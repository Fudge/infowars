[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]  There is a signal broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  Even when the set is turned off, look around to the environment we live in.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  Earth is being acclimatized. They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  We are like a natural resource to them. Deplete the planet, move on to another.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  They want benign indifference. They want us drugging.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  We could be pets. We could be food. But all we really are is livestock.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines, because I am glad to be here.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  I'm ready to take on the global tyrants, the New World Order, and all their addled minions and mercenaries.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here. It is the 23rd day of December, 2012.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  We have passed that imaginary line, that demarcation, no man's zone, no man's land, of December 21st, 2012,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  used by the globalists and mainstream media for 37 years at least,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  to hoax everyone that, oh, don't be involved politically. Don't be involved. The world's going to end anyways.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  And they tell the Christians the world's going to end because of the rapture every few years.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  And it's all just a giant cop-out. But the sun set on December 21st, and the sun came back up on the 22nd.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  I got to tell you, though, Thursday I was driving into work on the eve of December 21st,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  now behind us on the highway of life and time, here on the time-space continuum,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  and I tuned into my local affiliate and heard one of the hosts, not on the morning show, those are pretty smart guys,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  but on the show after it, where the co-host was saying, yeah, Alex Jones thinks the world's going to end tomorrow.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  Never said that in 17 years on air. Always said it was a fraud.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  Because I've been asked millions, not millions, I'm serious, thousands of times by callers and people on the street about 2012,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  and I just got so sick of it because it was always, oh, you're mistaken, or no, you're a fed, you're a traitor,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  because you don't think it's the end of the world. You're making that up. You're hiding.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  And then we got a call from one of the local TV stations Friday, which one was it, John?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  Yeah, KXEN NBC, getting a comment, Alex thinks the world's going to end, and we'd like to get his comment today.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  And we said Alex has never said that. We got a bunch of other calls, too.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  My frustration is that even though I've always said it's a fraud, there are real threats we face.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  People commenting on YouTube, the minority of them, on a special report we did,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  Doomsday 2012 secrets revealed exposing the real threats, not the fake threat,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  and how this self-fulfilling prophecy is used to get us to stand down.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And I noticed them saying, well, then why does he sell storable foods? Why does he promote guns and gold?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  Because of the real threats that 2012 obscured.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  Tyranny worldwide, global devaluation, the open world government being announced,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  the globalist or authoritarian eugenicist, Agenda 21, the deindustrialization program.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  That's why governments are digging in in their real Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense and NATO reports that are public.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  That's why the elite are digging in and moving to the countryside. That's mainstream news.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  That's what's going on, OK? The billionaires I've talked to, quite a few of them,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  everybody's moving to the country or getting out of Western nations.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  Look at the riots in Europe. That's why we get prepared. The public is so simple.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  They like get one thought in their mind at a time and that's it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  And it's painful because we've got to get people smarter or we're doomed.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  OK, see, the globalists like you dumber because you're easier to control.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  I like you smarter because I know what comes around, goes around. I'm a human. I'm on team human.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  I want my kids to have a good future. So I want to get the dumb masses up off their butts.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  The biggest attack on the Second Amendment ever, our worst analysis confirmed,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  but we're striking back straight ahead. Stay with us. All the intel you need.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  Renowned author and expert Joel Skousen.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that attack to come.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  Joel Skousen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  What I tell people is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  We talk about pollution, the water quality. My personal experience about being in every one of these states,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  There is no preparedness without strategy. This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  Strategic Relocation the film with Joel Skousen and Alex Jones.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  Available only at Infowarsshop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion. It just pancakes.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  Guns will be taken. No one will be able to be armed. We will take all guns.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  Global governance, at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  Do you want to defend the republic or do you want to be a slave?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  That is the question you need to ask yourself right now.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  Do you want to be drunk on entertainment and mindless fluff and be a joke to the global social engineers?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  Or do you want to be an empowered human who is fighting to control their destiny and build a better world?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  Not just for our children and grandchildren, but for the species itself?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  That is the question.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  Well, we're cruising into new territory. It's almost Christmas.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  And we are here live. It is the 23rd day of December 2012.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  And this is going to be an extremely... Every broadcast is important.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  Every Sunday show, every weekday show I do are very, very important.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  But this one is particularly important. I've done a lot of preparation for this broadcast to document and prove what I'm going to say here.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  Number one, it is official. They are going to try to physically ban all semi-automatic handguns and rifles and make you turn them in.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  That is the White House Council's plan. And we have all the proof of that. We're going to be going over it.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  It's part of the U.N. treaty to comply with that. And you cannot make this up.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  The Chinese and the Russians are offering to help disarm the American people. That is mainstream news as well.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  Even that shocked me. I couldn't believe it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  That's how dumbed down they think we are, that we just could care less about our sovereignty and would say something like that.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  Because in the past, if foreign governments got involved saying, disarm your people, we'll like to help you with the U.N.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  That would cause the American people to say, oh, you'll never get our guns. Stay out of our business.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  Nowadays, you're called traitor if you don't want to turn your guns into the U.N.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  In fact, guys, if you print me even Forbes reporting that the U.N. treaty does take our guns, I just want to read them saying it.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  So things are moving so quick, I can't even believe it. That's how bad it is.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  On Thursday, I said to Kurt Nemo, editor of Infowars.com, I said, I want you to do a story on these topics.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  And I want to put out a White House petition, which anybody can do, to call for the deportation of Piers Morgan.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  He did that Friday. It's in several thousand newspapers today. And they can't get it right.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  They say Kurt Nemo founded and ran Infowars.com, which is fine. Most of them don't even say where the petition came from.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  But it's really a record. Within about an hour, it should reach the 25,000 signatures to make the White House respond to it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  So we're going to talk about that. Now, again, Piers Morgan can say whatever he wants from England.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  He doesn't have a First Amendment here to engage in subversion.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  And when Piers Morgan came out and said, how dare you violate my First Amendment, the Wall Street Journal said, oh, here's a Supreme Court ruling from 77, Bud.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  That when foreigners come here in the media and try to overturn the Bill of Rights or Constitution, it's instant deportation.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  There have been thousands of people deported in the last century alone coming here and agitating.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Now, we may have been conditioned to put up with illegal activity, but no other country on Earth lets somebody come to their country.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  Come to their country and engage in attempted political actions. No one puts up with that.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  The Russians just arrested a bunch of CIA fronts over there trying to stir up stuff in the media and things. And whereas it is authoritarian.
[00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:16.524]  It was an act of subversion going on.
[00:11:16.524 --> 00:11:21.204]  Now I'm not saying arresting, I'm saying arresting and deporting.
[00:11:21.204 --> 00:11:22.204]  Now here's another issue.
[00:11:22.204 --> 00:11:29.604]  The Russian media, they run cable channels, RT and RT, RT America here in the US, they've
[00:11:29.604 --> 00:11:32.444]  gotten on the bandwagon calling for us to have our guns turned in.
[00:11:32.444 --> 00:11:37.644]  So let me explain something, Russia Today and the Chinese media over here doing this.
[00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:39.584]  You need to get out of our country, okay?
[00:11:39.624 --> 00:11:42.704]  I know everybody thinks America's done and we're pathetic and there's nothing we won't
[00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:50.463]  put up with and Obama became the head of the UN program, the head of the UN Security Council
[00:11:50.463 --> 00:11:51.463]  a few years ago.
[00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:56.284]  Totally illegal, violates Article 1, Section 9, it is high treason.
[00:11:56.284 --> 00:11:58.384]  They just flaunt everything in our face.
[00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:03.264]  Yeah, we have a president who's also the head of the UN Security Council.
[00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:08.463]  A president can't be the head of a foreign body, can't serve a foreign group, it's Article
[00:12:08.463 --> 00:12:09.463]  1, Section 9.
[00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:11.944]  No one else in the world will put up with this.
[00:12:11.944 --> 00:12:16.664]  We've been so open and so nice that we'll put up with anything.
[00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:22.024]  So they're bringing in buckets of foreigners at CNN and MSNBC, in fact that's mainly who
[00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:24.984]  they have up there.
[00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:29.544]  Putting down America, calling people rednecks who love freedom, putting us down, rubbing
[00:12:29.544 --> 00:12:34.704]  our noses in it, and not just calling for us to turn our guns in, calling for socialism,
[00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:35.704]  everything else.
[00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:40.704]  You know, America has voted, I'm gonna talk about this later, but it deals with the whole
[00:12:40.704 --> 00:12:41.704]  media hoax.
[00:12:41.704 --> 00:12:47.463]  And I even printed off some of the latest Nielsen ratings on this.
[00:12:47.463 --> 00:12:54.024]  In Austin, Texas, the local affiliate we're on, 590 AM, I have looked at the trade publications
[00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.384]  at its top shows.
[00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:59.984]  Over 100,000 people an hour listening, one affiliate we have.
[00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:02.784]  I've gotten the ratings, we're number one in almost every demographic just on The Little
[00:13:02.784 --> 00:13:05.463]  Sunday Show.
[00:13:05.463 --> 00:13:10.104]  But their biggest shows in the morning and things have well over 100,000 listeners at
[00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:11.704]  one time.
[00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:16.104]  I'm on stations in places like Chicago and Dallas where we have over 100,000 listeners
[00:13:16.104 --> 00:13:17.824]  an hour.
[00:13:17.824 --> 00:13:22.463]  They've got big trade publications that boil down the instant ratings and the Arbitron,
[00:13:22.463 --> 00:13:23.463]  the rest of it.
[00:13:23.463 --> 00:13:26.384]  Anybody in radio can pull this up, it's why we're getting on four or five new stations
[00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:30.664]  a week right now, especially since the instant meters came in.
[00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:33.664]  And we are just exploding.
[00:13:33.664 --> 00:13:39.184]  We on average have over a half a million listeners every 15 minutes.
[00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:44.384]  And imagine it's a three-hour weekday show, half a million every 15 minutes.
[00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:51.184]  And that's not counting XM, 166, that's not counting Global Shortwave or number one on
[00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:56.704]  audio streams and podcasts for the top show according to stat brand Google Analytics and
[00:13:56.704 --> 00:13:57.704]  Shoutcast.
[00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:02.024]  So Piers Morgan runs around with three bodyguards armed.
[00:14:02.144 --> 00:14:04.504]  Piers Morgan, because I've talked to people that have been there and been around him at
[00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:09.264]  CNN, well, it's been on the news, Piers Morgan runs around like he's God and all these Hollywood
[00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:12.264]  stars go on his show and heads of state.
[00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:17.664]  The guy's top ratings, and he's the best on CNN now, half a million.
[00:14:17.664 --> 00:14:23.864]  It's 550 something thousand, 56,000.
[00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:26.404]  Fox has like three million on the show up against it.
[00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:30.104]  And that's not even a very big audience comparatively in media.
[00:14:30.184 --> 00:14:34.264]  Something like Rush Limbaugh has about 11 million tuning in at one time, 22 million
[00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:35.264]  a week.
[00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:38.824]  Because most of them are tuning in all the time, but overall it's 22 million, that's
[00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:39.824]  conservative.
[00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:43.624]  Coast to Coast AM, 16 million during the week, about five to 10 million depending on which
[00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:44.624]  show it is.
[00:14:44.624 --> 00:14:48.424]  And believe me, I know the response, I go on CNN, no response, go on Fox, no response,
[00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:54.223]  go on Coast to Coast AM, run ads on Limbaugh, we've done that before, just blew our doors
[00:14:54.223 --> 00:14:55.223]  off.
[00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:56.944]  Okay, again, these are paper tigers.
[00:14:56.983 --> 00:15:01.784]  No wonder CNN wants to shut down free speech on talk radio, they call it the fairness doctor.
[00:15:01.784 --> 00:15:04.784]  No wonder they want to censor the Internet, because they can't compete with us.
[00:15:04.784 --> 00:15:10.983]  They have giant sets, emperors, new clothes, the emperor has no clothes.
[00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:16.284]  And here's this twit with all these bodyguards who wants your guns so you can't protect yourself.
[00:15:16.284 --> 00:15:20.144]  And he is literally a fantasy.
[00:15:20.144 --> 00:15:23.963]  Conservative numbers on this Sunday show, which we've done so stations can get a taste
[00:15:23.963 --> 00:15:27.044]  of the broadcast, they almost always end up picking up the weekday.
[00:15:27.044 --> 00:15:30.723]  It always goes, they pick up Sunday, then they put us on at night during the weekdays,
[00:15:30.723 --> 00:15:36.204]  then we're on prime time, boom, still, then on six years Sunday, guess what the numbers
[00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:39.483]  are, approaching 2 million conservatively, over the two hours.
[00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:44.324]  Guess what the weekday is, 3 mil and growing, in fact, it's much higher, but I'm not ready
[00:15:44.324 --> 00:15:48.364]  to give those numbers out yet, probably gonna be in excess of 5 mil.
[00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:53.444]  The system is, these people are jokes, cuz some foreigner says turn your guns in, you
[00:15:53.444 --> 00:16:00.924]  are, go back to England, a country you've already destroyed, you red coat punk.
[00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:05.604]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[00:16:05.604 --> 00:16:07.644]  immunity and health.
[00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:12.243]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

[00:16:29.524 --> 00:16:34.164]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and
[00:16:34.164 --> 00:16:39.324]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[00:16:39.324 --> 00:16:43.884]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[00:16:43.884 --> 00:16:47.884]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:17:05.844 --> 00:17:06.844]  storm.
[00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:11.204]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought
[00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:16.084]  in agricultural history, and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[00:17:16.084 --> 00:17:19.364]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.

[00:19:05.324 --> 00:19:07.524]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:19:07.524 --> 00:19:12.104]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none
[00:19:12.104 --> 00:19:16.664]  is ProPure, and it's available discounted at Infowars.com.
[00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:20.144]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:19:20.144 --> 00:19:21.824]  There's no priming required.
[00:19:21.824 --> 00:19:23.864]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:29.344]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%, easy to set up and use, doesn't
[00:19:29.344 --> 00:19:33.804]  require electricity, purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:19:33.804 --> 00:19:36.944]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:41.264]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.984]  ProPure is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:45.984]  It's what my family uses.
[00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:50.264]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code

[00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:04.784]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.784 --> 00:20:15.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.384 --> 00:20:21.504]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:21.504 --> 00:20:27.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.304 --> 00:20:37.543]  Okay, let's plunge straight into the news today.
[00:20:37.543 --> 00:20:40.144]  It is all off the chart.
[00:20:40.144 --> 00:20:46.744]  I want to direct you to articles at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that all link to quote
[00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:53.224]  mainstream establishment media, a foreign banker owned and run globalist operations.
[00:20:53.224 --> 00:20:56.424]  Go look up who owns the dominant media, and it's all state run.
[00:20:56.543 --> 00:21:04.184]  Whether it's CNN, whether it's MSNBC, it all gets government banker bailout money, stimulus
[00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:06.344]  money, you name it.
[00:21:06.344 --> 00:21:11.063]  The media is just subsidiaries of these global combines.
[00:21:11.063 --> 00:21:17.904]  New York governor, gun confiscations enforced, buyback an option, Kurt Nemo, Infowars.com.
[00:21:17.904 --> 00:21:23.063]  This story went viral on Friday, and it all comes out of a New York Times story.
[00:21:23.063 --> 00:21:28.104]  Cuomo says he'll outline gun proposal next month in the state of the state address, and
[00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:34.504]  he made his comments, there's audio of it, on WGDJAM.
[00:21:34.504 --> 00:21:38.184]  And he said, we may let you keep a few of your guns, but most of them, you can go read
[00:21:38.184 --> 00:21:40.344]  the quote and go listen to the audio.
[00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:44.583]  He said, you'll have to turn in most of your guns and we'll pay you for them.
[00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:48.944]  So get ready, because somebody committed a crime with a gun, you've got to turn your
[00:21:48.944 --> 00:21:51.784]  guns in, even though the new FBI crime statistics.
[00:21:51.784 --> 00:21:56.624]  We showed these on Friday, because we also stream video, go to FBI.gov.
[00:21:56.624 --> 00:22:04.144]  Crime has gone down more than 20% the last seven years, thanks to increased gun ownership.
[00:22:04.144 --> 00:22:09.624]  Mass shootings have gone up a tiny bit, but the media hyping of them has really increased.
[00:22:09.624 --> 00:22:13.944]  Continuing, CNN pushes British style gun ban.
[00:22:13.944 --> 00:22:17.784]  Paul Watson covered this on Infowars Nightly News Friday, he's gonna play a clip of that
[00:22:17.784 --> 00:22:20.944]  at the end of the show next hour, very powerful.
[00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:24.504]  And they said, just take everyone's guns and let them be at a gun range where you check
[00:22:24.504 --> 00:22:27.004]  them out, only to target shoot.
[00:22:27.004 --> 00:22:30.624]  That's how it is in England now, and you have to go through backgrounds just to do that.
[00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:34.624]  So that's British style, almost total gun ban.
[00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:45.610]  Then there's this article, the official People's Daily of the Communist Party of China came
[00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:52.370]  out on Friday and said, quote, we want to help Obama wage war on gun owners and help
[00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.050]  disarm them.
[00:22:54.050 --> 00:23:00.450]  And they support the implementation of the UN small arms treaty that will allow the UN
[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.450]  to control.
[00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:06.730]  We sign on to it, they can just have a general assembly vote of the whole UN, all those dictators
[00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.250]  and people, and then we are under treaty to then turn our guns in.
[00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.250]  And by the way, that's not Alex Jones breaking this down.
[00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:19.210]  Here is Forbes for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it right there.
[00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:24.870]  If you're a radio listener, you can simply go to search engine and type in UN agreement
[00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.770]  should have all gun owners up in arms.
[00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.890]  And it goes on to say, it says it'll restrict our guns and then allow them with a simple
[00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.030]  UN majority vote, no Security Council veto to ban them in the future.
[00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.010]  You might want to actually go read the treaty.
[00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.830]  Obama says he's gonna push the Senate, now huge Democrat dominated, only the Senate is
[00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.490]  needed to pass that in March.
[00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:48.970]  Isn't all this just perfect timing?
[00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.010]  Isn't that just special?
[00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.090]  Let's go on to the next little piece here.
[00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.610]  So Friday, as Americans, we strike back.
[00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.130]  You got the Russian TV broadcast in English.
[00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.730]  In Europe, it's actually on broadcast where Paul Watson lives in London on the regular
[00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.410]  television with rabbit ears.
[00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.010]  It's on cable here in the US, RT.
[00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:15.770]  It's calling for us to turn our guns in on its two channels, 24 seven.
[00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.570]  And Piers Morgan, who is facing all sorts of criminal charges, we're gonna go over some
[00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.030]  of those later here, he's facing six criminal charges, including a felony conspiracy to
[00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.750]  prevent the courts of justice.
[00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.070]  Needless to say, they're trying to get him to come back to England, he isn't too happy
[00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.070]  to do that.
[00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.090]  Nothing against the great British people, the folks in the UK, the Scots and the Great
[00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.350]  Irish, all of them great people.
[00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.970]  I'm related to all of them.
[00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.350]  But really, your countries are tyrannies now, you admit that.
[00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.630]  Your crime is more than doubled since you took the guns 15 years ago.
[00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.750]  We've gone over those numbers.
[00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.350]  Even British newspapers admit it.
[00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.350]  And here he is.
[00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.670]  So Friday, we strike back at Piers Morgan.
[00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.470]  And we say, you know what, buddy, you're engaged in something that has been very well
[00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.450]  documented for a very long time.
[00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:08.410]  It's sedition if a citizen is trying to overthrow the constitutional lawful government.
[00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.430]  But if government tries to overthrow the basic liberty, it is then our right and duty to
[00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.510]  throw it off.
[00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:21.510]  But it is called subversion when a foreign asset comes here and seeks to change the government.
[00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.750]  And it says sign petition to deport Piers Morgan for his attack on the Constitution.
[00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.110]  That came out at about noon on Friday during the broadcast.
[00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.830]  And you've got to sign your name and say who you are when you do that.
[00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.390]  And we'll show again people this article, you can link through and sign the petition.
[00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.570]  It's almost the 25,000 needed.
[00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:44.230]  You need 25,000 a month to have Obama respond to it, he's sworn to do.
[00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.230]  That means he won't.
[00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.110]  Well, then what good is this when you need 349 more to get it going?
[00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:55.590]  Sure, we'll get like 500,000 by the time we're done, this has just gone viral today.
[00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.910]  It's good because Obama has people signing a petition to ban our guns and he's gonna
[00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.390]  hold that up to us, or things like that.
[00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:10.990]  So it's good to get attention, it's good to focus things on here and his subversion inside
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.990]  our country.
[00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.850]  Now Piers Morgan, I'm gonna show viewers a bunch of these articles right here.
[00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:23.050]  He fired back last night at Infowars.com, at DrudgeReport.com, it also linked to our
[00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.570]  petition and it's still linked there on the right hand side right now.
[00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.890]  But that's the easiest place to find is DrudgeReport.com, go about halfway down the right hand side,
[00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.890]  it's right there.
[00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:36.410]  Find a link directly to the petition, we need to get a link back on the main page of Infowars.com.
[00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:42.570]  But the point is, is that you can go there and you can read literally, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.910]  there are thousands of articles, cuz you can type in Piers Morgan deport, and it says
[00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:52.510]  several thousand articles, Russian TV, French TV, British TV, they're all saying, how dare
[00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.650]  you Americans turn your guns in?
[00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:59.410]  So we'll probably say, we'll be polite, here's our guns, since the French said so.
[00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:06.770]  But gun advocate asked Obama administration to deport Piers Morgan, and in 90% of these
[00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.630]  articles or more, they will never say Infowars.com.
[00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:15.910]  That's how scared the mainstream media is, of the real media that isn't state run, but
[00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:16.990]  that doesn't matter.
[00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:22.150]  Our goal was, we didn't even put Infowars.com in the petition, it's cartonemo, we did that
[00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.430]  so it would actually get out there to people.
[00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.850]  Okay, continuing, there's the Hollywood Reporter, here's Huffington Post, Piers Morgan's deportation
[00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:35.950]  petition posted to White House after his gun control rants.
[00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:42.430]  The Examiner did report that it is an Infowars.com petition, so that's good.
[00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:48.110]  Here's France 24, national TV, US gun advocate seeks deportation of Piers Morgan.
[00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.150]  No, it's tens of thousands of people signing it.
[00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.750]  It goes on and on with all the reports.
[00:27:53.750 --> 00:28:00.390]  Now if you go to Infowars.com, we have an article titled, the law says deport Piers
[00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.390]  Morgan.
[00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:07.950]  I'm gonna go over some of this for people, because if you go to Infowars.com, we have
[00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:15.750]  links to the Wall Street Journal writer, Wall Street Journal columnist explains on Twitter
[00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.110]  how to deport Piers Morgan.
[00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.470]  Piers Morgan made jokes and said, you can't deport me on his Twitter, I'm not joking.
[00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.790]  It says, I'm a British supremacist, I'm not joking, go read them.
[00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:29.670]  I'm a British supremacist, and I'm going to dominate you.
[00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.510]  And then somebody said, you're glad those kids are dead, you can use them for that.
[00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.990]  And he said, yeah, I am.
[00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.950]  So he's a totally arrogant person fleeing justice from England.
[00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.790]  I mean, he is the slimiest guy in media.
[00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.790]  He had to leave England, okay?
[00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:49.350]  So here's this foreigner, and we come back, we're gonna explain how for subterfuge, how
[00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:55.990]  for subversion, he needs to be on the first airplane shackled out of this country.
[00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.830]  Because he's here trying to take our Second Amendment.
[00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.630]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.990]  Don't be one of them.

[00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.150]  solution.

[00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.390]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.070]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

[00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.510]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct and I recommend you do
[00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.510]  the same.

[00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.070]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.070]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:34.070]  We are live on the radio and hey, that's not enough for us because we want to fight for
[00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.070]  liberty 24-7.
[00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.070]  I'm back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:45.070]  We have the weeknight Infowars Nightly News, 7 to 8 o'clock Central as well at InfowarsNews.com.
[00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.070]  And by the way, it's not too late to get all your Christmas shopping done for friends and
[00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.070]  family and coworkers and support our broadcast.
[00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:57.070]  Man, I looked at the traffic going to Barton Creek Mall today, backed up for like 10 miles
[00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.070]  or something.
[00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.070]  It's just amazing here in Austin.
[00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.070]  If you're listening out in the country, I'm sure you're seeing the same thing around your
[00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.070]  malls.
[00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.070]  Hey, that's fine.
[00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.070]  Keep the economy going, whatever.
[00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.070]  The point is, as long as you don't go into debt.
[00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.070]  See, I don't think consumerism is bad if it isn't your God.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:17.070]  My point is, is the best way to wake people up is documentary films.
[00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:22.070]  And we created almost 10 years ago, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:27.070]  And for 15 cents a day, you can get a membership to see all my films, my daily radio show with
[00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:32.070]  video feed like we're doing right now with a five-camera shoot, special reports, live
[00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.070]  events when I'm on the road.
[00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.070]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.070]  My book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.070]  Well, now I just said, you know what?
[00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.070]  Let's have it when somebody goes and creates a membership and creates their username and
[00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:50.070]  passcode that you just create a username and passcode you can share with 10 more people.
[00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.070]  So it's really 11 memberships for $5.95 a month.
[00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:58.070]  That's less than 59 cents per person.
[00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.070]  10 people, 59 cents a person per month.
[00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.070]  And it's in high def.
[00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.070]  High def the last few years, a lot of the productions.
[00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.070]  So it's all up there and it works really great.
[00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.070]  We've redesigned it.
[00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.070]  You know, eight years ago, PrisonPlanet.tv worked okay.
[00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.070]  Five years ago, it worked decent.
[00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.070]  Three years ago, it worked pretty good.
[00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.070]  Today, it's smoking hot and getting better.
[00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:22.070]  And we're just going to add more and more and apps and everything coming up next year.
[00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:27.070]  The point is, PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowarsnews.com, you can go there.
[00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:32.070]  You can give yourself a membership to see all the films, all the special reports, everything
[00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.070]  The nightly news, 7 o'clock central every night.
[00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.070]  Sometimes it's like four hours long, usually about an hour.
[00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.070]  We're about to put it on TV, so it has to be a set hour soon.
[00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.070]  So I'm just saying it's going to be an hour to get you ready for that.
[00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.070]  But we'll go into overdrive sometimes live.
[00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.070]  The point is, is that we're taking the training wheels off, ladies and gentlemen, going to the next level.
[00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:52.070]  We just keep doing that because we have the animating contest of liberty to fight here.
[00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.070]  It's so exciting, like Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.070]  We're going to defeat the tyrants.
[00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:01.070]  You can go in there, set up your own membership and then put in an e-card or in a physical card.
[00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:05.070]  Hey, here's your documentary film, a news site membership.
[00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.070]  Just go there, put in the username, passcode, you're on.
[00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.070]  11 people simultaneously signed up.
[00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.070]  PrisonPlanet.tv and the little bit of money we make off of it.
[00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.070]  Not that it's bad to make money, but my goal is to reach people.
[00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:26.070]  With 11 people using a $5.95 membership, the bandwidth costs have gone way up.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.900]  $100,000 a month just for that site.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.900]  I mean, to give you an idea of how many people are using it.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:42.900]  I don't want to get into numbers here, but it's about 200,000 people every night tune in one way or another.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.900]  And people are like, oh, big deal.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.900]  I know 3 million on the weekday radio show and growing and almost 2 million on the Sunday show.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.900]  The point is this is a subscription site.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.900]  200,000 people are tuning in.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.900]  A half million tune into Piers Morgan.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.900]  He's free.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.900]  We're building the next media platform to bring down the globalist.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.900]  I've already got all sorts of TV deals lined out from here to Valhalla.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.900]  The issue is I've got to get us ready first and get more reporters in, more researchers, more fact checkers.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.900]  Because again, we try to tell the truth and that's a hard thing to do.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.900]  It's easy to lie all day and spin like the media does.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.900]  We aren't perfect, but we try to get it right.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.900]  That's my pledge, that we are consciously working to get you as close to the truth as you can get.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.900]  Because we all see through rose-colored glasses, as the Bible says.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.900]  I am simply attempting to see as clearly as I can.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.900]  We're all humans.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.900]  We're all fallible.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.900]  We all have issues.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.900]  I am trying to tell you as close to my hardcore research as we can get.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.900]  And I think it's proven it's pretty darn accurate.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.900]  I'd give us about a 95, 96% accuracy rate.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.900]  Okay, let me get back into this.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.900]  We put out a petition at the WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.900]  It usually takes weeks to get 25,000 signatures.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.900]  We're right there right now.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.900]  24,795, 205 more.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.900]  The White House says they'll respond.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.900]  They're total liars.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.900]  They probably won't.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.900]  They didn't respond to all those state secession ones that got hundreds of thousands.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.900]  But the public sees it and it creates a huge media event.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.900]  On Friday, they said, well, why are we going to do this article?
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.900]  The White House just ignores it.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.900]  I said, you watch how much media attention this gets to the fact that a foreigner who's
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.900]  fleeing justice from England on record is here.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.900]  The yellow journalism in a reported phone hacker, alleged phone hacker, all this stuff.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.900]  They're trying to charge him right now with felonies for it.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.900]  He's here.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.900]  We're going to expose it.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.900]  And I said, you watch.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.900]  He's going to arrogantly attack and make fun of people.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.900]  Because I know his M.O.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.900]  I mean, I don't like this guy, OK?
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.900]  Not because he's a big gun grabber, that's bad enough, because he's the mouse that roars.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:58.900]  But because he's so slimy and has that arrogant affront to him that just, I'm sorry, is the
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.900]  opposite of how I was raised and who I am as a Texan.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.900]  I guess last of the Mohicans here.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.900]  But the point is, I like genuine people.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.900]  People that look you in the eye.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.900]  And Piers Morgan is a sack of garbage, OK?
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.900]  Side issue.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.900]  Let's continue here with the facts.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.900]  The Wall Street Journal explains that Piers is like, oh, you're trying to take my First
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.900]  Amendment.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.900]  I thought you want your rights.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.900]  No, subversion is a foreigner here trying to overthrow our form of government.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.900]  And our government is the Bill of Rights, is the Constitution.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.900]  And so, hey, if communists are calling to put me in a FEMA camp, and we've had them
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.900]  on the show, I'm like, it's your right to say I should be arrested and put in a FEMA
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.900]  camp because you're a citizen.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.900]  I don't agree with you, but OK.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.900]  I've gone out and protested the Ku Klux Klan many times.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.900]  And I've said, you have a right to be up there saying that.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.900]  I have a right to protest you.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.900]  But when a foreigner comes to your country and says, get rid of your rights, and our
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.900]  government is the Bill of Rights and Constitution, we the people made that.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.900]  That's the government, not the crooks that have taken it over.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:08.900]  When they do that, folks, it is absolute subversion and espionage against our country.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:14.900]  And that is exactly what they say in the Wall Street Journal responding to our article.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.900]  Your opinion is protected.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.900]  Your presence in the US is not.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:25.900]  See Klein Dynast versus Mandel, 1972, another hearing in 77, where they deported communists
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.900]  trying to get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.900]  There you go.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.900]  That was the case of a Belgium communist, Ernst Mandel.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.900]  And there's been countless others.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:43.900]  Let me explain to you how this works, OK?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.900]  No nation on earth puts up with foreigners coming.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.900]  Look, I don't like to corrupt Russian government.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.900]  But when they kicked out a bunch of foreign agitators from the US last month, I said,
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.900]  well, what do you expect them to do?
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.900]  You don't let foreigners, the UN, created by the globalists, is here saying they're
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.900]  going to get a treaty passed that the House can't see, where now a simple majority of
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.900]  the UN, once it passes, takes, what, 60% to get it passed.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:16.900]  Once it passes, 51% of the UN General Assembly votes, our guns go bye-bye.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.900]  OK, we're going under global governance right now.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.900]  They brag.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:26.900]  Europe's already under it, run by six megabanks who brag they're setting up world government.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.900]  And they're the ones that want us disarmed.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.900]  Bloomberg made his $25 billion off that.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.900]  These are insiders, folks.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.900]  These are monopoly men.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.900]  And the article in the Wall Street Journal, one of their senior writers, goes over all of that.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.900]  So you can go to Infowars.com and read our article that gives even more background on this.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:48.900]  The law says deport Piers Morgan, why Infowars is calling for his deportation.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.900]  And I went further.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.900]  I said, hey, subversion calls for arrest.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.900]  OK, now arrest to deport him.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.900]  And see, folks, you're like, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.900]  If you don't think it will, it won't.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.900]  You've got to start recognizing we've been trained.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.900]  See, here's the deal.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.900]  Americans have always been incredibly hospitable and open armed.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.900]  The globalists bring in foreigners.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.900]  There's a lot of foreigners, the best people we got in this country.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.900]  We're nation immigrants.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.900]  But a lot of the foreigners that come here now are taught to hate America.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.900]  They're taught that the government's your friend, the population's your enemy.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.900]  And they vote over 90% to take guns.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.900]  They vote to take liberties.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]  They vote to do this.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:32.900]  They're bringing foreigners in as a force with the government to go after our liberties.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.900]  And that is, again, sedition and treason by the people in the government.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.900]  The foreigners are involved in subversion and espionage.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.900]  The people that are citizens are involved in treason.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.900]  And it's Fareed Zarkaria, the synthetic American, not really a citizen in my view,
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.900]  saying turn our guns in.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]  Americans are dumb idiots.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.900]  Well, then get out of here.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.900]  If it's so bad, if you're so elitist with your fake liberal list, get out of here.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.900]  Get out of my country.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.900]  Now that we have moved into the winter season,
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.900]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.900]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.900]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.900]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.900]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.900]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.900]  while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.900]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:14.900]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.900]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.900]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.900]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:27.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.900]  The last domino to fall for the global crime syndicate,
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.900]  a bunch of Bernie Madoffs who just haven't made it to prison yet,
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:44.900]  is that the public doesn't listen to them, doesn't trust them, doesn't like them.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.900]  But we don't know that everybody else knows that.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.900]  But the numbers show it. CNN, if you look at the numbers 20 years ago,
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.900]  had about 10 million viewers during Larry King.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.900]  I want to show you a media light story showing him,
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:07.900]  oh, Piers Morgan's top on CNN with half a million viewers total.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.900]  And it goes over his viewers. I mean, that is a complete joke, folks.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:18.900]  Should I have bodyguards in a helicopter land me at work and walk around in a cloak?
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.900]  Folks, I think with green screen, we should have me on top of a gold pyramid
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:29.900]  that's fanned and worshipped and maybe with a grill and some bling and girls in bathing suits.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:37.900]  Maybe that's the new level of media where, oh, he must have a lot of viewers if this is going on.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.900]  Remember, this guy has armed bodyguards that want your guns, wants your guns.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.900]  So there are some of the numbers on that. You can just type in Piers Morgan's ratings.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.900]  His best ratings ever are 556,000 total viewers.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.900]  I'm looking at it right here out of Arbitron.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.900]  Not out of Arbitron, this is out of Nielsen.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:06.900]  And they're bragging about it in media about, oh, my gosh, his top ratings on CNN.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.900]  Oh, my God.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.900]  I mean, that'd be like walking up to a bag lady and saying, you're the richest woman on earth.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.900]  Look at you. You've got a thing full of tin cans.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.900]  But I guess it's CNN, I mean, of all of the midgets, you know, some of them are about six inches tall.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.900]  I mean, he is almost a foot tall.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.900]  I mean, nothing against midgets, you get my analogy.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.900]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:33.900]  Total viewers of 556K, ooh, down from 10 million.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.900]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:43.790]  But the criminal government, the military industrial complex owned by foreign banks,
[00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:44.930]  it is still in charge.
[00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.990]  So I guess it isn't a joke.
[00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:53.390]  But they need to just put on this big act that, hey, we said so, and we're in control.
[00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.510]  And Piers Morgan laughed at Americans on his Twitter.
[00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:57.510]  You think I'm joking?
[00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:58.510]  Go to Real Alex Jones.
[00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.710]  We've tweeted some of them, retweeted them out.
[00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:04.990]  We wrote an article about it at Infowars.com where he says, I have come and conquered.
[00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.550]  I am the British supremacist.
[00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.190]  I will get your guns.
[00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.190]  Look at this right here.
[00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:11.230]  This is out of Americanprogress.org.
[00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:16.310]  Think again, considering CNN's choice to hire Piers Morgan.
[00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:23.470]  The news that former Rupert Murdoch conciliatory, Rebecca Brooks, who is awaiting trial for
[00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:28.590]  six separate crimes, including most seriously conspiracy to prevent the course of justice,
[00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:34.230]  received a $11.2 million payoff for actions that help destroy news of the world, in addition
[00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:39.150]  to covering her legal fees and drivers implies that perhaps the alleged crimes of which she
[00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.390]  is accused are not exactly frowned upon by her higher ups.
[00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.390]  Well, that's hush money.
[00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:48.070]  Then it goes into how he's had to testify and they're looking to charge him with this.
[00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:52.950]  Okay, and then it just goes over the fact that he doesn't like to show up in England
[00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:53.950]  too much.
[00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.650]  So the point is, I'm not obsessing on Piers Morgan here all day, but if we can route one
[00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:06.390]  of these rats, if we can run one of these scallywags, king of yellow journalism and
[00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:17.610]  tabloid garbage, now the maven, now the pimp over at the faltering amnesiac CNN, then we
[00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.110]  will have victory.
[00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.130]  But these people are a joke.
[00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:27.090]  Yes, if you go to whitehouse.gov, deport British citizen Piers Morgan for attacking Second
[00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.090]  Amendment.
[00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.030]  It's now 25,031.
[00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:37.650]  This just went out Friday afternoon and I saw Atlantic magazine making sniveling jokes
[00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.410]  about how we couldn't get any signatures.
[00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:44.690]  I've seen Obama try to get 25,000 signatures in a month for something.
[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.890]  See, we could find the secret to everlasting life and the pot of gold in the rainbow.
[00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:54.850]  They go, well, that's nothing, merely a flesh wound, kind of like Monty Python, I've chopped
[00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:57.770]  off both your arms and legs, it's nothing.
[00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:59.770]  And I demand the shrubbery.
[00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:02.370]  We are the knights that go neat.
[00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:07.610]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, there is just no end to these people.
[00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.370]  And so it's all a big act.
[00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:16.010]  This is all a big dress up show, like little girls dressing up like their princesses.
[00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.290]  And then they disdain, talk radio, that's not media.
[00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.290]  The internet, that's not media.
[00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:22.290]  None of you are media.
[00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:29.410]  I've interviewed the reporter, Lyon.
[00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.930]  I've interviewed the reporter.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:40.680]  Amber Lyon, who couldn't get her reports out about Muslim countries mass murdering
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.919]  peaceful protesters because they were aligned with the West.
[00:52:44.919 --> 00:52:50.580]  And then they told her, well, you don't understand, CNN is funded by the Saudi Arabians and by
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.200]  the folks in Qatar.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.240]  You didn't know our whole news division was actually underwritten by this king and that
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]  king.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.560]  She's been on the show.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.960]  And I said, Amber, you didn't know the CIA in 2000, it came out, ran all the major domestic
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.080]  and foreign news reports and that there's generals in plain clothes.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.359]  She said, no, I didn't know that.
[00:53:08.359 --> 00:53:15.120]  I was what Emmy award-winning, what was it, three times field reporter.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.000]  And then she wouldn't shut up and basically quit over it.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]  And I said, no.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.140]  And then she went and looked it up and, of course, found it was in the Washington Post
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.359]  and WorldNet Daily, as I said it was.
[00:53:22.359 --> 00:53:24.520]  Folks, this is globalist-run media.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:28.040]  This isn't even government state-run, though your taxpayer money goes through it through
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.080]  bailouts and stimulus money.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:35.040]  Did you know your stimulus money went to give Rachel Maddow, the short-haired person on
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:40.319]  MSNBC that has even less viewers?
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:47.880]  I mean she's got like 300,000 viewers or something and she's there though telling you
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:53.200]  how it is because she's arrogant because they smile and they they just get like like almost
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.200]  like a criminal energy I would describe it where they're like yeah now let's go to this

[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.759]  funds for ads during a Obermann Maddow show so it's worse than that

[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.540]  facets of what they're doing I think about how desperate I am to try to
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:33.140]  defeat these people and just how disgusting they are I mean these are the
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.900]  worst of the worst authoritarians that's who's gotten in control see because you
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.260]  could build a big government to be altruistic but it will always be taken

[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:52.860]  that as soon as they got the demographic of the majority being non-white you now
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.980]  see the demographic of it's racist to not want socialism and communism and I'm
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.460]  gonna talk more about that after the break and I'm gonna give the number out
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:04.380]  so that everybody can call in the phones aren't open yet but we'll do it when we
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:11.140]  start the next segment here in just a few minutes it is such a big deal that
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.500]  they don't care if it's not popular they need to create the illusion in fact
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.980]  that's an important point I need to do a whole a whole report on they want to
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:27.820]  create the illusion that they can legitimately take guns take guns
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:33.260]  illusion that's what they do they create illusions that you wanted government
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.140]  healthcare they create illusions that you wanted Barack Obama by having a
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:41.540]  fraud run against him as well and then having Obama win through a fraudulent
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:47.660]  election the fraud Romney all the evidence shows did actually win but it
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.860]  wouldn't have mattered they still wanted Obama and it wouldn't matter if he got
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.860]  in it's just it was fixed at every level because the globalist get all the money
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.260]  all the power all the control by just having the puppet president over the
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.180]  puppet Empire America is the heart of the global government it's what's
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:09.300]  forcing everybody into it because America had more Liberty Brazil has more
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.820]  resources across the board in the United States you take just three

[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:36.460]  ground got us into debt to them through fiat derivatives deals our trader collaborator
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:41.300]  government signed on to they've used our money and our treasure to leverage their private
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:47.500]  world government while using our own media to blame us for their crimes that they've
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.300]  committed worldwide so the mega banks don't get the blame the mega banks are imploding
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:57.900]  europe imploding california imploding other areas with debt uh bloomberg a foreign banking
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:04.340]  asset of the un checking to his sister at the un 25 billion off of insider deals uh
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:09.780]  he is calling for the total abolition of firearms he's got a cuomo pushing for that and i've
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.680]  never seen i've had larry pratt of gun owners of america on and others i've talked to members
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:20.700]  of congress on air and off air they've never seen an attack like this they're going for
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:25.660]  broke we've never seen the russians and the chinese saying disarm your people we've never
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.620]  seen the media say you're a ku klux klan member of you own guns you've seen that in the news
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.700]  starting with fox sports three weeks ago now everywhere they're making their move and i
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:41.740]  got some clips coming up of uh msnbc and others where they talk about this and again
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.100]  they've learned with americans especially white americans you say something's racist they could
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.260]  say you're racist if you don't stick your white daughter in a blender many mothers would murder
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.620]  their child on the spot and i'm not really being sarcastic about that political correctness is a
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:02.300]  religion the aztec said hey you're not politically correct if you don't give us your kids to
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:10.620]  sacrifice and we've pretty much gotten to that point now uh where this is the tool they use and
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.540]  now we're going to go into divide and conquer the british model where they brought in enough
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:20.700]  foreigners and enough people and made them be racially motivated racial identity while teaching
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:25.740]  whites not to have a racial identity and they're now going to basically bring down the united
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:29.100]  states there's nothing to do with race the globalists are just cold-bloodedly playing
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:34.300]  people off against each other off of the fraternity of humans and and caring about
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:41.100]  people for what they stand for and their ideas and not being into tribalism or racism that is
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:47.180]  all laudable you know i have a dream but it's all co-opted to shell their agenda where if you're not
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.220]  for socialism people i've known for a long time have told me point blank who are liberals they go
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:09:00.380]  if you don't support socialism and yes communism you are a racist and i'm like well you used to be
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.780]  a liberal against bush with drones and killing and wars and you were my friend but now you're
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:10.060]  saying if i don't turn my guns and i'm racist and they say yes and i may name names too people
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:14.300]  could probably guess who it is and i'm like but i'm not i mean the government wants my guns to
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.700]  enslave me and the thing is well we've got to have a collective and you can't have guns only the state
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:23.980]  can and the un says in their unidear documents that are in the preamble and and were used to
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:29.580]  develop the un small arms treaty they say the civilian ownership of firearms threatens the
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:35.420]  legitimate power monopoly of the state and that's what this is all about is the power monopoly of
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.540]  the state hitler had a power monopoly stalin had a power monopoly mal who said political power goes
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:47.100]  out of the barrel of a gun disarmed their people killed over 60 million i mean i know history see
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:52.860]  i'm an expert in history like the average man is an expert in cool motorcycles and ball games and
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:58.140]  how to be cool with the buds and i look at these men and i go look you need to be cool when it
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.860]  comes to knowing how the world works they're like oh you worry about that i'm like listen

[01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:51.670]  people remember how they said oh don't buy guns obama will never try to take your guns i mean
[01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:56.549]  he said as a state senator he believes in the total ban the current attorney general is on
[01:21:56.549 --> 01:22:00.710]  record look three weeks before this happened this came out a month ago this came out in late

[01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:10.590]  and it's obama standing on top the american flag or sitting on top the american flag
[01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:14.390]  in the chair and it gets into how they're coming after the guns how they use executive
[01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:18.830]  orders to do it and now reuters is like it's the law he can ban your guns by executive
[01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:24.710]  order well that's not what the law says but they think their readers are stupid they talk
[01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:29.590]  to you it's the law the government can blow your head off for no reason it's the law that
[01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:33.830]  the government can that the state police can stick their hand inside your body for no reason
[01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:37.790]  when the state police in texas were first defending pulling people over and sticking
[01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:41.430]  their hands inside their bodies until the public blew up and they went okay you're right
[01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:49.750]  we shouldn't have done that government has gone crazy and no it's not the end of the
[01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:53.350]  world it's the end of the world as we know it i gotta say this because i was driving
[01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:57.610]  to work thursday and heard local talk radio in austin saying oh alex thinks the world's
[01:22:57.610 --> 01:23:02.750]  gonna end tomorrow and then i had local tv call me and national tv call me friday saying

[01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:50.390]  shows like this and are waking up but the last thing you gotta wake up to is they are
[01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:54.910]  creating the illusion they've got momentum to take your guns the illusion that obama
[01:23:54.910 --> 01:24:00.910]  really won we've had top election fraud experts on who are non-partisan like beth harris the

[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:25.150]  listening to the alex jones show well hollywood the mainstream media ran the hoax that december
[01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:31.150]  21st 2012 was the end of the world we said it was a fraud that was not a hard call and here we are
[01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.430]  still alive and now they're going to blame the alternative media for the hoax when they're the
[01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:39.790]  ones behind it that's how they work they count on you being dumbed down and unconscious they're
[01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:46.350]  also running a new hoax saying that 20 dead children and out of a country of 315 million
[01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.990]  is the end of the world it's sad for those children but the system is using this to enslave
[01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:54.670]  us we're going to cover statistics with paul watson coming up in the next segment here's
[01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:59.390]  a town hall article i saw this a few days ago never got to it there's video obama called a
[01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:05.870]  newborn baby a fetus outside the womb people thought it was a typo that he messed up no they're
[01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:10.510]  now saying children up to three are fetuses and the new bioethics boards are calling for them to
[01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:15.950]  be killed up to age three you think i'm joking look it up it was the journal of bioethics earlier
[01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:20.910]  this year uh and again we'll cover all this throughout the week on the weekday show let's
[01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:26.030]  race through your calls quick comment from each caller dylan lindsay and others dylan in arkansas
[01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:31.790]  here on the air uh bloomberg says that he wants to have all your guns banned and that obama is
[01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:36.350]  set to try to physically make you turn them in cuomo says and they're going to pay you money back
[01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:44.350]  for them how's that sound hello yes dylan you're on the air buddy right now i did not intend to
[01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:48.430]  turn mine in and i think these gun buyback programs are ridiculous because criminals
[01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:53.150]  aren't going to turn theirs in but what i called for was i wanted to make a suggestion for another
[01:34:53.150 --> 01:34:58.430]  petition on the white house website and that is that the president make the white house a gun-free
[01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:03.550]  zone that if he thinks that gun-free zones in the school children safer then the white house should
[01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:09.470]  be a gun-free zone to make the president safer and all the pure genius pure genius pure genius i will
[01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:16.510]  call kurt nemo or don salazar or watson one of our seven or eight writers i will in fact i'm
[01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:21.310]  going to codify this you're absolutely right we should start like jesse ventura said last monday
[01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:26.990]  on the show we should start in fact ventura said make it a gun-free zone so we should call for the
[01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:32.590]  white house since guns are so bad period that it should be a gun-free zone as an example and to be
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:36.590]  sarcastic sarah military should lay down their firearms of course is what the un wants in the
[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:43.390]  end game anyways uh go ahead genius dylan yeah well um well if it makes the school children
[01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:48.270]  safer then logically it should make the president safer and of course uh of course the whole
[01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:52.990]  problem is that the uh fast and furious operation shows that the obama administration is total
[01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:58.270]  criminals they're willing to give guns to criminals and get hundreds of people killed
[01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:02.910]  for that and the idea that we're going to be safer with only these monstrous criminals having
[01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:07.150]  guns you know is just totally ridiculous that's right we should also have a petition to um
[01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:12.110]  we should also have a petition for obama to fake cry like he did for the poor sandy hook kids
[01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:15.870]  for all the hundreds of kids he killed in mexico with fast and furious great points
[01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:22.350]  thank you so much dylan uh and by the way ladies and gentlemen i know some national republican
[01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:26.030]  talk show hosts that will go unnamed have said don't sign white house petitions it'll give them
[01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:31.310]  a list john hancock signed his name on the declaration of independence if you're afraid
[01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:36.510]  of being on list move to north korea it's that attitude that will give you north korea
[01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:42.590]  here's an analogy i've noticed on the hiking bike trail even in 20 foot wide areas the bike
[01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:47.070]  riders even in areas they're not supposed to be on the mountain bikers think it's their area
[01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:52.030]  and everyone gets out of their way so they'll come over to where you're at and then tell you
[01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:56.270]  you should get out of my way so a guy told me to get out of his way yesterday and i said man
[01:36:56.270 --> 01:37:00.510]  you were just 10 feet over there he kind of bowed up and i said what are you big tough guy and he
[01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:04.350]  went and grumbled off with him and his buddies thought they were going to intimidate me same
[01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:09.310]  thing with cops and government they've bowed up to us so much and we've acted like we're bad guys
[01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:14.270]  oh yes sir i watch people on the hiking bike trail they cower when bikes come with a 10 foot
[01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:21.150]  wide deal over to the side and oh my god you're my king it's the same thing with government stop
[01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:22.270]  cowering
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:28.780]  and again I've been watching I'm gonna go hide a camera in the bushes and I'm
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:32.760]  gonna videotape this on the hiking bike trail and show people groveling to the
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.260]  bikes because they're about two feet higher than you they literally not all
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:40.300]  of them most of them are nice but every tenth bike is a control freak and they'll
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:44.300]  actually say get out of my way and I'm like I'm like and the guy stopped and
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:49.480]  bowed him I said I don't want to say on air but I just told him I said listen
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.280]  tough guy go ahead and do something of course he got all upset with him and his
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.600]  buddy and left so they wanted to have the symbol of dominating me not actually
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.560]  do it but you think you're gonna like dominate captain caveman right there on
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.240]  the spot do you okay let's go ahead and again it's not that I'm like nobody's
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.840]  gonna dominate me I'm real friendly and nice till I sit there and watch these
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:14.720]  people and the bike riders are just like government they're just like government
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.380]  they think they're your God and you're bending over has made them think they're
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:22.380]  God you ever run from a dog comes running out of its house you run what
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:27.260]  happens you get bit you say go inside dog it backs off government's got to be
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:31.420]  told you're the servant back off right now
[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:37.500]  that is actually the voice I'm sorry I said all right tough guy you're bowing up get off
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:43.580]  the bike right now you're looking at me too come on let's put something behind all this
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.620]  anyways and it wasn't because I was wanting to be loud at him I just wanted him to know
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:50.060]  question I'm not here to bend over pal
[01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:56.230]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lindsay in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.230]  Hi, Alex. How are you today? I'm pretty good.
[01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:04.230]  I just want to tell you that I have been listening to you for about four years.
[01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:13.230]  I am a Tangy Tangerine buyer and I went ahead and signed up for your year program the other day because I want to see you in the evenings too.
[01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:16.230]  Well, thank you for the support.
[01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:23.230]  Well, you know, you totally deserve it. You deserve it. You fanatical or not? You speak some truth.
[01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:26.230]  Oh, I am fanatical. I'm a red-blooded man.
[01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:28.230]  You back it up.
[01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:30.230]  Thank you. Go ahead, ma'am.
[01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:41.230]  I was really calling. One of the reasons that I went ahead and bought the year membership to Prison Planet TV was I was a little freaked out on Friday when the Secret Service visited you.
[01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:45.230]  Can you speak on that this afternoon? How did that work out for you?
[01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:49.230]  Oh, about the Secret Service visit Friday?
[01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:57.230]  Yes. I showed that to my father, who has been a practicing attorney in Texas for 30 years, and he was absolutely astonished.
[01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:05.230]  Oh, yeah. The Secret Service, they come here on average about once a year, and the subpoena, as usual, said I couldn't say what it was about.
[01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:17.230]  My lawyer obviously says generally I can say that it was not about us. It was about idiots on the message board calling for violence, and they were here for a single IP address on a single fool.
[01:40:17.230 --> 01:40:26.230]  And again, folks, don't go to the Infowars.com message board or the comments and call for the murder of this public figure or that public figure that's in government.
[01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:30.230]  I mean, I think there's been like three or four people over the years arrested.
[01:40:30.230 --> 01:40:36.230]  But again, once it's in the news, if they arrest the guy, I can talk about it once it's in the news. But that's basically it.
[01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:41.230]  Well, I sure am. I sure am glad that you are at your desk this Sunday afternoon.
[01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:49.230]  And I'm trying to turn some people on to things like Agenda 21, and people are just they think it's a unicorn. It's absolutely crazy.
[01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:57.230]  Oh, yeah. Well, Mayor Bloomberg, who is a big real estate mogul on top of all of their activity, they want to raise property taxes where about 80 percent of the money you pay is in taxes.
[01:40:58.230 --> 01:41:03.230]  And so instead of living in a thousand square foot apartment, you live in a 200 to 250.
[01:41:03.230 --> 01:41:11.230]  But then he's going to be worth twenty five billion dollars and have giant seventy thousand square foot palaces or whatever.
[01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:16.230]  I mean, it is a total joke. Mayor Bloomberg is an authoritarian pig.
[01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:22.230]  God bless you, Lindsay. Thanks for putting up with us. Jeff in Delaware, last caller for this segment. Go ahead.
[01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:26.230]  You couldn't be any more correct when you said that people are fearful of this government.
[01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:30.230]  I am sickened at the height of how people are fearful.
[01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:34.230]  We better not sign a petition. They'll get us.
[01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:38.230]  We better get scared. People actually do this on the hike and bike trail in one area.
[01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:47.230]  It's 20 feet wide and they get up against the bushes and go, oh, oh, when a bike comes by and the bikes will come over to show you they're dominant.
[01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:51.230]  I mean, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:56.230]  Well, I'm not sure if you visited the message board. I've been a follower of yours for quite a while.
[01:41:56.230 --> 01:42:03.230]  And I posted a message on your board saying how I even backed up these downtown vision people from putting extra cameras.
[01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:08.230]  And I've had one even follow me for over a week and engage them.
[01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:12.230]  There's more of us than them. They've got their U.N. 21 operatives everywhere taking everything over.
[01:42:13.230 --> 01:42:18.230]  Community organizers, engage them. You can walk out on any city street and their operatives are out there.
[01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:24.230]  Engage the enemy. It is a war. Engage them in info war. Start YouTube channels, start local blogs, start newsletters.
[01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:29.230]  Go to local talk stations and say, I want to do a one hour a week show. Show them your YouTube videos.
[01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:34.230]  They'll put you on air. Engage, become leaders, fight them, crush them, defeat them.
[01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:41.230]  David, William, Jay, Chris, Chuck, I apologize. I don't have time to get to you because Paul Watson's coming up with a segment from Infowars Nightly News.
[01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:48.230]  You've got to get in a maniac mode. Most people get in a maniac mode about sports, not about freedom.
[01:42:48.230 --> 01:42:51.230]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and sodium fluoride.
[01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:58.230]  Harvard admits that brain damage is in the tap water of the toothpaste. You need to get upset about that. Get upset about the new world order.

[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:06.230]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east, but we are still in the eye of the perfect storm.
[01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:12.230]  The most devastating economic conditions since the Great Depression, America's worst drought in agricultural history,
[01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:15.230]  and now the economic results of the presidential election.
[01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:18.230]  This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply.
[01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:24.230]  I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoodsDirect and I recommend you do the same.

[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:08.220]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:24.700]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:31.500]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex. In Dallas, Texas, three shots
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:37.100]  were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. The first reports say that
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:45.340]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea, a new order.
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:53.340]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion, it just panicked.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:05.340]  Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:17.420]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers,
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:26.460]  not in the hands of criminals. Guns will be taken and no one will be able to take all of them.
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:31.340]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:35.580]  Global governance at last, is it one world the central bankers in charge?
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:39.180]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:43.180]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:50.300]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:59.580]  It's December 21st, 2012. I'm Paul Joseph Watson. This is Infowars Nightly News.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:09.900]  Tonight, the New York governor says gun confiscation and forced buyback is an option.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:17.580]  Plus, CNN continues to push the red coat style gun ban. And Chinese pharmaceutical companies
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:23.980]  are accused of selling pills made from dead babies. The Korea Customs Service says they
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:28.620]  were made in Northeastern China from babies whose bodies were chopped into small pieces
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:35.180]  and dried on stoves before being turned into powder. That's up next on the Infowars Nightly News.
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.460]  Top story tonight, Kurt Nimmo, Infowars.com. New York governor,
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:56.700]  gun confiscation and forced buyback an option. This is also up on DrudgeReport.com tonight.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:02.380]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the state of New York is serious about gun confiscation.
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:07.100]  The Democrat and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development told an Albany radio
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:13.580]  station he plans to propose a package of draconian legislation during his state of the state address
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:19.660]  next month. And this is what he's calling for. Quote, confiscation could be an option.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:25.180]  Mandatory sale to the state could be an option. Permitting could be an option. Keep your gun,
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:31.260]  but permit it, the governor said. And of course, this is in New York where you already have to
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.180]  jump through, you know, 100 flaming hoops simply to get a gun in the first place.
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:42.060]  And isn't it the height of hypocrisy again, as we've said many times that Cuomo himself,
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:48.300]  just like Mayor Bloomberg, has his own armed bodyguard, but he's now lecturing the American
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:53.900]  people that they're going to have to potentially turn their guns in. It's OK for the crime bosses
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:58.780]  to be armed, to be protected with guns. American citizens are scum. You don't get that right.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:03.740]  And so for all the people who say, you know, well, the American people will never turn in
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:08.940]  their firearms. It's never going to happen. Just look at Hurricane Katrina. When the troops,
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:13.900]  when the National Guard came knocking, you know, even in the high and dry areas which were
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:19.900]  unaffected by the storm, they turned their guns in. You know, the quote from the police chief was
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.220]  no one will be allowed to be armed. We will take all the guns. And in many cases they did.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:29.420]  So that's a fallacy that some Americans won't turn their guns in. Whether it happens on a widespread
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:34.220]  basis remains to be seen. But we're drawn back and back again to this whole fallacy that you
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:41.500]  need government permission, permits to exercise a God given right of self-defence. So basically,
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:48.700]  Cuomo's thrown his lot in with Michael Moore, Piers Morgan, Mayor Bloomberg, Obama, and of
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:54.380]  course the communist Chinese government calling for the American people to be disarmed. And they're
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:52:00.460]  all on message calling for law-abiding American citizens to be disarmed, to have their Second
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:05.820]  Amendment rights stripped. Along with the mainstream media, which brings us on to our next
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:13.500]  story, CNN pushes British style gun ban. A letter to President Obama written by the sister of one of
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:18.860]  the Sandy Hook school shooting victims, which called for a British style gun ban that would
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:25.260]  restrict firearms to shooting ranges and nullify the Second Amendment, was read out live on air
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:32.700]  by CNN host Anderson Cooper. And you can watch this video at infowars.com. So basically it was
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:39.980]  a family friend of one of the children tragically killed in the massacre. She goes on CNN, hands
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:45.900]  Anderson Cooper this letter written by the sister of seven-year-old Daniel Barden,
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:50.460]  who of course was tragically killed during the shooting. And it's heartfelt,
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:56.780]  it's got emotional imagery. There's pictures of the memorial services in the background.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:02.860]  And this is the letter that Anderson Cooper read out. It said quote, my name is Natalie Barden,
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:09.100]  and I wanted to tell the president that only police officers and the military should get guns.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:13.260]  If people want to do it as a sport, then they can go to a shooting range,
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:21.500]  and the guns would not be able to leave there. Which of course is ironic because it was the very
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:27.100]  fact that because only the police were armed in this area, remember it was another gun-free
[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:35.100]  victim disarmament zone, a criminal safe zone. That's the very reason why nobody could stop
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:42.620]  Adam Lanza dead in his tracks until the police showed up, by which time he'd already killed
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:50.860]  27 people because nobody had a gun to defend the kids with. So the very thing that ensured the
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:58.460]  massacre was as deadly as it could be is being promoted by CNN with this added layer of emotional
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:05.580]  manipulation. The open appeal to eviscerate the Second Amendment and go under a British style
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:10.140]  gun ban where you can only have your guns in the shooting club, in the shooting range.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:15.820]  By law, they're not allowed to leave there, which never mind the guns. In Britain,
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:22.380]  the guns went decades ago. Now, we're not even allowed to defend ourselves with a baseball bat
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:29.020]  or a knife in fear of being prosecuted by the criminal who's breaking into your house.
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:35.100]  So that's how it starts with the gun ban. Of course, the handgun ban, all handguns made
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:41.260]  illegal back in 1996 in Britain after another school massacre. In the 10 years that followed,
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:46.540]  gun crime doubled because it does nothing to stop crime, it only disarms law-abiding people.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:53.100]  But Yahoo News described this letter as, quote, poignant and said it relayed, quote,
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:58.140]  a clear and thoughtful belief that guns did not belong in the hands of most civilians.
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:06.140]  And yes, it's the fact that a gun was not in the hands of a teacher or a school official. That's
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:13.900]  the very reason itself why Lanza was able to tragically kill all those children unimpeded.
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:21.740]  So now we've got CNN openly pushing for a British style, forget about semi-assault rifles,
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:27.500]  a full British style gun ban, handguns, the whole shebang, all of it gone. That's what
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:33.820]  CNN is pushing for now. And on that subject again, gun grabbers call for re-education
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:41.100]  programs in public schools. This is an article by Brandon Smith out of altmarket.com. And it's
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:45.820]  a response to a Reuters piece, which I believe we featured on the show a couple of days ago,
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:53.580]  which basically called again, not only for the assault rifles to be banned,
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:58.060]  but for the entire shebang to go, handguns and everything, complete evisceration of the
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:04.620]  Second Amendment. Quote, the answer, according to gun grabbers, is to force schools to re-educate
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:11.980]  your children to fear and disdain the very idea of gun ownership. Again, we're back to that whole
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:18.140]  idea of making even the discussion of guns taboo and something dirty, something that's said in hush
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:24.300]  tones. Quote, this is almost the equivalent of pre-monocular policy against the gun rights
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:30.940]  movement. Essentially, the Reuters author's philosophy is to breed us out, taking away our
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:36.780]  ability to pass on our Second Amendment principle to our children through propaganda conditioning
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:42.540]  instead of trying to fight us head on. And it's a rebuttal to this Reuters piece,
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:48.300]  which states, quote, this is what they're calling for. If we can link federal funds to mandatory
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:53.740]  standardized testing, then we can certainly do the same for gun control education.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:57:01.740]  So, of course, remember Eric Holder's quote from back in 1995, we must brainwash people on guns.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:08.780]  That's precisely now what's being advocated at the school level. And, of course, all this is
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:13.500]  necessary for the gun grabbers because the majority of American citizens, despite what
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:19.020]  you've seen over the course of the past week, do not support gun control, even in the very first
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.660]  few days after the Sandy Hook match.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.240]  Bye.
