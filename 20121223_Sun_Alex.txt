[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  There is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sets.
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.000]  Even when the set is turned off, look around to the environment we live in, carbon dioxide,
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  fluorocarbons, and methane have increased since 1958.
[00:18.000 --> 00:25.000]  Earth is being acclimatized. They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere.
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.000]  We are like a natural resource to them. To take the planet, move on to another.
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  They want benign indifference. They want us drugging.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.000]  We could be pets. We could be fruit. But all we really are is livestock.
[00:42.000 --> 00:51.000]  Our impulses are being redirected. We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:51.000 --> 01:01.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines because I am glad to be here.
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  I am ready to take on the global tyrants, the New World Order, and all their adult minions and mercenaries.
[01:22.000 --> 01:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here. It is the 23rd day of December 2012.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  We have passed that imaginary line, that demarcation, no man's zone, no man's land.
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.000]  It is the beginning of December 21, 2012, used by the globalists and mainstream media for 37 years at least,
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  to hoax everyone that, ah, don't be involved politically, don't be involved, the world is going to end anyways.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  And they tell the Christians the world is going to end because of the rapture every few years,
[01:56.000 --> 02:05.000]  and it's all just a giant cop-out, but the sun set on December 21, and the sun came back up on the 22nd.
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  I got to tell you, though, Thursday I was driving into work on the eve of December 21,
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  and now behind us on the highway of life and time, here on the time-space continuum,
[02:18.000 --> 02:28.000]  and I tuned into my local affiliate and heard one of the hosts, not on the morning show, those are pretty smart guys,
[02:28.000 --> 02:36.000]  but on the show after it, where the co-host was saying, yeah, Alex Jones thinks the world's going to end tomorrow.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Never said that in 17 years on air, always said it was a fraud, because I've been asked millions, not millions,
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  to be serious, thousands of times by callers and people on the street about 2012, and I just got so sick of it,
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  because it was always, oh, you're mistaken, or no, you're a fed, you're a traitor, because you don't think it's the end of the world, you know.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  You're making that up, you know, you're hiding, and then we got a call from one of the local TV stations Friday.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Which one was it, John?
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  Yeah, KXN NBC.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Getting a comment, Alex thinks the world's going to end, and we'd like to get his comment today.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  And we said, Alex has never said that.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  We got a bunch of other calls, too.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  My frustration is that even though I've always said it's a fraud, there are real threats we face.
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.000]  There are people commenting on YouTube, the minority of them, on a special report we did at Doomsday 2012,
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  Secrets Revealed exposing the real threats, not the fake threat, and how this self-fulfilling prophecy is used to get us to stand down.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  And I noticed him saying, well, then why does he sell storable foods? Why does he promote guns and gold?
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  Because of the real threats that 2012 obscured.
[03:47.000 --> 03:55.000]  Carony worldwide, global devaluation, the open world government being announced, the globalists are authoritarian, eugenicists.
[03:55.000 --> 04:05.000]  Agenda 21, the deindustrialization program, that's why governments are digging in in their real Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense and NATO reports that are public.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's why the elite are digging in and moving to the countryside. That's mainstream news. That's what's going on, okay?
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  The billionaires I've talked to, quite a few of them.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  Everybody's moving to the country or getting out of Western nations. Look at the riots in Europe. That's why we get prepared.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  The public is so simple. They get one thought in their mind at a time and that's it.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  And it's painful because we've got to get people smarter or we're doomed, okay?
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  See, the globalists like you dumber because you're easier to control. I like you smarter because I know what comes around, goes around.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  I'm a human. I'm on team human. I want my kids to have a good future. So I want to get the dumb masses up off their butts.
[04:48.000 --> 04:59.000]  The biggest attack on the Second Amendment ever. Our worst analysis confirmed. The worst striking back. Straight ahead. Stay with us. All the intel you need.
[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future. How do I safeguard?
[05:06.000 --> 05:13.000]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scowzen. The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that attack to come.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  What I tell people is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people wanting to be ready won't be able to get out of town because there will be absolute panic.
[05:39.000 --> 05:50.000]  There is no preparedness without strategy. This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness. Strategic relocation film with Joel Scowzen and Alex Jones.
[05:50.000 --> 06:07.000]  Available only at infowarshop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[06:07.000 --> 06:18.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial counterparts.
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  In Los Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  It is a big idea. A new order.
[06:37.000 --> 06:44.000]  It was almost as if it were planned in place. It's just pancakes.
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  Whether you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[06:50.000 --> 07:10.000]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals.
[07:10.000 --> 07:19.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[07:19.000 --> 07:27.000]  Global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge. But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[07:33.000 --> 07:42.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  Do you want to defend the Republic or do you want to be a slave?
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  That is the question you need to ask yourself right now. Do you want to be drunk on entertainment and mindless fluff and be a joke to the global social engineers?
[07:55.000 --> 08:06.000]  Or do you want to be an empowered human who is fighting to control their destiny and build a better world, not just for our children and grandchildren, but for the species itself?
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  That is the question.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  Well, we're cruising into new territory. It's almost Christmas.
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  And we are here live. It is the 23rd day of December 2012.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  And this is going to be an extremely, every broadcast is important. Every Sunday show, every weekday show I do, are very, very important.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  But this one is particularly important. I've done a lot of preparation for this broadcast to document and prove what I'm going to say here.
[08:34.000 --> 08:41.000]  Number one, it is official. They are going to try to physically ban all semi-automatic handguns and rifles and make you turn them in.
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  That is the White House Council's plan. And we have all the proof of that. We're going to be going over it.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  It's part of the UN Treaty to comply with that. And you cannot make this up.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  The Chinese and the Russians are offering to help disarm the American people.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  That is mainstream news as well. Even that shocked me. I couldn't believe it.
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  That's how dumbed down they think we are, that we just could care less about our sovereignty and would say something like that.
[09:09.000 --> 09:14.000]  Because in the past, if foreign governments got involved saying, disarm your people, we'll like to help you with the UN,
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  that would cause the American people to say, oh, you'll never get our guns, stay out of our business.
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  Nowadays, you're called traitor if you don't want to turn your guns into the UN.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  So, in fact, guys, you print me even Forbes reporting that the UN Treaty does take our guns. I just want to read them saying it.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  So, things are moving so quick, I can't even believe it. Okay, that's how bad it is.
[09:34.000 --> 09:43.000]  On Thursday, I said to Kurt Nemo, editor of infowars.com, I said, I want you to do a story on these topics.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  And I want to put out a White House petition, which anybody can do to call for the deportation appears Morgan.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  He did that Friday. It's in several thousand newspapers today.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  And they can't get it right. They say Kurt Nemo founded and ran infowars.com, which is fine.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  Most of them don't even say where the petition came from, but it's really a record.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  Within about an hour, it should reach the 25,000 signatures to make the White House respond to it.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  So, we're going to talk about that. Now, again, Piers Morgan can say whatever he wants from England.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  He doesn't have a First Amendment here to engage in subversion.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  And when Piers Morgan came out and said, how dare you violate my First Amendment?
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  The Wall Street Journal said, oh, here's a Supreme Court ruling from 77 Bud that when foreigners come here in the media
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  and try to overturn the Bill of Rights or Constitution, it's instant deportation.
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  There have been thousands of people deported in the last century alone coming here and agitating.
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.000]  Now, we may have been conditioned to put up with illegal activity, but no other country on earth lets somebody come to their country,
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  come to their country, and engage in attempted political actions.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  No one puts up with that. The Russians just arrested a bunch of CIA fronts over there
[11:06.000 --> 11:16.000]  trying to stir up stuff in the media and things. And whereas it is authoritarian, it was an act of subversion going on.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Now, I'm not saying arresting. I'm saying arresting and deporting.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  Now, here's another issue. The Russian media, they run cable channels, RT and RT, RT America here in the U.S.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  They've gotten on the bandwagon calling for us to have our guns turned in.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  So, let me explain something, Russia, today, and the Chinese media over here doing this.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  You need to get out of our country, okay? I know everybody thinks America's done and we're pathetic,
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  and there's nothing we won't put up with, and Obama became the head of the U.N. program,
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  the head of the U.N. Security Council a few years ago, totally illegal, violates Article 1, Section 9.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  It is high treason. They just flaunt everything on our face.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  Yeah, we have a president who's also the head of the U.N. Security Council.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  A president can't be the head of a foreign body, can't serve a foreign group.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's Article 1, Section 9. No one else in the world will put up with this.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  We've been so open and so nice that we'll put up with anything.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  So, they're bringing in buckets of foreigners at CNN and MSNBC.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  In fact, that's mainly who they have up there.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  Putting down America, calling people rednecks who love freedom, putting us down, rubbing our noses in it,
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  and not just calling for us to turn our guns in, calling for socialism, everything else.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  And America has voted, I'm going to talk about this later, but it deals with the whole media hoax.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  And I even put it off some of the latest Nielsen ratings on this.
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  In Austin, Texas, the local affiliate we're on, 590 a.m., I have looked at the trade publications at its top shows.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Over 100,000 people an hour listening. One affiliate we have.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  I've gotten the ratings. We're number one in almost every demographic, just on a little Sunday show.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  But their biggest shows in the morning and things have well over 100,000 listeners at one time.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  I'm on stations in places like Chicago and Dallas where we have over 100,000 listeners an hour.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  They've got big trade publications that boil down the instant ratings and the arbitra and the rest of it.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  Anybody in radio can pull this up. It's why we're getting on four or five new stations a week right now.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  Supposedly it's the instant meters came in.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  And we are just exploding.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  We, on average, have over a half a million listeners every 15 minutes.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  And imagine it's a three hour weekday show.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Half a million, every 15 minutes.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  And that's not counting XM, 166, that's not counting Global Shortwave,
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  or number one on audio streams and podcasts for the talk show according to stat, brain, Google Analytics, and Shoutcast.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  So Piers Morgan runs around with three bodyguards armed.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  Piers Morgan, because I've talked to people that have been there and been around him and seeing it in,
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  well, it's been on the news, Piers Morgan runs around like he's God.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  And all these Hollywood stars go on his show and heads of state.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  The guy's top ratings, and he's the best on CNN now, half a million.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  It's five, five hundred and fifty something thousand, fifty six thousand.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  Fox has like three million on the show up against it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that's not even a very big audience, comparatively in media.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  Something like Rush Limbaugh has about 11 million tuning in at one time, 22 million a week,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  because most of them are tuned in all the time.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  But overall, it's 22 million, that's conservative.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  Coast to coast AM, 16 million during the week, about five to 10 million, depending on what show it is.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  And believe me, I know the response.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  I go on CNN, no response.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  Go on Fox, no response.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Go on coast to coast AM, run ads on Limbaugh.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  We've done that before.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  Just, you know, just blew our doors off.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Okay, again, these are paper tigers.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  No wonder CNN wants to shut down free speech on talk radio.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  They call it the fairness doctor.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  No wonder they want to censor the Internet, because they can't compete with us.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  They have giant sets, emperors, new clothes.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  The emperor has no clothes.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  And here's this twit with all these bodyguards who wants your guns so you can't protect yourself.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  And he is literally a fantasy.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  Conservative numbers on this Sunday show, which we've done so stations can get a taste of the broadcast.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  They almost always end up picking up the weekday.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  It always goes.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  They pick up Sunday, then they put us on at night.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  During the weekdays, then we're on prime time.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  Boom.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  Still.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  Then on six years Sunday, guess what the numbers are, approaching two million conservatively.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  Over the two hours, guess what the weekday is?
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Three million and growing.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  In fact, it's much higher, but I'm not ready to give those numbers out yet.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  Probably going to be an excess of five million.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  The system is, these people are jokes.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  Because some foreigner says, turn your guns in, you are.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  Go back to England, a country you've already destroyed.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  You red coat punk.
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[16:07.000 --> 16:14.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver based products.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions.

[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[16:29.000 --> 16:36.000]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.000]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera,

[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[20:21.000 --> 20:33.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  Okay, let's plunge straight into the news today.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  It is all off the chart.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  I want to direct you to articles at infowars.com and prismblana.com
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  that all link to, quote, mainstream establishment media.
[20:49.000 --> 20:53.000]  A foreign banker owned and run globalist operations.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Go look up who owns the dominant media.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  And it's all state-run, whether it's CNN, whether it's MSNBC,
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  it all gets government, banker bailout money, stimulus money, you name it.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  The media is just subsidiaries of these global combines.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  New York Governor, gun confiscations enforced buy back an option.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  Kurt Nemo, infowars.com, this story went viral on Friday
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  and it all comes out of a New York Times story.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  Como says he'll outline gun proposal next month in the state-of-the-state address
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  and he made his comments, there's audio of it, on WGDJAM.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  And he said, we may let you keep a few of your guns,
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  but most of them, you can go read the quote and go listen to the audio.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  He said, you'll have to turn in most of your guns and we'll pay you for them.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  So, get ready, because somebody committed a crime with a gun,
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  you've got to turn your guns in, even though the new FBI crime statistics,
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.000]  we showed these on Friday, because we also streamed video, go to FBI.gov.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  Crime has gone down more than 20% the last seven years,
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  thanks to increased gun ownership.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  Mass shootings have gone up a tiny bit, but the media hyping of them has really increased.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  Continuing CNN pushes British-style gun ban.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  Paul Watson covered this on M4's Nightly News Friday,
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  he's going to play a clip of that at the end of the show next hour, very powerful.
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  And they said, just take everyone's guns and let them be at a gun range
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  where you check them out only to target shoot.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  That's how it is in England now, and you have to go through backgrounds just to do that.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  So, that's British-style, almost total gun ban.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  Then there's this article, the Official People's Daily of the Communist Party of China,
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  came out on Friday and said, quote,
[22:48.000 --> 22:54.000]  we want to help Obama wage war on gun owners and help disarm them,
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  and they support the implementation of the UN Small Arms Treaty
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  that will allow the UN to control once we sign on to it.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  They can just have a general assembly vote of the whole UN, all those dictators and people,
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  and then we are under treaty to then turn our guns in.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  And by the way, that's not Alex Jones breaking this down.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  Here is Forbes for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  You can see it right there.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  If you're a radio listener, you can simply go to Search Engine
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  and type in, you and agreement should have all gun owners up in arms.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  And it goes on to say, it says it'll restrict our guns
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  and then allow them with a simple UN majority vote,
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  no Security Council veto to ban them in the future.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  You might want to actually go read the treaty.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  Obama says he's going to push the Senate, now huge Democrat dominated,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  only the Senate is needed to pass that in March.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  Isn't all this just perfect timing?
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  Isn't that just special?
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  Let's go on to the next little piece here.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  So Friday, as Americans, we strike back.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  You got the Russian TV broadcast in English.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  In Europe, it's actually on broadcast where Paul Watson lives in London
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  on the regular television with rabbit ears.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  It's on cable here in the U.S. RT.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  It's calling for us to turn our guns in on its two channels 24-7.
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  And Piers Morgan, who is facing all sorts of criminal charges.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  We're going to go over some of those later here.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  He's facing six criminal charges, including a felony conspiracy
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  to prevent the courts of justice.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  Needless to say, they're trying to get him to come back to England.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  He isn't too happy to do that.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Nothing against the great British people, the folks in the U.K., the Scots,
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  and the great Irish.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  All of them great people.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  I'm related to all of them.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  But really, your countries are tyrannies now.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  You admit that.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  Your crime is more than double since you took the guns 15 years ago.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  We've gone over those numbers.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Even British newspapers admit it.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  And here he is.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  So Friday, we strike back at Piers Morgan.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  And we say, you know what, buddy?
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.000]  You're engaged in something that has been very well documented for a very long time.
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  Its sedition of a citizen is trying to overthrow the constitutional lawful government.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  But if government tries to overthrow the basic liberty,
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  it is in our right and duty to throw it off.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  But it is called subversion when a foreign asset comes here
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  and seeks to change the government.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  And it says, sign petition to deport Piers Morgan for his attack on the Constitution.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  That came out at about noon on Friday during the broadcast.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  And you've got to sign your name and say who you are when you do that.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  And show again people this article.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  You can link through and sign the petition.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  It's almost the 25,000 needed.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  You need 25,000 a month to have Obama respond to it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  He's sworn to do.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  That means he won't.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  Well, then what good is this when you need 349 more to get it going?
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Sure, we'll get like 500,000 on the time we're done.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  This has just gone viral today.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  It's good because Obama has people signing a petition to ban our guns.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  And he's going to hold that up to us or, you know, things like that.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  So it's good to get attention.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  It's good to focus things on here and his subversion inside our country.
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  Now, Piers Morgan, I'm going to show viewers a bunch of these articles right here.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  He fired back last night at infowars.com at drudgerport.com.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  It also linked to our petition and still link there on the right hand side right now.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  But that's the easiest place to find is drudgerport.com.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Go about halfway down the right hand side.
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  It's right there.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Find a link directly to the petition.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  We need to get a link back on the main page of infowars.com.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  But the point is, is that you can go there and you can read literally, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  there are thousands of articles because you can type in Piers Morgan deport.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  And it says several thousand articles, Russian TV, French TV, British TV.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  They're all saying, how dare you Americans turn your guns in?
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  So we'll probably say, oh, we'll be polite.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  Here's our guns since the French said so.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  But gun advocate asked Obama administration to deport Piers Morgan.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  And in 90% of these articles or more, they will never say infowars.com.
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  That's how scared the mainstream media is of the real media that isn't state run.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  But that doesn't matter.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  Our goal was, we didn't even put infowars.com in the petition.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  It's Kurt Nemo.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  We did that so it would actually get out there to people.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  Okay, continuing.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  There's the Hollywood Reporter.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  Here's Huffington Post.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  Piers Morgan's deportation petition posted to White House after his gun control rants.
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  The examiner did report that it is an infowars.com petition.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  So that's good.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  Here's France 24, national TV, U.S. gun advocate, six deportation of Piers Morgan.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  No, it's tens of thousands of people signing it.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  It goes on and on with all the reports.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  Now, if you go to infowars.com, we have an article titled, the law says to deport Piers Morgan.
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  And I want to go over some of this for people because if you go to infowars.com, we have
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  links to the Wall Street Journal writer.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  Wall Street Journal columnist explains on Twitter how to deport Piers Morgan.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  Piers Morgan made jokes and said, you can't deport me on his Twitter.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  I'm not joking.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  It says, I'm a British supremacist.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  I'm not joking.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  Go read them.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  I'm a British supremacist and I'm going to dominate you.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  And then somebody said, you're glad those kids are dead.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  You can use them for that.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  And he said, yeah, I am.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  So he's a totally arrogant person fleeing justice from England.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  I mean, he is the swineiest guy in media.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  He had to leave England.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  Okay.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  So here's this foreigner.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  We come back.
[28:44.000 --> 28:52.000]  We're going to explain how for subterfuge, how for subversion, he needs to be on the
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  first airplane shackled out of this country because he's here trying to take our second
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  amendment.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  Don't be one of them.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  solution.
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning and help improve wound healing.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  Supernatural silver is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  harmful pathogens.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  The science digest journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
