[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:27.300]  thank you for joining us my friends you have found the front lines of the
[00:27.300 --> 00:34.020]  information war the global awakening is accelerating it is Monday the 23rd day
[00:34.020 --> 00:40.480]  of August 2010 Webster Griffin Tarpley economist and historian will be joining
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.840]  us to talk about the massive intensification of preparations for
[00:45.840 --> 00:53.300]  war with Iran the Israeli Knesset said over the weekend that they are
[00:53.300 --> 00:58.580]  preparing for war that is out of the Jerusalem post and herettes will be
[00:58.580 --> 01:02.660]  discussing that with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming up in the next hour we
[01:02.660 --> 01:07.340]  have other serious news of the London independent toxic legacy of US assault on
[01:07.340 --> 01:13.220]  Fallujah worse than Hiroshima off the charts increases in cancers and
[01:13.220 --> 01:18.740]  deformities from depleted uranium the army's own reports from the 60s 70s 80s
[01:18.740 --> 01:23.140]  and 90s admit this is deadly not just to the people it's used on but for the
[01:23.140 --> 01:28.580]  troops that use the weapons as well so this just goes to the mindset of the
[01:28.580 --> 01:36.040]  globalist Iraqi Bishop says US betrayed country Christians suffer the most and
[01:36.040 --> 01:42.580]  so we'll look at the fake withdrawal as well with Webster Griffin Tarpley coming
[01:42.580 --> 01:48.860]  up in the next hour as well listeners did it again last Friday this time we
[01:48.860 --> 01:53.300]  had three Bilderberg group associated search terms all three made it into the
[01:53.300 --> 01:57.940]  top slots number one number two and number three and then literally hundreds
[01:57.940 --> 02:03.060]  of blogs scores of newspapers then wrote reports about in-game blueprint for
[02:03.060 --> 02:06.700]  global enslavement the Obama deception both films that expose the Bilderberg
[02:06.700 --> 02:10.460]  group and the shadow government and so hundreds of thousands of people have
[02:10.460 --> 02:16.020]  been exposed to the truth with one fails swoop with one powerful blow good job
[02:16.020 --> 02:22.460]  to everyone taking action on that front continuing with other news there's a
[02:22.460 --> 02:29.660]  prison planet dot com report today not only to John P. Holdren in the 70s the
[02:29.660 --> 02:33.700]  White House science arm call for sterilization chemicals to be put in
[02:33.700 --> 02:37.420]  the water forced world population reduction global government to enforce
[02:37.420 --> 02:44.540]  it he also in 2006 wrote about similar things four years ago and now we have a
[02:44.540 --> 02:49.700]  new 1992 document that's been discovered a publication reaffirms devotion to
[02:49.700 --> 02:53.500]  population control through global effort and of course there's another
[02:53.500 --> 03:00.380]  report here from the BBC they're gonna have a series of broadcast promoting
[03:00.380 --> 03:07.500]  for sterilization of people who aren't just mentally ill or who were handicapped
[03:07.500 --> 03:13.300]  but also those that have shown a history of being criminal more morally
[03:13.300 --> 03:20.140]  unfit or drinking alcohol good enough for Hitler good enough for England so a
[03:20.140 --> 03:24.300]  similar system being promoted there as if it's a wonderful thing the BBC is now
[03:24.300 --> 03:29.260]  promoting that and of course another info wars com article from two weeks ago
[03:29.260 --> 03:34.340]  that integrates in with this Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass
[03:34.340 --> 03:40.100]  scale fertility reproduction sterilization compounds added to the
[03:40.100 --> 03:48.460]  vaccines we know that that is ongoing now so that is coming up also new Logan
[03:48.460 --> 03:56.540]  searches blasted TSA test frisky frisking policy and they always roll it out in a

[08:34.020 --> 08:39.540]  news ahead of a deep breakdown of what's happening with the economy worldwide
[08:39.540 --> 08:44.420]  and the massive acceleration with the Israeli Kinesit mirroring their
[08:44.420 --> 08:49.140]  propaganda arm Atlantic Monthly last week they now came out over the weekend
[08:49.140 --> 08:53.540]  and said we are preparing to strike Iran we are going to strike Iran they've
[08:53.540 --> 08:59.580]  now fueled the reactor at Bashir if it is hit it could cause a Chernobyl type
[08:59.580 --> 09:04.660]  reaction but the system doesn't care just 15 years ago the Pentagon admitted
[09:04.660 --> 09:10.140]  that DU was deadly for our troops that use it deadly for the areas for billions
[09:10.140 --> 09:15.060]  of years where the DU is used it's now used in hundreds of different types
[09:15.060 --> 09:18.740]  of munitions not just two or three different types of munitions like
[09:18.740 --> 09:23.260]  bunker busters and anti-tank weapons fired from Vulcan cannons and 810 war
[09:23.260 --> 09:30.460]  dogs or Sabos in Abrams M1A tanks now it's being served out even in 223 for
[09:30.460 --> 09:36.300]  m16s and 50 caliber and they've got major scientific organizations and major
[09:36.300 --> 09:41.460]  newspapers reporting off the chart increases in cancers not just for the
[09:41.460 --> 09:46.740]  Iraqis but for our troops and just like the 9-11 workers or just like the
[09:46.740 --> 09:51.540]  Exxon Valdez workers are now the Gulf oil spill workers when they get sick and
[09:51.540 --> 09:56.860]  start dying they say look no healthcare for you go crawl in a hole and die we
[09:56.860 --> 10:01.700]  only want to wrap you in the American flag when we bury your butt we're here
[10:01.700 --> 10:07.340]  to use you we are the global new world order takeover system and that's the
[10:07.340 --> 10:11.780]  bottom line of what's happening here we're gonna be going over that today I
[10:11.780 --> 10:16.780]  also want to get into Obama's poll numbers continuing to collapse and the
[10:16.780 --> 10:21.260]  headline out of the telegraph does Barack Obama want to be reelected in 2010
[10:21.260 --> 10:26.900]  meanwhile he's got the Mexican president here again running around saying he
[10:26.900 --> 10:31.980]  wants semi-automatics banned in America and it's also being reported by New
[10:31.980 --> 10:36.900]  York newspapers that Mexican police are to patrol New York City making sure
[10:36.900 --> 10:42.260]  Mexicans aren't discriminated against meanwhile all over the country in in
[10:42.260 --> 10:47.660]  Mexico the police will come to the mayor or to a governor's house or to a US
[10:47.660 --> 10:52.460]  consulate and they'll walk Mexican government people out US government
[10:52.460 --> 10:55.900]  people out and they'll kill you in the street they'll even rape you and cut
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.660]  your head off as part of their their intimidation and the police are dealing
[11:00.660 --> 11:04.980]  the drugs in Mexico predominantly and Mexico doesn't care about that and they
[11:04.980 --> 11:09.660]  rob American citizens they suck off American citizens when they catch you
[11:09.660 --> 11:14.020]  down there they shake you down that's okay they're gonna come here and tell us
[11:14.020 --> 11:18.100]  to turn our guns in they're gonna come here and tell us that they're gonna
[11:18.100 --> 11:21.620]  patrol the streets of America to make sure nobody discriminates against their
[11:21.620 --> 11:26.020]  law infasura their law reconquista they're reconquering their invasion I
[11:26.020 --> 11:30.460]  mean it's just amazing to see this going on so I want to go back over some
[11:30.460 --> 11:34.620]  of the latest developments on that front today and then obviously I talked
[11:34.620 --> 11:38.540]  about some of this yesterday on the Sunday broadcast from 4 to 6 p.m. central
[11:38.540 --> 11:43.220]  it's all over the media it's in my local paper every day it's all over TV
[11:43.220 --> 11:49.060]  they're saying part of back to school but every American needs it is your H1N1
[11:49.060 --> 11:53.020]  shot and they've got tens of millions of dosages that they couldn't get people
[11:53.020 --> 11:57.780]  to take last year they're just gonna push last year's H1N1 on admitted hoax by
[11:57.780 --> 12:01.260]  the British Medical Journal they've made it's a hoax the European Union Medical
[12:01.260 --> 12:05.420]  Commission admits it's a hoax they admit it's a tenfold increase in convulsions
[12:05.420 --> 12:09.220]  if you take it that's mainstream news and they're just gonna run the whole hoax
[12:09.220 --> 12:13.700]  again and hype it up and scare everybody and find a few people that have
[12:13.700 --> 12:18.020]  compromised immune systems or who've got cancer who die of the flu they're gonna
[12:18.020 --> 12:20.940]  hype it and tell you you got to take it and there's no doubt that in these
[12:20.940 --> 12:25.420]  vaccines that we're seeing massive increases in infertility or full-born
[12:25.420 --> 12:30.780]  sterilization we're seeing massive increases in cancer and it's all on the
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.380]  drug insert that it can cause this and do this and they don't care they don't
[12:35.380 --> 12:41.900]  care that's just the way it is Gardasil you take it it kills you Prozac you take
[12:41.900 --> 12:45.900]  it absolutely attacks every organ in your body including the brain massively
[12:45.900 --> 12:50.220]  increases suicide violent tendencies they don't care they put it on the insert
[12:50.220 --> 12:54.780]  and push it on you just all admitted it's like all these drug ads I hear it
[12:54.780 --> 12:57.740]  goes oh you having trouble sleeping take this may make you have a heart attack
[12:57.740 --> 13:02.420]  or go crazy oh you have to urinate every few hours well that's not normal take
[13:02.420 --> 13:05.420]  this it may make you a psychopathic killer give you a heart attack or brain
[13:05.420 --> 13:14.900]  cancer but so what on and on and on we are in a pharmacological dictatorship and
[13:14.900 --> 13:20.140]  I was thinking about it this weekend I was looking at my wife's SUV and it's
[13:20.140 --> 13:23.300]  got a big key down the side of it that she got at a grocery store parking lot
[13:23.300 --> 13:26.740]  and it happened about a year ago we haven't fixed it and we don't really
[13:26.740 --> 13:30.340]  care you know once the car really gets banged up enough over the next four or
[13:30.340 --> 13:33.140]  five years we'll probably you know get it repainted or something but we're not
[13:33.140 --> 13:36.580]  you know too much you know into aesthetics long as the vehicle runs well
[13:36.580 --> 13:43.220]  but it just struck me that the ultimate form of control is drugging people and
[13:43.220 --> 13:47.820]  poisoning people that's the ultimate form of domination is controlling who
[13:47.820 --> 13:52.300]  can have children it's putting things in the water to lower your IQ that's the
[13:52.300 --> 13:57.020]  ultimate stealth assault and the globalists in a thousand different ways
[13:57.020 --> 14:04.220]  or more key our brains it's like a dog that goes over and urinates on somebody's
[14:04.220 --> 14:08.820]  fence post to mark this is my territory this is all part of this territorial
[14:08.820 --> 14:16.780]  domination that's what all of this forced inoculation is about it's what the
[14:16.780 --> 14:21.940]  TSA naked body scanning you and your family your wife your children yourself
[14:21.940 --> 14:26.660]  your brother your sister your mother your father now they're enhancing the
[14:26.660 --> 14:30.940]  frisk where and this is in the mainstream news where they grab your breast
[14:30.940 --> 14:35.620]  and squeeze them to make sure they're not bombs and they grab your genitals and
[14:35.620 --> 14:39.340]  squeeze them I'd already seen this on the news it would show the enhanced pat
[14:39.340 --> 14:45.700]  down and they go around the woman's breast men do this women frisk men men
[14:45.700 --> 14:50.340]  frisk women it's all about breaking taboos that's why the Pentagon admits
[14:50.340 --> 14:55.100]  they now have joint showers for men and women at many bases and joint sleeping
[14:55.100 --> 15:00.700]  quarters you know it's enough to get your your personal space broken down to
[15:00.700 --> 15:04.100]  be in the military and have to sit there on the head using the bathroom right
[15:04.100 --> 15:09.980]  next to dozens of other men but but imagine you've got to sit there right
[15:09.980 --> 15:13.300]  next to a woman and she's sitting on the commode and you're sitting on the
[15:13.300 --> 15:17.780]  commode and the social engineers over a hundred years ago the eugenesis said they
[15:17.780 --> 15:21.700]  would break down the distinction of family men and women they would divide
[15:21.700 --> 15:27.540]  the different racial groups against each other this is their tool of total
[15:27.540 --> 15:32.700]  control it's savage social engineering of we're gonna have police take your blood
[15:32.700 --> 15:36.500]  at warrantless nighttime checkpoints on the side of the road to get in your
[15:36.500 --> 15:39.740]  comfort space we're gonna take your baby's blood at birth and put it in the
[15:39.740 --> 15:43.340]  DNA database and we lied to you for decades but now we admit what it's
[15:43.340 --> 15:48.020]  really for and we're gonna naked scan you at the courthouses and the shopping
[15:48.020 --> 15:52.020]  malls and the federal courthouses and the airports and at the public schools

[15:55.660 --> 15:59.420]  going in colleges all federal courthouses are now getting it they
[15:59.420 --> 16:04.300]  store all the images just total control naked body scanners three years ago on

[16:42.060 --> 16:48.740]  and give me 25 scumbag it's all brainwashing it's all induction into
[16:48.740 --> 16:52.900]  slavery you and your family everything going into bondage now they're getting

[17:02.700 --> 17:06.940]  ranch getting you ready for total enslavement just setting the precedence
[17:06.940 --> 17:13.580]  now I I saw two articles yesterday and I I've been investigating the T Don
[17:13.580 --> 17:17.540]  Hudow FEMA center because it's also not just for foreigners but for citizens as
[17:17.540 --> 17:24.260]  well this residential FEMA camp and I noticed in the news that a jail guard is
[17:24.260 --> 17:29.100]  set he's been arrested he's now going to be indicted because picking up people at
[17:29.100 --> 17:35.900]  the airport to be taken to the immigration facility the FEMA camp he
[17:35.900 --> 17:41.180]  would reportedly frisk them and he was trained and enhanced search and he would
[17:41.180 --> 17:45.860]  do rings around their breast reportedly and pat their buttocks well I mean it's
[17:45.860 --> 17:49.700]  on the news that you line up with your wife and children and it's on the news
[17:49.700 --> 17:54.380]  them taking six-year-old girls and boys and squeezing them training them good how
[17:54.380 --> 18:01.380]  to be in Nazi Germany so my issue is you notice that they'll indict their own
[18:01.380 --> 18:08.700]  minions for doing it at a prison but they won't indict their own people because
[18:08.700 --> 18:12.780]  they're trained to do it now at Boston Logan and other airports where they're
[18:12.780 --> 18:17.020]  beta testing this so here's the article it's up on info wars.com and
[18:17.020 --> 18:21.380]  prisonplanet.com is actually several articles up there about this subject

[18:51.700 --> 18:55.420]  goes through this whole article to say and and the ACLU says oh we agree there
[18:55.420 --> 18:59.620]  needs to be searches because you know there are terrorists and we do need to
[18:59.620 --> 19:03.060]  pat you down and they could body scan you but but what about squeezing the
[19:03.060 --> 19:06.860]  breast you know is this okay what about grabbing the genitals is this okay well

[38:33.940 --> 38:41.980]  get into the next subject and this is really really important. I'm 36 years
[38:41.980 --> 38:52.420]  old I learn more every single year than what I had learned in the previous
[38:52.420 --> 38:58.860]  decades my understanding is accelerating and is expanding you're not the only
[38:58.860 --> 39:04.420]  people who are learning you're not the only people out there that are having
[39:04.420 --> 39:10.380]  epiphanies I'm having them as well we're all learning together and doing many
[39:10.380 --> 39:14.060]  hours of radio every day and radio interviews and reading documents and
[39:14.060 --> 39:21.180]  reading legislation and truly immersing myself in this information for 17 years
[39:21.180 --> 39:27.940]  on air for 15 and before that I was a big student of history because I found
[39:27.940 --> 39:33.220]  it to be entertaining I mean I like literally Lamore novels when I was 12
[39:33.220 --> 39:36.300]  years old because my dad was reading them and reading science fiction and I'd
[39:36.300 --> 39:40.580]  pick them up and read them but as soon as I found history I was done with
[39:40.580 --> 39:44.100]  fiction because it was much more entertaining and that's really how I
[39:44.100 --> 39:48.740]  got my education my my my foundational understanding because my parents
[39:48.740 --> 39:53.700]  read a lot of history as well and those books were laying around the house and
[39:53.700 --> 40:00.020]  we didn't have cable TV because my parents weren't big TV heads and so I
[40:00.020 --> 40:05.900]  learned to read and and entertain myself with reading instead of watching
[40:05.900 --> 40:08.940]  television and I still watch some TV growing up went to movies and things
[40:08.940 --> 40:12.500]  it's just that balm I love going to my neighbor's house because they would have
[40:12.500 --> 40:16.420]  cable I didn't have it so I didn't watch a lot of television if I did I watched
[40:16.420 --> 40:21.060]  mainly PBS and documentaries about war and history and Shakespearean plays and
[40:21.060 --> 40:28.260]  things so I got a good base a good classical education from just studying
[40:28.260 --> 40:36.540]  history now since then interacting with the public interacting with other
[40:36.540 --> 40:42.340]  media people interacting with celebrities I have gained a much greater
[40:42.340 --> 40:47.220]  understanding about human nature you know I've been married for nine years I've
[40:47.220 --> 40:51.340]  got three children I've had all those experiences that other parents have had
[40:51.340 --> 40:57.060]  I've had experiences now in business and taxes and how other people operate in
[40:57.060 --> 41:02.460]  business and I've really learned how good humanity is but also how bad
[41:02.460 --> 41:07.860]  humanity is and I never really understood what good parents I had I thought
[41:07.860 --> 41:13.260]  everybody had great loving strong dedicated parents I didn't realize how
[41:13.260 --> 41:19.420]  good my family was how good my grandparents were on both sides real
[41:19.420 --> 41:23.660]  Christian families you know going back hundreds of years to the Mayflower and a
[41:23.660 --> 41:28.780]  Europe I never realized how good I had it and now I really feel sad for people
[41:28.780 --> 41:33.460]  who don't understand love who don't understand honor that don't understand
[41:33.460 --> 41:40.900]  strength who don't understand decency and it really makes me sad and I realize
[41:40.900 --> 41:45.860]  that good people are blind to evil I've never been perfect and I've had my own
[41:45.860 --> 41:49.740]  dark side but at least I could recognize it a lot of people can't
[41:49.740 --> 41:54.660]  recognize it and they're driven by envy and by jealousy and by hyper
[41:54.660 --> 41:59.660]  competitiveness and they're so unhappy and they feel unfulfilled and they're
[41:59.660 --> 42:04.380]  angry at others they don't like seeing other people do well they don't admire
[42:04.380 --> 42:09.380]  success that's been gained through hard work they don't admire beauty they don't
[42:09.380 --> 42:15.900]  admire power that's that's that's good and wholesome and when you understand the
[42:15.900 --> 42:22.380]  globalist mindset it's the ultimate expression of oppression it's the
[42:22.380 --> 42:30.060]  ultimate expression of greediness and envy and control freakism and and now I
[42:30.060 --> 42:35.740]  understand a lot more so many people I've tried to build up so many people I've
[42:35.740 --> 42:39.300]  tried to lift up so many people that I've seen that have been articulate and
[42:39.300 --> 42:43.620]  well-spoken and intelligent that I've tried to build up I'd say over 80% of
[42:43.620 --> 42:48.940]  the time end up stabbing me in the back lying about us doing horrible things and
[42:48.940 --> 42:58.460]  it's because they realize just how effective and far-reaching we are I have
[42:58.460 --> 43:03.940]  always been humble and in the last decade I've really underestimated our
[43:03.940 --> 43:09.100]  reach I've really tried to lie to myself because I don't want fame and
[43:09.100 --> 43:13.460]  fortune it's one of the few things that I'm actually afraid of I understand the
[43:13.460 --> 43:21.340]  dangers of it historically I'm a humble person a private person and I've been
[43:21.340 --> 43:27.940]  public I've been involved against tyranny because I want freedom for my
[43:27.940 --> 43:31.660]  family and I want freedom for others and I want others to not be under bondage
[43:31.660 --> 43:35.860]  when I see someone else being oppressed when I see someone else being abused I
[43:35.860 --> 43:40.860]  empathize with them I feel their pain to use a Bill Clinton line at a primitive
[43:40.860 --> 43:46.300]  level I understand what's happening to other innocence will then end up
[43:46.300 --> 43:51.660]  happening to my family and I'm threatened by it but I have to tell you
[43:51.660 --> 43:57.980]  that I have not really announced to the listenership of this radio broadcast our
[43:57.980 --> 44:08.780]  analysis and our breakdown and it's such a weight of just how big this radio show
[44:08.780 --> 44:15.500]  is just how big our films are just how effective and trailblazing and
[44:15.500 --> 44:24.820]  exponentially viral info wars.com and prismplanet.com are it's indescribable
[44:24.820 --> 44:29.860]  everyone I talked to family and other cities and other countries people I've
[44:29.860 --> 44:34.260]  known over the years that work in television and in Hollywood producers
[44:34.260 --> 44:41.660]  directors graphics people you name it they say now that not only are people
[44:41.660 --> 44:46.500]  talking about info wars.com and prismplanet.com everyone I talked to in
[44:46.500 --> 44:52.540]  Hollywood in government in media at Fox News you name it all tell me the same
[44:52.540 --> 45:00.140]  thing all they're talking about is this show of course all the other so-called
[45:00.140 --> 45:05.780]  patriots are pulling their hair out in anger and jealousy and disgust because
[45:05.780 --> 45:10.380]  all they hear about is Alex Jones all they hear about is info wars.com and
[45:10.380 --> 45:16.020]  they think that it's a detriment to them they think it's somehow holding them
[45:16.020 --> 45:22.260]  back from some type of celebrity that they want they haven't gotten celebrity
[45:22.260 --> 45:27.300]  because they weren't pure of heart I don't want it so I got it I wanted to
[45:27.300 --> 45:33.220]  fight tyranny I wanted to affect change I wanted to stop the CPS taking over a
[45:33.220 --> 45:36.780]  million innocent children abusing them and doing horrible things every year
[45:36.780 --> 45:40.740]  without due process I want to stop people being brain damaged and killed
[45:40.740 --> 45:44.220]  from the next round of flu shots I want to bring the Federal Reserve to
[45:44.220 --> 45:48.620]  justice I want to stop these illegal wars I got into this because they were
[45:48.620 --> 45:53.940]  trying to take our guns in Texas I never intended to do what we've done
[45:53.940 --> 46:01.260]  together we're all in great danger we need to not let the co-intel pro
[46:01.260 --> 46:06.180]  manipulators get us to end fight with each other we need to grow up and
[46:06.180 --> 46:10.860]  transcend this and all the people that are so incredibly jealous of me and the
[46:10.860 --> 46:18.980]  work we do here it's so pointless don't they understand that even if they're
[46:18.980 --> 46:24.620]  just in this for the wrong reasons that we are if you look at it from a
[46:24.620 --> 46:29.420]  business perspective building the market we are waking people up we are
[46:29.420 --> 46:34.180]  creating the liberty movement myself my crew and the listeners that's our real
[46:34.180 --> 46:42.140]  power don't you understand that that that it's not a some set game that we
[46:42.140 --> 46:46.700]  need to wake people up to the paradigm of liberty versus tyranny and this is
[46:46.700 --> 46:51.660]  about survival and that you look at it from a business perspective and that's
[46:51.660 --> 46:58.060]  not what it is but even if you look at it from that perspective we are building
[46:58.060 --> 47:03.300]  the entire market for you don't you understand that if I hadn't been here
[47:03.300 --> 47:07.340]  and done the things I've done and reached out to people that you wouldn't
[47:07.340 --> 47:11.340]  have one-tenth of the viewers or listeners or readers that you have now
[47:11.340 --> 47:23.500]  most these people admit that I woke them up or I inspired them and they still
[47:23.500 --> 47:27.660]  attack me and they do it and it doesn't hurt us it actually only makes us
[47:27.660 --> 47:32.300]  bigger but but but it actually taints the overall transmission of the liberty
[47:32.300 --> 47:37.060]  movement sending out to make it all about Alex Jones that's destructive this
[47:37.060 --> 47:42.020]  is serious even if I was the worst guy in the world which isn't true you should
[47:42.020 --> 47:46.300]  be spending your time warning people about the vaccines about the fluoride
[47:46.300 --> 47:51.300]  about the mercury about the GMO about the new wars that the system wants to
[47:51.300 --> 47:56.660]  push we don't want the entire liberty movement to be about people defending
[47:56.660 --> 48:00.820]  Alex Jones or people attacking Alex Jones at the end of the day at a
[48:00.820 --> 48:06.980]  worldly level it's good for me do you understand that you know what was the
[48:06.980 --> 48:09.820]  famous saying I don't care what you say about me just get my name spelled right
[48:09.820 --> 48:15.380]  well yeah if I was coming at this from a worldly perspective I would be for what
[48:15.380 --> 48:22.060]  you're doing but I'm not because I want you to be more I want to be more I'm
[48:22.060 --> 48:27.380]  not perfect but I want you to be pure of heart I want you to be strong I want you
[48:27.380 --> 48:29.940]  to be winners I want you to be effective I don't want you to get
[48:29.940 --> 48:35.740]  manipulated by Hal Turner and hundreds of other operatives I want you to be
[48:35.740 --> 48:41.220]  leaders I want you to be what you really were born to be not a loser not a
[48:41.220 --> 48:46.180]  pathetic jealous envious person you know it was pointed out to me last night
[48:46.180 --> 48:52.780]  that mr. Bellamy amuse one of the top three bands in the world right now
[48:52.780 --> 48:59.220]  everything they put outcomes out triple platinum and the globalist are trying to
[48:59.220 --> 49:03.700]  co-op them right now mr. Bellamy's been on the show before that on their main
[49:03.700 --> 49:09.180]  official site they say website
[49:12.100 --> 49:17.460]  websites that are the red pill and the links on their official sites are info
[49:17.460 --> 49:22.300]  wars.com prison planet.com and propaganda matrix Paul Watson's mirror of
[49:22.300 --> 49:34.060]  prison planet it's amazing it's amazing and I salute their music and their call
[49:34.060 --> 49:38.820]  to stand up against tyranny it's powerful I salute the Foo Fighters who we
[49:38.820 --> 49:43.020]  know are patriots I salute this this indicator and it's the same thing a
[49:43.020 --> 49:48.860]  week and a half ago Jesse Ventura who I was instrumental in waking up to a
[49:48.860 --> 49:52.820]  great extent he came to town to visit with me as part of an investigation
[49:52.820 --> 49:57.260]  we're doing and he said in the car with Aaron and I riding around going to a
[49:57.260 --> 50:02.940]  place we were investigating he said Alex you know I get a bigger response on
[50:02.940 --> 50:10.540]  your show than I get anywhere else including Larry King live what does that
[50:10.540 --> 50:16.340]  say it says we're effective it says that we're bigger than when he goes on good
[50:16.340 --> 50:22.940]  morning America Fox News CNN he gets a bigger response on the streets wherever
[50:22.940 --> 50:28.740]  he is in the world from this show that tells you how important this broadcast
[50:28.740 --> 50:32.540]  is and that tells you why the Southern Poverty Law Center put out three
[50:32.540 --> 50:36.940]  reports viciously attacking me last Friday that tells you why the national

[54:44.180 --> 54:49.940]  are so far down the rat hole on this and we become a decadent wicked society so
[54:49.940 --> 54:54.300]  even when a lot of people wake up to the New World Order they're still not going
[54:54.300 --> 54:58.780]  to you know fully wake up to how to fight it and so the main focus needs to
[54:58.780 --> 55:03.460]  be waking more people up and organizing the local governments and the counties
[55:03.460 --> 55:08.500]  and the states to say no to the New World Order but dealing with the huge
[55:08.500 --> 55:14.540]  awakening on every front I mean we put out special prison planet TV videos
[55:14.540 --> 55:17.660]  every week to then get posted to YouTube and on average they get about a half
[55:17.660 --> 55:21.980]  million views we're getting over a million views on one YouTube channel a
[55:21.980 --> 55:25.460]  week and it's growing we have eight YouTube channels there are hundreds of
[55:25.460 --> 55:29.500]  others and hundreds of other websites carrying it and video sites we are
[55:29.500 --> 55:34.820]  reaching millions of new people every single week on the web alone we reach
[55:34.820 --> 55:38.900]  tens of millions a week through the radio show and through the interviews I do
[55:38.900 --> 55:43.300]  and the message is strong and it's scaring the establishment now there's a
[55:43.300 --> 55:47.620]  sophisticated article that covers a lot of facets that Paul Watson and I wrote
[55:47.620 --> 55:50.540]  this morning he called me said what do you want me to do about this I said yes
[55:50.540 --> 55:54.580]  I was aware of it I'd forgotten to talk about it I confirmed because I do have
[55:54.580 --> 55:59.460]  the book I haven't read at all that this is what it deals with and early on in
[55:59.460 --> 56:04.820]  the book a patriot leader who has videos on YouTube and has an internet radio
[56:04.820 --> 56:09.380]  show gets a Mayak report from the police and exposes that the government is
[56:09.380 --> 56:14.340]  trying to destroy the country from within and staging terror attacks now
[56:14.340 --> 56:18.140]  remember Beck attacks everybody that talks about government sponsored terror
[56:18.140 --> 56:22.900]  but he has the number one New York Times best-selling book the Overton window
[56:22.900 --> 56:32.100]  where the hero of the book is Daniel Bailey who is a internet video person
[56:32.100 --> 56:37.620]  who gets the Mayak report from Missouri and he goes on to say this is really
[56:37.620 --> 56:45.460]  nonfiction wrapped in a fiction and he coins a term to deal with that and my
[56:45.460 --> 56:49.500]  issue here is I haven't talked about this because I don't want to reveal our
[56:49.500 --> 56:57.340]  sources but I have two sources deep inside Fox News at the highest levels and
[56:57.340 --> 57:02.100]  I have another source who talked about how Rick Perry privately at a meeting
[57:02.100 --> 57:06.380]  said you don't need to go on his show we're worried about him taking over the
[57:06.380 --> 57:09.860]  Republican Party as if I'm gonna take over the Republican Party well they
[57:09.860 --> 57:16.140]  mean the ideas I'm putting out and that's in Newsmax today if true patriots
[57:16.140 --> 57:19.780]  can take over the Republican Party and the Democrats there's no way the
[57:19.780 --> 57:25.060]  globalist can win real anti-encompassing is now happening and that's my
[57:25.060 --> 57:30.340]  bottom line on back what he's doing is he's coming in as the counterfeit Alex
[57:30.340 --> 57:36.740]  Jones and I have this from people in Fox News he has five people who listen to
[57:36.740 --> 57:41.580]  the show every day track everything we do that's why when you hear us with a
[57:41.580 --> 57:45.180]  gas you hear it there two weeks later or a topic but he puts a spin on it and
[57:45.180 --> 57:49.820]  that's fine but the problem is Beck has shown that he gets people's confidence
[57:49.820 --> 57:53.660]  and then dashes it there are no FEMA camps there's no government sponsored
[57:53.660 --> 57:58.660]  terror you know the Mayak reports not that bad but then he writes a book about
[57:58.660 --> 58:04.300]  government sponsored terror in which I get killed stopping the government from
[58:04.300 --> 58:08.380]  detonating a hydrogen bomb in Los Angeles if there's a private global
[58:08.380 --> 58:12.580]  corporation Bilderberg group manipulating things in the book I'm gonna
[58:12.580 --> 58:15.700]  finish up with this in the next segment then we're gonna go to Webster Griffin
[58:15.700 --> 58:19.700]  Tarpley but the point is well the article breaks it down I'll try to read
[58:19.700 --> 58:23.980]  much of the article when we come back over the 72nd break it's just that we
[58:23.980 --> 58:30.100]  are having a huge cultural effect you and I together and it's so precious and
[58:30.100 --> 58:35.220]  the system is is attacking at every level trying to co-opt trying to destroy

[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:35.580]  I'll talk more about this but I've now had a chance to read part of it Watson
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.660]  scanned over it we've confirmed his number one New York Times best-selling
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:47.780]  book the Overton window is basically about yours truly and it just details
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:53.100]  it all government sponsored terror world government America destroyed by design
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:01:01.300]  I've separately confirmed that top Fox News personalities have been told by
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.740]  Glenn Beck do not go on Alex Jones's show same thing with Rick Perry this is
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.740]  from two different people and that they have a team of five people they're
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:16.540]  listening right now that listen and record every word I'm saying at Fox
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.580]  Center in New York and they take everything I do and then twist it to be
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.980]  a Republican oid version see I'm popular with the false left and the right
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.620]  we're shattering those paradigms and they claim they're doing some of that as
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:35.220]  they then re-invoke it and so literally Glenn Beck is the counterfeit and now
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.940]  I hope Glenn Beck's a good person deep down he's a talented smart guy and I'm
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:44.100]  not even trying to attacking the Paul Watson and I this morning put this
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:49.580]  article together it's very well written by Watson you know we conferred while he
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.820]  was writing it over the phone so it has his thoughts and my thoughts in it but
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.020]  I concur with his views and it's very important it says Glenn Beck channels
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:03.100]  Alex Jones in New York Times best-selling book and he goes on to say one of the
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:08.260]  primary characters in Glenn Beck's New York Times best-seller novel the
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.180]  Overton window is blatantly a caricature of our own Alex Jones according to a
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.680]  reader and we've also confirmed this who sent us his book review Jones's
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.940]  fictionalized as Daniel Bailey and of course Beck is having all these ghosts
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.860]  written you know doing a radio show and TV show every day these are all you know
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.340]  a new book every six months they're being ghostwritten I mean he's putting
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:32.440]  input into it but it's it's got ghost writers according to a reader who sent us
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.700]  the review of the book Jones is fictionalized as Daniel Bailey the
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.820]  Patriot I'm sure of the ghost writers a fan because I mean I'm in a great light
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.380]  in the book the Patriot movement leader who tries to prevent the US government
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:48.460]  from carrying out false flag terror attacks on Los Angeles now remember
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.820]  Beck says none of this exists and at the end of the book he says well I said
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.460]  this really wasn't fiction it was fiction you know covering up for real
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:02.640]  things but there is no false flag terror and there are no FEMA camps so Beck
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.340]  read it what his ghostwriter wrote and said you better add this at the end so
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.660]  they're going after our audience of awake people but they're giving them a
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.180]  fictionalized version of it Beck describes his book as a work of fiction
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:20.420]  faction as he calls it fiction based on facts and accordingly many of the
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.380]  characters in the novel are people plucked from the real world with only
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:27.740]  their names changed the novels plot centers around an evil public relations
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.460]  firm that works with Homeland Security and the CIA to collapse America from
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.540]  within Beck has put a book out about the truth but it's fiction an
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.340]  unprecedented attack this is a quote on US soil shakes the country to the core
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:43.940]  and puts in motion a frightening plan decades in the making to transform
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.460]  America and demonize all those who stand in its way amidst the chaos many
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.580]  don't know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:56.380]  are more important the side of the fight and which side they're fighting for
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:01.580]  states the amazon.com promo for the book the character of Daniel Bailey could
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.220]  merely be considered to be a construct of different people Alex Jones amongst
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:15.540]  them unless it was for a very specific detail contained in the plot that is a
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.620]  giveaway as of the fact that Beck based the character on Jones the book begins
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.940]  this is from Amazon with a meeting between PR firm and members of Homeland
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.300]  Security trying to squash the leak of a Mayak report that we released on record
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.860]  major newspapers admit that the PR firm boasts that they have successfully
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.620]  prevented the Washington Post from publishing the story unbeknownst the PR
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:43.260]  firm there is a patriot mole amongst them and she leaks the Mayak report to
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:49.180]  Bailey Alex Jones and he exposes it widely attended Patriot meeting the
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.540]  Mayak report was a real document put out by the Missouri Information Analysis

[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.820]  the GCN radio network just a few minutes we're going to Webster Griffin
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:23.980]  partly for the balance of the hour historian and economist talk about the
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.740]  situation with Iran all the new developments on that front with the
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.060]  Knesset coming out this weekend saying they are preparing to strike Iran but
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:35.220]  finishing up with this article Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones and New York
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.100]  Times best-selling book we have the book haven't finished it yet but it's
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.900]  confirmed what the Amazon review and other reviews are saying that's basically
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:49.440]  channeling yours truly with this patriot YouTube host who gets the
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.140]  Mike report and releases it to the public that patriots conservatives gun
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.660]  owners returning veterans are being targeted by Homeland Security there's
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:02.180]  a secret government plan to stage terror attacks to set up a police state and to
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.060]  economically implode the country by design but then at the end of the book
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:12.020]  which was clearly ghost written for Beck he then goes on to say oh whereas I
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:18.460]  said this was faction nonfiction hidden in fiction still I don't believe in
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.980]  FEMA camps of the government staging terror so we see the schizophrenia of
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:28.660]  Beck through this it goes on the mic report was originally leaked to Alex
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:33.340]  Jones by anonymous Missouri police officer and the book mirrors that just
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:38.060]  changes my name to Bailey Alex Jones was the source of the story after he had
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.300]  obtained the document from a whistleblower mirroring almost precisely
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:46.180]  the plot in Beck's book this ally with almost every other fact and fasted of the
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:50.700]  characters involvement the story including the fact that Bailey is depicted
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:54.860]  as the father of the radical patriot movement while a wide following of his
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.540]  videos on the internet strongly indicates that Daniel Bailey is none of
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.220]  the now looks Jones according to Clarkson the patriot movement along with
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.740]  Daniel Bailey are portrayed by Beck in a positive light throughout the book and
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:10.020]  indeed Bailey becomes the hero of the story when he sacrifices himself to
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.260]  prevent the government from setting off a nuclear device in Los Angeles by
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:16.700]  detonating the bomb in the desert so it's back trying to wink wink tell people
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.780]  he's really a patriot is for real this also borrows heavily from a plot
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:26.060]  focused around the character of Jack Bauer in this TV drama series 24
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.980]  however perhaps the biggest quiz contained in the book does not occur
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.940]  during the course of the actual story itself but as an afterward in which Beck
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.340]  completely distances himself from the notion that any of the material is
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.300]  accurate but the first the book he says it's faction which is real fiction
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:47.580]  despite him describing the book as a work of faction in the afterward of the
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.100]  book he makes a feeble attempt to discredit some of the damning info in
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.620]  the book like 7-7 being staged and the drill they're running that day he
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.300]  dismisses the 7-7 war games as a coincidence he also dismisses the
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.420]  army's advertisement for internment and resettlement specialists by citing our
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.060]  armed forces mission of bringing democracy to foreign lands but they
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:11.020]  admit it's also for domestic such as Iraq and Afghanistan he dismisses the
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:16.140]  fact that such policies will be used here and our homeland continuing we're
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:21.100]  going to tarply so why does it matter that a caricature of Alex Jones is one
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.740]  of the many players in Glenn Beck's new book primarily it goes to show that
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:30.020]  Alex and his message via your activism is now firmly woven in the fabric of
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.980]  American political discourse Beck has an audience of millions and wheels of
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:37.820]  significant albeit somewhat declining influence on the body politics according
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.460]  to his ratings numbers secondarily it is again highlights the baffling
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.780]  disconnect between Beck's own accurate and compelling message that a new world
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.540]  order is trying to destroy America within and its contradictory debunking of
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:55.060]  the issues that form that assessment FEMA camps false flag terror and a
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:12:00.420]  multitude of other facets of the new world order agenda is Beck a genuinely
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.340]  concerned patriot who is just afraid of losing his media platform if he goes all
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:10.940]  the way is he merely an opportunist out to make money from paranoia in the obvious
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:15.140]  and real collapse of America or is he a pied piper gaining trust from the
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:20.140]  patriot movement by putting out a good message only later we demonstrate we
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.220]  have been told by several highly placed incredible sources at Fox News that Beck
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:28.700]  has a team of researchers his primary role is to listen to Alex and read Alex's
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.860]  material from his radio shows and websites this obviously suggests that
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.460]  Beck and Fox News are obsessed with Jones material because they are trying to
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:41.380]  gain the trust of Jones growing audience in an effort to exalt Beck as a Jones
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:46.060]  counterfeit and misdirect the patriot movement the fact that Beck has
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:51.220]  constantly attacked by the establishment left only increases his credibility
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.460]  amongst conservatives just like right-wing attacks on Obama is the
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:13:01.820]  only thing that bolsters him continuing with world government advancing as the
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.700]  economy goes into meltdown Americans are waking up to the new world order
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:08.260]  agenda in droves thanks in part to Alex Jones the work of his info orders
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.380]  worldwide the only way Glenn Beck can stay relevant is to identify with these
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:16.980]  people by mixing in some truth of this message Beck puts out the information in
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.700]  a fictional context and then adds a disclaimer at the end in order to
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.020]  psychologically inoculate people against the fact that everything he talks
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.580]  about in the book is really happening this revelation of the method technique
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:31.500]  allows him to gain the trust of his audience and then steer them in the
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.020]  direction he wants from everything we've seen it appears as though Beck is
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.060]  trying to sit on both sides of the fence at the same time and in doing so is
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:43.460]  playing a very dangerous game with his masters at Fox News we need to link to
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:49.740]  the Hal Turner set up stories about how he got set up to point that out to Beck
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.740]  we all choose sides in life this is the key we all choose sides in life and
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:01.260]  whatever the truth really is surrounding Beck's motivations we hope for his
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:07.860]  sake that he has chosen the right side and then we have a review another
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.700]  review of the book by someone else underneath that we appreciate them
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:16.140]  giving us that tip I got the book in a bookstore a few weeks ago and hadn't
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.300]  I've scanned over it and seen what you're talking about and just couldn't
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.580]  believe it through it on the desk at my house and never really got into it on
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.820]  air it's just too bizarre but we're seeing this everywhere ladies and gentlemen
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:32.940]  and before we get into Iran before we get into the economy Webster Tarpley I
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.460]  want to get his view on the article I just read and why he thinks Glenn Beck
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.700]  is doing this what do you think's going on Webster well Alex I haven't really
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.540]  seen this article that you're talking about but I can tell you a few things
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:51.140]  about Glenn Beck in general and maybe draw some historical parallels I think
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.020]  the most important thing you have to say about Glenn Beck is that he's a
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.420]  scoundrel and I don't normally start off with insults but that's if you don't
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:06.500]  establish the fact that he's an unprincipled scoundrel and really this
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.060]  is really deplorable what this guy does on television he's obviously a creature
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:17.380]  of Rupert Murdoch in other words this reactionary quasi-fascist Australian
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:22.340]  millionaire who's taken over this you know Fox News Empire and his friend there
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:27.700]  Roger Ailes who has credentials going back to the the Nixon campaign and even
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:32.780]  to the campaigns of Bush the Elder in Texas and elsewhere they're the
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:38.660]  ones who put Glenn Beck on the air now if you go back to the 1930s you had
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:43.820]  similar figures right you had this guy father Coglan the radio priest and the
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:48.180]  message from father Coglan the radio priest was that basically Hitler was
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:52.620]  was not as bad as you thought Hitler was really a good guy the main enemy was
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:59.020]  Stalin so he had a whole demagogic thing around this Glenn Beck is an
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:03.140]  eclectic in other words what he's looking for is what I would call the
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:08.340]  demagogic synthesis of a whole bunch of elements and you're very right to say
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:13.580]  and in my terminology his job is to co-opt in other words he's got to take
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.460]  forms of political ferment you know people in motion people who are upset
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:23.140]  about Obama he's got to convoy them back ultimately to the Republican Party
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.060]  that's what he's that's his task he's got to co-opt them he's got to do them
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:31.660]  he's got to manipulate them and then you look at what he what he offers this
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:35.820]  whole format with the chalkboard and the professorial lecture and all these
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:41.540]  things the guy's profoundly ignorant he doesn't know anything he's basically an
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.900]  alcoholic with with intellectual pretension right a dry drunk in many
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:50.500]  ways similar to bush the younger same kind of personality he's obviously a
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.060]  narcissist he's got a lot in common with the with Obama from that point of
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:58.460]  view but it's interesting that that somebody in this kind of a slot right
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:02.900]  daytime television four or five o'clock would normally not be offering you
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:08.260]  opinions about Woodrow Wilson or William McKinley or they were they had a
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.460]  program lately in praise of Calvin Coolidge of all people with with an
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:17.140]  activist from the council on foreign relations this calamity slays was there
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:21.260]  to tell you how great Calvin Coolidge was normally these are topics that you
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:26.500]  don't get on daytime television but he feels the need to go into this and you
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.180]  see that this is to get to departure from normal American politics well that's
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:35.460]  because the internet and this show is raising all of these real issues and
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:40.460]  and putting it in a proper historical perspective and so they're now forced to
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.020]  basically cover this and they're getting top ratings by doing it so I mean
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:47.620]  bottom line Rupert Murdoch wants to steer and control this he sees it as a
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.300]  as a lucrative market and but I mean to have Beck write a book about false flag
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:58.700]  terror 7 7 being staged the Mayak report an Alex Jones character and then to say
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:03.700]  none of this is real at the end but to say it's real at the first very bizarre
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:08.300]  it's it's I think it's simply designed to confuse people it's to make people
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.740]  think that they've learned something when again I haven't read this book and I
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:16.540]  don't know the article you're referring to to confuse them listen Alex I have
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.500]  I have some stuff going on with me too if you listen to Rush Limbaugh these days
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:26.300]  he says regime regime regime the Obama regime the Obama regime this is more
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:29.860]  or less the language I've been using for three or four years and today I heard
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.060]  Limbaugh came out with one of my signature terms which is reactionary
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:38.420]  right this is something you don't usually hear in the United States normally
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.700]  these people they call themselves conservatives they're not conservatives
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:45.860]  they're reactionaries that would be Glenn Beck but Limbaugh says there are
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.780]  reactionary leftists or leftist reactionaries running around it's it's
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.100]  very interesting he takes a kind of a trope right he takes an element of
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:59.300]  rhetoric and he redirects it right he he turns you know we know Limbaugh uses
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.860]  prisonplanet.com articles all the time and now the drudge report is linking
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.300]  to our Dr. Paul Craig Roberts articles I mean it's just our information is
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:13.460]  everywhere and so the system is trying to gauge it and trying to color
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:18.940]  themselves like us camouflage themselves so they can pose as anti-establishment

[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:15.180]  article that Matt Ryan's written that just went up at info wars dot com where
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:19.780]  a black construction worker wasn't even a Muslim he was working at ground zero
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.940]  and this crowd saw him and chased him screaming get out of here Muslim he's
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.020]  like I'm not a Muslim is he was even wearing an American flag and they
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:29.940]  chased him getting very close to something out of Nazi Germany where they
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:34.380]  first wouldn't let Jews have businesses and would chase them off the streets and
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:40.780]  they're hyping all this up now right at the time oh Matt Ryan add to your story
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:46.460]  Steve Watson's article about Muslim Imam is globalist dudes trilateral
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:52.340]  Commission CFR top globalist it turns out the co-owner of Fox News this is
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:58.860]  Associated Press and Yahoo is this is so incredible is is actually the main
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.500]  contributor to the mosque and now some black guy or an American flag shirt
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.020]  comes walking out of ground zero where he's working and they see him and start
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.940]  chasing him around I mean this is incredible what they're doing Webster
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:17.620]  I want to get into Iran but clearly this builds up towards that hysteria we've
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.900]  got this key article by Steve Watson that I covered some Friday and Sunday that
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:28.380]  guys reprint that for me I know it's in the stack but headline ground zero mosque
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.580]  Imam globalist stooge and it details how he's a top globalist I mean Webster we
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:37.020]  can really see what's happening here but even more directly this this is a
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:42.660]  Imam of Faisal Raouf and it turns out that he's from the FBI he works for the
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:47.780]  FBI he's a trainer for the FBI he's an advisor for the FBI he has worked for
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.600]  Bush the younger in that administration he's a current employee of the State
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.620]  Department now this is what we would call in very poor terms a government
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:26:00.540]  agent and he's out there as an FBI provocateur doing his job which is to
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:05.180]  provoke and now instead of having we could have about 95 percent of this
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:10.260]  population marching against Wall Street and saying down with the banks claw back
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:15.060]  the bailouts you know stop you know lower the credit card rates no more payday
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:18.900]  loans you could get about 95 percent of the American people for that instead
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:23.940]  we've got these you know 60 40 70 30 things we've got the New York mosque we've
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:28.500]  got the Arizona illegal alien situation and of course gay marriage in
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:34.100]  California coming right on the heels of the Shirley Sherrod doctored tape so
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.340]  what does this mean that no serious economic issue none of the life or
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:44.100]  death economic questions of jobs employment wages the thing that the
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.780]  people really live or die by that is all swept aside so we're having a summer of
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:54.100]  total programmed insanity right of MK ultra running wild if you will through
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:58.620]  all the mass media and I urge people when you see a dog and pony show like
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:03.660]  this have the brains not to choose sides you know when you see the you know the
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:08.580]  Yankees playing you the the you know whatever it is the other team right in
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.820]  the in the world series it's hard not to get sucked in right you want to choose
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:17.020]  sides and become a fan for one side in this case don't do it because this is
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:21.340]  this is simply a way to prepare these elections I think it shows that the
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:25.900]  ruling elite is in the process of switching their bets from the sinking
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:31.580]  ship of Obama to some demagogic reactionary Republican maybe it's
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.940]  Mitt Romney but I think much more like the general Petraeus waiting in the
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:42.260]  wings as the new version of you know whatever oppression is coming down
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:46.620]  notice we now have the ADL saying no to the mosque I mean this is like right out
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:50.100]  of Nazi Germany what they're doing yeah the thing with the mosque is obviously
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.260]  if you want to make a gesture of reconciliation that's a wonderful thing
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.980]  but unfortunately it this is not turning out to be a gesture of
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:00.820]  reconciliation so I would think that it it's time really to deemphasize this
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.940]  plus everybody's arguing about something that strictly speaking doesn't exist
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:10.620]  there is no mosque there really is even one more building has to be bought well
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.340]  it's a first amendment issue and it's a property right issue and the fact that
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.380]  this guy's hooked in with the FBI State Department Trilateral Commission CFR
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:23.500]  and being funded by the owner of Fox News I mean that's incredible yeah but
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:27.060]  again it doesn't exist they don't they don't have the money to do this they
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.460]  have to buy another piece of property then they have to build that this thing
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.380]  is years and years in the future if at all I don't it's a perfect psychological
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:44.300]  distraction to create the primitive you know animal brainstem threat that
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:49.460]  oh my gosh the foreigners that did 9-11 they've now come to plant their flag at
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:55.580]  ground zero it's it's a propaganda image like Iwo Jima with the troops raising
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.740]  the flag it's that snapshot image something like that and remember these
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:05.220]  are the wedge issues right the hot button social issues that pit one
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:09.060]  significant part of the US population against another part right the gaze
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:13.900]  against the straits the Islamic population against the rest of them or
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:19.540]  the leftist joining in on on the side of the the mosque and so on and so on it
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.380]  just it never ends right the the the nativists against the Hispanic
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:28.780]  immigrants and Wall Street laughs all the way to the bank because no no attacks
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.740]  on Wall Street have been heard for the last 30 or 60 days stay there I want to
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.300]  come back and get into Iran Webster that's why you're here and then the

[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:35.420]  in full gear to promote an attack on Iran they fueled the Bashir peaceful
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:40.860]  reactor it would take them five years according to the UN itself to get enough
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:45.380]  uranium out of these rods to build a weapon but under contract the Russians
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:49.100]  are running the facility and they're going to take that you know those spent
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:54.220]  fuel rods and the waste from the plant away the Iranians last week offered the
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:59.020]  US to come build it and run it they offered for Turkey and Brazil to do it
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.340]  it's all coming up because now Israeli Kinesit member declares we are
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:07.980]  preparing for war and we're seeing similar statements out of one of the
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:11.740]  globalist favorite organs it came out last week and declassified Senate
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:17.220]  documents that one of the main newspapers magazines paid off illegally by
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:21.700]  the Israelis that paid cash I was Atlantic monthly decades ago and it's
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.220]  now Atlantic monthly again putting out the latest you know why Israel's
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:30.700]  preparing to attack Iran and and what it means to you so that's coming up with

[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:24.580]  you the floor who the interest are you know this new fake Iraq pull down where
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:28.820]  they admit they've just renamed the names of the battle brigades increase the
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:33.540]  private security firms in a model of control they want the US with the top
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.460]  secret USA system now we've got them building towards an Iran strike saying
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.220]  they've got to do it they said two weeks ago or week and a half ago they had to
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:46.540]  hit Iran before they fueled the reactor because if they hit it went once the
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:52.700]  rods Iran it could cause a Chernobyl all of this on the heels of toxic legacy of
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:57.820]  US assault on Fallujah worse than Hiroshima top scientists admit off the
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:02.260]  charts increases of deformities and deaths from the DUU's in Fallujah our
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:06.700]  troops that rolled in after the assault they're dying and having massive health
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:11.500]  problems now this is just incredible and now they want a whole new war so Webster
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:16.260]  break it all down for us and where your intel and research shows we're going well
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:21.420]  I guess first of all that that we've now got the the third anniversary of the
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:27.540]  rogue B-52 who remember this a road through B-52 strategic bomber with six
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:32.140]  nuclear-armed cruise missiles was essentially hijacked by the Cheney
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:36.660]  faction this rogue network again it's not the US government it's out of the
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:41.660]  control of the US government and into a Wall Street controlled network the one
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:45.340]  that Cheney happened to be the spokesman for there for a while but the Cheney
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.920]  may be gone but this thing goes on and on and you remember it went from North
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.180]  Dakota to Louisiana and then it was going to go on to the Middle East this
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:58.460]  was right before the September 7th Israeli air raid on Syria which according
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:02.380]  to the Israelis at least destroyed a nuclear reactor I'm still skeptical
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:07.060]  about that but you got to think about this the rogue B-52 and there never was
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:10.900]  a congressional investigation there's never been an accounting about this it
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.100]  was never an issue in the presidential election and I had called attention to
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.100]  this actually before the fact with that Kenny Bunkport warning which was issued
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:25.060]  about three years ago this month so that was the last time we were on the
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:30.260]  brink of war after that we had the December 2007 national intelligence
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:35.420]  estimate which said and this is the CIA we state with great confidence that Iran
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:42.580]  has no nuclear weapons program they had one up until 2003 but not anymore now
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:47.580]  all of that has changed and I would point to in particular the increased
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:53.100]  financial desperation of London and New York right they had been attempting now
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:58.340]  for the last year or so to stage a speculative attack on the euro they were
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:03.940]  attacking through the Greek bonds the Spanish Portuguese and other government
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:09.740]  bonds and they got a significant crisis going on that in April and May but then
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:15.860]  that attack has now broken down partly because of the German self-defense
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.380]  measures like Germany came forward and said we're banning naked credit default
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:25.380]  swaps we're banning naked shorts against German stocks and I think very
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:30.940]  important China supported the euro the Chinese were not prepared to see the
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:35.980]  US and the British destroy the euro so China came in and began buying up euro
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:40.780]  zone assets and that had the effect of supporting the euro so what we've had is
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.780]  an attempted blitzkrieg by the Anglo-Americans against the euro which
[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:49.940]  has now broken down the high point of this was around the flash crash remember
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:55.220]  the May 6th event when the Dow lost a thousand points in about 10 or 15 minutes
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:59.940]  take a look at that because if you look at what was happening in the currency
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:05.340]  world on the afternoon of the flash crash you'll see that the euro lost about 12
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:12.140]  American cents compared to a yen and that's a big a big dip it looks to me
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:18.580]  like the flash crash had something to do with a program trading high frequency
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:23.220]  trading attack on the euro but somehow boomerang they found that they were
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:27.380]  successfully driving down the euro but it was also destroying the New York stock
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:32.580]  market so they had to pull back as this thing exploded in their face so now it's
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:37.140]  essentially the blitzkrieg by the Anglo-Americans has failed and there's
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.780]  really for the last three months everything has been drifting sideways
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:45.580]  there's there's a possibility that it may now be the pound and the dollar that
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:50.900]  go down and the euro survives that there's certain strength in the euro that
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:56.180]  has been displayed over the last nine nine ten weeks but it's also possible
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:59.780]  that the end will be the big winner we may wake up one morning and find that
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:05.500]  the yen and the Chinese renminbi are standing and that the dollar and the
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:10.100]  euro have been locked in this conflict and they both go down together probably
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:14.580]  together with the with the pound anyway apart from the details this is the kind
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:19.340]  of situation that drives a financier ruling class absolutely berserk they
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:23.980]  go bonkers they freak out they go into these flight forward things and the
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:27.700]  idea is of course if you could start a war in the Middle East you can get the
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:32.860]  Iranians to block the streets of Hormuz and the Gulf and at that point the price
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:37.820]  of oil goes to 300 or 500 dollars a barrel or even higher and at that point
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.260]  the problem of the dollar for the moment is solved because there's huge demand
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:46.540]  for dollars if you multiply the price of oil by five or ten then you've
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.620]  multiplied demand for dollars by five or ten as long as the dollar is the
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.140]  posted price currency for oil which it still is so that's a really big thing
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:59.140]  the other things we've got going on the coming of Petraeus and that the increased
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:04.100]  power of the neocons there's a big freak out in the US-British diplomatic
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:08.340]  circles about what you just mentioned that Brazil and Turkey attempted to
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:12.620]  mediate the crisis there's also the fact that the weaponry that's being
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:18.380]  accumulated by Iran by Syria by Hezbollah and maybe even by Hamas is also
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:24.860]  building up so a conjuncture of you know five or ten different things coming
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:29.740]  together so we now have to say that there is a very acute danger and I would
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.940]  point to this statement about two weeks ago from Fidel Castro right the dictator
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:40.380]  of Cuba he's really the head of state he's the Comandante and Hefe he's not
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:44.220]  officially the head of state but really he is he runs Cuba even if it's from
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:48.420]  his from his sickbed so he called an emergency session of the Cuban parliament
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:54.220]  and said we're facing a situation of imminent nuclear war now some people
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.380]  would say well he's crazy or he's a communist but you have to think about
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:02.580]  the resources that he brings to the table he has an intelligence agency right
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:07.980]  it's the DGI the Dirección General de Informaciones and they have spies we
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:11.940]  just had a guy in the State Department and his wife who was put away I think for
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:17.500]  life after spending decades and decades buying for Cuba so Castro draws on
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:22.260]  internal knowledge of the you don't even need that they've turned the
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:28.020]  propaganda back on and are testing the public market testing for the attack
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.100]  saying they've got to do it and they've been building up the military forces and
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:37.260]  now he comes out and talks about a criminal global government and endorses
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:42.260]  a book saying it's a eugenics empire that controls the planet this is amazing
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:46.500]  yeah and remember it but what what goes on in public in other words when you get
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:50.260]  a member of the Likud who visits the United States and pops off in some
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:55.260]  warmonger bellicose vein you know that that may just be propaganda that just
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:59.420]  may be an attempt to you know to keep support going and to keep the Middle
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:03.420]  East conflict and the public eye and all that but again I think Castro is
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:07.500]  basing this on things that are from behind the scenes not just propaganda not
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.380]  just side war not just you know the attempt to to blackmail people with
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:15.820]  threats of war but real real war preparation now just in the past weekend
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:20.620]  people may be disoriented because Hillary Clinton came out and announced
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:24.740]  that we've got the resumption for the first time in nine years of the direct
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:29.780]  talks between the Israelis and the Palestinian authority of Abu Abbas Abu
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:36.620]  Mazen but of course this is probably the the weakest attempt at negotiations we
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.500]  have ever seen well they always try negotiation before a new war to say see
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:47.140]  we tried quite quite possibly and and the the thing is the Israelis did a a
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:52.300]  tank thrust into Gaza this past weekend so it's a very strange combination they
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.620]  also sent fighter aircraft into Lebanon and other areas over the weekend right
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:03.260]  so it doesn't look like it's it's very serious and if Netanyahu says he's
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:06.500]  gonna start building settlements again and if he does then these these talks
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:10.740]  will come to a very quick end now on the Iranian side we've had all sorts of
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:14.580]  things right they had a photo up where they displayed all these graves in the
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.860]  desert saying here Americans Israelis these are the graves for your soldiers
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:23.180]  they're now selling these attack drones the ambassador of death right the
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:26.940]  messenger of death that's the other one it can this can carry 500 pounds of
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:32.540]  warhead for a 650 mile range now that would necessarily have to operate from
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:36.940]  southern Lebanon from Syria or from someplace else if it if the target were
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:42.300]  we're going is the message that they put the messenger of death in Lebanon they
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:47.820]  they may well be because the what they put there for sure are these M600 short
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:51.500]  range ballistic missiles with guidance systems which actually can be used to
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:56.820]  target specific military targets so no longer counter value for his
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:02.940]  Bola no longer terror attacks on Israeli cities but now counter force attacks on
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:07.660]  the air bases where the Israeli Air Force operates in inside Israel that is
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:12.620]  very very scary that's the kind of thing that pushes the situation towards
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:19.020]  this desperation now the Bushir reactor this has gotten a lot of attention we
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:24.380]  there's a reactor interestingly that was begun about 30 years ago it was
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:29.340]  actually begun before Ayatollah Khomeini took over Iran and when Ayatollah
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:35.900]  Khomeini came in he shut down the entire nuclear program of Iran they would
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:40.100]  have had without Khomeini they would have had 10 or 15 functioning nuclear
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:44.580]  reactors plenty of nuclear power this whole thing would be a non-issue but
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:49.820]  Khomeini who was of course favored by Carter and Brzezinski right as their
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:55.420]  Islamic card against the Soviets as it turned out to be the Khomeini insisted
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:59.900]  on shutting down all this stuff so now we've got the Bushir reactor started I
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:05.380]  think by the German firm Siemens back in the very late 70s finally coming online
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:11.540]  with this time with Russian technology and Russian technicians we had Bolton
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:17.860]  this former UN ambassador of the neocons right of the Bush regime the
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:22.660]  younger saying that if you want to attack you've got to do that now in the
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:26.340]  next well when he said it seven or eight days it would basically be now in the
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:32.140]  next day or two but before the end of August and in the case because otherwise
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:37.820]  you're going to spread nuclear nuclear waste and nuclear debris the problem with
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.220]  that argument is it's absurd because if you're talking about bombing the
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.860]  Iranian nuclear program you're always going to be spreading nuclear debris
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:52.060]  by any attack on any nuclear facility be it centrifuges or uranium enrichment or
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:56.220]  whatever it is that's going to spread radioactive debris so there really is no
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:00.780]  basis to say even from these guys points of view that it has to be done now so
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:06.220]  what Bolton was trying to do was to get a new wave of hysteria and perhaps even
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:10.380]  act as a cover for an attack but that that may not happen but his deadline was
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:16.260]  always a fake deadline the deadlines go on and on doesn't it doesn't change so
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:25.460]  we then got this military situation and I think if you look back to the Lebanon
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:31.260]  War of four years ago remember that the Israelis fared very very badly in that
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:35.940]  war because they were confronting in those days Hezbollah armed with some
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:42.500]  fairly modern Soviet block and Russian equipment which were it was sufficient to
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:48.100]  destroy the vaunted Merkava tank that the Israelis had built up and were
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.660]  parading as an invincible war machine that that certainly didn't happen and
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:57.300]  now this time around you'd have to say Hezbollah has actually increased its
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:01.940]  armament with the help of Iran and with the help of Syria they have got in
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:07.580]  addition to these old-fashioned World War two style rockets the grad or the
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:12.740]  the Katyushka or whatever they are they've also got these handheld anti
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:16.860]  aircraft missiles like the Grail the Gremlin and the Grouse these are like
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.700]  the US stinger they can be used to shoot down airplanes and helicopters you
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:25.780]  know at flying at fairly low level well Webster so so the odds are being evened
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:29.380]  up here but but I have the question you know geopolitically from your research
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:35.980]  of the region if Israel actually went and did real peace talks would I ran
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:44.620]  ever stop arming Hezbollah and Hamas would they ever pull out of Gaza and
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.700]  other areas because if you look at it it just means which side do you take
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:54.180]  Israel wants to knock out Iran Iran wants to knock them out and and so from
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:58.900]  the Israeli perspective do they have any choice because I'm against these wars
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:02.420]  against World War three I don't like what Israel is doing I'm against it but
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:08.660]  I mean what is Israel's choice then if if they back down is there any chance the
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:14.100]  Arabs will back down I think the choice is a regional peace conference
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:19.900]  involving all states in the region and also certain non-state actors like
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:27.340]  Hezbollah or Hamas or others that that that act as a strategic force you
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.300]  mentioned this article in the Atlantic Monthly by Jeffrey Goldberg right this
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:38.660]  the idea that the Israeli attack on Iran is inevitable because Iran poses this
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:43.660]  existential life or death threat to Iran I would call your attention to an
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.060]  article by Trita Parsi he's a scholar in the field and his finding is that the
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:52.300]  Israeli leaders really don't believe that themselves but that this is a
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:56.300]  rhetorical stance that they've decided to take from the moment that Obama came
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.260]  into the White House stay there let's talk about when we come back what's
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:03.820]  your target hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.460]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.940]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.580]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.420]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:21.980]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of

[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:15.740]  Virgil will Ron Ronnie and others that are patiently holding but finishing up
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:21.380]  with Webster you were getting into Jeffrey Goldberg the Israeli asset and
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:24.820]  he's been all over MPR you name it promoting it's sad but it's a foregone
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:29.500]  conclusion we've got to do it because they're gonna nuke us if we don't and
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:33.340]  Israel's gonna do it but you're saying that that's just talk what's behind that
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:36.860]  I think it's propaganda it's the kind of talk that can lead to tragic
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:41.580]  consequences you had this guy treat a Parsi who is a fairly mainline academic
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:46.460]  he's obviously of Iranian background so he essentially has assembled a book
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:52.660]  about secret negotiations among Iran Israel the United States and he points
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:56.740]  to the fact that a good barack to be the former well the current defense
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:02.420]  minister of Israel tells the Israeli newspaper yeti of Aronauth September
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:08.900]  2009 so less than a year ago quote I am not among those who believe that Iran is
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:14.140]  an existential issue for Israel then we have the foreign minister of Israel in
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:19.860]  the previous government to believe me argues according to Haaretz in private
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:25.980]  that a nuclear Iran is not a an existential threat to Israel the art
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:29.220]  this guy himself treated Parsi says he talked to the former head of the
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:35.740]  Mossad Efraim Halevi and Halevi says the idea that Iran can destroy Israel
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:40.060]  creates the dangerous impression the false impression that Israel is
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:44.620]  helpless and vulnerable and Halevi said something like that in public so I
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:50.740]  think there's a there's actually a greater strategic sobriety awareness of
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.820]  the realities in the Israeli leadership than what they're putting on and I
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:59.660]  think it is in some ways the desire to go with the United States into some
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:06.900]  aggressive actions of it by using this and to go to Iran into more aggressive
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:11.700]  rhetoric on the side of Iran let me just point to one thing so far we don't have
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.380]  any evidence that there's an Iranian nuclear program we're still operating
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:20.740]  under the NIE of December 2007 now all the neocons are saying that's because of
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:25.420]  this guy Amiri this is the famous Amiri who was all over the internet and now he
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:29.580]  went back to Iran he was a double agent he lied to us and that's why we came
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.580]  to the wrong conclusion almost three years ago there's no proof and we have
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:41.580]  Flint Leverett one of the best experts on on Iran he was in the Bush NSC with
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.140]  his wife he also says there's no evidence of an Iranian nuclear
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:50.940]  we know that that CIA report was based on the UN inspectors and others not on
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:54.380]  that so-called defector but we got about two three minutes left what just one
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:58.380]  last thing is this John Mirzheimer right the professor of political science at
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:03.660]  the University of Chicago who says if he had to give advice to Ahmadinejad he
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:09.020]  would acquire a nuclear deterrent deterrent means deterrent it's not a
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:13.260]  first-strike force it would be a modest nuclear deterrent that would simply
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:17.940]  guarantee that nobody they'll understand Israel has hundreds of nukes and certainly
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.900]  and of course Pakistan has hundreds of well at least a certain significant
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:25.980]  number Pakistan is actually an example of a country that the US might like to
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:31.180]  attack but does not attack because they do have a nuclear weapon so there's a
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:36.260]  lot of fakery but the answer to this would be a regional peace conference the
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:40.780]  Israelis feel threatened you're fine the Iranians feel more threatened so go to
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:45.380]  the table well we're out of time and I have one more question what do you think
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:48.940]  of Hameed Ghul former head of Pakistani intelligence he came on this show and
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:54.900]  said that the West is staging events to stir up the Muslims in Central Asia as a
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:59.100]  pretext to expand war absolutely I would anything coming from him I would
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:03.100]  take very seriously he's obviously been widely demonized but I don't I don't think
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:08.460]  there's too much basis for that so again the main guy going after him is
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:15.060]  Asanj right of WikiLeaks and we just saw Asanj over the weekend he died his hair
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:19.100]  Alex did you see Asanj is no longer a blonde yeah but doesn't that I mean that
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.140]  looks like they're trying to set him up claiming he was molesting people and
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:27.700]  it's not true I think he's essentially had the charges dropped the reason the
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:32.020]  blonde stuff is interesting is this cult that his family's associated with the
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:36.500]  Ann Hamilton burn cult where they gave kids LSD all the kids in that cult had
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:44.140]  to be died blonde so maybe he's trying to show us yeah thank you for listening to

[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:56.860]  now I want to go to your phone calls as promised and appreciate you holding but
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:00.340]  I'm not only going to cover this report about Obama gains foreign support in
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:05.380]  Second Amendment there's another report on info wars.com about 100,000
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:10.980]  American made rifles that are not allowed to be sold in the United States so
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:15.460]  we're gonna talk about that report as well the headline is 100,000 American
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:19.780]  made rifles not allowed to be sold in the United States one of the tiles up on
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:27.660]  info wars.com Dan in Wisconsin Dan you're on the air yeah hey Alex I'm a Army
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:33.140]  veteran I've first-time caller I've been listening to your show for about three
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:37.660]  months now just actually just woke up so pretty much everything that's going on
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.460]  actually when I was in the Army about 20 years ago I read the book and DCC and
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:46.820]  undercalled conspiracy and that kind of woke me up but I fell asleep for a
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.140]  long time became a neocon pretty much well that's why it's important to reach
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:54.980]  out to people seeds get planted that don't sprout sometimes for decades and
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.820]  now those millions of seeds that Patriots have planted they're now
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:03.020]  starting to sprout so you've got to plant more seeds and it may take years
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:07.740]  but others will then sprout. Yeah you know and I've been talking to guys too
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:12.020]  you know in my area that have heard of you but they're just kind of still like
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.900]  you know just kind of waiting for whatever I don't know what they're
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:18.620]  waiting for but I'm trying to you know I purchased a couple years your Obama
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:23.340]  deception and and right as a republic and I've been trying to show that to as
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:28.820]  many people as I can and but I've got a question for you regarding the cyber
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:35.100]  security act protecting cyber security as a national asset I've been on I've
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:38.820]  been communicating with my senator one of my senators here in Wisconsin Herb
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:45.660]  Cole regarding this issue and basically you know the last time last by email
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:51.380]  last email I sent him I asked him some I thought they were pretty legitimate
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:55.220]  questions I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I thought they were
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:01.060]  legitimate questions like you know define a cyber attack you know it's in you
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:04.980]  know mentioning a Rockefeller is one of the proponents major proponents Jay
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:12.780]  Rockefeller yeah yeah and basically I just all I get back from the senator is
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:16.540]  basically what what they've already done you know all the whole well even
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:19.660]  mainstream media admits it gives the government a kill switch and starts
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:24.780]  taking over the internet right right so you know what what do you guys I guess
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:28.980]  I don't like to say I'll alternative media I like to say true media you guys in
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:34.620]  the true media I'm mostly on the internet I guess is is there a plan B for
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.940]  when they I mean I don't want to sound like a defeatist well we've got a fight
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:42.260]  for this internet the free internet and use it while we've got it but there will
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:46.100]  be plan B's there'll be alternate systems that are developed but let's not
[02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:50.220]  let's not give them the field let's let's fight and if we expose their
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:54.140]  admitted plan there's no way they'll get get done and that we'll talk about that
[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:58.380]  when we come back then more of your calls some other key info they're trying to
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:02.940]  enlist all high schoolers in ROTC the question is where should the American
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:08.780]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:12.580]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:16.980]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:20.340]  think they own our land they think they're on our water children our
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:25.940]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate

[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:18.460]  we had a caller he just joined us in the last segment who was saying how do we
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:23.700]  stop the cybersecurity takeover well I made a Google video over the weekend
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:27.380]  that we need to go mega viral
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:32.660]  Google's plans to take over the internet expose and it shows how Google is the
[02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:39.140]  main vehicle of internet to in their own words to take over the web surveil the
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:43.980]  web track everything we're doing and gate keep so that it's key to get that
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:48.660]  video out of you're talking about solutions but also there is a report
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:54.300]  out of the examiner Philly requiring bloggers to pay $300 for a business
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:09:00.100]  license and they say for the privilege it's not a privilege to travel they tell
[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:03.420]  you it is it's not a privilege to own a gun now they tell you it is we've been
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:08.620]  brainwashed about this and I tell you the good news is last night after the
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:14.700]  Sunday show I took the guys from the Sunday crew to dinner we were downtown
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:20.140]  and I walk outside about to leave and two police officers are there on their
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:24.260]  bikes and this happened the last time I was downtown about a month ago they came
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:27.380]  over and we're both listeners and supporters this fellow comes over he
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:31.460]  goes listen I'm an oathkeeper and I've been listening to your show for years and
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:35.020]  a lot of us are waking up and my partners awake and they were genuine and
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:38.900]  shook my hand and said you know we're ready to do whatever it takes you know
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:43.740]  to fight this new world order and we know how real all this is and they went
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:48.180]  on to talk about how the system is collapsing things by design and also
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:53.700]  making the public immoral so that the state comes in with more control and the
[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:58.580]  public will actually beg for it they understood everything so I mean now
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:03.820]  every time I talk to Austin cops every time their listeners every time they're
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:08.220]  aware of what's going on so it's very positive and that's why the media shows
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:12.660]  police and Denver beating a guy up walking his dog for no reason and it's
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:16.300]  wrong they're doing that and then they don't ever prosecute him to put out the
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:20.220]  image that it's okay for bad cops to act like that and then they promote the bad
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:27.060]  cops but they want you to know about it so you start hating police so they then
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:32.580]  implode into their own gang mentality of us against them but that was very
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:37.100]  positive but but look at this story fully requiring bloggers to pay 300 for a
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:42.220]  business license it looks like cash hungry local governments are getting
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:48.100]  awfully rapacious these days between your blog and infrequent contributions to
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:54.980]  eHow.com over the last few years she has made about $50 to Maryland
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.660]  Bess her website is a hobby to the city of Philadelphia it's a potential
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:03.020]  moneymaker and the city wants its cut what an incredible precedent for cities
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:08.460]  to start demanding money for you to be able to have a blog and this is how they
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:11.220]  want to do it they want to come in with taxes regulations that's how they're
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:14.860]  gonna kill the internet as we know it in May the city sent Bess a letter
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:20.460]  demanding that she pay $300 the price of a business privilege license see her
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:27.260]  first amendment they're now saying is a privilege in May the city sent Bess a
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:32.180]  letter demanding that she pay $300 the price of a business privilege license
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:37.180]  the real kick in the pants is I don't even have a full-time job so the city to
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:41.940]  tell me to pony up 300 for a business privilege it's a privilege they love
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:46.820]  using that no it's not a privilege pay wage tax business privilege tax net
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:52.860]  profits tax and a handful of money is outrageous see they'll send out IRS over
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:56.260]  four cents at a car wash or they'll they'll send state people out to seize
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.900]  your bank account over 25 cents but they're not gonna go after Goldman Sachs
[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:05.860]  and others that have stolen 23.7 trillion it's now 28 trillion plus all the
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:10.260]  regulators are to target you and they can use zoning and business taxes to
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:13.100]  destroy whatever they want and if you think this is bad you ain't seen
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.980]  nothing yet with the carbon tax I got a bunch of other news but I said I'd go
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:18.700]  to your calls and I want to hear from you but that listener brought that up
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:22.900]  they want to kill freedom by a thousand cuts we're gonna beat them and there's
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:28.500]  millions of us with a million cuts right back to them if you have this image
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:32.940]  of you got to have this big tectonic final battle with tyranny that's not how
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:37.340]  it works it's a philosophy of resistance a philosophy of strength a
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:42.620]  philosophy of will a philosophy of the truth our truth is more powerful than
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.340]  their lives let's go ahead and go back to the calls Virgil in Oklahoma you're
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:50.940]  on the air hey Alex thanks for all the work you've been doing woke up a lot of
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:56.220]  people I had a question back in I want to say March maybe April you said
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:13:03.540]  something about doing a show on where we the public listening public draw our
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:08.420]  lines in the sand have you done that yet well we've we've had guests on and
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:12.340]  taken calls about it where do you draw your line in the sand but no we should
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:17.020]  do that in fact tomorrow for at least an hour or two of the broadcast we'll
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:20.700]  love we'll ask that question what's your line in the sand on the Sunday show I
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:24.500]  said what's the biggest government lie and how many lies will we put up with
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:28.780]  until we realize this is a criminal bankrupt group run by a bunch of scum
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:32.220]  you know at the highest levels they're trying to corrupt the lower levels to
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.900]  have full tyranny but I mean you're live now what's your line in the sand
[02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:40.020]  second amendment man they come from my gun that's that's self-defense right
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:46.740]  there well they're trying to pass all sorts of taxation regulations as oh you
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:50.940]  didn't pay all the taxes or you didn't refile your form every year in Illinois
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:55.660]  we're sending a SWAT team they always create little legalese excuses for their
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:14:00.340]  infringements of our liberty well they can come and take it if they want they
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:03.780]  think they can try so you're ready to die I mean I mean that's that's a
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:07.060]  commendable attitude to have it if we all had that attitude we'd have total
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:11.460]  liberty and that's the big ace in the hole we have against tyranny is that we
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:14.900]  are armed this is not the Soviet Union where the people were already served
[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:17.860]  under the czar this is not communist China where they were already served
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:22.780]  before Mao Zedong this is the United States we may be fat done and happy but
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:27.260]  we're starting to wake up amen sir you have a nice day all right good to hear
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:33.100]  from you Virgil will in Ohio will you're on the year hello Alex hey buddy I was
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:36.820]  I was reading this morning I have well from one of the Yahoo groups that I
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:41.140]  belong to and they've got the UN wants a bill I guess it's to take all the
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:44.940]  parental authority away to give the kids all the right you can influence the
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:48.260]  religion or anything yeah and then they tell the kids at school do they make you
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:51.780]  go to church and the nine-year-old goes yeah I don't like it and then CPS comes
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:55.820]  and takes them that's already being done for decades in the US and so the
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:59.540]  schools are already saying chattel on mommy if she hadn't used in the right
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:04.140]  light bulbs tell mommy not to take hot baths and Prince Charles is traveling
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:09.020]  around telling the kid and Al Gore two years ago told kids you tell your
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:15.100]  parents what to do well now it's gonna be my child wants to have sex at 10 and
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:19.220]  I don't want to let him and so the school taught him how to do it and so CPS is
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:23.460]  gonna take him or or my child you know the school you know told him that they
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:26.580]  could convert to some other religion and I don't want them to be that or an
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:31.100]  atheist or whatever and so they come and take it or you know your child you
[02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:34.780]  don't want them taught all of this they are turning your children against you
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:39.980]  that's right Alex but the only way we're going we can win this is is by unity
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:45.380]  we have to come together when we had those power searches and stuff you know
[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:51.620]  they had to acknowledge our voices we are the majority okay all the polls show
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:55.420]  that we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we know the truth the
[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:59.140]  system is scared and that's why they're trying to co-op things with Glenn Beck
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:02.940]  and others but it's not gonna work just continue to get the word out will all
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:08.060]  right thank you Alex God bless you will thank you don't thank me listen again
[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:12.580]  we're all in this together folks I I want to thank you let's talk to Ron in
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:17.460]  Texas Ron you're on the air Alex pleasure to speak to you I am a newly
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:21.700]  awakened patriot thing doing several others out there my own investigations and
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:26.820]  I'm ticked off to be you know to be honest with you where like the last
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:32.580]  college says we're only gonna survive there you've been doing a great job I
[02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:38.460]  have listened to you for your about six months now I've listened to other people
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:45.220]  like you mr. Newman etc but are we just gonna continue talking about it I mean
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:49.420]  you can you can get all the information out there to everybody and I know you
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:52.980]  don't want an armed revolution in this country God God forbid that that ever
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:57.100]  happens but at the same time we're on the brink of a third nuke a third world
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:01.060]  war that could possibly wipe us all out and if we're gonna put people in the
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:05.100]  local government that that's gonna stop this tyranny if we're gonna put people
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.900]  into the county governments etc that's gonna take years we don't have years
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:13.980]  all right supposed to do well again a very important question and let me try
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:18.700]  to be as simple as possible we always spend our time and energy upwards of
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:23.340]  60% turnouts and more money spent than all the states combined on these
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:28.140]  presidential elections and we have on average about an 8.2 turnout at the
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:31.780]  county and city level and the feds and the globalists and the officer
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:35.500]  corporations they're spending most of their money actually now in lobbying
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:39.940]  they've shifted it to the states to block us and they're demonizing the states
[02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:44.580]  rights movement it could only take three or four years or the next two
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:49.540]  election cycles to really check make the globalist at the state level so we
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:53.900]  fight on all fronts but when you talk about you know we don't have time what
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:58.780]  do we do they had the lowest level of flu last year flu deaths because we had
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:01.980]  the lowest level of inoculations it's it's the inoculations all the studies
[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:06.260]  show they're actually killing people and making most of them sick hardly
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:10.980]  anybody took the H1N1 shot it's come out now that it's a hoax we've got to
[02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:14.780]  expose it again this year they're just brazenly coming out so you got to take
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:18.820]  H1N1 again we're gonna combine it with a regular flu shot they're gonna hype
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:22.940]  the fear again we've got to expose the tenfold increase in seizures brain
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:27.860]  damage give people the mainstream news articles the British Medical Journal the
[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:33.100]  EU Commission's admissions how the big farm is paying off the politicians you
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:36.140]  know we're not going to beat this overnight but when we actually got
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:41.140]  involved and people put up flyers all over the world exposing the deadly flu
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:46.780]  shots we kick their butt in this battle and if we just keep battling battling
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:50.860]  battling battling battling and realize that it's an incremental fight we're
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:54.460]  gonna climb this hill take the machine gun nest and defeat the enemy we've
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:58.860]  already gone over the whole major mountain range we're up to the big final
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:02.660]  mountain the enemy's got its guns up at the top shooting at us and it's going to
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:07.100]  be hell going up that mountain but but but we don't have a magic helicopter to
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:12.460]  take us up to the top we've got to fix things by fixing ourselves by not being
[02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:16.580]  decadent by not being evil by not being corrupt by dedicating time and energy
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:21.140]  not looking for silver bullets but simply putting one foot in front of the
[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:26.780]  other and it's that process that's gonna fix this look I mean they're trying to
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:32.100]  push an Iran strike people are exposing it they may not get away with it all the
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:35.860]  polls are against the wars so they've had to lie and claim the wars over we've
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:39.900]  got to point out that's a lie now they're always gonna come back but we're
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:45.580]  gaining ground now this the establishment is losing ground and so
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:50.540]  every time the people get motivated and take action we have victory the system
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:55.180]  stone walls like we have no power but more and more we see them finally
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:59.220]  collapse right at the moment that they look like they're invincible stay there

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:16.940]  consciousness like to have another kiss okay I got a big news blitz coming up
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:21.220]  and I want to continue with your calls Ron we have to fight on all fronts but
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:24.460]  the big blind spot of the globalist the founding fathers built into the
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:28.940]  Declaration of Independence Constitution Bill of Rights is stage rights and
[02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:32.700]  that's why they're demonizing it and so you're we are in trouble we're in
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:36.900]  trouble because we let these criminals take over but everybody's always looking
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:40.340]  for a silver bullet I mean if you've got one you're welcome to tell me what it
[02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:45.900]  is if people get violent that's the excuse that they've been hoping for to
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:50.220]  really try to clamp down and we might end up winning that way but it's going
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:54.980]  to be very dangerous very disastrous and generally in history violent
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:58.340]  revolutions end up with something even worse than what you were fighting against
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:02.740]  go ahead well you know what just two quick questions I'll get off and let you
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:07.900]  answer them first of all case in point Mr. Barry treason Sataro we know he's
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:11.900]  illegal why is he still there isn't there something that we can do like you
[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:15.540]  see in movies all the time where they they they sit there they take a person
[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:19.980]  out of power because of whatever the case is when they take over a submarine for
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:23.180]  example hey you know you need to step down you're not doing it right what can
[02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:27.460]  we do about that why is he still in there second question Alex it's been a
[02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:31.620]  pleasure to speak with you yeah I just rolled to Austin I do twice a week from
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:36.220]  Laredo to Michigan twice a week you got a building right off the highway it's
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:39.380]  looks like it's got crystal palaces growing up out of the top of it what is
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:45.580]  that you're talking about the big frost owl building I guess it looks like
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:48.660]  some amount of Superman or that is crystal palace up at the top very
[02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:51.460]  beautiful building well that's the big that's the big owl building I
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:56.860]  appreciate your call look Obama is a puppet who's meant to be politically
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:03.860]  destroyed just like George W. Bush was and then they will remove the puppet and
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:08.380]  give us a new puppet and that goes back to why do we obsess over presidents it's
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:11.980]  our Congress that's given up control over trade given up control over the
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:16.420]  monetary system to private banks we have to even get our government back this
[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:21.180]  government we have is out of control let's go ahead and take another call
[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:28.020]  let's talk to Tim in Virginia Tim you're on the air greetings Alex I must
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:31.860]  commend you for your efforts well thank you sir I commend you for your efforts
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:36.660]  go ahead yeah well I'm like most Americans were not happy with the
[02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:45.140]  economy or not happy the way things got rammed through and you know Iran what
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:50.460]  is going to be our priorities what are states going to do to create jobs by
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:55.580]  furnishing economic incentives for like automotive companies to come to their
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:27:03.180]  state like a 30-year tax well they use their globalist they use the automaker
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:07.220]  bailout to move them to Brazil and China and Eastern Europe so we have to
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:11.300]  again get rid of the traders they want to destroy the middle class they want to
[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:15.780]  deindustrialize they're doing this by design so again we have to remove the
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:22.140]  criminals or we have no future it's that simple and any solution they give us is
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:26.620]  always a lie it's only about giving them more power they've already committed
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:31.980]  so many crimes so much looting they're not going to stop well Alex I can only
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:37.140]  see that if the federal governments start taxing these American corporations
[02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:42.620]  that are doing business outside of the US with a 50% tax rate they're gonna have
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:48.420]  to decide is it worth it and that's the bottom line but the bottom line is this
[02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:54.300]  Alex our economy is a service economy which basically means we're a
[02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:59.700]  prostitute economy our industrial manufacturing base is gone yeah we're a
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:04.380]  client to China which is the globalist model absolutely and the problem is is
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:10.500]  that when you talk about Iran and all that masturbation rhetoric about the
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:15.820]  saber rattling the bottom line is the US can do the shock at all but when it
[02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:21.340]  comes to anything long-sustaining our manufacturing base is not there and if
[02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:27.100]  Israel is gonna tack around it's gonna be using all 200 of their small tactical
[02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:31.140]  nuclear weapons well they have some weapons that aren't tactical they have
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:36.140]  larger nukes but I appreciate your call because we all here's the problem we
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:41.300]  keep looking at this as Americans we keep looking at this as if our government
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:46.020]  cares about us our government is an offshore corporate group that uses our
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:50.100]  tax money our wealth everything to enrich themselves and if they're offshore
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:54.660]  globalists of course they're going to have laws passed with tax incentives for
[02:28:54.660 --> 02:29:00.060]  them to move offshore they're dealing in short-term profits but in the wider
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:05.780]  scheme it's short-term profits that empower them to be the only financial
[02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:12.740]  group left standing at the end of this situation and that's not my opinion
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:19.340]  everything we talked about 13 14 15 years ago has now happened not because I'm
[02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:25.220]  a psychic not because I'm a gypsy with a traveling road show here or reading
[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:30.140]  tarot cards it's a globalist blueprint when I get up here and tell you they're
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:34.400]  putting sterilence in vaccines I have the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.140]  linked to them on the website when I tell you the government knows that sodium
[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:43.460]  fluoride brain damages you reduces IQ causes cancer they had studies in the
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:48.940]  20s on that they know what they're doing they're pure evil nothing's gonna get
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:54.420]  better till we remove these crooks we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:52.740]  historically once they see the globalist own statements once they see the
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:58.460]  information covered in my films in my books they awaken the power of the
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:04.980]  obama deception being seen now more than 30 million times in the last year and a
[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:09.620]  half shattering the left-right paradigm is everywhere the power of fall the
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:14.340]  republic being seen close to 10 million times for free and that's just on the
[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:17.420]  web not counting the hundreds of thousands of people that have been given
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:23.420]  hard copies please buy obama deception fall the republic invisible empire a
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:27.740]  new order to find make copies of them give them to everyone you know and when
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:30.820]  they see it they will know the truth they will see the globalist own
[02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:34.820]  documents their own statements where they explain their program they think
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:38.100]  you're stupid they think you won't go research their own statements so they
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:41.420]  communicate with each other in public like Brazilian Brzezinski saying look
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:45.620]  we're in trouble the new world order is now has global resistance like it's
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:50.900]  never had there is a worldwide awakening but they're counter striking we've got
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:55.340]  to accelerate that I mean here's a clip from Fox News yesterday or actually this
[02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:59.820]  morning where they're talking to two former Obama supporters and they say
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:04.460]  I've shattered the left-right paradigm I've woken up to this the same bankers
[02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:10.420]  that ran Bush run Obama this is a takeover they finally are getting it
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:15.060]  everywhere and the system doesn't know what to do and so Gallup and others have
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:18.420]  major reports out this week that just came out over the weekend saying look
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:22.100]  and the Republican Party leadership's talking about this they said look
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:26.460]  Republicans are gonna get into power but they're gonna instantly be removed if
[02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:33.180]  they don't stop all the banker bailouts and all the corruption and the people
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:37.820]  are awake and so anti-incumbent Democrats are winning in primaries
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:42.260]  anti-incumbent Republicans are beating all the Republicans in every case but
[02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:48.220]  Rick Perry in scores of cases the system is in deep trouble that's why they
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:51.980]  want to start World War three I want to get into a bunch of news but first here
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:58.620]  is a short clip from Fox television today what kind of hope and change go
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:03.740]  ahead with regard to the job market Tatiana did you expect I expected way
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.180]  more change but now doing the research I realize that Obama is an illusion of
[02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:14.660]  change he's a lot like Bush in many ways and he he's a lot like Bush in many
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:21.860]  ways and it's a fallacy to actually believe that he cares about employment
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:28.980]  when he hired an economic team that's comprised of Volkner Geithner and it
[02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:36.020]  just shows you that uh that these three these men were in the past three
[02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:40.620]  administrations and they don't really care for the poor and the working class
[02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:45.060]  of this nation but I'm not really disappointed I'm not so much disappointed
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:49.140]  in Obama I'm also disappointed with the Republicans and the American citizen
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:56.060]  far too many Americans keep falling for this left-right paradigm when the power
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:37:01.660]  structure at the top of both parties is corrupt they're both sold to the bankers
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:05.460]  and the corporate interests okay Mike I know that one thing that really troubled
[02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:09.980]  you okay that it started to dawn on you that maybe the young people actually
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:14.220]  so it's it's everywhere a lot of these the awakening is just massive by the way
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:17.660]  we didn't edit that video we were streaming it live from Fox website and
[02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:23.740]  it was it was cutting out but it's just everywhere it's everywhere that this
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.900]  awakening is taking place and it's game over when you realize there's an
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:33.220]  ultra powerful criminal cartel of private corporations that don't like the
[02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:36.780]  free market that don't like you owning your own business that don't like you
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:42.220]  owning your own restaurant or your own farm or ranch that don't want you owning
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:46.900]  your own record label that don't want you owning your own firearms company when
[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:51.500]  you realize they're monopoly men and that competition is a sin to them as the
[02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:56.340]  founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said it's game over the moment people
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:01.540]  actually get it and realize we have the shadowy corporate elite represented by
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:07.020]  the Bilderbergs the CFR and others it's over and that's what Ron Paul has said
[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:10.900]  and I agree with him that once you identify the Federal Reserve as a
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:17.660]  private criminal group they can get their kept Congress that they own they can
[02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:23.380]  have them give them more power but it's short lived as they try to pass laws
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:27.100]  saying they're allowed to steal money well they pass laws saying black people
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:31.700]  weren't humans but folks stood up against that they could pass a law saying
[02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:35.820]  I've got to worship the Stay Puff Marshmallow man but it doesn't mean I
[02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:39.740]  have to worship the Stay Puff Marshmallow man there are innate organic
[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:45.340]  common sense laws to the universe and innate rights that I have given to be
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:50.140]  my my creator not given to me by Barack Obama or George W. Bush and they
[02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:54.460]  themselves are frontmen and there's no doubt if I could talk to that young
[02:38:54.460 --> 02:39:00.300]  woman she's seen the Obama deception word for word she's quoting it she's got
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:04.900]  it and we're seeing this everywhere it's explosive and the system has the NSA
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:09.620]  they have the tracking and surveillance they knew the effect this radio show my
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:13.900]  films and the websites were having years ago before we even realized it I
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:18.060]  mean I knew we were having a big effect but folks now I literally can't walk my
[02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:21.980]  dog I can't go in a restaurant I can fly anywhere in the country I can go
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:26.420]  anywhere and cars stop on the road and it's two three or four of them will back
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:30.860]  up every time I see police in Austin they run over and say we're awake we know
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:36.020]  it's all true you told us about world government now it's admitted all because
[02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:44.140]  I stood for the truth and I continued to just lay out the facts I continued to
[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:48.140]  tell the truth and didn't care if people made fun of me and then it came true
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:55.980]  everything we talked about began to unfold and black people Democrats cops
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:40:01.820]  Hispanics white folks farmers it doesn't matter they're all starting to really
[02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:06.420]  figure out how the world really works the hoax the illusion is disappearing I'm
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:11.020]  nothing special it's like the emperors new clothes the emperor of you if you
[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:17.260]  read the fable it's it's it's fiction it's a allegory for life for those that
[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:19.380]  don't know the story I'll briefly tell it and then I'm gonna get into the news in
[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:26.140]  your calls the emperor had these con artists come to town and they said
[02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:32.380]  we're going to weave you a beautiful cloak of gold but it's so beautiful that
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:41.660]  only the upright and intelligent and genius can see the cloak and the the
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:45.340]  emperor got called in he paid all this money all these jewels for it and they
[02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:49.300]  said here is your cloak and he didn't see anything but he didn't want to admit
[02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:53.700]  that he was profane that he was dumb that he wasn't enlightened because only
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:58.460]  the enlightened could see the beautiful coat and I'm paraphrasing the story it's
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:01.660]  been your guys we pull up the actual parable of the emperor's new clothes
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:07.740]  maybe we should link to it on info wars calm the point is is that then they
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:13.060]  solding several other cloaks underwear pants his undershirt and then he had a
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:17.140]  parade a few months later totally naked but none of his advisors wanted to
[02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:20.980]  admit he was naked and getting trouble nobody wanted to be the first person to
[02:41:20.980 --> 02:41:25.740]  wonder why he was naked so in plain view he was walking through the city
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:30.300]  square at a parade and a two-year-old boy stepped forward and laughed and said
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:35.060]  the emperor is naked the emperor is wearing no clothes and then everyone
[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:38.820]  else started laughing everyone else started pointing and he turned red and
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:43.260]  got embarrassed and ran back inside and I'm like the two-year-old they're in the
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:47.460]  news telling us tortures good then they get caught doing it then they indict
[02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:50.820]  the people they ordered to do it then bush comes out and says he ordered it
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:54.900]  and would order it again but they sent people to prison that did it they're
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:57.940]  giving people vaccines that are causing convulsions and brain damage
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:02.260]  admittedly everywhere a tenfold increase it's an admitted fraud but they're back
[02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:06.260]  with the emperor's clothes again and more of us are pointing out it's a fraud
[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:12.300]  they lied about WMD's they're back lying about Iran again they lied to us
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:15.860]  about GMO food being good for us when every study shows it's deadly they
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:20.460]  told us prozac stopped suicide when they now admitted increases suicide they
[02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:23.700]  lied to us and said big government was good they lied to us and said they
[02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:27.460]  weren't taking baby's blood at birth 38 years ago now it's admitted they have
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:32.300]  been secretly they told us getting rid of Glass-Steagall Act wouldn't hurt the
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:36.580]  economy and that the banks wouldn't sell derivatives and they did and destroyed
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:42.140]  the economy they told us naft and Gatt was gonna be great it's so simple when
[02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:48.020]  you have a historical context if you are as informed about history and society
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:52.540]  and it's incredibly entertaining incredibly addictive incredibly

[02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:21.900]  things work and know how people work and know how society operates because once
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:26.740]  you do you realize most people are still completely blind unconscious don't know
[02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:30.780]  what's going on and then instead of being like the globalist using the fact
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:34.380]  that they're in the dark to control them and to manipulate them for your own
[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:39.180]  gain that's what evil does to take blinders off people's eyes off their
[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:44.740]  souls to see them expand their awakening and understanding like a seed
[02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:51.460]  sprouting and growing into a mighty oak tree to see the effect I've had in 15
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:55.540]  years and the effect that others that came before me had to realize the innate
[02:43:55.540 --> 02:44:00.900]  power of the individual is so wondrous and a blessing from God all right I'm

[02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:41.540]  than Hiroshima London independent the shocking rates of infant mortality and
[02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:45.660]  cancer in Iraqi city this is just one city they studied raised new questions
[02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:50.700]  about battle and it goes on to say the major studies been conducted and they
[02:44:50.700 --> 02:44:54.300]  found a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in
[02:44:54.300 --> 02:45:01.060]  childhood cancers in under 14s a 12-fold increase dramatic increases in
[02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:05.340]  infant mortality cancer leukemia in the Iraqi city of Fallujah which was bomb
[02:45:05.340 --> 02:45:09.620]  barred by Marines and 04 exceed those reports by survivors the atomic bombs
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:13.420]  that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45 according to new study
[02:45:13.420 --> 02:45:17.740]  Iraqi doctors in Fallujah have compiled since 2005 we have other US studies by
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:22.060]  the way being overwhelmed by the number of babies with serious birth defects and
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:26.540]  they put them on the news ranging from a girl born with two heads to paralysis of
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:32.020]  the lower limbs they said that they were also seeing far worse cancers than they
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:36.860]  did before the battle of Fallujah between US troops and insurgents Dr. Chris
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:41.100]  Busby visiting professor of University of Ulster and one of the authors of the
[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:44.820]  survey of 4,000 individuals in Fallujah said it's difficult to pin down the
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:48.660]  exact cause the cancers and birth defects he added that to produce effects like
[02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:53.220]  this some Mary Vager multi mutagenic exposure must have occurred you know
[02:45:53.220 --> 02:46:00.540]  for when the attacks happen and then it goes into all the DU that was used okay
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:10.300]  continuing here I think the AC is off in this office let me get into this report
[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:15.420]  I'm gonna do a larger YouTube video on this today but Adderall may have unhinged
[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:22.700]  Lindsay Lohan and in every one of these different cases that I've seen time and
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:28.820]  time again whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Britney Spears or mass shooters they're
[02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:32.980]  always on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are in the hallucinogen
[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:39.580]  psychotropic class and it makes people do crazy things that's admitted what it
[02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:45.180]  does and it destroys inhibition it makes people much more promiscuous it makes
[02:46:45.180 --> 02:46:49.500]  people much more reckless and in every case we look at these people are hopped
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:55.460]  up on pharmacological drugs as we first reported the docs at the UCLA rehab
[02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:58.540]  facility believe Lindsay was misdiagnosed with attention deficit
[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:03.580]  hyperactivity disorder and was prescribed Adderall that's a type of speed to
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:07.700]  treat the foot the phantom affliction which again speed also makes you nuts
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:15.260]  dr. Joe Harazi a prominent LA addiction specialist tells TMZ people who take
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:18.860]  Adderall when they don't need it can experience similar effects to people use
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:24.580]  cocaine or methamphetamine bottom line of bad medical diagnosis may have set
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:30.100]  the ball rolling that unhinged Lindsay Lohan's life the wreckage of these
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:34.300]  synthetic drugs they push I mean you take hillbilly heroin that Rush Limbaugh
[02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:39.180]  was on every study shows far worse than real heroin but they push it you have a
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:45.220]  sprained leg got a hurt back oh here have some pills that totally addict you
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:51.060]  here's another one out of the Deccan Herald five out of six new drugs don't
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:55.720]  work five out of six approved prescription drugs seldom benefit patients
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:59.580]  says a critic of the pharmacological industry and then it breaks down all
[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:05.340]  these major university heads University of Medicine New Jersey going over all
[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:09.100]  the information about statins attacking the liver not lowering cholesterol all
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:14.540]  these other bad drugs here's another one on the similar study a new study 85% of
[02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:18.260]  big pharma's new drugs are lemons and pose health risk to users just like the
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:21.780]  swine flu shot but they don't care they're back pushing it again this year
[02:48:21.780 --> 02:48:26.900]  they have no shame they just operate in plain view for years natural health
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:29.940]  opponents have been sounding the alarms about the dangers of the new drugs that
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:37.180]  were pushed on consumers but is that one-sided inaccurate view not at all and
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:42.620]  it goes on to say in fact far worse than most people have ever dreamed
[02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:46.740]  independent reviewers found that about 85% of new drugs offer few of any
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:51.580]  benefits but carry the risk of causing serious harm to users according to
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:55.420]  Donald Light PhD professor of comparative health policy University of
[02:48:55.420 --> 02:48:59.740]  Medicine New Jersey who authored the study pharmacological industry is a
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:06.220]  market for lemons and it goes over all of that but the issue here is that it's
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:10.980]  worse than that they're not just lemons they know it's hurting you they know on
[02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:15.940]  the insert for Gardasil that it doesn't protect you from human papillomavirus
[02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:20.820]  that reportedly can cause cervical cancer they admit it doesn't help you they
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:24.820]  admit and know that fluoride doesn't make your teeth stronger the American
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:32.220]  Dental Association now admitted that five years ago they know all of this they
[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:39.100]  knew H1N1 was a hoax they understand it now we're going to break I want to
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:42.420]  start getting into this now key article and I'll show some of the video black
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:47.740]  construction worker chased away from round zero by craved mob the guy was it
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:50.860]  not even a Muslim he told him we can't play the video there's so many cuss words
[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:55.700]  them cussing at him and this crowd is screaming at him and he's saying I'm not
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:59.020]  even a Muslim he's wearing an American flag pendant around his neck they say
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:04.060]  well you got that white hat on he says well it's hot out here this is so sweat
[02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:08.340]  doesn't drip in my eye when I'm you know welding and so he comes walking off
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:13.220]  ground zero as a construction worker and by the end of it they end up screaming
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:16.580]  and yelling and basically chasing him out of there saying get out of here
[02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:20.140]  Muslim get out of here Muslim well so what if he was a Muslim is this what
