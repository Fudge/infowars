[00:55.320 --> 00:59.720]  Congress for not paying his taxes and stealing trillions of dollars and won't
[00:59.720 --> 01:05.400]  say where it went but he showed up here to try to get sympathy for the entire
[01:05.400 --> 01:11.640]  criminal IRS private fellow reserve grid that is running this nation and the
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.360]  planets the same group of bankers controlling the globe into the ground and
[01:17.360 --> 01:24.880]  it was extremely eventful they ran off Rob Jacobson and Jason Burmese because
[01:24.880 --> 01:33.880]  they said we're with info wars the other guys did not get questioned so they
[01:33.880 --> 01:37.560]  were able to be in the press conference on the side of the road in America it
[01:37.560 --> 01:42.480]  doesn't matter what type of press passes you have the Secret Service kicks you
[01:42.480 --> 01:46.960]  out and then Aaron was able to get a serious question into Geithner and he
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.000]  tried to dodge it so that is coming up later in the broadcast will break down
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.840]  what happened and play the video and audio for the radio listeners and
[01:55.840 --> 02:02.280]  prison planet dot TV viewers fact before I forget guys tell Aaron he's getting
[02:02.280 --> 02:06.400]  that ready uploaded to prison planet dot TV today the video he's making it will
[02:06.400 --> 02:10.240]  go live there first but I want to stream it I want to premiere it here on the
[02:10.240 --> 02:18.000]  radio TV today for radio listeners and prison planet dot TV members now I have
[02:18.000 --> 02:28.360]  one two three four five six seven eight key stacks today and the biggest and
[02:28.360 --> 02:38.640]  most important stack dovetails with the second most important stack now that it
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.200]  has become big news in Philadelphia that the principal admitted they were
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.440]  accessing of the government issued taxpayer paid for laptops to the
[02:48.440 --> 02:52.120]  students the high school students that the principal and other people were
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.200]  accessing it in the children's in the young people's homes that's how the
[02:57.200 --> 03:00.680]  families found out and they've now come out and said what's the big deal what's
[03:00.680 --> 03:06.760]  wrong with that it's an exercise in mind control and in your face brainwashing
[03:06.760 --> 03:15.920]  but a ferreting about Steve Watson in an article he wrote yesterday found a
[03:15.920 --> 03:24.400]  video of PBS showing a school administrator spying on children without
[03:24.400 --> 03:31.960]  them even knowing like it was no big deal kind of like Google came out four
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.600]  years ago 2006 and said yeah we're using the microphones and cameras on your
[03:36.600 --> 03:39.320]  computer to watch and listen to you but don't worry we have computers that are
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.840]  doing it and then Taylor making advertisement for you but they can also
[03:43.840 --> 03:50.280]  use it obviously to spy on you but this is so off the charts I mean we should be
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.400]  yet running down the street yelling about this not just calmly reporting it but
[03:54.400 --> 04:00.280]  see that's how they do it with social engineering they just calmly report that
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.560]  they're doing all of this they think you're so weak-minded that if they just
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.760]  announce it on the news like it's no big deal you'll go along with it oh yeah
[04:09.760 --> 04:13.360]  we're watching your kids in their bedroom sure what's what we're putting
[04:13.360 --> 04:20.280]  cameras in the girl showers in states like Tennessee yeah we're we're keeping
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.080]  your babies DNA oh and it wasn't for blood disease test it's for the Pentagon a
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.200]  bio weapons program as I told you 14 years ago it's actually in the Austin
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.320]  American statesman yesterday suit possible over baby DNA sent to military
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.720]  oh and of course it's global we're already in the global government been
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.120]  going on for 37 years that's just some of the top stories I'll finish up with
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.240]  laying out what we're going to cover today and tell you about some of the
[04:49.240 --> 04:53.960]  guests we've got joining us as well we'll also have open phones coming up

[05:00.200 --> 05:03.560]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.520]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.520 --> 05:11.760]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:11.760 --> 05:16.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.040 --> 05:20.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.480 --> 05:29.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.160 --> 05:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.120 --> 05:40.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:40.920 --> 05:43.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[05:43.640 --> 05:48.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar

[08:08.080 --> 08:15.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:15.920 --> 08:23.480]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:23.480 --> 08:27.120]  alex jones
[08:27.120 --> 08:47.520]  it's always worse than even I have previously been informed of my say
[08:47.520 --> 08:53.920]  always that's a figure of speech over 90% of the time and that's conservative
[08:53.920 --> 09:00.680]  my knowledge about the new world order and information we cover on air that
[09:00.680 --> 09:06.640]  sounds so shocking at the time when all the facts finally get declassified and
[09:06.640 --> 09:15.400]  released it's almost always many magnitudes worse than what I previously
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.840]  was even aware of one of the favorite co-and-tell pro lines is that alex jones
[09:21.840 --> 09:27.000]  is a fear monger or alex jones exaggerates you really don't hear that
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.960]  anymore because it doesn't work now much of the time what we cover is not even
[09:33.960 --> 09:44.000]  classified it's just not popularly known like the atomic weight of lead is known
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.560]  and most chemist or geologist would know it but off the top of my head I don't
[09:51.560 --> 09:59.120]  know it so you see if someone doesn't know something it's as if it doesn't
[09:59.120 --> 10:07.080]  even exist and I use the analogy quite often of perception is not reality you
[10:07.080 --> 10:12.200]  can be on PCP and jump off a 50-story rooftop and believe you're flying like a
[10:12.200 --> 10:16.440]  swallow through the air but when you hit the concrete at the bottom for a
[10:16.440 --> 10:23.520]  millisecond you're gonna realize you weren't flying you were falling so to
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.480]  new listeners out there you can't just listen to this radio show and choose to
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.160]  not believe what I'm covering and what I'm discussing if you're going to just
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.960]  out of hand say I'm lying you better go out and check it for yourself and of
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.760]  course I put that challenge out because you're going to find out not only am I
[10:43.760 --> 10:47.760]  telling you the truth I'm holding back that's right ladies and gentlemen I
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.160]  hold back quite a bit of information because I don't think the public's
[10:52.160 --> 11:01.280]  ready for it things are much worse the history we've been given is nothing
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.920]  close to reality we are living in a matrix of propaganda the brain is a
[11:06.920 --> 11:14.000]  computer and it's been programmed with lies and fraud and deceit and so I only
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  cover what I can document and what I can prove but I've got a very good idea of
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.840]  the full magnitude of what we're facing and believe me ladies and gentlemen if
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.240]  you knew what I knew you would be worried about sports or what your hair
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.960]  looks like or what your neighbors think of you you would be thinking about
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.360]  nothing but getting out of this new world order that we're being brought into
[11:45.160 --> 11:48.800]  coming up later in the broadcast we've got the gentleman coming on who bulldozed
[11:48.800 --> 11:57.280]  his house that he owned when the IRS put a bank lien on it so the bank went ahead
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.480]  and said we're gonna take it pay off the bank lien and keep your house they
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.840]  called a $350,000 house in Austin it'd be a $2 million house and Austin's not
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.440]  even inexpensive I mean it's just a lavish giant home with a big pool he
[12:11.440 --> 12:18.160]  built himself and they said uh-oh we're taking it but I guess in the rural area
[12:18.160 --> 12:24.440]  of Ohio it's only $350,000 just like in Michigan you can get a office building
[12:24.440 --> 12:27.600]  now for a couple hundred thousand dollars an older one because everything's
[12:27.600 --> 12:34.160]  falling apart and how we'd won the West you know I told Kevin I don't
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.840]  particularly like the name because it's really American drug war two and on
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.200]  steroids it exposes government drug dealing how they want to use drug laws
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.840]  against vitamins and minerals how they're violating states rights it's
[12:47.840 --> 12:58.400]  shipping from info wars.com it's now shipping they had a viewing of it last
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.760]  week in LA and then the police rated every dispensary that showed up every
[13:02.760 --> 13:07.160]  dispensary owner they're legal they arrested I mean it's total harassment
[13:07.160 --> 13:13.400]  just like with aka Tommy Chung when the feds rated the documentary film making
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.080]  warehouse and stole thousands of copies of the film now that blew up in their
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.640]  face because then the film went from obscurity to being a big hit and then
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.000]  even Showtime picked it up saying wow we need to find out why this is being
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.520]  censored so much and since then it's been on HBO so it had the opposite effect
[13:32.520 --> 13:40.240]  that the lawless ones wanted so I guess if they raid me and steal my videos it
[13:40.240 --> 13:44.880]  only make it a bigger hit but this is what they want to do to the First
[13:44.880 --> 13:49.600]  Amendment they're trampling on all of the amendments they are a parasitic
[13:49.600 --> 13:58.800]  group of criminals feeding and rending the public I have a big stack of news on
[13:58.800 --> 14:05.320]  the economy the banks last year had broken record bonuses for themselves 2009
[14:05.320 --> 14:08.800]  they're now getting some of the first bonuses of the year banks brokerage
[14:08.800 --> 14:15.640]  firms and others and it's triple their previous record oh yes and they've got
[14:15.640 --> 14:19.120]  all these Harvard economists saying an age of austerities here we're gonna have
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.920]  to raise taxes on all of you to pay the banks as they bathe in trillions
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.960]  laughing at you with North com locked and loaded begging to be released on the
[14:27.960 --> 14:32.440]  public just like a New Orleans to come after the guns ready to eat their own
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.120]  guts and ask for seconds what makes the grass grow the blood of the American
[14:37.120 --> 14:47.680]  people blood blood blood lock and load it's hunting season on the American
[14:47.680 --> 14:55.040]  people run them down there's a big study in big business journal about how the
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.480]  IRS actually destroys people's lives with these taking their paychecks putting
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.400]  leans on their house how they would actually the study showed get more
[15:01.400 --> 15:06.040]  money if they didn't do this they don't want the money they want to bankrupt you
[15:06.040 --> 15:10.240]  they don't need the money the Federal Reserve makes it out of nothing it's
[15:10.240 --> 15:16.800]  about controlling the economy it's about mafia power it's about fear now the
[15:16.800 --> 15:19.680]  mindless drones they've got working for the private Federal Reserve's
[15:19.680 --> 15:24.280]  collection agency the IRS they really believe all the propaganda they spout
[15:24.280 --> 15:28.960]  bunch of socialist is one of the groups they hire that believe in big government
[15:28.960 --> 15:36.480]  and they also hire former military people that follow orders and the green
[15:36.480 --> 15:40.440]  taxes are meant to bankrupt the economy in the words of the UN in the words of
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.600]  multiple Obama officials in the words of the NASA
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.800]  climatologist they want you bankrupt you got that so you're so bankrupt you
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.480]  can't afford to have children because if you can't afford your children they're
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.440]  gonna take them and they got special guilds of people that like to have their
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.160]  way with children and that's who takes care of that see there's a criminal
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.960]  enterprise and it's called corrupt government and it's hiring and it's
[16:05.960 --> 16:11.000]  growing and the paychecks are swelling and getting bigger and they're just in
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.120]  an orgy of our blood and guts and sucking off of us the we're being
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.760]  swarmed over like lice and ticks and fleas as they drink our blood laughing and
[16:19.760 --> 16:28.760]  celebrating at it and crapping all over us and worshiping themselves and just
[16:28.760 --> 16:34.760]  rolling around knee-deep in our blood
[16:38.160 --> 16:45.520]  lawless criminal parasites on every front and they're just getting started
[16:45.520 --> 16:52.000]  because it's what they like to do they enjoy it 99% of the time nations fall
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.080]  to tyranny and the dictators and the corrupt oligarchs that run the system
[16:56.080 --> 17:01.240]  for no reason start slaughtering and killing in the final phase because they
[17:01.240 --> 17:16.120]  like it they enjoy it and they're not gonna stop it's their world they're the
[17:16.120 --> 17:21.600]  gods of this world Geithner doesn't have to pay taxes half the Congress on

[17:53.080 --> 17:59.520]  epaulets and I mean you know the equivalent of primordial headdresses
[17:59.520 --> 18:06.320]  monkey crowns to let everybody know I'm the big parrot the tree I've got the
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.480]  biggest feathers it's absolute peacock behavior
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.480]  all right here are my stacks of news it's worse than I even thought we're gonna
[18:19.480 --> 18:25.200]  play a clip of this coming back into the break school spy cam case explodes as
[18:25.200 --> 18:33.440]  feds initiate probe prison planet calm and full wars calm Steve Watson and in
[18:33.440 --> 18:40.120]  here they just calmly show a PBS program frontline and the reporter isn't
[18:40.120 --> 18:43.640]  saying there's anything wrong with it no one's questioning that the school
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.480]  administrator is sitting there watching from his office students that are

[24:11.720 --> 24:15.880]  day remotely monitoring what the kids are doing on their laptops we have a
[24:15.880 --> 24:20.720]  photo booth he can see them but they can't see him these kids are goofing off
[24:20.720 --> 24:25.680]  taking pictures of themselves in class so wait do all the kids have the cameras
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.600]  six and seven three have cameras a lot of kids are just on it to check their
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.280]  hair do their makeup they just use it like it's a mirror I always like to
[24:36.280 --> 24:41.680]  mess with them and take a picture nine times I said they ducked out of the way
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.320]  and then they shut down and they get right back to work so I can see he's
[24:46.320 --> 24:51.760]  got a few things going on here he's got the photo booth program open he's got
[24:51.760 --> 24:57.680]  this is social studies project open school email open you know I think the
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.040]  kids know what is expected of them but they also want to do all their other
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.880]  things that's what I see a lot of the multitasking but I was doing my work too
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.280]  most of the adults at the school actually seemed pretty sanguine about the
[25:11.280 --> 25:22.160]  kids being so easily distracted you learn something new every day we're gonna
[25:22.160 --> 25:25.600]  play that video we're live at present planet dot TV in the next hour so you
[25:25.600 --> 25:29.960]  can actually watch it not just listen to it but it's in the article written by
[25:29.960 --> 25:36.400]  Steve Watson school spy cams it's school spy cams case explodes as feds
[25:36.400 --> 25:43.680]  initiate probe now this is a frontline piece from a year ago hidden in plain
[25:43.680 --> 25:50.560]  view and notice the reporter we've got a link to the entire PBS program I watch
[25:50.560 --> 25:53.800]  the whole thing they never question why they're being watched on spy cams they
[25:53.800 --> 25:57.680]  never question what this is like they never question the students aren't told
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.560]  that the parents aren't told they never question anything it's all about wow the
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.680]  kids are distracted screwing around on their computers oh look I can read what
[26:05.680 --> 26:09.280]  they're writing what they're saying what they're doing and they have them do
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.120]  their school reports and then the feds have grants for that where they do
[26:14.120 --> 26:19.600]  federal mandated reports about mommy and daddy is just part of their English
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.120]  class and it's just total surveillance total control and it's your cell phones
[26:24.120 --> 26:30.280]  it's your home computers it's your TVO it's your scientific Atlantic cable boxes
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.560]  everything is bare minimum listening to you with the microphones and what the
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.600]  government has declassified and you can imagine it's much worse is they have on
[26:41.600 --> 26:48.120]  average about 10 million connections a day just over the phone and they dial
[26:48.120 --> 26:53.160]  into your regular landline and under federal law the phones are designed so
[26:53.160 --> 26:59.480]  that the government can turn the receiver on even when it's off the you
[26:59.480 --> 27:03.640]  on the hook and that's why a lot of them should pick your phone up even G
[27:03.640 --> 27:06.280]  Gordon Lettuce broke this down and talked back when he was a G man they had
[27:06.280 --> 27:11.040]  this you know in the 60s and 70s and when you pick your phone up and you don't
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.920]  hear a dial tone immediately that you've got a computer listening okay and they
[27:14.920 --> 27:18.960]  just randomly dial in and keyword software listens about 10 million
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.440]  conservatively there you go this everybody wants a month or so gets a
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.120]  dial in you know it's part of freedom part of big brother part of the new
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.240]  America founding fathers would support it I mean come on you're not a terrorist
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.480]  are you and so they just dial in and listen to you and then now with the
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.800]  cell phones they dial in and listen and now under cybersecurity they say all
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.480]  cell phones all landlines all computer all email all faxes they're building
[27:42.480 --> 27:47.400]  giant hubs all over the country tens of billions of dollars per facility
[27:47.400 --> 27:53.880]  everything will be read and looked at right now and this could be a lot it
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.000]  could already have it but they say they just have the computing power to read
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.600]  most your emails most your faxes because that's already text and randomly
[28:01.600 --> 28:06.040]  listen to about 10 million of you a day and of course they have to take key
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.240]  resources away to listen to me 24-7 and have actual physical rooms full of
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.720]  people listening and tracking everything we're doing and of course my FBI file is
[28:13.720 --> 28:17.280]  classified my NSA file is classified they won't give it to us national
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.240]  security yes because they always put a bunch of lies in there they don't want
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.560]  me getting that but that's the freedom and now they want you to know see and so
[28:26.560 --> 28:32.080]  the school thought this was no big deal and I see reports oh yeah we put cameras
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.960]  in the girl showers and we watch it mm-hmm oh yes law enforcement other
[28:34.960 --> 28:37.560]  states are accessing and watching your naked daughter what's wrong with that oh
[28:37.560 --> 28:43.120]  but if a member of the military gets in a photo of his daughter in a bikini we
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.840]  arrest him ABC News but the government's gonna record your naked children and
[28:47.840 --> 28:51.200]  we're gonna put you and your children and your wife right through a body scanner
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.840]  in front of everyone and do it it's an act of domination and total submission
[28:55.840 --> 29:04.640]  and it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and now all over England
[29:04.640 --> 29:10.360]  all over the US this is coming up the day when I play an audio clip a guy was
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.680]  out at Christmas taking photos of the Santa Claus parade and the police just

[35:30.720 --> 35:38.080]  research because they know that all of the subgroups of the human race Asian
[35:38.080 --> 35:44.320]  Caucasian Negro and all the other subgroups and variants are all
[35:44.320 --> 35:50.000]  interrelated so they have problems with race specific bio weapons HIV has
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.280]  couplers designed for black people it's very hard for a northern European to
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.360]  get it the team lymphocytes don't have it don't have the coupler points I've had
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.640]  top genetic engineers on to break that down for you that's another example it's
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.240]  like catching a cold in Africa or if you're a black person you you catch it
[36:08.240 --> 36:13.160]  fast they've done studies on hemophiliacs that got factor eight filled with HIV and
[36:13.160 --> 36:20.160]  guess what Africans are African Americans people of African descent who
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.360]  get a blood injection of the blood drug factor eight are 500 plus times more
[36:26.360 --> 36:32.840]  likely to get HIV and then full-blown AIDS everyone who gets it becomes HIV
[36:32.840 --> 36:38.720]  positive but over 500 times more likely to actually develop autoimmune disease
[36:39.080 --> 36:45.640]  that's just one little goodie and so what they do is they sit there and they
[36:45.640 --> 36:51.240]  are and this is admitted Israel South Africa England the US all the major
[36:51.240 --> 36:58.080]  countries with race specific bio weapons and they've got this tailored down as of
[36:58.080 --> 37:02.720]  more than 20 years ago where they can quickly an assembly line biotech
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.160]  engineering facility create a race specific weapon if you've got a blood
[37:06.160 --> 37:14.560]  sample of Alex Jones you can make inexpensively a bio weapon preferably
[37:14.560 --> 37:20.200]  they normally use an autoimmune type virus that causes cancer and Alex dies
[37:20.200 --> 37:30.640]  of cancer now they're freaking out they just had me on big Houston talk station
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.040]  talking about it because everybody's heard me lay this out the military is
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.400]  getting at the Pentagon I mean again I don't ever crystal ball 14 years ago I
[37:38.400 --> 37:45.560]  discovered this it's a UN program 37 years ago everywhere the globalist
[37:45.560 --> 37:52.280]  control that's almost every nation on earth started taking the blood 37 years
[37:52.280 --> 37:58.160]  ago and now they admit in the statesman oh it's for law enforcement purposes and
[37:58.160 --> 38:03.160]  the Pentagon and genetic engineering companies have it and oh now people go
[38:03.160 --> 38:08.160]  in to get gene therapy and they're told oh guess what we we got one of your blood
[38:08.160 --> 38:11.800]  samples this particular company did and you don't own your own genetics you've
[38:11.800 --> 38:20.040]  got to pay extra money now to have access to your own genes and what we're
[38:20.040 --> 38:26.120]  talking about is 37 years it's all old news can you imagine what they're doing
[38:26.120 --> 38:31.240]  and the media doesn't really talk about it so nobody really comments I'm getting
[38:31.240 --> 38:38.080]  my hair cut the lady cut my hair her boyfriend UT they forcing he didn't know
[38:38.080 --> 38:45.760]  he could a waiver at the time to get the hepatitis shots he contracts cancer he
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.320]  goes and looks up the studies finds out that that's linked to the cancer then
[38:50.320 --> 38:55.120]  they kill him in malpractice with a stint they put in his chest leaving it in
[38:55.120 --> 39:01.080]  got infected he died and then the girl next to us starts talking about how her
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.160]  boyfriend died of cancer oh how old was he oh this one guy was 30 the other guy
[39:05.160 --> 39:10.040]  was 25 somebody else goes really you know yeah my daughter's dying of cancer
[39:10.040 --> 39:15.000]  how old she oh she's 18 just everyone dying this cancer everywhere la la take
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.160]  the injections it's so much fun and all these newspaper reporters get to make
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.760]  jokes about me oh Alex Jones thinks they're taking blood Alex Jones thinks
[39:24.760 --> 39:32.280]  it's for bio weapons research it's so funny it's so cute now all you IRS
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.600]  employees all you FBI people all you cops who love the system and love to
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.680]  laugh at me go ahead take all the shots take your kids in for extra shots and
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.320]  maybe when they when you plant your kids in the ground maybe then you'll repent
[39:45.320 --> 39:49.840]  to God and hit your knees and realize I told you the truth and risked my life to
[39:49.840 --> 39:56.120]  do it I'm so sick of your cowardice I'm so sick of your weak-mindedness I'm so
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.680]  sick of the fact that you won't even look into what I have to say and how
[39:59.680 --> 40:08.560]  deadly serious this is I am sick of it and I'm sick of the killing and I'm
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.480]  sick of the population being exterminated like rats being treated
[40:13.480 --> 40:22.560]  like guinea pigs I have had it I have had it with all of it you fools that
[40:22.560 --> 40:26.840]  serve this evil system don't you understand the petty power you get is
[40:26.840 --> 40:32.000]  nothing compared to what you exchange for it no yeah your paychecks are going
[40:32.000 --> 40:41.880]  up everybody else's goes down and so that's coming up later when I get into
[40:41.880 --> 40:50.640]  the police state stack that we have here the police in Australia New Zealand
[40:50.640 --> 40:56.200]  Europe in Canada the United States it's all simultaneous CPS head start
[40:56.200 --> 41:00.840]  face scanning cameras everything's implemented globally in secret treaties
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.920]  that's now been declassified secret treaties on world ID secret treaties on
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.640]  banking secret treaties on the internet secret treaties on everything and they
[41:10.640 --> 41:19.280]  aren't real treaties because our Senate doesn't ratify them you have a
[41:19.280 --> 41:26.520]  government run by psychopathic killers at the top who love murdering people who
[41:26.520 --> 41:32.680]  love disease who love pain globalists when you study them they hate you live
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.600]  in a nice house with a swimming pool they hate your healthy wife they hate
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.040]  your healthy children they hate your healthy husband they hate you all they
[41:42.040 --> 41:45.600]  talk about in their own publications is how they can't wait to bankrupt you and
[41:45.600 --> 41:49.560]  drive you into total submission and make you poor and pathetic that's always been
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.480]  the pleasure of the kings and queens and of the lords of old dominating the
[41:54.480 --> 42:01.320]  peasants with forced austerity and bondage and the globalists are turning
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.760]  us into them they got all their torture porn some of the most popular movies in
[42:05.760 --> 42:11.760]  Hollywood things like hostile or women are tortured to death and their breast
[42:11.760 --> 42:15.720]  are sliced off and they're ripped apart and blood spills everywhere in video
[42:15.720 --> 42:19.800]  games where you play the part of police staging false flag terror for the
[42:19.800 --> 42:29.400]  greater good sells five hundred million dollars worth in one week the
[42:29.400 --> 42:33.520]  atmosphere is being turned into hell the mind of the average person is being
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.800]  turned into a selfish goblin like creature we're being prepared we're
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.320]  being dehumanized we're being trained to see our fellow men and women torn to
[42:43.320 --> 42:49.440]  pieces and to love it as entertainment simulated snuff films are all over TV and
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.680]  movies all scientifically crafted so that no one will stand up for you when
[42:53.680 --> 43:02.480]  you're being torn apart the only group were taught to worship and feel sorry
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.320]  for his government did a government agent stub their toe did a government
[43:07.320 --> 43:13.240]  agent get a cold did a government agent get hurt did a mother and father stand
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.880]  up to a CPS agent when they tried to take their child how dare them did someone
[43:18.880 --> 43:35.560]  fight back oh no oh no the only virtue were taught is worship a big brother
[43:35.560 --> 43:42.280]  the only mathematics were taught is two plus two equals ten the only god we're
[43:42.280 --> 43:48.120]  taught to worship is mindless television and money printed out of nothing that the
[43:48.120 --> 43:54.800]  majority people sell their souls for meanwhile this is only important because
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.800]  it shows the targeting of the population you know when you read a time
[43:58.800 --> 44:03.240]  magazine or Newsweek article saying there's no such thing as climate gate no
[44:03.240 --> 44:07.520]  emails exist you think this is ridiculous people know those are real emails and
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.920]  climate gates serious the UN's even admitted it you're not the target
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.200]  audience it's that 50 60% of the public that feels like they're part of the
[44:16.200 --> 44:19.960]  establishment that's playing make-believe and it's only designed for them to read
[44:19.960 --> 44:27.760]  it and laugh and giggle and sloth off their responsibility to stand up against
[44:27.760 --> 44:39.320]  corruption think of what the globalist think of the average person these
[44:39.320 --> 44:45.040]  reporters are hired because they are duplicitous spin masters and they know
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.200]  to dumb their propaganda down the lowest common denominator sure you read this
[44:49.200 --> 45:01.760]  Financial Times of London article attacking me in fact all I have is Paul
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.280]  Watson's article about this we actually print me the article because I want the
[45:06.280 --> 45:13.280]  headline from it it's the first link in the article Financial Times writer
[45:13.280 --> 45:18.360]  compares Alex Jones with OKC Timothy McVeigh you just put it on screen for
[45:18.360 --> 45:27.240]  me and I'm in the headline and he goes on to say there's no such thing as
[45:27.240 --> 45:30.680]  world government were completely insane this is a guy that's written multiple
[45:30.680 --> 45:39.080]  articles he's their head foreign affairs correspondent calling for a
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.240]  tyrannical unelected authoritarian government he calls from authoritarian
[45:43.240 --> 45:51.280]  government that's a quote and in this article he says that I am Tim McVeigh he
[45:51.280 --> 45:59.080]  says I come from Tim McVeigh I am Tim McVeigh and then he lies lies further
[45:59.080 --> 46:04.600]  with a ball face line he says I called him up like an insane shaved head person
[46:04.600 --> 46:09.680]  this is a quote from San Quentin frantically telling him to come on the
[46:09.680 --> 46:15.240]  show well I might call one out of five hundred guest you know maybe I want to
[46:15.240 --> 46:17.920]  talk to Jesse Ventura about something off air I call him hey governor we come
[46:17.920 --> 46:22.080]  on sure Alex loved her sometimes he calls me I might call a Ron Paul up
[46:22.080 --> 46:30.040]  myself or a Charlie Sheen but 99.9% of the time my office calls and they are
[46:30.040 --> 46:38.560]  very polite and calm but he says no I called him and left frantic messages so
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.680]  he ignored me so he paints the picture of I thought it was someone in San
[46:42.680 --> 46:47.160]  Quentin so I'm a prisoner then he talks about McVeigh so the whole thing is I
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.840]  need to be locked up and and he knows that the the weak mind will read the
[46:51.840 --> 46:57.600]  article and hear about someone being in San Quentin so the image is I'm a
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.760]  criminal and then he ends it with I'm basically McVeigh this is the financial
[47:02.760 --> 47:11.360]  times of London foreign affairs head editor in probably the most prestigious
[47:11.360 --> 47:17.760]  newspaper in the world owned by a Bilderberg group member this is what
[47:17.760 --> 47:23.400]  they think of you they think you're so stupid that this tribe will work it's
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.240]  designed though for the ignorant now the good news is there's hundreds of
[47:28.240 --> 47:36.560]  comments and over 90% of them are eloquent our research are focused and
[47:36.560 --> 47:41.520]  eviscerate this guy and that's the good news they'll have articles about Michael
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.680]  Jackson or about Tiger Woods and half of them are about the the comments are
[47:46.680 --> 47:50.960]  you're not manipulating us with your new order brainwashing we know the serious
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.280]  issues of the banks robbing trillions the public is awake and the last
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.680]  domino to fall is that the public still hasn't figured out we are the massive
[48:00.680 --> 48:12.400]  majority look at this article world government Alex Jones and me by Gideon
[48:12.400 --> 48:19.360]  Rockman Rickman to this day the most successful article I've ever written
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.400]  was a column called and now for world government by successful I don't mean
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.880]  that it was pickly good article this is success defined in terms of internet
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.520]  hits I noticed the other day that if I type my name into Google one of the
[48:33.520 --> 48:39.240]  first popular search suggestions is Gideon Rickman world government which
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.840]  yields over 40,000 results getting in right man in new world order produces
[48:42.840 --> 48:49.680]  844,000 results and it goes on the common thread I think is that my world
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.000]  government piece was picked up by the Looney right in America as grist for
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.160]  their conspiracy theory he says private bankers running the world we're
[48:58.160 --> 49:01.560]  setting it up we've been building it quietly it is authoritarian for your
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.640]  own good he puts a link to his article from last year and then says we're
[49:05.640 --> 49:11.640]  crazy it doesn't exist that isn't stupidity that's like O'Brien torturing
[49:11.640 --> 49:15.520]  Winston saying two plus two equals five he's teaching you he's saying I'm gonna
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.640]  push world government but then if you say you don't like it I'm gonna say
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.840]  you're insane it doesn't exist that's two plus two equals five they're going
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.080]  after the fashionable the trendy the cool oh well you know if he sits there
[49:32.080 --> 49:34.760]  and insults me and says it doesn't exist even when he's calling for it and says
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.440]  it doesn't exist I better go along with what Mr. Reichman says because I don't
[49:38.440 --> 49:44.120]  want to be cookie the common thread I think is my world government piece was
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.320]  picked up by the Looney right the right huh yet he tries to divide us as
[49:48.320 --> 49:52.280]  grist for the conspiracy theory that there is a secret plot to create a
[49:52.280 --> 49:54.720]  world government and to deprive Americans of their freedom well that's
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.520]  what you said at the time the article was published there was a particularly
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.960]  persistent radio host who kept trying to interview me but then a valence Joan
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.640]  something about him made me decide to steer clear maybe it was the crazed tone
[50:06.640 --> 50:12.200]  of the message left on my answering machine maybe it was the fact that his
[50:12.200 --> 50:16.920]  program is called prison planet this guy can't even get that right the website's
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.360]  prison planet punk I had a vision of a shaved head nutcase speed dialing me
[50:22.360 --> 50:25.880]  from San Quentin from a cell in San Quentin's I'll say I'm a criminal
[50:25.880 --> 50:32.800]  there there's the image but it seems I was wrong Alex Jones is at large oh see
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.240]  oh I'm at large like like some roving monster in the countryside like some
[50:37.240 --> 50:43.960]  ogre or grizzly bear or night vapor but it seems I was wrong Alex Jones is at
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.200]  large and broadcasting from a radio station in Texas he is according to
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.760]  this article the host of the most popular conspiracy talk radio program in
[50:52.760 --> 51:00.960]  America that's Texas Monthly and we'll come back and go over the rest of it and
[51:00.960 --> 51:08.080]  there's so much more coming up today is it safe to breathe anymore crowded public

[52:16.720 --> 52:22.320]  Americans at home turn in its influence on our president in Congress and they
[52:22.320 --> 52:27.440]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[52:27.440 --> 52:31.800]  citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[52:31.800 --> 52:37.040]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[52:37.040 --> 52:41.360]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[52:41.360 --> 52:44.840]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[52:44.840 --> 52:50.080]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[54:18.160 --> 54:25.400]  people pay to have low-grade propaganda designed for morons that he
[54:25.400 --> 54:27.400]  shoveled into their gullets
[54:27.400 --> 54:32.920]  heart and body is forever when you're just a little kid so
[54:32.920 --> 54:37.720]  Cyrus Jones lived forever grave digger
[54:37.720 --> 54:40.680]  grave digger when you dig my grave
[54:40.680 --> 54:51.240]  dig my grave would you make a shallow soul so I can feel the rain
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.000]  grave digger
[54:58.000 --> 55:06.440]  mural stormwall 193 to 1954 she lost both of her babies in the second
[55:06.440 --> 55:13.320]  gray wall now you should never have to watch your only children lower than the
[55:13.320 --> 55:19.320]  ground I mean you should never have to bury your own babies
[55:19.320 --> 55:23.320]  grave digger when you dig my grave
[55:23.320 --> 55:33.320]  make it shallow could you make a shallow soul so but I can feel the rain
[55:33.320 --> 55:39.320]  grave digger continuing with this hit piece
[55:42.320 --> 55:47.440]  but it seems I was wrong Alex Jones is at large he said I should basically be in
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.160]  San Quentin and broadcasting radio station in Texas he is according to
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.720]  this article the host of the most popular conspiracy talk radio program
[55:54.720 --> 56:00.120]  in America this may sound like rather a small niche but it isn't Jones has a
[56:00.120 --> 56:08.200]  big following he also feels a lively sense of rivalry with the much more
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.960]  famous right-wing randor Glenn Beck Jones simultaneously denounces Beck as a
[56:13.960 --> 56:18.320]  shell out and accuses him of plagiarizing all his own best ideas so
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.840]  that's to say I'm inconsistent no I say Glenn Beck plagiarizes the key stories
[56:23.840 --> 56:28.120]  we cover but then spins them and then flip flops we weren't for the bank or
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.120]  bailout we don't believe global warming is real we're not attacking Debra
[56:31.120 --> 56:38.080]  Medina or Ron Paul we're not saying we need value-added taxes and sales taxes
[56:38.080 --> 56:48.800]  no no no and you know that the rivalry is telling for Jones rantings are not
[56:48.800 --> 56:52.800]  that far removed from the anti-government anti-Obama conspiracy theories
[56:52.800 --> 56:57.440]  peddled by much more famous media personalities like Glenn Beck and Rush
[56:57.440 --> 57:04.480]  Limbaugh so they try to discredit us all together and the theories of Jones
[57:04.480 --> 57:08.320]  himself are not that far removed from those of the militia movement that came
[57:08.320 --> 57:13.280]  to prominence after the Oklahoma bombing which was a government inside
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.920]  job like the Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh Jones was radicalized by the
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.760]  FBI's bloody assault on the branch to video religious sect in Waco Texas in
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.160]  93 in fact it seems to me that there is a thin but direct line of anti-government
[57:29.160 --> 57:34.320]  paranoia that leads you from Jones back to the Tea Party movement to Beck that is
[57:34.320 --> 57:44.920]  now such a powerful force in US policies or does that sound like a conspiracy
[57:44.920 --> 57:52.880]  theory and Paul Watson has an excellent article dissecting all of this and
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.160]  really breaking it down I suggest you go get it at prisonplanet.com and info
[57:58.160 --> 58:05.040]  wars.com financial times writer compares Alex Jones with OKC bomber Tim McVeigh

[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:09.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:14.600]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:18.000]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.800]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:27.960]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:32.480]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:37.160]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:41.200]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.880]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:49.680]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have

[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:42.960]  some bands with him so did Joe Healy and many others in Austin we're going to be
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:47.160]  going over some breaking news and information here on air that's very
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:51.240]  important that points directly at false flag terror and recapping the other
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:56.440]  evidence for that case I'm still not sure but breaking information coming up on
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:00.640]  that front we've been researching this the last three days as we first saw the
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:05.720]  information in other news look at this ABC news of Australia one of their big
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:15.200]  national TV networks the Australian broadcasting system ABC news give folks a
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:23.960]  document cam shot kangaroos poisoned by fluoride the environmental
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:28.120]  protection authority says fluoride from Alcoa's aluminum smelter at Portland is
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:32.040]  making kangaroos sick well why not just put it in the water supply oh that's
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:37.880]  what you do it's the byproduct from the purification process of aluminum
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:42.920]  manufacturing and the byproduct of fertilizer manufacturing and you just
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:48.160]  dump it in our water that and over 150 chemicals on average some systems get
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:54.440]  over 300 the EPA admits this but oh the public just laughs about it haha
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:59.000]  Dr. Strangelove Stanley Kubrick made a joke about that well here it is and all
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:05.160]  over the country it's been known for decades and decades that a lot of farms
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:10.120]  and ranches that butt up on towns and cities that get municipal water for their
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:14.960]  cows and horses stop giving it to them and have to dig wells because cows and
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.800]  horses are so susceptible and see fluoride builds up it doesn't leave the
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.200]  body it sticks it goes to your organs and bones and it ends up killing the
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:27.120]  horses and cows you can go to YouTube and just type in horses and cows sick
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:30.400]  from fluoride pigs sick from fluoride chickens sick from you'll see local
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:34.440]  newscast where they go yeah we we've been giving them fluoride for six months in
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:38.960]  the water and they're all dying their hair falls out they get bone fractures
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:44.120]  they get cancer this is what we drink and you say well I don't drink fluoridated
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:47.600]  water I drink purified water when you take a bath or shower you absorb through
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:58.320]  your skin it's so diabolical that all of this is going on now I haven't confirmed
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:08.440]  this yet and I'm going to try to go find the audio of it well we it says the
[1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:11.720]  audios here I was given this during the break and so guys will you cue this up
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:16.680]  where they say they have audio in this article the headline is and we'll get
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:21.360]  this linked up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com Debra Medina agrees
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:28.840]  that 9-11 truthers beliefs are despicable and she was on this particular
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:32.680]  radio show that fills in for Rush Limbaugh out of Dallas Mark Davis who's
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:37.320]  attacked me routinely and lied about me he said I said kill Michelle Malkin
[1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:41.080]  even after the Denver Post and others retracted and said other people that
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:44.600]  were with Malcolm were screaming it to set me up he still went ahead with that
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.240]  in the Dallas Morning News so the Dallas Morning News was then retracted the
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:55.080]  story but he never retracted he he still says it on air and we have the
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:58.800]  transcript of it you know you know my issue is what Debra Medina said about
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:01.760]  people have a right to investigate and a right to question just like six of the
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:06.920]  ten 9-11 commissioners have said I've said hey it's you know it's her right to
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:13.840]  not come out on 9-11 truth or to believe that it could be an inside job but
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:18.080]  Debra Medina can't play politics here now that she's given good answers because
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.680]  I've seen other speeches in TV where she said a lot of people have questions we
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.680]  don't know what happened in separate interviews and it's very concerning if
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:31.560]  this is true to see a flip-flop after she's made repeated statements for a new
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:36.680]  investigation similar to what Palin has said to then come out and say I agree
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:46.840]  it's despicable do you guys have the audio yet let's go ahead we're gonna
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.160]  go ahead and play the clip right now let's go ahead and play the clip for
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:55.240]  everybody to hear it right now here it is wrap up the the 9-11 thing and then I
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:58.640]  want you to get to what you want to talk about for these remaining weeks of the
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:05.200]  campaign I seriously well indeed so my assertion is it would have been over by
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:08.840]  now would have been over in a day if after the back thing you just said boy
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:12.760]  I'm sorry I messed up I should have identified this 9-11 truth or movement
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.040]  as the despicable paranoid cult that they are what a horrible hateful belief to
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:21.160]  have in your head that 9-11 was an inside job why didn't you do that yeah I
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:26.360]  am I agree with you Mark you know I laughed it off whenever he said I was a
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:31.040]  truth or cuz I thought it was so absurd and I and I I should have just said no
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.880]  absolutely I'm not a truth or I think it's abundantly clear I'm not a
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:41.480]  truth or you know those those things happen to us and we pick up say should
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.560]  have done that better move on and that's what we've done then there's just one
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:48.640]  other thing that's left because not being a truth or is great I'm thinking
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:53.240]  of course you're not of course you're not but sometimes the wisdom is defined
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:58.800]  by knowing whom to praise and whom to quite frankly condemn someone walking
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.580]  around with the belief that America would do this to its own people the
[1:14:01.580 --> 1:14:05.080]  president Bush and those around him would slaughter our own citizens in order
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:10.480]  to justify war is a despicable thing to great and and if that's it you want to
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:16.200]  be on record is agreeing with that agreed yeah okay I okay look I'll say
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:21.360]  this right here and right now Rick Perry is bad news K. Belly Hutchinson's a
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:27.880]  Bilderberg group member not just an attendee but this is very disturbing
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:33.080]  very very disturbing if she wanted to come out day one and want to control our
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:39.520]  borders get rid of property taxes stand up for sovereignty send a message
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:43.600]  nationwide for true constitutional is to get elected to the Republican Party to
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:50.360]  state office that would be fine but what is bad about this is she said a lot of
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:54.800]  people have questions they have a right to their opinion we need to investigate
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:59.560]  this I mean I she's done TV and radio interviews countless times since then
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.400]  saying look people have a right and she said it at speeches so for one audience
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:10.640]  she's saying one thing and for another audience she's saying another thing and
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:15.800]  I'm gonna withdraw my support for Deborah Medina in this election if I don't
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:21.440]  hear an apology and a clarification on this because she needs to explain
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.560]  herself for him to sit there and say we're despicable we're horrible we're
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.480]  evil really I just showed you a new declassified State Department document
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:35.120]  from the State Department history site where the Bobby Kennedy wanted to blow
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:42.880]  up the U.S. Embassy in Honduras to blame it on foreign governments operation
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:47.000]  Northwoods it's declassified they stage the Gulf of Tonkin it's an army field
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.200]  manual they give captains in black ops how to stage terror attacks I mean
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:16:03.160]  governments do this and and now MSNBC is demonizing MSNBC is demonizing in a
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:08.880]  big big way along with the New York Post and others the firefighters police and
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:12.520]  medical workers saying it's a despicable conspiracy theory and they just want
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:17.400]  money that they're sick from asbestos and concrete and pulverized glass when
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:21.520]  all the major medical facilities have done CAT scans their lungs are just full
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:26.400]  of it now that's a despicable conspiracy theory I mean we have the former
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:31.280]  head of the U.S. Embassy visa section on to tell you on record that those guys
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:34.920]  from Saudi Arabia Mohammed Atta and others were let in by the CIA and
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:38.480]  protected we have Stephen Butler the head of the defense language school on
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.960]  records saying Mohammed Atta and others were trained at their base that's
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:46.600]  associated press what I'm not supposed to be it's despicable that I'm aware of a
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:51.600]  history of government sponsored terror and I'm a horrible person and 84% of
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:55.320]  Americans in an Angus and Reed New York Times poll question the official story
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:58.840]  I want a new investigation and six of the 10 commissioners and Mr. Farmer the
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:01.920]  head of the Commission and Homeland Security Director Ridge writes a best
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.280]  selling book last year saying they would issue fake terror alerts for political
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:09.520]  gain that's a form of terrorism under the Patriot Act it's an act of terror to
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:17.640]  put out a fake terror call again I like Lou Dobbs because I disagree with him on
[1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:23.560]  the drug ward a few issues but he's the same today yesterday tomorrow and I
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:28.480]  agree with him on NAFTA and GATT the New World Order and sovereignty Michael
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.120]  Savage isn't perfect but he's the same 10 years ago he's the same today he's
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:37.160]  saying Obama may stage terror attacks in America but he says he will and we know
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.520]  the underwear bombing was it's on record the government got him on the plane in
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:45.600]  Amsterdam that's confirmed and the FBI lied about it at first I'm not supposed
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.400]  to question that I'm despicable to all my family listening in Dallas to the
[1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:55.960]  number one talk station I'm despicable you agree that I'm bad you Deborah
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.480]  Medina is part of the in the Fed people she knows full well I never even brought
[1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:02.960]  up 9-11 truth with her she knows full well that a large part of her grassroots
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  supporters that launched her campaign we're not a little bit down we go to the
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:09.720]  subject of Ron Paul Ron Paul will get up on national TV and say I'm worried
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:15.120]  about stage provocations he will say governments do stage crises he talked
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:19.560]  about he's worried about a gulf of Tonka to get us into war with Iran he says he
[1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:23.640]  doesn't believe 9-11's an inside job and that's his right but he's never
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:27.480]  flip-flopped and when he's been asked are you against these despicable people
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:31.040]  all over TV he says no they're not despicable they have a right to ask
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:36.640]  questions see Deborah Medina doesn't have to be a carbon copy of what we are
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:40.120]  but the establishment and in their internal memos at the White House
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:43.680]  currently cast Sunstein and others are deadly afraid of 9-11 truth because
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:48.040]  people start thinking about whose stages crises fake global warming that's a
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:52.240]  fake terror attack sea levels will rise showing kids you know animals drowning

[1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:59.160]  polar bears are gonna die that's a form of stage terror telling you you're gonna
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:02.400]  die the flu if you don't take a dangerous vaccine and lying to you not
[1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:05.640]  telling you it has mercury in it or can cause neurological disorders that's a
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:11.160]  form of fake terror people start getting this and it was declassified that
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:15.640]  Cheney wanted to stage a gulf of Tonkin two years ago it goes declassified that
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:19.920]  a year before that three years ago he wanted to stage a terror attack to
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:25.360]  blame it on Iran that's MSNBC that's New Yorker magazine that's Cy Hirsch I mean
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:31.560]  I'm despicable now I don't look I'm not gonna put a lot of energy into this but
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:35.080]  I'm sure people say oh how dare you so I probably will I'll just get Deborah
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:39.360]  Medina in all these conversations and all these speeches she's given since the

[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:28.880]  have been over by now would have been over in a day if after the Beck thing
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:33.120]  you to said boy I'm sorry I messed up I should have identified this 9-11 truth
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:36.840]  or movement as the despicable paranoid cult that they are what a horrible
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.720]  hateful belief to have in your head that 9-11 was an inside job why didn't you do
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:46.880]  that yeah I agree with you Mark you know I laughed it off whenever he he said I
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.280]  was a truth or cuz I thought it was so absurd and I and I I should have just
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.640]  said no absolutely I'm not a truth or I think it's abundantly clear I'm not a
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:02.240]  truth or you know those those things happen to us and we pick up say should
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:06.320]  have done that better move on and that's what we've done then there's just one
[1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:09.400]  other thing that's left because not being a truth or is great I'm thinking
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:13.640]  of course you're not of course you're not but sometimes that the wisdom is
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:19.240]  defined by knowing whom to praise and whom to quite frankly condemn someone
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:22.240]  walking around with the belief that America would do this to its own people
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:25.880]  President Bush and those around him would slaughter our own citizens in order to
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:31.200]  justify war is a despicable thing to great and and if that said you want to
[1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:36.680]  be on record is agreeing with that agreed yeah I'm I I was thinking in terms
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:41.720]  of a commission report not in terms of what you know individuals are out there
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:47.320]  doing and the the commission report I think is the is the thing that I was
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:51.520]  getting back to none of which as you indicate has a direct impact on what's
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:56.320]  going on in Texas right now with the exception of we ought to be concerned
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:59.560]  about terrorism and what's coming across our southern border indeed right let's
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:04.600]  have an address that issue and we really need to be focused on that we you know I
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:09.200]  don't have time to track Glenn Beck Sarah Palin much less Deborah Medina and
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:12.240]  watch everything you're doing but I've seen three or four video clips of her
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:16.200]  and speeches after the Glenn Beck situation saying people have a right
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.520]  people have questions there they have a right to question with what our
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.280]  government's done in the past we don't know what happened you know what happened
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.560]  with you know with that building falling and then now she goes on a show I mean
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:33.320]  this is the one thing I won't put up with folks is is duplicity is flip-flopping
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:38.680]  and I tell you what you know early on they asked for our support we got our
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:41.640]  listeners to donate money get them off the ground you know it's like Ron Paul
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:46.040]  in 2007 he sat on air half their early support when he's running for president
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:51.680]  the first six months was from the show and Ron Paul comes on he's been attacked
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:58.840]  on TV for doing it he never stabs me in the back but I'll tell you this this is
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:06.480]  very upsetting you know and you notice after she even denied us after she even
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:10.480]  threw us under the bus notice he came back at her and said yes but it's the
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.120]  decision-making process of a leader you should have answered that right right
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:21.240]  away he's still attacking her he's a clear channel radio host they gave they
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:25.440]  had a clear channel gave a half million bucks to Perry they're not gonna be your
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:31.920]  friend lady what this means is if she gets into office maybe it's better to
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:35.040]  just keep Perry in so everybody hates him more and the government gets more
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.360]  discredited and we have fought back his nap to highways and his guard of sale
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:43.440]  maybe it's better to have a lame duck Perry in there people just get angry
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:47.720]  instead of putting a supposed Patriot in who will then flip-flop anytime there's
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:51.840]  heat or anytime the neocon stage an event and then we the Patriot movement
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:57.880]  gets blamed you know that's my problem of Glenn Beck posing as us that's my
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:01.240]  problem is because then when he gets discredited which he's meant to do by
[1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:10.880]  design we get discredited I've had it and I just can't hold back anymore it's
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.880]  like with a traffic can interview I knew what he was gonna say I had him on I
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:19.680]  can't hold back what's going on in this country anymore lives too short I woke
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:23.720]  up at 1.50 in the morning last night and couldn't go back to sleep just just
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:30.560]  just saying Alex you got to go all the way on all the issues traffic can't
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:34.200]  certainly in perfect but he's for real and he doesn't flip-flop and he stood
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:39.480]  up for people on taxes and I am and I just can't handle it anymore I can't
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:45.880]  handle politicians and Debra Medina is a nurse she's a good lady been a good
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:48.920]  lady and I don't know who her political advisors are no she's got there's been a
[1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:52.560]  shake-up in her campaign some of the old people aren't there anymore and I don't
[1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:58.640]  know who's advising her but you've already lost the 9-11 hater crowd okay
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:02.000]  the neocons already the job on you Glenn Beck already put your picture up
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.880]  next to Van Jones and said these people hate America last Thursday pointing at
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.800]  you you're not going to get idiots that don't see through Glenn back back yet to
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:15.800]  stand on principle and say look I agree people should be allowed to ask for a
[1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:22.080]  new investigation but no we are despicable you have attacked us Debra
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:28.240]  Medina you have attacked me so I don't want to hear I'm attacking you you drew
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:34.880]  blood on us you attacked us you drew first blood that's the way it is I think
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:37.600]  everybody should call her campaign and email her and tell her where her
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  support comes from and tell her you want to apologize you right now Glenn Beck
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:44.600]  lost a half million viewers when I went after him in the last two weeks
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:49.160]  defending your sorry bike what do you think's gonna happen now when I come

[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:35.840]  radio show we've been looking for five minutes for Debra Medina after the
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:40.880]  glenbeck interview saying people have a right to ask how those towers fell this
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:45.720]  is why I'm angry we put everything behind somebody we support them from
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:50.080]  obscurity and then they go on a big syndicated radio show and throw us under
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:56.000]  the bus saying we're despicable now is this Debra Medina despicable this is
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.040]  this is two days after the glenbeck fiasco two weeks ago here she is here it
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:06.240]  is people are asking questions I think the questions that I've heard asked her
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:12.160]  how those buildings fell right and I don't I don't I'm not the engineer to
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:16.360]  know that and I think those are good for element questions to ask that's not
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:19.440]  that's not saying our government was involved I don't know that I think our
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.200]  government was involved I think they're questions that need to be asked we need
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:26.160]  to elect people who are natural born citizens according there you go there you go
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:30.680]  I mean I'm not putting up with this anymore okay I want that clear I'm not
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:36.240]  putting up with it all right she did the bad thing you understand that and we
[1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:40.360]  can't pull our punches we need people elected that do what they say they're
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:44.640]  gonna do okay I wasn't mad at her when she said I'm not in line 11 truth or
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:47.960]  but I support people's right in America to ask questions and about how those
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:54.520]  buildings fell then a couple weeks later there's a new Debra Medina and she's
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:03.560]  saying we're despicable now let's show Debra Medina and whoever's gotten in
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:08.040]  control of her campaign there's been a big shake up there let's show her who
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:12.400]  her real supporters are and were you make your decision what you're gonna do
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:22.360]  about this but let me give you their number it's 877 we Texans or 877-938-3926
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:29.440]  877-938-3926 you call them today you call them tomorrow and you tell them what
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:38.440]  you think about this okay 877-938-3926 I'll hand it to the one Democrat
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:43.120]  candidate that billionaire haircare product guy Farooq Shammy he's come out
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.200]  and said looks like an inside job to him I don't like him on a lot of his other
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:59.400]  policies but at least at least the guys got guts and guts is enough we can't
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:04.040]  compromise our values again if she'd have come out and said she didn't believe
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:07.360]  9-11 truth I never asked her that when she was here don't you think I knew that
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:11.280]  would have made major headlines for my show if I would have asked her about 9
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:17.440]  11 truth you hear me ask Ron Paul about 9 11 truth when he's here no I try to
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:22.960]  support them Ron Paul though always gives a tip of his hat to everybody on the
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:26.480]  show and says I'm worried about staged events I'm worried about stage crises I'm
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:34.160]  worried about a Gulf of Tonkin with Iran Ron Paul will get up and say the CIA's
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:38.300]  bringing in the drugs and has had a coup of this country I'll say this about you
[1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:43.360]  Deborah Medina you're inexperienced and new and that's the only reason I'm not
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.480]  even more angry and I saw this I read it I heard the audio and I got angry as a
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:56.120]  lot of other people are getting angry because if she'll flip-flop like this
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  why not just have Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Rick Perry 877 we Texans 8779383926
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:12.800]  give me a document cam shot on this or the non-toll line 9 you can call and
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:20.840]  spend some of your own money I guess you already sent her enough 9 7 9 5 3 2 5 6
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.680]  5 1 9 7 9 5 3 2 5 6 5 1 you tell me what her office said with all the little
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:34.160]  expert politicos in there but you notice she threw us under the bus and that
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:39.880]  Mark Davis slimeball still said yeah but my second point is you answered that
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:45.040]  wrong and it shows you don't have the wisdom you don't have the leadership
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:50.120]  they're not gonna support you lady all you had was your integrity that's all
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:54.840]  anybody's got in this world and you have started to sacrifice that and this is

[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.880]  wanted to stage terror attacks against Latin American countries is a pretext
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:30.040]  for war blowing up US embassies what I'm not supposed to read Northwood's ABC news
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:36.040]  I'm not supposed to know what's going on I'm not I'm just supposed to shut up that
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:39.960]  means if she gets political heat then they must not be worried now she gets
[1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:45.400]  elected that means if she ever gets any political heat she'll just flip flop queue
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.200]  up that tape again of the news that was what Houston TV show the same thing on
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.080]  Dallas I've seen like five of these we just found this since in your clips

[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:04.520]  strangely I think people have a right to know and six of the 10 911
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:07.400]  commissioners have a serious question so yeah we need new investigation I think
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:15.680]  people it's reasonable to ask that no not now no sir no sir just like I'm
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:21.800]  supposed to support Glenn Beck when he's saying global warming is real in USA
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:25.160]  today or when he's calling for value added taxes or when he's saying Ron Paul
[1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:29.280]  supporters are basically terrorist and I get these idiot Glenn Beck supporters
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.320]  email me so I've never seen that I want proof well go to my website and do a
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:38.920]  search on it for Glenn Beck a tax Ron Paul or Glenn Beck calls for taxes look

[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:34.040]  fits wear it we have got a hellish government using the cameras and school
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:38.800]  computers they give the kids to watch them and it's admitted we have a
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:42.760]  government I mean look at the type of news I have here in front of me Bayer
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:48.640]  pesticide banned over threat to honey bees kidney damage in 12% of Chinese
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:52.920]  children exposed to melamine contaminated dairy products science daily
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:58.720]  meanwhile a year and a half ago it was killing making kids sick here EPA FDA
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.600]  FDA said melamine's no longer bad for you now that's big news folks here's a
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:10.120]  slate story the chemist war how the US government killed at least 10,000 people
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:16.480]  by pose poisoning liquor to kill people during prohibition I mean this is your
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:19.760]  stinking government this is who they are this is who they are we're not the
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:24.200]  radicals it's the criminals running government that are radical where's the
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:29.600]  kangaroo story out of ABC news look at this the kangaroos drink the water that
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:35.560]  humans are drinking and they die ask any farmer rancher who's had been in a
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:39.800]  drought and given municipal water to cows and horses it kills them within a
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:45.440]  year they get sick within a few months you're drinking this stuff okay this
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:51.800]  isn't time to be cowards it isn't time to mince words it isn't time to back off
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:57.440]  you think this is a game we're playing this is war this is info war this is for
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:04.880]  real I'm for real and that's why we're the number one alternative radio show
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.000]  and websites on the planet because people that have discernment and know
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:14.400]  how to see the fruit they know and I'm staring down the barrel of a gun doing
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:17.080]  what I'm doing I'm going up against a freight train going a hundred miles an
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:20.360]  hour what are you doing to defend freedom what are you doing no more
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:26.840]  compromise with baloney kangaroos poisoned by fluoride the environment
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:31.640]  protection authority says for fluoride from alcoa's aluminum smelter at
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.560]  Portland is making kangaroos sick the EPA's Bruce Dawson they have the same
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:41.440]  agency over there says the fluoride is being absorbed by the nearby vegetation
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:44.040]  which is them being eaten by the kangaroos they now spray in the last
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:48.640]  three years on most food crops fluoride as a pesticide oh it kills bugs then it
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:53.320]  goes through the the different plants membranes precipitates out and then you
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:44:00.760]  eat it he says the fluoride poisons the kangaroos and makes lesions grow on
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:04.960]  their bones which renders them lame once kangaroos a restricted movement it is
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:08.000]  significant impact on their welfare so this is something that needs to be
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.640]  managed and avoided yeah have you noticed in the major studies over a 300
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:16.200]  percent increase in different degenerative diseases of the bones and
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:30.680]  arthritis since they've been fluoridating since the late 40s oh I don't
[1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:36.320]  even know what to do anymore I don't even know what to say anymore you know I
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:40.440]  know why people some people out there and the government plays off of this
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:45.360]  cast Sunstein talks about it and it's White House memos how to get patriots
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:49.640]  and anti-globalists fighting with each other I know why some people out there
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:53.040]  don't trust me because hell most the time you can't trust anybody you can't
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:58.360]  trust it just makes me sick you know who I trust I trust you the listeners I
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:01.360]  trust you the grassroots I trust you the people that make this country run and
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:03.960]  work the good hard working people that are standing up against the new world
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:08.560]  order and we've come so far and there are good men and women running for office
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:11.600]  all over this country that will not compromise and that's why the globalist
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  and their own internal memos are scared this is a big deal that ever Medina's
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:24.400]  done it's a big deal and it makes me sick
[1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:37.680]  it actually makes me sick I mean I feel nauseous right now I rarely rarely get
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:48.720]  that upset I've never betrayed anybody who's worked with me or been around me
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:56.080]  I've always been steadfast I've always been true I've always been an honorable
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:03.120]  person and it took me 26 27 years of my life even when I was aware politically
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:08.280]  active I was probably 26 27 till I learned you can't trust most people I thought
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:15.920]  everybody was like me growing up honorable strong yes angry yes aggressive
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:30.160]  yes violent but real I'll tell you the listeners this you know you're good you
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:32.960]  know you out there listening you know your heart is right so you be the
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:42.320]  leader you step up we need you take action I want to get into this story now
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:50.680]  and there's so many facets to it over a decade ago I told you that webcams were
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:55.600]  being remotely accessed over 10 years ago I told you that scientific Atlantic
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:59.080]  cable boxes with the audio sensor the microphone were being used that
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:04.480]  everything you do on major science on complex digital cable boxes basically
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:08.560]  all the cable boxes that are out there now they've phased them in are tracking
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.280]  everything you're doing watching you that's now all admitted your cell phones
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:18.520]  tracking you watching you it's all mainstream news and they just condition
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:21.840]  you and condition you I mean I remember 12 13 years ago reading Pentagon
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:25.440]  documents how they plan to microchip the whole population how they were going to
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:29.360]  sell it under the guise of
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:39.080]  security under the guise of VIP getting into better clubs and facilities how
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:42.160]  they were going to sell it and the guise of helping Alzheimer's patients
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:45.480]  prisoners and people would laugh at me because they hadn't heard it yet oh
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.440]  microchips under our skin yeah right now here we are 10 11 years later and
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:52.880]  just oh yeah all sorts of governments are making their politicians take them
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:56.560]  and having their their attorney general's office in Mexico everybody get
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:48:00.000]  chips and yeah okay so what tell me something I hadn't heard we've all been
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.400]  conditioned to accept it and now Google comes out four years ago says we're
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:08.680]  gonna watch you and listen to you with the webcams not even ask don't say you
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:14.560]  weren't warned the head of Google Schmidt says hey don't do something on your
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:21.480]  computer you're ashamed of and then it comes out in Philadelphia that the
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:26.240]  principal just thinks it's normal he's out in the open he's out in front of
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:36.960]  everybody running around saying that yeah I saw you Billy at home doing
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:39.200]  something weren't supposed to your bedroom last night they're like what and
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:42.200]  the parents are still somewhat normal and not brainwashed they go wait you're
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:46.240]  watching us at home off the computer we paid for that the school gave us in
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:50.400]  quotes we're gonna sue you and the principal went well I mean it's only
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:53.640]  for your safety okay we you know we do access these remotely but it's only for
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:56.200]  security purposes to make sure the laptop wasn't stolen and they go wait a
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:03.000]  minute this laptop wasn't stolen and then Steve Watson found a frontline
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:08.480]  video clip we're gonna play for the break from a year ago and we think this is
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:13.440]  out of context you can link through on the PBS link we've got to the entire
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:20.880]  piece the frontline piece is on their site for free PBS how great it is that
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:24.760]  they're sitting there watching the kids on their laptops at school and they
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:28.360]  don't even know this remote accessing and they've got cameras in school
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:33.200]  bathrooms school showers it's come out in South Carolina and Tennessee and
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:38.160]  California and Michigan that the law enforcement in other states is accessing
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:44.880]  it just perverts criminals and they think you'll go along with anything
[1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:49.440]  authority says so we're authority we're now gonna watch you at home yes we're
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:54.120]  gonna watch your daughters and sons in the showers at the school and because
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:57.440]  they rolled it out and brainwashed the school and the parents submitted in that
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:01.920]  test a visiting basketball team of girls is there sees a camera in the shower
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:06.240]  panics and runs out parents are cussing screaming in the parking lot after the
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:10.000]  basketball game of the visiting team taking a shower that was normal what's
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.120]  going on I mean if you found a hidden camera in your house would you get upset
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:16.000]  if your neighbor did it you get upset the government did it you'd probably say
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.200]  well I guess or the government I if somebody came to your door and knocked
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:24.960]  on it and said we want to put a camera in your house just for your safeties that
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:28.720]  are oh sure no you say get out of here pervert but the government does it in
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:31.960]  corporations do it without asking and it's like well I guess it's all right and
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:37.120]  this front line piece reports it like it's good see that's the whole issue I
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  mean next am I a radical because I don't want laptop computers and regular
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:45.160]  computers in my house watching and listening to me because I don't want a
[1:50:45.160 --> 1:50:49.120]  microchip because I know how to read ABC news talking about Operation Northwood's
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.040]  US government plan to stage terror truth is truth is truth that's all I've
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:58.360]  gots the truth that's my precious possession and I will not sell it out

[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:30.960]  with two inches of snow it is pouring out of the sky this in February where
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.320]  you hardly ever in the last 15 plus years I've looked at the record have
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.320]  snow south of Dallas and it's rare to have it in Dallas I mean it is just
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:47.680]  coming down this is your global warming but you notice what all of the weak
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:54.240]  minded people have done all the Republicans and others until climate
[1:54:54.240 --> 1:55:02.600]  gate came out many of them newt gainrich john mccain bill O'Reilly all running
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:05.240]  around saying global warming is really got to do something and a lot of them
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:10.680]  sports and anger they're still saying they're still saying it because the
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:14.280]  globalist have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in this takeover of
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:20.480]  the economy not just taxes now coming up in about 10 minutes second segment of
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.600]  the next hour we're gonna have rob do has been working on this and
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:31.120]  investigating it Paul Watson's written an article on this I saw this over the
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:34.880]  weekend I actually originally saw this Friday and got so busy to investigate
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:41.480]  then I saw it again on Sunday and took and I meant to cover it yesterday but we
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:45.960]  did more investigation I want to double check it and one of the original blogs
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:50.600]  we first saw it on was the of goats and men blog and their info was very accurate
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:55.200]  great job we have a detailed breakdown of all this now at prisonplanet.com this
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:55:59.640]  article just went up Joe stacks intriguing connections with defense
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:04.840]  contractors and intelligence agencies and then I've got all my other articles
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:08.360]  and I asked you to reprint them because I cleaned my desk off about Joe stacks
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:14.000]  daughter saying it doesn't sound like his letter all the quote strange
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:20.040]  coincidences that happened with the fire trucks and the emergency managers from
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:23.680]  all over Travis County were there with scores of firemen and trucks and
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:27.160]  equipment right next door to the building and the FBI was already out there
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:31.040]  I mean this is important and now you've got Geithner coming and posing in front
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:33.920]  of the building yesterday I've even gotten to that video coming up in the
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:37.520]  next hour and audio for radio listeners of the press conference with Geithner
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:40.920]  wasn't even a press conference they wouldn't let our guys in or try to keep
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:44.600]  them out but I sent three different teams two teams got in they only caught
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:48.240]  one of the decoy teams at a public press conference out on the front of the
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:53.200]  building but the Secret Service said no you're not in America get out of here so
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:56.800]  the video of all that and Geithner getting asked one tough question from
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:57:01.760]  Aaron Dykes but it showed up nowhere in the media that is coming up but him
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:07.080]  posing as a victim and up there worshiping the illegal IRS and trying to
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:11.240]  paint the Tea Party movement as a bunch of killers this is the type of stuff
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:15.000]  that's going on and this thing looks more and more like a staged inside job a
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.880]  lot of people are so angry they're saying good job stack no the government
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:23.520]  wants that to happen and we need to investigate this they want violence we

[2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:39.680]  this is just a video from outside the office just minutes ago massive snow
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:49.040]  pouring down on us look at this giant snowball I just went out and got it
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:52.880]  Austin, Texas this is global warming jaren what are you doing in studio here

[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:49.360]  yeah if you just tuned in people out there will misrepresent it but the facts
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.800]  are the facts of why I am very upset with Debra Medina running for Texas
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:01:59.800]  governor from obscurity it was really patriot tea party and 9-11 truth groups
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:03.480]  because people that are awake a lot of times 9-11 truth and they admit a lot of
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:07.600]  the tea party 9-11 truth people including a lot of Ron Paul supporters
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:11.800]  supported her and never asked her get a 9-11 truth then she said she supports a
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:15.520]  new investigation she said a bunch after the Glenn Beck interview clarifying
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:19.200]  herself we played that clip and now she says that we're quote despicable bad
[2:02:19.200 --> 2:02:25.640]  people on a Dallas radio station the guy that fills in for Rush Limbaugh and
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:31.000]  Mark Davis and I'm angry about it and that's the way it is it's Debra Medina
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:35.040]  that attacked all the 9-11 truthers in Texas calling us despicable and it's
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:38.880]  the flip-flopping it's the fact that she gives all these interviews after Beck
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:43.440]  clarifying that you have that queued up will you queue up the clip there's a
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:47.640]  bunch of them I've heard on TV two days after the Glenn Beck situation this is on
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.440]  Houston TV he said the same thing on Dallas I mean here it is this is the
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:54.960]  flip-flopping well she'll do this on the other issue she needs to pledge she'll
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:59.000]  never flip-flop again once she comes out with something here it is that are
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.760]  redacted and their top secret that makes us all wonder well what's happening
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:09.520]  back there the same as true with the birth certificate thing I think there
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:13.800]  it's it's healthy that people are asking questions and I think the questions
[2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:19.920]  that I've heard ask her how those buildings fell right and I don't I don't
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.560]  I'm not the engineer to know that and I think those are good for element
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.800]  questions to ask so I didn't attack her when she went on Beck's show and said
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:31.480]  well I'm not really a 9-11 truth or but I support people's right to call for an
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:35.360]  investigation then she went further and I thought well under all this heat she's
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:39.240]  a really good lady now if she apologizes and says I had advisors and I was
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:45.680]  confused it's still bad I mean it's bad and I'm about my integrity I don't just
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:50.600]  invest in Obama and then he gets in and sells out what he said he would do and
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:54.360]  then I support him or I support Bush which I never did either one
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:57.680]  hypothetically and then he gets in and goes back on his promises and I go well
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.240]  I feel like a winner because I've already supported and I won't admit I'm wrong
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:07.640]  no when I support somebody and they flip-flop like this on such a key issue
[2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:14.440]  and viciously called 9-11 truthers despicable for questioning the official
[2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:20.080]  story that makes me very angry because you hear Alex Jones on one radio show
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:24.680]  it's gonna be the same as Alex Jones on another radio show what are like about
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:29.600]  Ron Paul you hear him one place you're in another it's the same not like Rick
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:33.240]  Perry something different everywhere or Barack Obama you know Barack Obama I
[2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:36.840]  think's broken all records online on everything I just supposed to just
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:41.400]  accept that oh I like Barack Obama now I think I think that's great all right I'm
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:43.880]  not gonna talk about this much more I got a bunch of other subjects I want to
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:50.040]  get to including big developments Joe Stax intriguing connections with defense

[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:16.240]  directly answer her opinions but she could say people have the right to their
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:19.280]  own opinion and that should be the end of it we live in America it's a free
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:23.280]  country and you know she could have said it that way instead of trying to side
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:27.000]  with them and I think she's just trying to play politics it was exactly what we
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.560]  don't want exactly that's the whole point is it's straight talk and we're
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.440]  gonna get the truth and yeah and and the point is then even after she does this
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:37.640]  and throws us out of the bus repeatedly calls us despicable over and over again
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:42.000]  then he says well still you you said it wrong and answered it wrong which shows
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:45.120]  you're not a good leader they're not gonna like her this is gonna hurt her
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:48.760]  bad not just with us this is gonna hurt her bad across the board because people
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:53.800]  like Ron Paul is because he is the same yesterday today and tomorrow and he's
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:56.960]  been proven right and he's I've been interviewing him for 14 years and he's
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:10:00.640]  set on air without me asking half of his support in the first part of the
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:06.560]  presidential campaign was from this show we raised him millions of dollars you
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:11.440]  know we deserve my listeners deserve credit you know what I think with this
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:14.560]  I think this was a test to see if they could control or use the press to kind
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:17.600]  of snipe at her from different angles and see how she would fold and they're
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:20.800]  like oh she'll work with us no problem we just have to attack her enough and
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:23.880]  and she'll fold under pressure instead of just standing up because there's
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:26.160]  plenty of people out there that would agree with her yeah yeah that's the
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:29.200]  issue if she would have said 9-11 truth despicable day one I would have said
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:33.000]  well I can still support her because she says she'll do the taxes and she says
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.920]  she'll control the border and she says we'll have you know like Vermont style
[2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:40.880]  open carry but because at least we know she was better now she may not do those
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:47.080]  things now she may completely do a 180 it's all open that's the issue that's
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:57.560]  why this is so bad and it's a betrayal we're gonna give it a few days for you
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:00.240]  rip all the signs down though I'm gonna see what I'm gonna see what they say she
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:04.600]  says folks she's definitely gonna hear this broadcast folks if you support what
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:08.400]  she did give her a call let her know you really appreciate her flip-flopping and
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:12.360]  saying that we're horrible despicable people of course the media she's a fool
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:15.040]  has already got we learned about this because the mainstream media has already
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:18.840]  gotten this and is saying oh look she flip-flopped they've got five different
[2:11:18.840 --> 2:11:22.200]  TV newscasts she was on after the back thing saying I agree with the new
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:25.640]  non-new investigation how the towers fell now she says it's despicable they're
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:31.760]  gonna eat her alive for this who is advising this woman well she did just
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:35.000]  have a shakeup so it'll be interesting to see who's taken over since then that's
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:39.160]  right it's all new people when we call over there yeah and boy I tell you what
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:43.800]  I don't know what advice they're giving her but it's it's it's cockeyed I mean
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:48.080]  it's not good advice and all I've got's my integrity and I ain't selling it for
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:53.280]  nobody and you understand I'm not gonna sit here and just shut my mouth and go
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:57.280]  along with this the advisors are almost as important as the person you're putting
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:12:01.360]  in office I mean look at the people who are behind Obama you know he's got he's
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:07.360]  got a Kissinger he's got Zignia Brzezinski working with him I mean that's
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:10.480]  what you got to look at who's behind the person to well this is more than
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:18.280]  suspicious let me give you a number 877 we Texans that's 877-938-3926 ask her if

[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:14.200]  every other you know issue that she's that she's coming out claiming that
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:18.200]  she's with us on now we have to dig into her history because we can't take her
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:23.080]  face value anymore well she pledged on this show that everything she said was
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:30.520]  the way it was gonna be I shook her hand right where you're sitting yeah I mean
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:34.600]  we're gonna see we'll see how she responds to this you know let's give her
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:38.520]  a fair shot and let her come back on the show and see what she says then I know
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:41.960]  it seems now it seems to be open game now we can talk about 9-11 since
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:46.560]  everybody else is talking about it you know I want to get that Democrat
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:51.800]  candidate on here see if he backs off he hasn't backed off no and he's silly
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:56.120]  and ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough mr. Shammy and so you're
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:02.760]  talking mr. Shammy yeah holy mackerel I don't even know what to say anymore I'm
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:08.120]  just I mean I am in a tailspin over this I tell you an absolute tailspin dude
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:13.840]  okay let's shift gears let's let's go over the backstory first before we get
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:17.160]  into the new info because I keep saying there's gonna be a false flag in Austin
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:20.360]  against a government installation be blamed on the tea parties how many times
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:23.840]  have been sailing the last three months I can't even count as it's been over and
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:27.160]  over again on air off air because I can strategically see what they're gonna do
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:34.440]  yeah and then you it's admitted KXAN and the statesman in the fire department
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:37.920]  Mets fire department from all over Travis County in Austin an emergency
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:42.480]  meeting next door yeah the parking lot next door and witnesses say this on the
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:45.880]  news you'll all you don't have witnesses no now it's confirmed oh it's like the
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:49.360]  underwear bomber when the truck rest man got him on with no passport now it's
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:54.000]  confirmed the government ordered him let on okay it's confirmed confirmed put
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.280]  it your pipe and smoke it okay we're right again and then his daughter says
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:01.600]  doesn't sound like his note his wife sounds says there's nothing like him he
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:05.040]  hasn't flown the plane in months and months and months and there's a bunch
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:10.440]  of other evidence that feeds into this then it turns out the IRS was having
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:13.000]  another meeting another part of a separate building which they've never
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.800]  done so they were mainly out of their offices just like the Pentagon and now
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.120]  we have the latest news took us three or four days to research it Joe stacks
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:23.760]  intriguing connections with defense contractors intelligence agencies go
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:27.680]  over that for folks Rob all right so we'll go we'll get a document camera
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:31.520]  roving guys over here this was found this was searched under the Williamson
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:36.760]  central appraisal district you could look up the owner of the hangar at
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:42.040]  Georgetown Airport this is owned by Joe Stack and John Podolik and when you look
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:48.880]  up John Podolik he's connected to a company called L3 and then he was let's
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:54.520]  see he became he's he became a manager at the Department of Homeland Security
[2:15:54.520 --> 2:15:59.520]  and I'm looking for the exact quote where it says he's gonna oversee
[2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:03.520]  transition of the team's anti-missile system to commercial applications this
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:08.720]  is from the L3 website and this is the guy that an anti-missile system is on
[2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:12.800]  board the aircraft correct and that's tied into what Bush said about remote
[2:16:12.800 --> 2:16:16.400]  control on the plane where the government can even control it's part of the
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:19.600]  CAP system which is the commercial airline and that company also works on
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:23.520]  remote control aircraft systems mm-hmm oh my god and they're also tight they
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:27.400]  could have just had a voice morpher play him over the radio they can get a
[2:16:27.400 --> 2:16:30.200]  recording of anybody's voice put in a computer and then type in whatever they
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:34.440]  want the voice to then say it even passes voice print analysis he takes off
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:37.120]  wait till you hear what we have or maybe he will the witnesses said there was no
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:42.240]  one in the plane go ahead well and then you look at L3 was also connected to
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:48.840]  9-11 they actually had let's see let's go to this article here let's see
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:52.640]  supposedly they were getting investigated by the SEC for the unusual
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:57.160]  stock put options in relation to 9-11 and an L3 consultant to the NSA
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:00.640]  apparently watched a live feed of the first plane hitting the tower and
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:05.040]  apparently there was no video except for those one guy it's L3 tied into
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:08.520]  insider trading betting against America the United at record levels right and
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:13.080]  buzzy Cron guard executive director of the CIA now that's the partner according
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:19.120]  to the Williamson County appraisal district appraisal district the guy
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:23.760]  owned half the plane who's an L3 specialist he'll hear it he owns the
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:27.360]  hangar not the plane it doesn't say so he owns the hangar okay hang on his
[2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:31.040]  house did yes so there's probably another plane in there but he obviously has
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:35.920]  access to where the plane is if nothing else and it also mentions other
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:39.840]  places stack work for teledyne was a prime contractor for the global hawk
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:44.640]  in L3 supply to communication systems global hawks remote control drone oh
[2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:48.680]  man I mean this just gets worse and worse by the minute he was working on
[2:17:48.680 --> 2:17:52.320]  I tell you my gut tells me inside job my guts never wrong and you've been saying
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:56.160]  it and we had a heated discussion back in the me screaming at Burma's yeah well
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:17:59.680]  yeah you're screaming everybody said you knew this was an inside job and you
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:03.200]  know I had my doubts it was that Friday night yeah and I had my doubts and now
[2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:06.520]  you look at this stuff and it's just by the way I'm not normally screaming in
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:11.560]  the coffee room am I no normally you're looking for coffee but Burma's
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:15.920]  cornered me and was arguing well he was he was saying he he was saying the jury
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:19.040]  still out in his mind and you were telling him you know you know it's an
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:22.440]  inside job back to this lucky coincidence okay of course that was off
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:25.200]  record I'm saying oh I'm open minded because I'm looking at the evidence sure
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:27.960]  yeah and we're all looking at I want to believe this is not an inside job
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:35.600]  exactly but it is and so flight aware and flight-wise are two to web applications
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:39.400]  that people can go online and look at flight records of like small personal
[2:18:39.400 --> 2:18:44.480]  aircraft and here it doesn't show his the last date of his aircraft taking off
[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:50.120]  and landing was Thursday August 6 2009 and we cross-referenced that with his
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:55.800]  plane which under here it says it gives you the name of the plane and then the
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:19:00.480]  owner Joseph Stack so we cross-referenced that I called the oh sorry guys I didn't
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:03.560]  my bad I'll turn it this way you're showing folks a document cam it's fine
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:08.600]  go ahead and so you look at that and so the plane hasn't apparently been been
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.800]  flown since August you would think that would have been updated that day it's
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:16.720]  it will be interesting to see what happens with that I called the airport
[2:19:16.720 --> 2:19:20.880]  nobody answered I left a message and I'm gonna call them back to see if they have
[2:19:20.880 --> 2:19:23.680]  they keep their own personal flight manifest there and see if their actual
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:28.240]  actually is a manifest now there there was talk in this KXAN piece that I was
[2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:32.520]  listening to because they played some of the audio of Joe's last words we went
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:35.800]  and check the actual FAA original recording it's different right so
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:39.400]  there's there's a group out there that records the scanners and puts it up
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:44.240]  online send that to Watson to add to his article okay I will and we actually have
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:48.440]  I put it together and I played the KXAN piece and then what the scanners picked
[2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:51.840]  up and then I slowed down what he says off the side all right we're gonna come
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:56.560]  back play that and recap this and then open the phones up folks this is big
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:01.560]  this is big but it's despicable that we're looking into it it's despicable
[2:20:01.560 --> 2:20:09.760]  dude despicable as the economy continues to decline
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:15.360]  patriots across a nation are preparing for the worst the world is changing fast

[2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:02.400]  Don't Tread on Me radio show
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:10.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:14.840]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:18.440]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:23.480]  turning members influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:28.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:32.480]  citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:37.720]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:28.760]  also appear in that's coming up next hour Rob do okay briefly for those who
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:33.000]  just joined us recapping you have a company involved in the global hawk
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:39.720]  remote controlling of planes you have the person that owns the hangar is tied
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:45.200]  in and works for Homeland Security at L3 you have people saying the emergency
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:50.200]  crews were all there on the spot turns out from all over Austin were masked told
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:54.120]  to have a drill there that morning you have the IRS people mainly out of the
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:57.080]  building and another building in the complex having a meeting you have
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:00.920]  witnesses saying nobody was in the plane Joe stacks probably been fed to fish
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:03.920]  ground up for Fed of the hogs you got his daughter saying doesn't sound like
[2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:07.000]  his letter the government's trying to start a revolution it wants people to
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:13.440]  get violent continue yeah well we'll go over all that and so back to over here
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:16.680]  if you look at the document cam we've got Joe
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:21.640]  our let's see John put allic you know you don't have to have the document can
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:23.760]  because it makes you lean away from the mic just take the material and read it
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:27.160]  over here well they they both call in this hangar and you look up who John
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:33.680]  paddock is and back in 2004 he was hired by Homeland Security to be part of
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:36.840]  their infrared countermeasure program manager for its department of Homeland
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:41.880]  Security counterman pads man portable air defense system initiative and so he
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:47.520]  comes from a long line of companies including L3 which has you know all
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:53.360]  kind of defense department connections with with you know global Hawk
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:57.360]  satellite of the global Hawk drones and you know air-controlled systems
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:26:01.760]  essentially so there's a connection there that you know it's a deep government
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:05.520]  connection it's not you know I don't know how this how it works you know if you
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.680]  own remote control aircraft expert sure owns the hangar which may be a
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:12.960]  coincidence but you had everything else in it needs to be ferreted out
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:16.400]  investigated what about this audio clip we're about to play okay so the audio
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:21.200]  clip comes from KXA news and they played supposedly his last words and
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:27.320]  which were thank you over and now but actually from from the from the scan
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:32.720]  recordings he says I'm definitely checking out so you have it you have
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:37.160]  that being manipulated we're gonna play it I have the the KXA inversion then I
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:40.080]  have the other version from the scans and then I play the other version from
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:44.000]  the scans slowed down and then I play the KXA inversion slow down so you can
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  come really hear what he's saying let's start let's start rolling it now here it
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:55.560]  is air traffic control recordings suggest there was nothing out of the
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:27:00.760]  ordinary his final words
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:30.720]  okay so that's different versions of that now also it's a
[2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:34.920]  important remember on 9-11 there were fake phone calls and the FBI is now
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:41.080]  confirmed that the solicitor general's wife did not call him that the calls
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:45.040]  were not made at the air phones weren't making calls that the cell phones
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:48.000]  couldn't make calls at that height and the phone records show it didn't happen
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.320]  they could record Alex Jones off the radio or off the phone they have a
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:56.800]  computer program 20 years ago this is publicly available where you can record
[2:27:56.800 --> 2:28:00.600]  it then type in what you want the voice to say and then it will create the fake
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:05.920]  audio and so this is very very suspicious they have a very dumb down
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:09.040]  program like that on Macintosh is where you can type in what you want it to say
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:12.120]  and it'll say it in a computer generated voice and if you think the
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:15.440]  government doesn't have something you know 50 times more powerful than that
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:18.400]  you know you're you're kidding they have a program that'll do that oh yeah
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:25.080]  totally and and it just gets weirder and weirder back to back to where the the
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:28.400]  firefighters were the firefighters were meeting for the first time ever at this
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:34.160]  empty parking lot across the highway from you know maybe 200 250 yards from
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.040]  where this plane hit and it was also another coincidence and it was from all
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:41.120]  over Travis County the first time they done that right it was all over from
[2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:46.400]  Travis County is the first time they met at this location and and one of the
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:49.400]  first time they brought real fire trucks right says they normally don't right
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:53.040]  Lake Travis brought out its fire engine and typically that the they don't use
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:56.240]  fire engines in these exercises but you know they say Lake Travis had just
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:00.840]  received new trucks and they wanted to show them as trucks yeah and so I mean
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:04.520]  it yeah it says trucks and then there it says it says truck and then it says they
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:10.200]  have new trucks so very interesting there and then multiple witnesses said
[2:29:10.200 --> 2:29:13.440]  they saw no pilot comes right over the highway people are looking there's no
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:17.160]  body in the cockpit it was actually the same witness to that saw the fire
[2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:19.280]  trucks when they said you have anything else you want to add she goes why I
[2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:22.360]  think it was amazing that the fire trucks were just right over there doing a
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:26.640]  exercise she also mentions in another interview she said she was close enough
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:30.560]  to see the plane and she goes but I didn't see the pilot she said she was
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:34.160]  close enough to see inside the plane but she could she did not see a pilot we
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:37.640]  need to get all that to Watson to add it and beef up this article Joe Stax
[2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:41.520]  intriguing connections with defense contractors intelligence agencies it's
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:47.480]  up on prisonplanet.com right now he's gonna add all that information then
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:51.560]  we'll put a doppelganger up on infowars.com anything else Rob stay there
[2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:54.040]  we'll come right back
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:30:01.040]  we're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:07.600]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:11.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:30:11.920 --> 2:30:16.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:30:16.120 --> 2:30:20.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:24.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:30:24.040 --> 2:30:28.320]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:30:28.320 --> 2:30:32.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:30:32.480 --> 2:30:36.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:40.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:44.680]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:48.080]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:26.680]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:31.960]  with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:36.560]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:40.760]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:31:40.760 --> 2:31:45.680]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:14.880]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:17.600]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:22.480]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:27.280]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:31.520]  citizens to pay attention fall the republic identifies the enemies of
[2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:36.600]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.560]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:44.360]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:48.200]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:54.200]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the

[2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:04.480]  high quality at prison planet dot TV
[2:33:04.480 --> 2:33:17.280]  okay Joe Stack attacks none of the story ads up it looks just like the
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:23.040]  underwear bomber they may have just gotten rid of this poor guy multiple
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:26.680]  witnesses video clubs I've seen said there was nobody in the cockpit I could
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:31.080]  see inside the plane people up inside apartment complexes looking down and the
[2:33:31.080 --> 2:33:34.760]  family says it doesn't look like his letter but the government says so so it
[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:40.680]  must be true yeah his daughter from his first marriage Samantha Don Bell she
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:44.120]  said and I quote it's not him the letter itself sounds like it's coming from a
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:49.320]  different person and so that's what she says about the letter and it's buried
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:54.200]  in this article about the IRS worker who was killed in in the crash it's you
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:57.920]  know buried down at the bottom and one other thing in this KXN news broadcast
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:01.280]  they're talking about well how could a small engine like that creates such a
[2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:05.200]  big fire or small plane you know with 40 gallons of fuel creates such a big fire
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:08.720]  like that and they said well he apparently removed seats and then
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:13.280]  there's an oil a fuel drum missing well I could tell you one thing those planes
[2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:16.120]  are very small I actually talked to a pilot out at the press conference
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:19.160]  yesterday and I said you know they were talking about how he he might have
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:23.040]  taken this oil drum and put it on the plane they said you can't you have to
[2:34:23.040 --> 2:34:26.400]  crawl on the wing and then there's a little bitty door on the passenger side
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:30.080]  to get into this plane he said there's no way you could fit look the whole
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:34.600]  story stinks to high heaven it came across at the perfect time to make the
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:38.280]  IRS look like victims Geithner came into the press conference speaking of the
[2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:43.800]  devil we have Aaron's video don't we let's get Aaron Dixon here now in shift
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:47.000]  gears the press conference yesterday with Geithner the Treasury Secretary

[2:37:55.960 --> 2:38:00.720]  questions that were asked Aaron got into the press conference he asked a
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:08.520]  question the IRS commissioner gave him a it looks could kill stare a guy with
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:13.200]  what Austin Free Press is what it's called he asked some good questions or
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:16.520]  one good question and Geithner said I'll get to that later and then basically cut
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:20.000]  the press conference short and left he made a statement made the media wait
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:23.200]  there for an hour and a half past the time he was supposed to be there this is
[2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:26.800]  in front of the building right by the highway and you're about to see video
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:30.600]  of this now I sent three teams knowing they would discriminate against us and
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:34.200]  our first amendment and it is illegal to civil rights violation I don't have time
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:37.080]  to go assume over this point is we're gonna expose them you've seen footage
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:42.000]  from DC footage from Kansas City of myself Aaron and others a half mile
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.320]  away from the Federal Reserve at a city park videotaping they get in their car

[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:09.240]  in a terror database and they arrested him they're telling mainstream media
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:12.800]  news cameras there are as people with news cameras in England they surveil you
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:16.080]  they naked body scan you they have the laptops in England in the US and
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:20.080]  Australia watching the kids that's now confirmed to play that clip in a moment
[2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:24.280]  I promised to I forgot to earlier for the prison planet TV viewers from
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:29.040]  Frontline all of this is going on and they just come up to Rob Jacobson and
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:32.760]  Jason Burmes and say who are you with we're with info wars calm get out of
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:36.040]  here not allowed to be here you're not on the approved list there was no list
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:39.120]  they just called the press conference kicked him out made him get several
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:42.840]  hundred yards away wouldn't even let him be on the side of the street off the
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:49.680]  property and kept harassing him but Aaron kept his mouth shut by himself we
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:55.560]  also had Rob do and Jason Douglas there and that's just a compilation of that
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:40:02.200]  footage Rob Jacobson Burmes down the street and then footage up close Aaron
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:05.680]  we're gonna play this clip in a moment but go ahead and break down what happened
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:09.360]  there yeah this was one of the most tightly controlled media events I've
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:13.240]  ever been a part of I had to am I coming through you're good go ahead start
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:16.840]  over it's one of the most tightly controlled media events I've ever been
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:21.000]  a part of or witnessed I had to infiltrate just to uphold my free
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.960]  speech basically and ask a question of one of these gods who just can't be
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:28.900]  approached and it doesn't pay us taxes oh of course not but there is with the
[2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:34.880]  IRS commissioner but yeah they were not all they had literal media gatekeepers
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:38.800]  who who kept swinging these gates and they would check off this phony list
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:43.480]  which was really just all the ABC channels that you see on TV it was all
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:47.320]  the regular network people they had called them earlier Treasury put out a
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:51.880]  memo saying no one who doesn't sign up by noon is allowed in that's how they
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:56.280]  put it out at 1230 yeah yeah the story didn't hit the wire till around noon or
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:00.880]  one so there's virtually no chance for anyone to make it unless they got a call
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:06.440]  from their station like all these ABC you know Ki whatever and they're not
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:09.920]  reporters all they do is take a statement and then regurgitate it they're
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:14.840]  repeaters yeah they're scripted their parents yeah their phony TV anchors they
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:19.000]  use fake voices they don't report real news they have talking points it's known
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.440]  and it's like have you talked to the families the pain the poor IRS that's
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:27.200]  all it was and that's what it is with all these reporters but even amongst the
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:31.080]  tenor so stations they didn't even trust that that's how controlled this event
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:35.360]  was they selected two reporters that they knew they could rely on to have
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.840]  questions and the guy screening with the list we caught them on tape talking to
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:42.880]  them about we're gonna go to you with the question how long is this video you
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:46.800]  put together it's ten minutes total it's got some clips at the beginning I'm
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:50.360]  gonna skip this break coming up it's a network break that's our break station
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:54.600]  should be playing over this okay so we're gonna skip the network break to
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:59.480]  play this and then I'm gonna come back to Aaron to comment on it but but for
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:03.440]  radio listeners who will get part of it from the audio fill them in briefly on
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:07.600]  the video so that they get an idea of what we're playing world premiere here
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:11.840]  the prison planet dot TV viewers well we have a few clips just for background of
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:15.880]  our Geithner lying and fudging in front of Congress refusing to tell them where
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:21.640]  the money went just like Bernanke but you see Jason Burmese and Rob Jacobson
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:25.400]  being told they're not allowed to express their freedom of speech and that
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:29.600]  their freedom of speech is somehow a hundred yards down the road the audio is
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:32.440]  a little bad because they had the press conference on the side of the major
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:38.680]  highway but you have Geithner and you have the IRS commissioner Shulman come
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:43.080]  out and make their phony statements about how they grieve for this dead IRS
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:47.920]  guy which is a tragedy but what they're doing is they're proving more evidence of
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:52.320]  false flag there they're sucking this up as victims grants the feds bombed
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:55.880]  Oklahoma City that's confirmed oh yeah and they've done almost every event it's
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:43:00.200]  you know if this is a real event it's one of the first that we've seen pushed
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:05.000]  through the media and you know it's another big government solution an IRS
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:10.280]  guy and a looting Treasury secretary what was the stardown like oh the
[2:43:10.280 --> 2:43:16.040]  stardown yeah as soon as I blurted out what talk about the real number the 23
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:21.960]  trillion the IRS commissioners stared at me like he wanted me dead and I hope he's
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:27.960]  not the kind of guy to follow up on that well you're a true Patriot the Spirit
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:31.840]  1776 let's go to the video Aaron I didn't tell him to do this I told him
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:36.600]  yes that's it go home do it later tomorrow Aaron hasn't slept Aaron is
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:40.280]  literally one of the best guys I've got he's like a Clydesdale he's just
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:43.960]  incredible stamina in the fight against the globalist because he doesn't like
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:48.960]  them and that's the engine here is is our wish for justice our desire for
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:53.960]  honor to be restored let's go ahead and go to this video you tell the American
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:44:00.400]  people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars and who got the money
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:06.360]  hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank or that has access to the US Federal
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:10.440]  Reserves discount tell us who they are no do you think it's consistent with the
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:15.440]  spirit of that provision the Constitution for a group like the FMOC to
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:20.040]  hand out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners without any action by this
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:24.400]  Congress Congress approved it in the Federal Reserve Act some of the world's
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:28.840]  top central bankers are gathering in Sydney for two days of secret talks on
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:33.760]  the fragile global economy delegates from banks in Europe Asia and the US will
[2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:38.600]  attend the meeting amid tight security I take a look at section 1204 of the
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:45.320]  legislation you've proposed and can only describe it as tarp on steroids when we
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:50.160]  pass the tarp bill we limited the administration to seven hundred billion
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:57.680]  dollars section 1204 unlimited I have an amendment to this section saying it's
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:01.200]  a limited to a trillion dollars is the Treasury going to oppose that or are they
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:06.080]  going to support it Congressman it's important to make people understand
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:11.200]  actually a simple question I have very limited time but would you support it or
[2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:15.360]  oppose it and then let me move on to the next question support I would not
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:20.480]  support proposals that would put this country in the position we were in in
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:24.520]  2007 and 8 where we did not have the ability to act to protect the key thing
[2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:29.040]  then is that the executive branch of the power to commit not just 700 billion no
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:33.720]  but a trillion or more without having to have Congress be involved at the time
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:39.080]  of the crisis that is not a that is not it would not be a fair description of our
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:41.360]  strategy
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:06.560]  what we'll do is move into the grassy area right here that's as close as we
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:13.320]  can guess what outlets are you with I'm with the states okay lbj lbj okay
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:19.280]  info wars which was worse dot com info wars dot com yeah I don't see on my
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:25.600]  list well we didn't pre-register yeah you would have had to pre-register who are
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:32.840]  you guys with you were sent the advisory didn't say yeah yeah yeah you would have
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:39.640]  had to register before before noon I mean is it going to be a big issue yeah
[2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:47.080]  really yeah check the advisory because I talked to the press secretary what were

[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:12.000]  ones that I have registered on this list you can set up on the grassy area but
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:40.440]  I'm gonna have to verify I don't have you on my list
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:55.520]  I'll have to leave you here for now and get back to
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:33.600]  all right so we're clear in the street actually what we're gonna do is put
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:36.760]  you over into a public viewing area where the general public is allowed to
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:44.440]  gather where those cones are apparently you're not on his list because we
[2:48:44.440 --> 2:48:51.080]  didn't hear about it till after 12 o'clock I mean come on we have an
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:56.440]  audience of millions of people I know you're not telling you you don't have
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:49:02.560]  the right to cover the event what we're doing is we are making a general public
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:07.440]  viewing area since this is an invited thing these people were invited to the
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:11.680]  to the attend the press conference or whatever it is we want to call it isn't
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:14.920]  this a public official that's attending he's a public official but it's a
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:18.000]  private event we're members of the public it's a private event though public
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:21.160]  will be allowed over there that's all I can tell you guys I apologize I'm not
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:24.120]  trying to push around I'm not trying to convince you but that's the way it's
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:39.000]  gonna be for everyone safety okay okay they were media they were media not
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:47.440]  just the public here I am on two radio stations you can hear in Austin 1330 and
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:53.800]  590 a.m. and I can't even send reporters and they were letting anybody in their
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:50:00.080]  local blogs you name it it was info wars.com only our two reporters were
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:02.400]  kicked out
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:14.240]  and here he's showing video of how the two key reporters were vetted and chosen
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:18.040]  bring Aaron in here that was key Aaron watching that because I haven't even
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:20.760]  seen this yeah this is the first time I'm seeing it am I correct in saying they
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:24.000]  they selected the reporters will be allowed to ask questions that's absolutely
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.720]  correct they were totally selected no one was really allowed to ask questions I
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:30.960]  know you just got an article up on info wars.com about this do you point that
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:34.640]  out oh yeah I mean this is totally staged that shows what's the headline
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:42.200]  states stage press conference essentially here's guy to mourn the loss of one of
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:48.440]  our colleagues honor our colleagues who survived through the plane crash what a
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:53.600]  lot of the IRS serve their country every day with pride

[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:04.360]  incredibly proud of them I want to thank the first responders who came to the
[2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:09.360]  scene from Austin I want to thank all the people from across the country who
[2:51:09.360 --> 2:51:13.720]  gave their well wishes to the agency the people who came the first responders
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:18.800]  were already there this senseless act and the people the IRS are incredibly
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:22.360]  strong they're going to continue to serve their country and the nation's tax
[2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:37.720]  pay to serve the bank our dignity and respect you got a real question and look

[2:52:20.440 --> 2:52:27.360]  an hour with the minimum work in that building the best part that's my
[2:52:27.360 --> 2:52:31.280]  little bit of directing on this video the the commissioner looks at Aaron with
[2:52:31.280 --> 2:52:36.440]  pure hatred like daggers and he cuts in a little short clip of they live where I
[2:52:36.440 --> 2:52:40.480]  got one that can see and that's literally what happened here go ahead and
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:48.640]  play it the real cost of the bailout is 23 I just want to say to join the
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.160]  commissioner saying how proud we are of the minimum of the IRS working to serve
[2:52:53.160 --> 2:52:58.160]  their country we came to show them our respect and support I've got one that
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:02.840]  can see you spend an hour with the men and women who worked in that building
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:07.240]  listening to talk about their colleague who died what a great leader is racial
[2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:11.120]  leader he was we listen to the stories they told about evacuating this building
[2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:15.360]  in three minutes all the lives they say by working together to help their
[2:53:15.360 --> 2:53:18.040]  colleagues get out as quickly as possible and we heard them talk about
[2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:23.520]  their great pride in working for the IRS and helping the country do the country
[2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:26.240]  needs to do look at that I was able to read to them a letter from the

[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:34.680]  support and once you weren't allowed to ask questions then people started
[2:53:34.680 --> 2:53:38.520]  realizing the bailout is a good question they started asking it and they kept
[2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:42.080]  ignoring it and then he just shot the press conference now the commissioners
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:45.480]  switched from staring just to me and started batting around who are all these

[3:00:33.280 --> 3:00:37.200]  it exposes government drug dealing everything is happening how they're
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:41.440]  attacking states rights how they're blocking medical marijuana I'm not a
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:44.960]  pot smoker I don't particularly like it I have smoked it before high school and
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:48.440]  college sometimes you know girlfriends like come on come on before we go in the
[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:53.440]  movie and I'm like God I wish I had the smoke that but the point is it's a
[3:00:53.440 --> 3:01:01.920]  freedom issue and I have another article here from Slate the chemist war more
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:05.480]  than 10,000 Americans were poisoned by the government who would secretly spike
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:10.080]  illegal alcohol with deadly poison and the government brags they spray
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:14.480]  paraquad on marijuana this is the drug war the bigger against the more drugs
[3:01:14.480 --> 3:01:19.120]  are on the streets the big banks that the Federal Reserve controls launder the
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:25.040]  money I'm done with it that's coming up because after Kevin Booth premiered this
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:28.360]  film in LA they rated most the people that were at the meeting who were legal
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:34.240]  lawful marijuana dispensaries this is Obama's change so this is a suppressed
[3:01:34.240 --> 3:01:37.240]  film they do not want you to have how we'd won the west available at info
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:44.600]  wars dot com discounted out of the gates now I play the audio with this at the
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:47.480]  start of the show but I'll put the video here for prison planet on TV viewers as
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:55.040]  well this is in an article that was written by Steve Watson about of the
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:01:59.880]  controversy over naked body scanners explodes there's criminal investigations
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:03.200]  by the FBI the federal government paid for these laptops nationwide to go out
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:08.200]  the schools access them watch the kids at school out of school and we found a
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:12.440]  front line piece from a year ago where they show them watching people the
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:16.760]  children in live time and laughing about it no comment about big brother no
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.080]  nothing they're just teaching the new generation to fully accept this now
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:23.880]  remember Google and others announced four years ago they're using your
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:27.520]  computer to watch you and listen to you they use computers for keywords to do it
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:35.040]  this is this is public this is public so let's go ahead and play this video go
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:40.920]  ahead so I click and there's an observed button and it brings up their screen the
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:45.160]  school's assistant principal spends part of each day remotely monitoring what the
[3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:49.960]  kids are doing on their laptops we have a photo booth he can see them but they
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:54.840]  can't see him these kids are goofing off taking pictures of themselves in class
[3:02:54.840 --> 3:03:00.400]  so wait do all the kids have the cameras on six and seven pretty happy a lot of
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:04.760]  kids are just on it to check their hair do their makeup they just use it like
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:10.800]  it's a mirror I always like to mess with them and take a picture
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:15.240]  nine times I said they ducked out of the way and then they shut down and they get
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:20.680]  right back to work so I can see he's got a few things going on here he's got the
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:25.760]  photo booth program open he's got this is social studies project open school
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:31.680]  email open you know I think the kids know what is expected of them but they
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:36.560]  also want to do all their other things that's what I see a lot of the multi
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:41.360]  tasking but I was doing my work too most of the adults at the school actually
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:44.920]  seemed pretty sanguine about the kids being so easily distracted you learn
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.840]  something new every day I think so they're all relaxed they're only
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:52.600]  concerned that the kids may screw around on their computers not that they're
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:56.640]  watching the kids and then to mess with them he takes a picture of them and they
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:03:59.520]  see it flash on the screen let them know they're being watched the little girl
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:04.400]  gets out of the way now here they're just rolling it out but it's come out
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:09.880]  in Philadelphia and other cities the kids go home and the school admits they
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:14.000]  turn it on and watch them at home after all it's the government's computer we
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.920]  gave it to you free taxpayers didn't pay for that the kids now think it's
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:21.520]  normal to have their computer watching them and all new computers have the
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:27.280]  built-in on the screen at the top of the screen school cams cases explode as

[3:08:03.640 --> 3:08:09.360]  it was the summer of 2009 people were losing their jobs and the value of our
[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:14.560]  homes were dwindling before our very eyes in California state workers were
[3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:20.280]  being given IOUs and lieu of paychecks and yet through all the hellishness one
[3:08:20.280 --> 3:08:26.040]  fledgling industry was not only surviving it was booming a lot of
[3:08:26.040 --> 3:08:32.080]  people think it's strange that marijuana which has had this shadow over for so
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:38.120]  long is now being sold at storefronts in California what's happened is as many
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:41.760]  people in the culture have used marijuana they found out that refer
[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:47.040]  madness and other such propaganda films were just that propaganda cannabis even
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:51.480]  very potent cannabis is a remarkably safe medicine we don't hear the horror
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:55.080]  stories with medical cannabis that we do with prescription drugs more patients
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:58.160]  are going to realize that they have a viable medication and the rest of states
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.080]  are going to slowly turn this way even though California and other states have
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:08.680]  legalized marijuana we've seen a massive increase in smash and grab raids
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:13.160]  there's continued outrage that I following a DEA raid on a medicinal
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:17.360]  marijuana clinic several law enforcement agencies rated the dispensaries in
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:31.840]  Culver City and West Los Angeles we know this is all about you making
[3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:36.000]  something that's naturally occurring illegal so you can create artificial
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:40.040]  scarcity and jack up the prices Obama doesn't have that much power as we're
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:52.640]  seeing now the drug dealing banks own and control many of the private prisons
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:58.880]  that hapless drug users are incarcerated in there's an inflection point that when
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:02.640]  we get over 3.2 percent of the population incarcerated it actually
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:06.920]  increases crime this is risky but I don't see any other strategy I'm gonna go
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:10.400]  down for it I'm sick of what they're doing to people this is wrong but the big
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:19.040]  kahuna is international control codex alimentarius is a global compact being
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:23.680]  agreed to by the United Nations the Fortune 500 and governments on a
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:30.320]  planetary scale they want to criminalize over-the-counter sale of vitamin C
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:37.040]  fish oil colloidal silver aloe vera they want to make these controlled
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:43.120]  substances that's why they're fighting to keep marijuana illegal prohibition
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:50.880]  drives the price up on everything a weed one the West is an indictment of the
[3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:54.640]  phony drug war and exposes how the government and big banks are bringing
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:10:58.520]  the majority of hard narcotics and how they want to keep marijuana illegal as
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:02.880]  a pretext to pack the prisons with nonviolent offenders in this film you'll
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:07.560]  see drug dealers who don't want the government to decriminalize I'm not in
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:11.960]  favor of no dispensaries I want everybody come to me you want to bring down the new
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:17.360]  world order expose the phony drug war in marijuana prohibition decriminalize it
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:22.120]  how we've won the West is awesome I consulted on it I'm in it you can
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:27.080]  pre-order how we've won the West today and it ships out from my offices on
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:33.000]  February 15th 2010 at info wars.com we're discounting it out of the gates
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:37.120]  ladies and gentlemen and you can get American drug war half price or fall
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:41.680]  the Republic half price when you order at info wars.com how we've won the West
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:47.160]  it's powerful it will absolutely expose the fraud that is the drug war because
[3:11:47.160 --> 3:11:50.120]  we were taught all throughout history to fight for that right we're Americans
[3:11:50.120 --> 3:12:00.120]  that's what we're supposed to do
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:10.320]  I want to be clear alcohol is abused marijuana is abused prozac's bad period
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:14.360]  Ritalin but the government pushes all those other drugs everybody knows that
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:18.520]  during prohibition the mafia more than quadruple in size the police got more
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:24.440]  corrupted alcohol prices went way up alcohol use tripled these are all
[3:12:24.440 --> 3:12:28.680]  official government numbers and the mafia didn't have alcohol to be illegal
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:34.000]  anymore so they made marijuana and cocaine and heroin that you could buy at
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  any local drugstore and people knew that losers use that stuff now marijuana is
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:44.600]  literally a wonder plant when it comes to glaucoma and cancer and I mean it's
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:49.480]  ridiculous but the point is they need to continue the drug war and now they want
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:52.360]  to make it vitamins canada's already announcing they're gonna arrest people
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:57.080]  that sell over the counter vitamins in canada that was in the toronto star two
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:03.160]  weeks ago this is really going on this is codex alimentaries the globalist
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:08.680]  know this creates crime it empowers criminal groups at the highest and
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:12.680]  lowest levels that's why I'm for decriminalization but the film is about
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:17.960]  states rights government drug dealing everything now I mean I really want to
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:20.920]  talk about this film much more you know we sell it I'm in it it's on the website
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:32.600]  it's excellent but this is what happened I had of course Tommy Chong on the show
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:37.680]  of Cheech and Chong top comedian one of the top comedians of the country on the
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:43.920]  show to talk about aka Tommy Chong and the film was getting no attention they
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:47.480]  weren't even selling very many copies of it they printed a few thousand I had him
[3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:55.080]  on and the feds rated the private separate filmmakers and stole the copies
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:59.160]  and later it got dropped in court that made the film go mega huge it went on
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:04.080]  what showtime and then HBO and sold hundreds of thousands of copies that's
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:07.920]  how stupid they are because the film exposes how they got people hired inside
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:12.760]  Tommy Chong's business that sold pipes for tobacco marijuana whatever his
[3:14:12.760 --> 3:14:17.720]  right his son selling it they tried for four years hundreds of times was it
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:23.640]  400 plus times to put orders into this one county where marijuana pipes are
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:27.120]  illegal in the US and finally they got one of their people to mail it out they
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:34.160]  put Tommy Chong in jail for several years as a big stunt now Kevin Booth's
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:37.920]  gonna break this down we're gonna go to some of the victims of this Kevin Booth
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:40.920]  had a big showing at a dispensary in their back parking lot hundreds of
[3:14:40.920 --> 3:14:44.640]  people were there the feds were there marking down names they rated a bunch of
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:48.360]  dispensaries that night the next day and told him because of the film they are
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:51.760]  scared of this documentary and again even if you don't believe in
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:54.960]  decriminalization and you think the drug war is great the government shipping
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:59.160]  it in is wonderful don't you believe in the first amendment you just saw
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:01.800]  Geithner not letting people in a press conference on the side of the highway in
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:07.840]  America they want this film shut down on the good news is a lot of the DVDs have
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:10.720]  already shipped out and I don't know if they're stupid enough to try to raid
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:15.600]  Kevin the filmmaker but this is on the distributors all over the point is this
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:20.520]  was a major attack Kevin Booth director maker of the award-winning aired on
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:24.600]  Showtime you name it one of their top rated show by the way I saw that in the
[3:15:24.600 --> 3:15:30.720]  news their number one show number one on demand as well for more than a year was
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:34.480]  American drug war this film is much more hardcore and that's why they're so
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:37.120]  scared his film barely gets into government drug dealing it's just how
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:41.800]  the drug war hurts everybody this one does and Kevin I'm a little concerned
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:47.160]  about this break down what happened that night and in the aftermath well
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:51.120]  basically I mean the screening went quite well I mean Craig is also on the
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:55.200]  line who can testify that some of this Craig Rubin and we're gonna tell folks
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:15:58.520]  about him in just a moment go ahead yeah he's more familiar with some of the
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:05.000]  locals and the Narxon area but you know the owner Jeff Joseph who has been
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:08.280]  busted over and over again and if everybody remembers the famous picture
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:11.560]  that circulated on the internet over a year ago about black water raiding a
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:16.600]  marijuana dispensary that was that was him that that's what happened and let's
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:21.360]  be clear these are legal under state law it's like a target store it's right
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:25.120]  there and the feds keep coming in and writing and now under Obama it's getting
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:31.000]  even worse exactly and then and what happened was just a few days after the
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:35.720]  screening they came and arrested him and just took him away now there they've
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:40.920]  been arresting or they've been raiding other dispensaries but this is the the
[3:16:40.920 --> 3:16:45.640]  only two people to ever get arrested into jail time are Craig and Jeff or in
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:49.560]  the film and they're literally throwing the book at Jeff I just spoke to a
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:54.520]  sister this morning I was in all the newspapers that he was under $350,000
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:59.960]  bail it's now been raised to $520,000 bail I should add Jeff Joseph was gonna
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:04.840]  be on the day but they've arrested him exactly yeah he's he's sitting in the
[3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:10.280]  Twin Tower downtown LA it's probably one of the most hellish places on earth he
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:15.360]  has 24 felonies against them including money laundering and just a whole list
[3:17:15.360 --> 3:17:19.920]  of just crazy things that had nothing to do with them like being charged because
[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:24.760]  they're they're saying that somebody was passing out flyers promoting the
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:28.840]  dispensary and one of these flyers made it to some kid at some school and so
[3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:33.960]  basically in court yesterday oh it's for the children oh yeah just kept
[3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:37.160]  bringing up this one thing about how this one child well I would bring out
[3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:41.720]  how they push prozac and riddlin in that school no exactly it's amazing
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:46.640]  amazing okay well we're about to go to break let's go to Craig Rubin and Craig
[3:17:46.640 --> 3:17:49.440]  briefly have a long bio tell us a little about yourself and break down what's
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:54.620]  happening here well I was at the screening the other night and some of the
[3:17:54.620 --> 3:18:00.120]  agents that were there actually left sweating because we were there but you
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:03.560]  know I've been involved with medical marijuana I played the owner of the
[3:18:03.560 --> 3:18:07.760]  medical marijuana club on the show weeds and we really portrayed it in kind of a
[3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:12.840]  negative way and my wife and I are Bible believers we have seven kids so we
[3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:16.640]  opened a medical marijuana club at the church trying to reach people who use
[3:18:16.640 --> 3:18:21.120]  medical marijuana with the word and I was sentenced to four years and eight
[3:18:21.120 --> 3:18:25.840]  months in prison and now I was arrested and then I got permission from the judge
[3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:30.320]  to do it again and the probation department and then I was arrested again
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:37.320]  on October 22nd of 2009 I go to trial starting on this Thursday the 25th of
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:42.080]  February and I'm facing 12 years now for selling one gram of pot to a officer
[3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.600]  who came in as a qualified patient with the doctor's note in the valid
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:50.000]  California ID which is state law I mean let's be clear you're following the law
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:54.720]  and I have a permit to sell medical marijuana from the city I have
[3:18:54.720 --> 3:18:58.640]  permission from a judge from the probation this is just like Austin with
[3:18:58.640 --> 3:19:03.720]  the ATF shutting down the gun show with no law right well and they're going after
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:08.000]  I've known Jeff for 20 years he's been like me someone who's been interested
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:12.200]  in hemp we both had stores or we sold hemp clothes before medical marijuana
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:16.840]  which has no THC in it yeah had none of it but we didn't get in trouble for that
[3:19:16.840 --> 3:19:20.520]  but we've been activists and so we've been people who speak out and what's
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:24.360]  going on is the government is taking over this industry lots of medical
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:28.800]  marijuana clubs are run by police officers or government agents and that
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:33.520]  guy from blackwater is actually a DEA agent he would just happen to be wearing
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:38.680]  a blackwater shirt during that raid but he was a DEA agent we got his name when
[3:19:38.680 --> 3:19:45.160]  he raided my temple back in 2006 well this is incredible I mean it's like
[3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:48.920]  Seattle something like half the bars are owned by cops they go sell each other
[3:19:48.920 --> 3:19:52.920]  drugs in the bathroom of nice bars and restaurants and then they own and run it
[3:19:52.920 --> 3:19:58.880]  I mean just total parasites now outside the law coming in federally and at the
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:03.320]  state prosecuting you guys and and they all want this film seen folks they went
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:10.320]  crazy money talks and it sounds just like Jim Kramer I'm Kramer money talks

[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:52.720]  standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book

[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:27.760]  we're talking to Craig Rubin and Kevin Booth joining us from Los Angeles
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:32.360]  let's go back to that night I mean Kevin you were telling me they rated a bunch
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:37.240]  of the dispensaries that attended these are legal under state law the state's
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:40.120]  coming in and saying okay there you know there's 500 or so of these in the
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:44.320]  city of 10 million people now we're gonna like to have 150 and it'll all be
[3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:49.080]  certified groups and it's openly detectives and cops and retired FBI
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:53.920]  agents I mean I guess they were the drug dealers before and so okay they're
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:58.000]  gonna legalize it only we can run it I mean this is mafia government there's
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:03.640]  so many issues here Craig Rubin and Kevin Booth well I mean it just it's
[3:25:03.640 --> 3:25:08.000]  working on so many levels by the way it's a thousand dispensaries and now
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:11.440]  they're saying what they're gonna bring it down to 70 so well who gets to
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:15.800]  decide which of those you know you know in other words okay so the numbers have
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:19.440]  changed because I'm the news settle in LA times it was like 500 dispensaries
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:23.840]  they want to cut it down to 150 it's even worse than that there's 1000
[3:25:23.840 --> 3:25:28.880]  in the city of LA 1400 in LA County wow they're trying to they're trying to cut
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:32.920]  it down to only 70 and this is when we have a vacancy rate in our commercial
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:38.800]  properties of over 15% I mean they're complaining that oh these places are
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:43.120]  everywhere and yet every one of these places has a well-lit parking lot they
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:48.240]  have security guards out front you know and either some of the only income and
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:51.200]  some of these bad neighborhoods and what they're doing is they're putting down
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:55.640]  these ridiculous zoning things saying like oh if you're what a thousand feet
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:00.320]  from a school or a thousand feet from a neighborhood by which
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:06.080]  500 feet from a residential area but every one of them practically is near
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:09.920]  500 feet of a residential area we're in the city yeah I mean if you're familiar
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:15.160]  with LA there every single commercial building is within 500 feet of a
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:22.360]  residential structure so it's impossible it's a joke and so basically the
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:26.240]  people of California people of LA everybody is voted on what they want
[3:26:26.240 --> 3:26:29.960]  and yet they keep doing this and what's interesting right now has how it kind of
[3:26:29.960 --> 3:26:34.160]  keeps shifting back and forth from the fed to the locals to whatever and so it's
[3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:38.400]  the DA that's bringing these charges on Jeff right now and you know me he's
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:42.720]  he's sitting in jail now until March 4th and his next hearing I mean he could be
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:48.160]  going away for some serious time and I spent seven days in that county jail
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:54.000]  and it is torture you think we treat our prisoners in Iraq poorly I didn't eat
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:57.560]  for seven days I lost a lot of weight I didn't go to the bathroom for seven days
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:03.720]  it was so disgusting thank God I speak fluent Spanish and you know but I was
[3:27:03.720 --> 3:27:07.120]  really and I'm sure Jeff is one of the only middle-aged white guys in there it's
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:11.440]  pretty much all black and brown people and it's really disgusting Ron Paul is
[3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:16.320]  right the CIA has committed a coup in our country and they're really evil doers
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:20.920]  and they're the real drug dealers by the way cue that Ron Paul we actually have
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:24.080]  the original great guy sent it to us at a campaign for liberties in the
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:26.640]  government ships in the drugs they've been caught literally thousands of times
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:32.320]  on hundreds thousands and we've had a coup over our nation but but the most
[3:27:32.320 --> 3:27:36.160]  important thing you just said Craig because I've seen this in other areas
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:41.160]  I've seen dry counties in Texas were only the retired cop who pays his
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:47.400]  friends off is allowed to run a bar where it's a club anybody else gets shut
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:52.640]  down I guess it's the same thing here you're saying police own their own
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:57.320]  dispensaries and of course those don't get touched yeah but I'm not sure they're
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:00.720]  like retired police I think they're doing operations to catch the vendors of
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:04.920]  people come in to sell medical marijuana and they also find out who's using
[3:28:04.920 --> 3:28:09.400]  medical marijuana and the police run medical marijuana clubs so the
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:14.040]  absolute cheapest pot around and it's usually a little dried out as if they're
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:19.120]  stealing it from people like Jeff and myself and then resell it's also on the
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:22.720]  news that the police go and grab money and drugs and don't even file it now
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:27.120]  they just openly keep it I mean we're as bad as Mexico well that happened in my
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:33.120]  first situation Brett Bogue who is also in the movie came into my temple and I
[3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:37.640]  wrote him a check and he actually I have him on video arriving with the police
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:41.600]  that's why I mean I think this movie they do want you to watch it it's partly
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:47.480]  financed by I believe the CIA and Kevin can talk about that but these guys are
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:51.080]  actually selling the pot I wrote him a check for the pot they gave me the pot
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:55.280]  and then they came and seized the pot and they kept the money from the cash
[3:28:55.280 --> 3:28:59.080]  check and I still owe them money and I still owed money to a couple other
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:03.960]  vendors that I've done my best to pay off but Brett and his brother never ever
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:08.200]  asked me for the money that we owe them the balance because it wasn't their
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:11.880]  money to begin with it was I'm not there in LA I don't even know who these people
[3:29:11.880 --> 3:29:15.640]  are that you're talking about the guy in the movie he's got like a whole
[3:29:15.640 --> 3:29:19.800]  commercial in the middle of the movie and where it built his credibility as I've
[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:23.200]  won the cannabis cup and won this and he works for the government and he's one
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:28.000]  of the guys creating the genetics you know he's created the genetics for great
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:31.720]  babe kaya kush bubble kush sour grapes wait a minute wait a minute how do you
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:36.360]  know he works for the government because I have it on video when I got
[3:29:36.360 --> 3:29:39.880]  arrested in the first case I've known this guy for years and years and years
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:45.040]  Kevin can tell you all about him amazing well let's continue to talk about the

[3:33:16.520 --> 3:33:20.600]  if the mass media would get a hold of and do something about it but they're
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:24.880]  covering it up and that is the you were talking about the government
[3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:29.760]  involvement in drugs there have been government investigations there have been
[3:33:29.760 --> 3:33:33.420]  private investigations and we've interviewed a lot of people to XCIA
[3:33:33.420 --> 3:33:39.100]  people who have talked about the CIA involvement in drug operations for many
[3:33:39.100 --> 3:33:44.820]  decades it's public knowledge so once again the media are not saying anything
[3:33:44.820 --> 3:33:51.860]  about it that Oliver North and his people involved with the Contras have
[3:33:51.860 --> 3:33:56.340]  been running drug operations cocaine primarily bringing it back into the
[3:33:56.340 --> 3:34:01.340]  United States and there are other investigations which show that George
[3:34:01.340 --> 3:34:06.700]  Bush's office Donald Greg particularly and the people he was working with have
[3:34:06.700 --> 3:34:12.940]  been supervising an enormous drug operation which once again was bringing
[3:34:12.940 --> 3:34:18.140]  sending illegal arms or down to the Contras and elsewhere and bringing
[3:34:18.140 --> 3:34:23.620]  cocaine and other types of drugs back into the United States but neither the
[3:34:23.620 --> 3:34:28.460]  Democrats aren't talking about this now are the libertarians talking about this
[3:34:28.460 --> 3:34:32.800]  and did they put this into the framework of the drug law situation that you're
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:36.300]  talking about we talk about a whole lot of course we always have the trouble
[3:34:36.300 --> 3:34:39.500]  of getting the attention that we think it deserves there have been a few
[3:34:39.500 --> 3:34:43.340]  Democrats have talked about certain carries office and some work he's done
[3:34:43.340 --> 3:34:47.380]  a lot of the investigation right and I think he's on to something and I think
[3:34:47.380 --> 3:34:52.020]  we've gotten some other information too of course that George or the CIA has
[3:34:52.020 --> 3:34:55.180]  given Noriega over the years $200,000 a year
[3:34:55.180 --> 3:35:01.700]  yes and they kept feeding him money even when Bush was ahead of the CIA I
[3:35:01.700 --> 3:35:07.380]  think George Bush is deep into it well over this head somebody asked me once
[3:35:07.380 --> 3:35:12.540]  of if I thought George Bush knew about as much what's going on as Ronald Reagan
[3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:16.000]  I think George Bush knew a lot more about what was happening in the CIA because I
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:22.020]  think Reagan was probably more removed from that just by his own personality
[3:35:22.020 --> 3:35:30.100]  that's Ron Paul back in the 1980s in Austin Texas alternative views when I got to Austin in the
[3:35:30.100 --> 3:35:34.460]  early 90s I would watch the show and learn quite a bit that that show was
[3:35:34.460 --> 3:35:40.300]  very formative I didn't know till later Tommy Pilata in the early 90s no even
[3:35:40.300 --> 3:35:42.940]  before that because he was in slacker in the early 90s with Rick with Rick Link
[3:35:42.940 --> 3:35:46.220]  Letter I guess right around that time I haven't talked to Tommy yet but I believe
[3:35:46.220 --> 3:35:48.940]  he was involved in that very interview in production so remember him talking
[3:35:48.940 --> 3:35:53.540]  about meeting Ron Paul in conjunction with that show but let's go ahead now
[3:35:53.540 --> 3:35:58.180]  and we're queuing up another clip the one I actually wanted but that was a good
[3:35:58.180 --> 3:36:03.100]  clip too of what happened just about a month ago with Ron Paul in a campaign
[3:36:03.100 --> 3:36:07.020]  for Liberty this is why I love Ron Paul he's the same yesterday today and
[3:36:07.020 --> 3:36:12.340]  tomorrow exposing the CIA coup over America you decriminalized drugs it is a
[3:36:12.340 --> 3:36:15.140]  major blow this is how they get into our lives with their informants their
[3:36:15.140 --> 3:36:19.780]  police state here it is I mean they're they're almost like they lived in a
[3:36:19.780 --> 3:36:24.300]  different world the military is down around is down the money is an area
[3:36:24.300 --> 3:36:29.420]  going looking for a couple more wars to fight it makes no sense whatsoever but
[3:36:29.420 --> 3:36:34.380]  no we don't have to worry it's not the military anymore because it's there's
[3:36:34.380 --> 3:36:38.980]  been a coup have you heard it's the CIA coup the coup the CIA runs everything
[3:36:38.980 --> 3:36:43.260]  they run the military they're the ones who are over there lobbing missiles and
[3:36:43.260 --> 3:36:48.300]  bombs on these countries it's not even a military that does that the CIA runs
[3:36:48.300 --> 3:36:55.020]  this and of course the CIA is every bit as secret as the Federal Reserve and yet
[3:36:55.020 --> 3:36:59.420]  think of the harm that they have done since they were established in since
[3:36:59.420 --> 3:37:03.980]  World War II they are a government under themselves they're in businesses they're
[3:37:03.980 --> 3:37:13.460]  in drug businesses and we need to take out the CIA Ron Paul can be for liberty
[3:37:13.460 --> 3:37:17.980]  about a month ago now now here's the issue I don't use drugs except for
[3:37:17.980 --> 3:37:22.980]  caffeine and tobacco occasionally and I've even pretty much quit drinking the
[3:37:22.980 --> 3:37:28.900]  point is is that I know that they're even keeping it from cancer patients and
[3:37:28.900 --> 3:37:35.860]  glaucoma patients and the hundreds of other medical uses I know that as our
[3:37:35.860 --> 3:37:39.420]  guest was just saying I don't know about particular cases but that you have all
[3:37:39.420 --> 3:37:43.020]  these dispensaries some government runs some government ops behind it I mean
[3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:47.420]  it's a mess when the state legalized legal dispensaries if a medical doctor
[3:37:47.420 --> 3:37:51.340]  says you can use this and the reason the UN and Codex Alameteria so that's what
[3:37:51.340 --> 3:37:55.580]  I consulted on in the film when Kevin came to interview me is about the fact
[3:37:55.580 --> 3:38:00.300]  that they want to have aloe vera they've had a red on aloe vera plantation
[3:38:00.300 --> 3:38:04.460]  saying it it's evil a fish oil they want to make you in fact pull up that
[3:38:04.460 --> 3:38:08.740]  Toronto star about government puts out new rules for pharmacies about over the
[3:38:08.740 --> 3:38:12.420]  counter vitamins and minerals saying it's outlawed you know not even a law
[3:38:12.420 --> 3:38:16.300]  they just say it that's why this is so serious this gives the government the
[3:38:16.300 --> 3:38:19.620]  excuse to have informants the secret police and all of this and now the
[3:38:19.620 --> 3:38:22.300]  government wants to control the dispensaries and cut it down from
[3:38:22.300 --> 3:38:27.580]  thousands they're saying to only 70 or whatever it is in Los Angeles so they
[3:38:27.580 --> 3:38:31.220]  control it if they can't keep it illegal so they can control it and get
[3:38:31.220 --> 3:38:34.460]  higher prices they'll restrict the number of stores to keep the prices high
[3:38:34.460 --> 3:38:38.100]  I mean this is really a monopoly being set up isn't it Craig ribbon what do you
[3:38:38.100 --> 3:38:41.740]  think about what Obama's done looks to me like he's gone back on his promises
[3:38:41.740 --> 3:38:46.780]  Obama has gone back on his promises and one of my volunteers Richard Castaldo
[3:38:46.780 --> 3:38:50.820]  was a victim from Columbine he's in a wheelchair and he testified in front of
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:54.580]  the L.A. City Council that when he first came to L.A. he was paying eighty five
[3:38:54.580 --> 3:38:58.540]  dollars for three point five grams of marijuana and he was finally getting it
[3:38:58.540 --> 3:39:02.940]  down to forty dollars are excuse me for an eight now he's getting it down to
[3:39:02.940 --> 3:39:06.980]  forty dollars and eight because there's such a proliferation of clubs and I
[3:39:06.980 --> 3:39:10.700]  believe marijuana is really the key to defeating the new world order because
[3:39:10.700 --> 3:39:14.220]  it's really all about globalization and having been forced to get your
[3:39:14.220 --> 3:39:17.860]  and it takes the profit out of it it takes the profit out of it which cuts out
[3:39:17.860 --> 3:39:23.460]  the CIA but by having pot illegal we can't grow industrial hemp Henry Ford
[3:39:23.460 --> 3:39:28.820]  built a car at a hemp that ran on hemp fuel the body like the Corvette with a
[3:39:28.820 --> 3:39:33.740]  fiberglass and hemp body that it was ten times stronger than steel we don't need
[3:39:33.740 --> 3:39:37.660]  to go all around the world to get our resources we can grow food locally make
[3:39:37.660 --> 3:39:42.340]  our clothes locally our medicines and marijuana is really the key to defeating
[3:39:42.340 --> 3:39:49.300]  the new world order Kevin again it's important for people to see how we'd
[3:39:49.300 --> 3:39:53.980]  won the West I mean I think the most important sections of the government
[3:39:53.980 --> 3:39:58.300]  drug dealing in the film tell folks more about I mean you spent years making how
[3:39:58.300 --> 3:40:04.260]  we'd won the West yeah I mean this has been a long labor of love and and
[3:40:04.260 --> 3:40:09.260]  something where I had to just do more than infiltrate this society I had to
[3:40:09.260 --> 3:40:15.820]  kind of you know merge in with these people and it's a it's just been it's
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:18.940]  been a long labor of love and one of those one of the things I wanted to talk
[3:40:18.940 --> 3:40:23.300]  about is you know I go through and when you've been posting video clips on
[3:40:23.300 --> 3:40:29.100]  YouTube and stuff it's like only one out of every couple hundred responses is
[3:40:29.100 --> 3:40:33.660]  negative and I keep seeing this one same negative response towards you being a
[3:40:33.660 --> 3:40:37.420]  part of the film Alex and that is people saying I can't believe Alex is
[3:40:37.420 --> 3:40:41.220]  falling for this you know the new world order wants everybody to be stoned
[3:40:41.220 --> 3:40:47.460]  yeah go ahead and be a big donor and lose your freedom etc etc that those are
[3:40:47.460 --> 3:40:53.940]  the people that that I'd like to address and by saying that you know it's all
[3:40:53.940 --> 3:40:59.500]  just just a matter of what works best for you and the fact that we're allowing
[3:40:59.500 --> 3:41:04.660]  the government to outlaw a plant is the very face but Kevin it's more serious
[3:41:04.660 --> 3:41:08.700]  than that when they outlawed alcohol the amount of alcohol getting drunk
[3:41:08.700 --> 3:41:12.180]  tripled at least and it corrupted all the police and empowered the mafia I
[3:41:12.180 --> 3:41:16.060]  mean the point is the point is if they made out alcohol illegal you know
[3:41:16.060 --> 3:41:19.740]  people robbing stealing and killing to get it and get the money to get it I
[3:41:19.740 --> 3:41:23.260]  don't like alcohol and it's obvious it kills hundreds of thousands a year
[3:41:23.260 --> 3:41:27.100]  marijuana doesn't that's my whole point is this is hypocritical the government
[3:41:27.100 --> 3:41:30.220]  produced films like reefer madness saying you murder people when you smoke it
[3:41:30.220 --> 3:41:34.020]  maybe you sit there and eat a half gallon of Dutch ice cream yeah I mean
[3:41:34.020 --> 3:41:37.620]  sure some people are lazy to begin with marijuana I'll make them lazy some people
[3:41:37.620 --> 3:41:42.460]  aren't that's not even my issue my issue is the government is shipping in the
[3:41:42.460 --> 3:41:47.460]  hard drugs I'm sick of it all you take away their profit by decriminalizing
[3:41:47.460 --> 3:41:54.980]  I've been involved with the hemp movement since I was 12 years old I used to go
[3:41:54.980 --> 3:41:59.940]  down to the beach with the bus and work at the hemp booth and what's going on
[3:41:59.940 --> 3:42:03.420]  is the CIA and government are taking over the marijuana industry and they're
[3:42:03.420 --> 3:42:07.620]  trying to get the genetics so they can sell them to a Monsanto or a Philip
[3:42:07.620 --> 3:42:12.820]  Morris one of these big corporations and that's where I see the real key of how
[3:42:12.820 --> 3:42:15.620]  the New World Order is trying to infiltrate their way into the middle
[3:42:15.620 --> 3:42:18.540]  way let's talk about that because earlier stuff I don't know what you're
[3:42:18.540 --> 3:42:21.820]  talking about because I just consulted from a farm was interviewed for it but I
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:26.300]  do know and some of this is covered in the film that big tobacco companies are
[3:42:26.300 --> 3:42:29.940]  buying up the key marijuana growing areas and they are it looks like getting
[3:42:29.940 --> 3:42:34.060]  ready to come out with the super weed that is really really strong and then
[3:42:34.060 --> 3:42:37.860]  knocking everybody else out so so they know since most Americans have smoked
[3:42:37.860 --> 3:42:42.420]  pot and know it's a joke to have it illegal they're that I know are coming
[3:42:42.420 --> 3:42:46.620]  in and trying to dominate the key varieties so okay if we can't have it
[3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:51.620]  illegal we'll just have it as a cartel well I believe that's what's going on
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:54.660]  and they were involved in the Amsterdam growing and what they're
[3:42:54.660 --> 3:42:59.100]  specifically the government's role is to develop the genetics to then hand over
[3:42:59.100 --> 3:43:03.900]  using taxpayers money and then they hand over those genetics eventually either
[3:43:03.900 --> 3:43:07.920]  to themselves as they retire or to large corporations and then get their big
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:14.420]  retirement for having dealt drugs for the government for years that's my
[3:43:14.420 --> 3:43:18.340]  opinion Kevin you researched that for the film what do you think of what he
[3:43:18.340 --> 3:43:24.620]  just said you know I there's a lot of different conspiracy theories going on
[3:43:24.620 --> 3:43:28.620]  there it's hard to know what all is true and what's not true I mean another big
[3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:35.540]  theory is that the government is also engaged in trying to put things into the
[3:43:35.540 --> 3:43:39.780]  genetics of marijuana seeds to make it so they'll they'll they'll stop being
[3:43:39.780 --> 3:43:43.260]  able to breathe I mean you you've obviously heard of that Craig right well
[3:43:43.260 --> 3:43:46.620]  that's a terminator seed that they're trying to do with any plan so that you'd
[3:43:46.620 --> 3:43:51.700]  have to go back every single season to the seed provider to get your genetics
[3:43:51.700 --> 3:43:58.260]  to be able to farm any product but I don't know about about marijuana a lot
[3:43:58.260 --> 3:44:01.220]  of people that don't understand I mean today a lot of people make fun of the
[3:44:01.220 --> 3:44:06.380]  term medical marijuana and all I know is that when I was younger you know and I
[3:44:06.380 --> 3:44:10.020]  tried smoking marijuana it was the cheap you know what we call Mexican dirt
[3:44:10.020 --> 3:44:13.820]  weed with all the sticks and seeds in it when you smoke that stuff it makes you
[3:44:13.820 --> 3:44:20.020]  feel stupid and lazy and groggy when you try some of this medical marijuana some
[3:44:20.020 --> 3:44:24.540]  of this stuff it's so clean it doesn't even really make you get high and it
[3:44:24.540 --> 3:44:29.780]  just has the medicinal well that's right and to be clear I haven't started
[3:44:29.780 --> 3:44:35.100]  smoking marijuana because of this but when Joe Rogan was in town he invited
[3:44:35.100 --> 3:44:39.660]  me out to dinner to buy me dinner and I mean I don't care folks I drink a beer
[3:44:39.660 --> 3:44:43.940]  here and there and I had to smoke pot probably in 15 20 years you know I guess
[3:44:43.940 --> 3:44:49.140]  it was in high school 18 years ago college 17 so maybe 17 years and he said
[3:44:49.140 --> 3:44:57.140]  smoke this and I smoked one hit of it and was literally I mean I was like what
[3:44:57.140 --> 3:45:01.540]  is this because I had more energy I was more awake and then he explained to me
[3:45:01.540 --> 3:45:06.780]  that there's marijuana varieties that wake you up and everyone's always known
[3:45:06.780 --> 3:45:11.620]  this in the main crud stuff out of Mexico is what makes you tired and lazy and
[3:45:11.620 --> 3:45:15.860]  have the munchies and so the government's known this all along and 80 years
[3:45:15.860 --> 3:45:20.220]  ago got really scared of this and and so I guess a few months ago I mean I
[3:45:20.220 --> 3:45:24.740]  smoked one hit of marijuana and it was totally different from the stuff I'd
[3:45:24.740 --> 3:45:27.900]  smoked a few times in college in high school that made me feel groggy and
[3:45:27.900 --> 3:45:33.020]  stupid and and and so again I mean I literally did it as and that but I did
[3:45:33.020 --> 3:45:38.140]  it as an experiment I mean I did it as an experiment and it was very interesting
[3:45:38.140 --> 3:45:41.460]  go ahead no and that's exactly what the government doesn't want you to try
[3:45:41.460 --> 3:45:45.740]  because also you can grow that stuff yourself you don't need to get it from
[3:45:45.740 --> 3:45:49.300]  Mexico you don't need to get it off the black market and even have to buy it
[3:45:49.300 --> 3:45:54.060]  from a dispensary if you don't want and that's that's really what the fall comes
[3:45:54.060 --> 3:45:58.420]  down to well all the studies show that type of marijuana literally does work
[3:45:58.420 --> 3:46:02.620]  with depression I mean Prozac on the insert makes you kill yourself and get
[3:46:02.620 --> 3:46:06.500]  more depressed and is a deadly chemical that rots your brain and your liver on
[3:46:06.500 --> 3:46:11.300]  record same thing with that's interesting about being in and around all
[3:46:11.300 --> 3:46:15.100]  these like large marijuana events this weekend we they just had the hemp con at
[3:46:15.100 --> 3:46:18.020]  the LA Convention Center there's hundreds of thousands of people here it's
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:24.940]  it's like the most mellow even keel group everybody is so friendly and focused
[3:46:24.940 --> 3:46:29.380]  and it's just so different than any other kind of like drug culture or
[3:46:29.380 --> 3:46:33.140]  alcohol culture I mean go to a and I'm not putting down Octoberfest I mean we've
[3:46:33.140 --> 3:46:36.460]  got a place in Fredericksburg I love I you know but you know these kind of
[3:46:36.460 --> 3:46:40.020]  things like say Octoberfest where everybody gets just bombed and you've
[3:46:40.020 --> 3:46:44.180]  got fist fights breaking out people are upset getting advice with their wives
[3:46:44.180 --> 3:46:48.780]  etc etc and then you go to one of these big new marijuana rallies and it's just
[3:46:48.780 --> 3:46:54.980]  this really kind of even keel friendly atmosphere it's really hard to well I
[3:46:54.980 --> 3:47:00.620]  literally one second guys yeah I think that part of the problem with the United
[3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:05.060]  States is in the reason that the Liberty Movement is growing so rapidly is that
[3:47:05.060 --> 3:47:09.420]  there's this big spiritual deficiency and one of the reasons people come to
[3:47:09.420 --> 3:47:13.780]  marijuana the marijuana culture or medical marijuana is because they feel a
[3:47:13.780 --> 3:47:17.500]  part of something bigger than themselves and they feel a part of that for 20
[3:47:17.500 --> 3:47:21.980]  culture and you know I personally believe in the Bible but I believe that
[3:47:21.980 --> 3:47:25.940]  marijuana is something that makes people feel part of the community and helps
[3:47:25.940 --> 3:47:29.940]  fill that need and that that when they're using and they don't seem sick but
[3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:33.820]  they're using it for medical reasons that it's really a spiritual deficiency
[3:47:33.820 --> 3:47:36.900]  that people are suffering all right listen I'm out of time I'm out of time
[3:47:36.900 --> 3:47:40.140]  guys I'm gonna cover another key issue but we'll talk to you again soon how we
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:43.660]  the one the West really part two of American drug war available at info wars
[3:47:43.660 --> 3:47:49.500]  dot-com or by calling 888-253-3139 investigated for yourself I think
[3:47:49.500 --> 3:47:52.980]  overall well whatever type of marijuana has been spoken as general public it does
[3:47:52.980 --> 3:47:56.820]  hurt some people but the medical uses are certainly good and proven and that's
[3:47:56.820 --> 3:48:01.380]  what we investigate in this film and government drug dealing Kevin and Craig
[3:48:01.380 --> 3:48:04.900]  Rubin I want to thank you both for coming on with us thank you Alex thank
[3:48:04.900 --> 3:48:10.220]  you go ahead Kevin anybody out there who doesn't think it should be legalized
[3:48:10.220 --> 3:48:13.980]  is that whether it's legal or not you're not stopping anybody from trying it
[3:48:13.980 --> 3:48:19.620]  okay marijuana has been and will always be available I'm making it taboo all the
[3:48:19.620 --> 3:48:25.540]  study show it becomes I'm on guard and in a trendy and more people use it okay
[3:48:25.540 --> 3:48:30.740]  I'm pretty good for our economy as well guys I got a jump thank you I appreciate
[3:48:30.740 --> 3:48:35.380]  you both coming on with us okay separately I want to talk about ever
[3:48:35.380 --> 3:48:38.940]  Medina here at the end of the show we're gonna skip this final break okay this is
[3:48:38.940 --> 3:48:45.820]  a network break we're skipping it they came up to me during the first hour of
[3:48:45.820 --> 3:48:50.340]  the show and gave me this examiner article Debra Medina agrees that 911
[3:48:50.340 --> 3:48:56.340]  truthers beliefs are despicable and I'm familiar with the writer L.A. County
[3:48:56.340 --> 3:49:00.180]  libertarian examiner reporter I know he's done some good reports in the past
[3:49:00.180 --> 3:49:04.580]  they confirmed that the that it was audio of her on one of my big enemies who's
[3:49:04.580 --> 3:49:10.860]  lied about me this Mark Davis that she was on there and I told you when I came
[3:49:10.860 --> 3:49:16.740]  out and said I'm very upset with ever Medina and most the calls 95% of the
[3:49:16.740 --> 3:49:18.900]  calls we're getting are very supportive and understand because they heard what I
[3:49:18.900 --> 3:49:25.260]  actually said other people are gonna misconstrue what I've said about Debra
[3:49:25.260 --> 3:49:31.340]  Medina it isn't that she's not a 911 truth or that's not why I'm mad at her I
[3:49:31.340 --> 3:49:35.020]  never asked her about it when she's been on the phone and in the studio because I
[3:49:35.020 --> 3:49:38.700]  know it wasn't one of her issues at State of Texas it's that when she went on
[3:49:38.700 --> 3:49:43.420]  Glenn Beck they set her up I'd had people in her campaign going oh help us get on
[3:49:43.420 --> 3:49:46.540]  Glenn Beck I said he's gonna attack you they didn't listen they never listen
[3:49:46.540 --> 3:49:52.580]  everybody's just got everything figured out but me and he set her up and went
[3:49:52.580 --> 3:49:56.860]  after her and she said quote the real underlying question here though is
[3:49:56.860 --> 3:50:00.460]  whether or not people have the right to question the government I think the facts
[3:50:00.460 --> 3:50:04.900]  of the people are even asking questions on this level gets to the incredible
[3:50:04.900 --> 3:50:09.700]  distrust career politicians have fostered and I said hey she's not a 911
[3:50:09.700 --> 3:50:13.420]  truth or but she supports an investigation I think she's great it's a
[3:50:13.420 --> 3:50:20.700]  Texas issue because she hadn't flip flopped the issue is the flip flopping
[3:50:20.700 --> 3:50:31.500]  she goes on Mark Davis's show yesterday this is the number one talk show in
[3:50:31.500 --> 3:50:34.420]  Dallas he fills in for Rush Limbaugh it's syndicated in some markets according
[3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:38.220]  to what I've read he's lied about me in the past said I said kill Michelle
[3:50:38.220 --> 3:50:40.980]  Malcolm even when major newspapers retracted and said somebody behind me
[3:50:40.980 --> 3:50:44.300]  yelled it tried to set me up they were with Malcolm that was another setup I
[3:50:44.300 --> 3:50:48.260]  get set up at these rallies folks and they shoot video a certain way to deceive
[3:50:48.260 --> 3:50:54.420]  you but but that came out and then she went on Dallas Houston TV five
[3:50:54.420 --> 3:50:58.060]  different TV stations we played the clip earlier and said I think the way those
[3:50:58.060 --> 3:51:01.620]  towers falls is very suspicious and I said wow she's like a 911 truth or
[3:51:01.620 --> 3:51:08.020]  wow I like her even more wow she's not retracting then they had a shake-up in
[3:51:08.020 --> 3:51:10.900]  her campaign last week some people got replaced suddenly things started
[3:51:10.900 --> 3:51:15.260]  changing and I noticed it and I was going man I got a bad feeling here then
[3:51:15.260 --> 3:51:19.660]  she came out on Mark Davis's radio show to six million people potentially in
[3:51:19.660 --> 3:51:24.780]  Dallas and surrounding areas covers half the state she went on this big show and
[3:51:24.780 --> 3:51:28.020]  he said these are despicable people they're horrible they're evil they're
[3:51:28.020 --> 3:51:34.460]  bad she said I totally agree it's ridiculous it's horrible it's the total
[3:51:34.460 --> 3:51:42.700]  180 flip flop that's the issue it's not about 911 truth it's that I was thrown
[3:51:42.700 --> 3:51:47.580]  under the bus you were thrown under the bus and I'm sick of it now my question
[3:51:47.580 --> 3:51:51.700]  to Deborah Medina is if she'll come on that's fine I'm sure they'll check it
[3:51:51.700 --> 3:51:56.300]  out I don't care the truth's all that matters I don't throw my weight and my
[3:51:56.300 --> 3:52:00.540]  listeners wait behind something and then get double-crossed and not come back
[3:52:00.540 --> 3:52:06.740]  at it you understand that I stuck up for Ron Paul when he didn't go public for
[3:52:06.740 --> 3:52:10.740]  911 truth and says he doesn't believe that and said great that's always been
[3:52:10.740 --> 3:52:14.700]  in his opinion fine he exposes other admitted forms of government sponsored
[3:52:14.700 --> 3:52:20.460]  terror he's real I don't know if she got bad advice or what she did but will she
[3:52:20.460 --> 3:52:24.780]  go back and not be for controlling the border or for open carry or for property
[3:52:24.780 --> 3:52:31.060]  taxes I want to know this is supposedly this maverick this is person who will
[3:52:31.060 --> 3:52:34.340]  a hundred percent tell you the truth and what she said yesterday she'll say
[3:52:34.340 --> 3:52:39.540]  tomorrow and I did get a few emails people saying you know Alex you know
[3:52:39.540 --> 3:52:45.780]  Texas freedom is more important than this and Texas freedom you know as if I
[3:52:45.780 --> 3:52:49.540]  should go yeah okay throw us under the bus yeah totally change what you said
[3:52:49.540 --> 3:52:57.740]  and then I become complicit in that I don't do that you understand that ladies
[3:52:57.740 --> 3:53:02.220]  and gentlemen I'm the same yesterday today and tomorrow occasionally I make a
[3:53:02.220 --> 3:53:07.580]  mistake and I'll admit that but you notice Mark Davis we're gonna play the
[3:53:07.580 --> 3:53:13.780]  clip coming up here a moment you notice after she throws herself and us under
[3:53:13.780 --> 3:53:17.860]  the bus she didn't know she was thrown herself under it he says well there's a
[3:53:17.860 --> 3:53:21.900]  second point on this you know just because you said you weren't cleared or
[3:53:21.900 --> 3:53:24.740]  didn't know what you were talking about that shows you don't have leadership
[3:53:24.740 --> 3:53:27.460]  because you didn't know what was going on and didn't know the issues so see
[3:53:27.460 --> 3:53:32.340]  they're just gonna attack her more don't you understand that I mean when she came
[3:53:32.340 --> 3:53:35.500]  out and went further for 911 truth not just saying a new investigation is
[3:53:35.500 --> 3:53:40.700]  reasonable but oh yes I'll play that clip first of her a day two days after
[3:53:40.700 --> 3:53:44.700]  Glenn Beck there's five different clips of this she went on Houston Dallas TV you
[3:53:44.700 --> 3:53:49.820]  name it and said I think people have a right for an investigation I think the
[3:53:49.820 --> 3:53:55.340]  towers falling was very suspicious and then so she's saying she's despicable
[3:53:55.340 --> 3:54:00.300]  because most 911 truth or she's saying we're despicable most 911 truthers don't
[3:54:00.300 --> 3:54:02.700]  know exactly what happened they just know the official stories of fraud in the
[3:54:02.700 --> 3:54:09.940]  line so here is the video clip of her two days after Glenn Beck on television
[3:54:09.940 --> 3:54:15.580]  saying that she thinks it's reasonable to question here it is I think the
[3:54:15.580 --> 3:54:21.740]  questions that I've heard asked her how those buildings fell right and I don't
[3:54:21.740 --> 3:54:24.300]  I don't I'm not the engineer to know that and I think there's a good
[3:54:24.300 --> 3:54:29.020]  relevant questions to ask that's not that's not saying our government was
[3:54:29.020 --> 3:54:31.700]  involved I don't know that I think her government was involved I think their
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:34.540]  questions that need to be asked we need to elect people who are natural born
[3:54:34.540 --> 3:54:38.060]  citizens according to our okay and there's even more before that the point
[3:54:38.060 --> 3:54:41.740]  is it's interview after interview after interview and on Glenn Beck she said
[3:54:41.740 --> 3:54:44.220]  the real underlying question here though is whether this is statement our
[3:54:44.220 --> 3:54:47.860]  website or not people have the right to question our government I think the fact
[3:54:47.860 --> 3:54:51.100]  that people are even asking questions on this level gets to the incredible
[3:54:51.100 --> 3:54:57.500]  distrust career politicians have fostered so I'm like yeah then she goes on a
[3:54:57.500 --> 3:55:01.820]  big radio show and says we're basically despicable let's go ahead and play that
[3:55:01.820 --> 3:55:06.780]  clip from Mark Davis good it is nice to have you let's do two things let's take
[3:55:06.780 --> 3:55:10.980]  a couple minutes and wrap up the the 9-11 thing and then I want you to get
[3:55:10.980 --> 3:55:15.460]  to what you want to talk about for these remaining weeks of the campaign
[3:55:15.460 --> 3:55:19.940]  days I think I seriously yeah it well indeed so my assertion is it would have
[3:55:19.940 --> 3:55:23.660]  been over by now would have been over in a day if after the Beck thing you to
[3:55:23.660 --> 3:55:27.820]  said boy I'm sorry I messed up I should have identified this 9-11 truth or
[3:55:27.820 --> 3:55:31.940]  movement as the despicable paranoid cult that they are what a horrible hateful
[3:55:31.940 --> 3:55:35.500]  belief to have in your head that 9-11 was an inside job why didn't you do that
[3:55:35.500 --> 3:55:41.460]  yeah I am I agree with you Mark you know I laughed it off whenever he he said I
[3:55:41.460 --> 3:55:47.380]  was the truth or cuz I thought it was so absurd and I and I I said no a
[3:55:47.380 --> 3:55:52.580]  despicable horrible cult back it up to her answer on people to hear that this
[3:55:52.580 --> 3:55:58.220]  is unedited despicable horrible cult oh I agree Mark I agree they're a
[3:55:58.220 --> 3:56:03.620]  despicable horrible cult weeks before after Glenn Beck oh I think the way
[3:56:03.620 --> 3:56:07.740]  those buildings fell I have questions now we're a despicable horrible cult and
[3:56:07.740 --> 3:56:14.660]  I agree and then I'm bad Alex Jones is bad for actually being steadfast and
[3:56:14.660 --> 3:56:19.340]  seeing a flip-flop like this and getting angry I want you to call Medina
[3:56:19.340 --> 3:56:27.140]  their lines have been busy and I want you to get through 877 we Texans yeah we
[3:56:27.140 --> 3:56:30.740]  Texans aren't double talkers and flip-flopper floppers and side crab
[3:56:30.740 --> 3:56:40.140]  walkers 877-938-3926 or contact at Medina for Texas comm this isn't about
[3:56:40.140 --> 3:56:46.540]  9-11 truth this is about flip-flopping Glenn Beck now says he believes in
[3:56:46.540 --> 3:56:48.980]  global warming now that it's collapsing trying to save it he says he wants
[3:56:48.980 --> 3:56:52.380]  value-added taxes he says he wants the Patriot he says he's for the Banker
[3:56:52.380 --> 3:56:56.180]  bailout he says he that's what we're talking about is a bunch of double
[3:56:56.180 --> 3:57:04.140]  talking people I've had it with double talk player again play it but I agree
[3:57:04.140 --> 3:57:08.300]  with you mark you know I laughed it off whenever he he said I was a truth or
[3:57:08.300 --> 3:57:12.500]  cuz I thought it was so absurd and I and I I should have just said no
[3:57:12.500 --> 3:57:16.660]  absolutely I'm not a truth or I think it's abundantly clear I'm not a truth
[3:57:16.660 --> 3:57:23.180]  or you know those those things happen to us and we pick up say should have done
[3:57:23.180 --> 3:57:27.220]  that better move on and that's what we've done then there's just one or the
[3:57:27.220 --> 3:57:30.620]  thing that's left because not being a truth or is great I'm thinking of course
[3:57:30.620 --> 3:57:34.940]  you're not of course you're not but sometimes the wisdom is defined by
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:40.300]  knowing whom to praise and whom to quite frankly condemn someone walking around
[3:57:40.300 --> 3:57:43.460]  with the belief that America would do this to its own people the president
[3:57:43.460 --> 3:57:46.580]  Bush and those around him would slaughter our own citizens in order to
[3:57:46.580 --> 3:57:51.900]  justify war is a despicable thing to great and and if that's it you want to
[3:57:51.900 --> 3:57:57.100]  be on record is agreeing with that agreed yeah I'm I I was thinking in
[3:57:57.100 --> 3:58:02.020]  terms of a commission report not in terms of what you know individuals are
[3:58:02.020 --> 3:58:07.140]  out there doing and the the commission report I think is the is the thing that
[3:58:07.140 --> 3:58:11.460]  I was getting back to none of which as you indicate has a direct
[3:58:11.460 --> 3:58:15.660]  stab is going on now he stabs her in Texas right now with the exception of
[3:58:15.660 --> 3:58:19.180]  we ought to be concerned about terrorism and what's coming across our southern
[3:58:19.180 --> 3:58:24.020]  border indeed I haven't addressed that issue and we really need to be focused
[3:58:24.020 --> 3:58:28.620]  on that we've of course been out talking about how important border security is
[3:58:28.620 --> 3:58:33.340]  that's enough we won't have time to play the rest of it radio show is over the
[3:58:33.340 --> 3:58:36.500]  video clips are up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com if you want
[3:58:36.500 --> 3:58:40.620]  to see them in their entirety I mean this is unbelievable and I'm not putting

[3:58:55.980 --> 3:58:59.700]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[3:58:59.700 --> 3:59:03.500]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:59:03.500 --> 3:59:08.020]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:59:08.020 --> 3:59:12.220]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[3:59:12.220 --> 3:59:16.860]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[3:59:16.860 --> 3:59:20.820]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[3:59:20.820 --> 3:59:24.980]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[3:59:24.980 --> 3:59:28.940]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[3:59:28.940 --> 3:59:33.100]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
