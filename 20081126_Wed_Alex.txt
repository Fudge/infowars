[00:11.200 --> 00:15.700]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:15.700 --> 00:18.700]  Once again, thank you from GetTheT.com.
[00:18.700 --> 00:28.700]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:32.700 --> 00:34.700]  Big Brother.
[00:34.700 --> 00:37.700]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:37.700 --> 00:39.700]  You want answers?
[00:39.700 --> 00:41.700]  Well, so does he.
[00:41.700 --> 00:45.700]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45.700 --> 00:49.700]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:49.700 --> 00:51.700]  That's right!
[00:51.700 --> 00:55.700]  We're going to air a few more minutes from the intro to the great global warming swindle.
[00:55.700 --> 00:59.700]  We have it posted up at prisonplanet.com.
[00:59.700 --> 01:02.700]  Don't believe a sign of it claims? Check them all out for a show?
[01:02.700 --> 01:05.700]  Find out the truth.
[01:05.700 --> 01:07.700]  And then we've got Alan Watt coming up.
[01:07.700 --> 01:10.700]  And we'll be taking your phone calls continually with him.
[01:10.700 --> 01:13.700]  But as I said at the end of the last hour, briefly in 10 seconds.
[01:13.700 --> 01:16.700]  Prisonplanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16.700 --> 01:22.700]  All of my films, 20 plus, Fable Enemies, Jason Burmes' film, High Quality, Burnham to Disks, DVD,
[01:22.700 --> 01:29.700]  Give Them to People, Prisonplanet.tv, a factory, an armory of resistance.
[01:29.700 --> 01:33.700]  My weekly TV reports, a whole bunch of extras.
[01:33.700 --> 01:41.700]  You know, just raw footage from films, special extras like in-game 1.5, just thousands of pieces of media.
[01:41.700 --> 01:43.700]  Four and a half years up and running.
[01:43.700 --> 01:48.700]  Prisonplanet.tv, super high quality, super fast download, streaming.
[01:48.700 --> 01:51.700]  We've got CDNs, so it's really high quality out to you.
[01:51.700 --> 01:55.700]  And your membership also makes this show what we do here possible.
[01:55.700 --> 01:58.700]  So we can do a lot more if you'll support us with the Prisonplanet.tv membership.
[01:58.700 --> 02:04.700]  But listen, for Christmas, for the holidays, just go get a Prisonplanet.tv membership.
[02:04.700 --> 02:06.700]  Create a passcode and username.
[02:06.700 --> 02:08.700]  It takes about a minute to sign up.
[02:08.700 --> 02:12.700]  And then give somebody a year membership, five months free right now, by the way.
[02:12.700 --> 02:15.700]  Or give them a monthly membership and then just keep the code for yourself.
[02:15.700 --> 02:17.700]  I don't care if you share it.
[02:17.700 --> 02:21.700]  We've got the IP address thing turned up to about five IP addresses.
[02:21.700 --> 02:24.700]  I may even turn it up higher so you can share your passcode.
[02:24.700 --> 02:28.700]  In the old days, we just had basic servers and I didn't want to slow down for members.
[02:28.700 --> 02:35.700]  But now we're not, I mean, I just pay for it, but it's always fast, always high quality.
[02:35.700 --> 02:38.700]  So I don't care if you share it with some folks.
[02:38.700 --> 02:45.700]  I mean, obviously, if you publish it somewhere and 100 people use it, it won't work anymore because it will block after five IPs.
[02:45.700 --> 02:47.700]  But I think I'm going to turn it up to like 10 IPs.
[02:47.700 --> 02:53.700]  And so for Christmas, I want you to share the truth in high quality the way these films were meant to be seen.
[02:53.700 --> 02:55.700]  Again, at Prisonplanet.tv.
[02:55.700 --> 02:58.700]  Back to the great global warming swindle.
[02:58.700 --> 03:09.700]  It's important that people know that climate enabled a quite different lifestyle in the medieval period.
[03:09.700 --> 03:15.700]  We have this view today that warming is going to have apocalyptic outcomes.
[03:15.700 --> 03:21.700]  In fact, wherever you describe this warm beard, it appears to be associated with riches.
[03:21.700 --> 03:23.700]  We're having a heat wave.
[03:23.700 --> 03:27.700]  In Europe, this was the great age of the cathedral builders.
[03:27.700 --> 03:32.700]  At a time when, according to Chaucer, vineyards flourished even in the north of England.
[03:32.700 --> 03:41.700]  All over the city of London, there are little memories of the vineyards that grew in the medieval warm period.
[03:41.700 --> 03:50.700]  So this was a wonderfully rich time, and this little church, in a sense, symbolized it because it comes from a period of great wealth.
[03:50.700 --> 03:56.700]  Going back in time further still, before the medieval warm period, we find more warm spells,
[03:56.700 --> 04:02.700]  including a very prolonged period during the Bronze Age, known to geologists as the Holocene Maximum,
[04:02.700 --> 04:08.700]  when temperatures were significantly higher than they are now for more than three millennia.
[04:08.700 --> 04:15.700]  If we go back 8,000 years in the Holocene period, our current interglacial, it was much warmer than it is today.
[04:15.700 --> 04:18.700]  Now, the polar bears obviously survived that period.
[04:18.700 --> 04:19.700]  They're with us today.
[04:19.700 --> 04:28.700]  They're very adaptable, and these warm periods in the past, what we call hipsy thermals, pose no problem for them.
[04:28.700 --> 04:32.700]  Climate variation in the past is clearly natural.
[04:32.700 --> 04:37.700]  So why do we think it's any different today?
[04:37.700 --> 04:42.700]  In the current alarm about global warming, the culprit is industrial society.
[04:42.700 --> 04:49.700]  Thanks to modern industry, luxuries once enjoyed exclusively by the rich are now available in abundance to ordinary people.
[04:49.700 --> 04:53.700]  Novel technologies have made life easier and richer.
[04:53.700 --> 04:58.700]  Modern transport and communications have made the world seem less foreign and distant.
[04:58.700 --> 05:04.700]  Industrial progress has changed our lives, but has it also changed the climate?
[05:04.700 --> 05:11.700]  According to the theory of man-made global warming, industrial growth should cause the temperature to rise.
[05:11.700 --> 05:18.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with Alan Watt from Canada and your phone calls at 800-25-99231.
[05:18.700 --> 05:23.700]  I'll go over the days, important news, the economy, his outlook on the future, and a lot more.
[05:23.700 --> 05:27.700]  The always intriguing Alan Watt, straight ahead, I'm Alex Joe.
[05:30.700 --> 05:33.700]  We have a new president coming into office in January.
[05:33.700 --> 05:36.700]  His number one word of use is change.
[05:36.700 --> 05:39.700]  What if the change was not the change America expected?
[05:39.700 --> 05:44.700]  What if all natural products were handed over to the pharmaceutical companies to be eradicated?
[05:44.700 --> 05:49.700]  What if the only remedy for sickness and disease was to take drugs?
[05:49.700 --> 05:52.700]  This hasn't happened yet, I repeat, not yet.
[05:52.700 --> 05:56.700]  Prepare and defend your body with GetTheTea.com.

[06:28.700 --> 06:34.700]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here on
[06:34.700 --> 06:37.700]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[06:37.700 --> 06:44.700]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[06:44.700 --> 06:53.700]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:53.700 --> 07:00.700]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[07:00.700 --> 07:03.700]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[07:03.700 --> 07:09.700]  He takes his hand off in a year, three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[07:09.700 --> 07:12.700]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[07:12.700 --> 07:18.700]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[07:18.700 --> 07:21.700]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[07:21.700 --> 07:27.700]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:27.700 --> 07:34.700]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank. We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America.
[07:34.700 --> 07:43.700]  We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident which will force unpopular decisions.
[07:43.700 --> 07:49.700]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted on our Christmas gifts
[07:49.700 --> 07:53.700]  that will be useless when the only food available isn't a government bread line.
[07:53.700 --> 07:57.700]  When the president is faced with the expected national security incident,
[07:57.700 --> 08:02.700]  the in-place patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[08:02.700 --> 08:06.700]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[08:06.700 --> 08:12.700]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[08:12.700 --> 08:18.700]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself, food for these unknown times.
[08:18.700 --> 08:27.700]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633.
[08:28.700 --> 08:37.700]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:37.700 --> 08:51.700]  It is November 18, 2008. We've got an hour and 52 minutes left in this transmission broadcasting on the AM and FM dial.
[08:51.700 --> 09:01.700]  Transmitting and streaming over the web at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com as well as over different satellite systems.
[09:01.700 --> 09:06.700]  This is The Alex Jones Radio Show. I am Alex Jones.
[09:06.700 --> 09:15.700]  Our guest is Alan Watt of cuttingthroughthematrix.com again for the next hour and 51 minutes now.
[09:15.700 --> 09:22.700]  I know that we have Don and Costa Rica, Jimmy and Kentucky, Dustin and others holding over from the last hour,
[09:22.700 --> 09:24.700]  but Alan can speak to any subjects you want to call in about.
[09:24.700 --> 09:28.700]  If you want to talk to Alan Watt, it's 1-800-255-99231.
[09:28.700 --> 09:30.700]  I have a lot of questions I want to ask Alan.
[09:30.700 --> 09:34.700]  I want to have discussions with him and try to bring both of our knowledge of the New World Order
[09:34.700 --> 09:38.700]  and all of our knowledge together to a higher level because to defeat the enemy,
[09:38.700 --> 09:40.700]  you have to know who they are and what their agenda is,
[09:40.700 --> 09:46.700]  but we will start going to your calls in T-minus 20 minutes when we come out of the bottom of the outbreaks.
[09:46.700 --> 09:51.700]  Everybody be patient. We're going to get to everybody who is patiently holding.
[09:51.700 --> 09:57.700]  But Alan, last hour I had a caller call in, Mike from California saying,
[09:57.700 --> 10:04.700]  well, if they're saying they plan to kill 80% of us, how do they plan to do that? And I was explaining to him that it's incremental.
[10:04.700 --> 10:09.700]  First, they've got to socialize this, get us under government control, being regulated, being tracked, being traced,
[10:09.700 --> 10:16.700]  in government schools where they always have things more far advanced than they are for the adults.
[10:16.700 --> 10:21.700]  This is all part of programming, bringing in the new model,
[10:21.700 --> 10:27.700]  flushing out the old info, putting in the new, reducing the language, semantically reducing the language,
[10:27.700 --> 10:33.700]  drugging, poisoning, sterilizing the population. We have all the numbers on that. I want to go over that.
[10:33.700 --> 10:39.700]  But out of the gates, I wanted to ask you, because I've seen a lot of this in their club of Rome planning,
[10:39.700 --> 10:43.700]  UN planning, biological diversity assessments.
[10:43.700 --> 10:48.700]  We've seen a lot of it in the university level documents they're putting out.
[10:48.700 --> 10:53.700]  What the Rand Corporation is saying, what the British Ministry of Defense said last year that I know you covered extensively,
[10:53.700 --> 10:58.700]  as we did here, where they admit that there's a global elite and they're waging war against the individual,
[10:58.700 --> 11:06.700]  that they're putting in robotic aircraft so they can replace humans, even refusing to say nerve gas large cities.
[11:06.700 --> 11:12.700]  So can you walk through how, from the pieces we have, I know you've researched the same stuff I have,
[11:12.700 --> 11:18.700]  and even more in some cases because I hear you, I read you, I know it's all on target because it's from the enemy's own manual.
[11:18.700 --> 11:24.700]  So for listeners, this is not our opinion here. But again, they leave gaps in it. They explain a lot of it,
[11:24.700 --> 11:30.700]  but then you have to, it's all compartmentalized and partitioned. You have to put it all together.
[11:30.700 --> 11:37.700]  And they're not clear on timeframes, but they want to use global war, global famine, controlled bioweapons releases,
[11:37.700 --> 11:44.700]  to train us with each terror attack, each bioweapons release, being bigger to live in a more and more controlled society
[11:44.700 --> 11:50.700]  in the name of keeping us safe to get us finally in that totally controlled technological enslavement grid,
[11:50.700 --> 11:57.700]  control grid, so that they can then exterminate us en masse with the super bioweapons they have,
[11:57.700 --> 12:01.700]  and they say they're racing to do this to save the earth.
[12:01.700 --> 12:06.700]  So can you break down how you see that unfolding and where you see it going on and what?
[12:06.700 --> 12:11.700]  Yes, well, as far as bringing the population down, it's already happening.
[12:11.700 --> 12:16.700]  It's been happening for 50 years and their own statistics prove it.
[12:16.700 --> 12:24.700]  I read reports this last week or so from official reports on the sterilization of males, the CBC television,
[12:24.700 --> 12:31.700]  Canada, that's the BBC version of the Canadians, came up with a documentary called The Disappearing Male,
[12:31.700 --> 12:36.700]  where now 85% are more sterile.
[12:36.700 --> 12:39.700]  The West is dying from Russia to Japan to the United States.
[12:39.700 --> 12:46.700]  First World is dying at about 3-4% a year, but to be clear, you mean they slowed down the global growth?
[12:46.700 --> 12:53.700]  Absolutely, and there's more women, girls being born than boys now because the boys have been attacked in the womb
[12:53.700 --> 13:03.700]  by Spinal A and phthalates, which will literally alter the biological makeup of the male, the taxes, and the crime system at the age of 7 weeks as a fetus.
[13:03.700 --> 13:10.700]  And we're seeing them today, the family of males, they're much slimmer, they have no shoulders.
[13:10.700 --> 13:16.700]  Let's not glaze over that, and this is again main government documents, CBC broadcast,
[13:16.700 --> 13:25.700]  and what Alan and I have already covered, but there was codified, the baby boys are dying in the womb, in mass, being targeted if they make it out.
[13:25.700 --> 13:32.700]  I don't even want to say they're feminine, they're an emasculated male whose literal glands do not develop.
[13:32.700 --> 13:34.700]  Alan, please continue.
[13:34.700 --> 13:46.700]  And also in that same documentary, they said that 10 years ago they could take sperm samples from young healthy males in college around the age of 18,
[13:46.700 --> 13:59.700]  and they had 60 million sperm per million liter, and now the new normal is 10 million per million liter, so that's how far it's dropped.
[13:59.700 --> 14:08.700]  And so they keep dropping the normal sperm count for males, and the sperm that's left is a motile, is a motile dysfunctional,
[14:08.700 --> 14:15.700]  it doesn't find the target, it cannot go to the ovum, so technically most males today are almost completely sterile.
[14:15.700 --> 14:23.700]  And this is well understood, they've been studying this for 50 years, and so now they're releasing what they've always known for the last 50 years.
[14:23.700 --> 14:29.700]  And you have to go back 50 years to the writings of Charles Galton Darwin, who came out with his book,
[14:29.700 --> 14:36.700]  The Next Million Years, where he outlines on behalf of the elites the different techniques of doing this very thing,
[14:36.700 --> 14:42.700]  sterilizing the population, primarily targeting the males, and reducing them drastically.
[14:42.700 --> 14:48.700]  So it has been happening, people are always looking for a big apocalypse, and it doesn't happen that way,
[14:48.700 --> 14:54.700]  it happens gradually, quietly, and the big mainstream media make no big deal about it.
[14:54.700 --> 15:02.700]  Explain that, because you do that very well, they state it's silent weapons for quiet wars, they slowly turn up the ambient chemicals,
[15:02.700 --> 15:09.700]  the frequency pollution, what's in the water, the food, so that we slowly get used to the neighbors, the kids dying of cancer,
[15:09.700 --> 15:14.700]  the old people dying early, we slowly get used to everybody not being able to have babies on the block,
[15:14.700 --> 15:18.700]  except for the new third world populations that come in that haven't been under the chemicals,
[15:18.700 --> 15:24.700]  but then you take third world groups that have been here a generation, they're just as sterilized as blacks and whites.
[15:24.700 --> 15:26.700]  I mean, we're under hardcore attack right now.
[15:26.700 --> 15:35.700]  It's complete all out warfare, and now he discussed this with Charles Galton Darwin, he was a physicist in the 1950s,
[15:35.700 --> 15:44.700]  and you find Arthur Koesler also worked at the United Nations, Arthur Koesler is admitted now, Koesler was a member of MI5, MI6,
[15:44.700 --> 15:52.700]  and he taught at university in New York for a while, he worked for the United Nations, and he wrote about this necessity as well,
[15:52.700 --> 15:58.700]  of vastly reducing the population, but using the same techniques, in fact, that they've been using on animals,
[15:58.700 --> 16:07.700]  and basically animal management in the forestry commissions, they target primarily the males to bring their population down drastically,
[16:07.700 --> 16:08.700]  same techniques we use chemical.
[16:08.700 --> 16:13.700]  Yeah, they've been putting out baits to chemically sterilize badgers and foxes,
[16:13.700 --> 16:17.700]  and again, it's all done just like you manage animals, they even say that, go ahead please.
[16:17.700 --> 16:24.700]  Yes, they actually call it hair management when they discuss humans in the medical societies now openly.
[16:24.700 --> 16:30.700]  So this has been happening, we're seeing all the other side effects as the sperm count drops,
[16:30.700 --> 16:37.700]  and the endocrine system is severely attacked in young men, their IQ level is dropping as well,
[16:37.700 --> 16:43.700]  which also explains why they can't catch on to the big picture of what's happening around them,
[16:43.700 --> 16:47.700]  they literally don't have the ability to see what's happening,
[16:47.700 --> 16:54.700]  and that again ties in with the big planning committees who discussed this with Charles Galton Darwin,
[16:54.700 --> 17:02.700]  he didn't do this on his own, he spoke on behalf of the big think tanks and foundations that worked on behalf of the British elite at the time,
[17:02.700 --> 17:09.700]  and they talked about the necessity for dumbing down the people, especially the male, because the male was their main target,
[17:09.700 --> 17:17.700]  they said that the men will never ever accept this new world order, this regimented system from birth to death.
[17:17.700 --> 17:22.700]  And that's why they project and riddle in the boys, that's why they target them for a fist fight,
[17:22.700 --> 17:27.700]  they go to jail now, instead of being allowed to do their normal male activities,
[17:27.700 --> 17:38.700]  and they'd be like arresting a baby pronghorn, a juvenile pronghorn for challenging other males out on the grassy plains of New Mexico,
[17:38.700 --> 17:43.700]  all normal human activity is made criminal, the male is destroyed.
[17:43.700 --> 17:51.700]  That is correct, and say they had targeted the IQ, there's very little testosterone working there,
[17:51.700 --> 17:59.700]  you technically are not a man anymore, you won't rebel, you won't stand up and fight, you won't even object, you're very passive,
[17:59.700 --> 18:07.700]  and again this is well understood by hered management for animals, when you basically neuter a bull,
[18:07.700 --> 18:15.700]  it becomes very, very placid, and you'll accept treatment quite easily, there's no objections, well that's happened in society.
[18:15.700 --> 18:21.700]  And then the police now take steroids to supplement the fact that they've been basically neutered,
[18:21.700 --> 18:27.700]  and so that's the only sequestered area though, where you're allowed to be male, only if you're assaulting your own people though.
[18:27.700 --> 18:34.700]  That is correct, that is absolutely correct, and of course the guys in charge of the military and the police turn a blind eye,
[18:34.700 --> 18:39.700]  they understand this, and I've seen cops too in Toronto standing outside the gold gym,
[18:39.700 --> 18:45.700]  and opening their big bags, and inside there's all the files there of the different steroids, they have bags of it,
[18:45.700 --> 18:51.700]  and they all look like the incredible Hulk, they have no neck, and with the shaven heads there,
[18:51.700 --> 18:59.700]  and they're just dying to get out there and be aggressive, now they have permission, so once again it's authorized from the top.
[18:59.700 --> 19:06.700]  Please continue. Well, what's interesting too, one of the main chemicals that is a synthetic hormone,
[19:06.700 --> 19:12.700]  the very things that Charles Galton Darwin was talking about and advocated was bisphenol A.
[19:12.700 --> 19:22.700]  Now bisphenol A was understood, it was discovered in the 1800s, and in the 1930s the chemical companies in the US
[19:22.700 --> 19:32.700]  had done extensive experimentation with it, and they found that it was an endocrine disruptor, it literally would attack male growth in the womb.
[19:32.700 --> 19:39.700]  So what did it do with this bisphenol A? They made it mandatory to use it to sterilize all babies' bottles.
[19:39.700 --> 19:44.700]  That's right, there's hundreds of types of plastic, but they find this one type of sterilizing rats and guinea pigs,
[19:44.700 --> 19:50.700]  and so they make sure there's universal adoption of that, how loving.
[19:50.700 --> 19:59.700]  And then of course they put it into the bottles themselves, and with heat it leaches very quickly from the plastic feeding bottles for babies,
[19:59.700 --> 20:03.700]  and it's in the little teats they use to the rubber teats.
[20:03.700 --> 20:08.700]  And in children it's even more devastating, Alan Watts, stay there, we're going to come back and talk more about this.
[20:08.700 --> 20:14.700]  Only one small facet of how you're under attack. Don't believe us, it's all true, all on record, they bragged how they would do it.
[20:14.700 --> 20:25.700]  Diet injections and injunctions will reduce you to the level of mutton, or sheep, but mutton on the plate.
[20:25.700 --> 20:48.700]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[20:55.700 --> 21:01.700]  That's why there's Puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[21:26.700 --> 21:33.700]  Hey GCN listeners, if you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift this year, listen up.
[21:33.700 --> 21:36.700]  This message is going to make holiday shopping very easy.
[21:36.700 --> 21:40.700]  This year, give the amazing Survival Seed Bank to friends and family.
[21:40.700 --> 21:49.700]  Here's why, the Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense life sustaining food.
[21:49.700 --> 21:58.700]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open pollinated seeds, it's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if necessary.
[21:58.700 --> 22:04.700]  And here's the best part, the price of Survival Seed Bank has been drastically reduced for GCN listeners this Christmas.
[22:04.700 --> 22:10.700]  You might even want to pick one up for yourself. The price goes back up January 1st and the supply is definitely limited.
[22:10.700 --> 22:13.700]  Think outside the box and into the bank this year.
[22:13.700 --> 22:19.700]  Give a Survival Seed Bank by going to survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com.
[22:19.700 --> 22:28.700]  Or you can call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365 to give the perfect gift.
[22:28.700 --> 22:35.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[22:35.700 --> 22:39.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[22:39.700 --> 22:40.700]  Bin Laden.
[22:40.700 --> 22:41.700]  This is his ammo.
[22:41.700 --> 22:44.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[22:44.700 --> 22:51.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[22:51.700 --> 22:58.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:58.700 --> 23:02.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[23:02.700 --> 23:09.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[23:09.700 --> 23:12.700]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[24:42.700 --> 24:44.700]  Alan Watts, our guest.
[24:44.700 --> 24:46.700]  Paul's coming up.
[24:46.700 --> 24:51.700]  Alan, of course, you've only covered one tiny area of this and they just throw it in your face
[24:51.700 --> 24:56.700]  that they knew in the studies over 100 years ago what this would do.
[24:56.700 --> 24:59.700]  They said, well, put it in the plastics.
[24:59.700 --> 25:01.700]  Put it in the liners for the 10 cans.
[25:01.700 --> 25:03.700]  Put it in everything.
[25:03.700 --> 25:09.700]  And more importantly, they said, let's put fluoride, sodium fluoride in the water.
[25:09.700 --> 25:13.700]  We have the documents on that, but then they just laugh at us.
[25:13.700 --> 25:15.700]  Please continue Alan Watts.
[25:15.700 --> 25:18.700]  Yes, what you have is a multi-pronged attack.
[25:18.700 --> 25:23.700]  When you look at your victim or your enemy in warfare, you must study the enemy.
[25:23.700 --> 25:26.700]  The enemy are the people.
[25:26.700 --> 25:27.700]  You study them.
[25:27.700 --> 25:28.700]  You find out what their habits are.
[25:28.700 --> 25:31.700]  What do all people go through in stages, et cetera.
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.700]  How do they rear their young?
[25:33.700 --> 25:34.700]  You can conceive their young.
[25:34.700 --> 25:36.700]  Where can you hit your target?
[25:36.700 --> 25:41.700]  You hit your target in the womb, preferably if you want to stop major natural changes from occurring.
[25:41.700 --> 25:44.700]  You get in there first and you cause abnormal changes.
[25:44.700 --> 25:48.700]  We've been under attack from so many areas, including the inoculations.
[25:48.700 --> 25:52.700]  Now Bertrand Russell, Lord Bertrand Russell, another member of MI5,
[25:52.700 --> 25:57.700]  who is now declassified again along with Coesler and many other big writers of their time,
[25:57.700 --> 26:00.700]  who led big international meetings.
[26:00.700 --> 26:06.700]  He said himself that they'd also use the needle to make people very placid.
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.700]  Those are his words in one of his books.
[26:08.700 --> 26:10.700]  And they have been using inoculations.
[26:10.700 --> 26:15.700]  They train the public who are taught to trust their masters
[26:15.700 --> 26:20.700]  and they've trained them that everything they pump into your body is for your own good.
[26:20.700 --> 26:23.700]  Well, it's like your dog lovingly coming over and getting your lap
[26:23.700 --> 26:26.700]  and the government just inject cyanide in.
[26:26.700 --> 26:28.700]  It's so sick.
[26:28.700 --> 26:29.700]  Please continue.
[26:29.700 --> 26:30.700]  Yes.
[26:30.700 --> 26:37.700]  And once again, these inoculations literally have targeted the immune system of people.
[26:37.700 --> 26:41.700]  There's hardly a person in the Western world with an intact immune system.
[26:41.700 --> 26:48.700]  I thought about this years ago when I looked at the fads that the medical sciences have gone through
[26:48.700 --> 26:50.700]  and they do go through these strange fads.
[26:50.700 --> 26:57.700]  And back in the 50s, at the same time as all this was mandated to go into effect with the food and so on,
[26:57.700 --> 27:02.700]  they also started tonsillectomies and removing adenoids.
[27:02.700 --> 27:06.700]  As a matter of course with all children in Europe around the age of four or five,
[27:06.700 --> 27:11.700]  it was the done thing to do and every mother brought in their child and they become their adenoids
[27:11.700 --> 27:12.700]  and their tonsils.
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.700]  That's your first line of defense.
[27:14.700 --> 27:16.700]  They are parts of your immune system.
[27:16.700 --> 27:18.700]  They create white blood cells.
[27:18.700 --> 27:22.700]  So once they're removed, you're already missing 30% of them.
[27:22.700 --> 27:28.700]  You're being set up so that ordinary little colds or flus or things which would normally fight off
[27:28.700 --> 27:30.700]  could actually kill you.
[27:30.700 --> 27:33.700]  And that was the intent of attacking the immune system.
[27:33.700 --> 27:38.700]  And they did studies in the 40s. They knew that antibiotics were going to create super bacteria.
[27:38.700 --> 27:40.700]  But please continue.
[27:40.700 --> 27:46.700]  And not only that, what really staggers in the mind too, I call this the matrix because you swallow the world
[27:46.700 --> 27:52.700]  that's been presented to you and everything in it is pretty well a false or a deception or a cover.
[27:52.700 --> 28:01.700]  Now again, the CBC in Canada did an incredible documentary a few years ago called Phaegiosites.
[28:01.700 --> 28:09.700]  Now Phaegiosites are viruses which are man made which can attack and destroy other viruses.
[28:09.700 --> 28:14.700]  Any other viruses programmed, literally programmed to destroy or a bacterium.
[28:14.700 --> 28:23.700]  And the Russians, the Soviet system were using them from 1917 onwards and all through the period up until the 90s,
[28:23.700 --> 28:25.700]  the mid 90s, the West were important.
[28:25.700 --> 28:28.700]  They knew about this of course in intelligence agencies.
[28:28.700 --> 28:30.700]  They knew about this in the military industrial complex.
[28:30.700 --> 28:33.700]  But we were told there's nothing but antibiotics.
[28:33.700 --> 28:37.700]  Meanwhile, children can go into a clinic in Russia with pneumonia.
[28:37.700 --> 28:40.700]  They get a little puffer inhalants.
[28:40.700 --> 28:42.700]  They have a couple of breaths of this.
[28:42.700 --> 28:49.700]  They go home and they're cured the following day because special viruses can be programmed like computers from 1917
[28:49.700 --> 28:52.700]  and they did not need antibiotics in Russia.
[28:52.700 --> 28:58.700]  Now a company in New York bought over all of the rights of this particular Georgian company,
[28:58.700 --> 29:02.700]  an ex-Soviet Union, and they've kept it quiet.
[29:02.700 --> 29:05.700]  They're only using it for one thing only and I don't trust them here.
[29:05.700 --> 29:08.700]  They're using it in all cold cut meats now.
[29:08.700 --> 29:15.700]  They put these Phaegiosites viruses on the cold cut meats supposedly to kill off other viruses.
[29:15.700 --> 29:19.700]  That's right, in Latin it means bacteria eater.
[29:19.700 --> 29:24.700]  And the bigger problem with the cold cuts in the meats, they're spraying with it.
[29:24.700 --> 29:29.700]  It allows them to take rotten meat covered in feces from the slaughterhouse, literally folks,
[29:29.700 --> 29:32.700]  and not clean it off or not throw it away.
[29:32.700 --> 29:37.700]  They just spray it with virus eaters, viruses that eat bacteria,
[29:37.700 --> 29:44.700]  and then you still have the bacteria dead in the toxins they secrete, their fecal matter.
[29:44.700 --> 29:49.700]  And so you then eat the toxins, also the way they're breeding these viruses in these tanks.
[29:49.700 --> 29:55.700]  There's other viruses they're mixing in when they spray it in to the larger preparation, correct Alan?
[29:55.700 --> 30:03.700]  That's right, and now we have outbreaks of listeria on cold meat suddenly that didn't happen before.
[30:03.700 --> 30:06.700]  And so their answer is, radiate.
[30:06.700 --> 30:09.700]  But you're still eating the toxin.
[30:09.700 --> 30:12.700]  What gets you really sick is the bacteria excrement.
[30:12.700 --> 30:18.700]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt and your calls.
[30:18.700 --> 30:22.700]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[30:22.700 --> 30:28.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:28.700 --> 30:31.700]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[30:31.700 --> 30:34.700]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?

[31:25.700 --> 31:28.700]  It is a big idea.
[31:28.700 --> 31:30.700]  A new world order.
[31:30.700 --> 31:35.700]  In the near future, birth is dominated by powerful government.
[31:35.700 --> 31:37.700]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:37.700 --> 31:40.700]  What's their objective, the world domination?
[31:40.700 --> 31:46.700]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:46.700 --> 31:54.700]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[31:54.700 --> 32:02.700]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[32:02.700 --> 32:06.700]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[32:06.700 --> 32:09.700]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[32:09.700 --> 32:10.700]  Most people have no idea.
[32:10.700 --> 32:11.700]  They're not after money.
[32:11.700 --> 32:12.700]  They have all the money they need.
[32:12.700 --> 32:13.700]  They're after power.

[32:27.700 --> 32:31.700]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[32:31.700 --> 32:37.700]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[32:37.700 --> 32:41.700]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[32:41.700 --> 32:44.700]  Nature's Gem, premium omega-3.
[32:44.700 --> 32:50.700]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[32:50.700 --> 32:55.700]  and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden flaxseed around.
[32:55.700 --> 33:00.700]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight,
[33:00.700 --> 33:04.700]  keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[33:04.700 --> 33:07.700]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[33:07.700 --> 33:09.700]  Nature's Gem golden flaxseed is pure.
[33:09.700 --> 33:13.700]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.
[33:13.700 --> 33:15.700]  We offer a 100% money-back guarantee.
[33:15.700 --> 33:19.700]  Order in Nature's Gem premium golden flaxseed today at goldenflax.com.
[33:19.700 --> 33:21.700]  Goldenflax.com.
[33:21.700 --> 33:24.700]  Or call 800-387-5516.
[33:24.700 --> 33:26.700]  That's 800-387-5516.
[33:26.700 --> 33:38.700]  Free shipping included.
[33:38.700 --> 33:52.700]  Alright, going back to Alan 1.
[33:52.700 --> 33:56.700]  So many things going on in the world.
[33:56.700 --> 34:02.700]  Baby Zion, mother's crying.
[34:02.700 --> 34:06.700]  How much old is one human life worth?
[34:06.700 --> 34:11.700]  Going back to Alan 1, your phone calls here in just a moment.
[34:11.700 --> 34:20.700]  But before I do that, I want to tell you about a couple sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[34:20.700 --> 34:25.700]  One great sponsor is Inner Health Botanicals.
[34:25.700 --> 34:27.700]  You know them as Inner Food.
[34:27.700 --> 34:32.700]  That's just one other great line of products.
[34:32.700 --> 34:40.700]  Inner Food, folks, is the best green food out there, bar none.
[34:40.700 --> 34:48.700]  And I hope that you will check out the web manners that we have for them up on infowars.com
[34:48.700 --> 34:53.700]  and prisonplanet.com because they have a whole line of great products.
[34:53.700 --> 34:54.700]  But they're green food.
[34:54.700 --> 34:57.700]  You're not taking other ones that have all these superfoods and ingredients.
[34:57.700 --> 34:59.700]  And they always give me headache or make me feel sped up.
[34:59.700 --> 35:03.700]  This doesn't have any of the caffeine type mimicers.
[35:03.700 --> 35:04.700]  It doesn't have it.
[35:04.700 --> 35:09.700]  It's just a whole bunch of well-known superfoods that are really good for your body.
[35:09.700 --> 35:13.700]  So again, check it out at infowars.com
[35:13.700 --> 35:19.700]  and prisonplanet.com.
[35:19.700 --> 35:22.700]  You can link through there to the Inner Food website.
[35:22.700 --> 35:26.700]  Find the banner right there on both sites.
[35:26.700 --> 35:30.700]  Also, there is Food Shortage USA.
[35:30.700 --> 35:34.700]  FoodShortageusa.com is the website.
[35:34.700 --> 35:40.700]  Phase 1 of the Insider's Plan for a One World Government has been indicated with the recent bailout.
[35:40.700 --> 35:45.700]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency
[35:45.700 --> 35:47.700]  and a new World Bank to act as saviour.
[35:47.700 --> 35:49.700]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[35:49.700 --> 35:51.700]  The insiders have discovered that they can control two things.
[35:51.700 --> 35:53.700]  This is total control and power.
[35:53.700 --> 35:56.700]  One is the world currency, which they are currently being prepared to accept.
[35:56.700 --> 35:57.700]  And the other is food.
[35:57.700 --> 36:00.700]  We are witnessing the engineered financial crisis, folks.
[36:00.700 --> 36:02.700]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[36:02.700 --> 36:07.700]  Go to FoodShortageusa.com to learn how to make your own storeable foods for you and your family.
[36:07.700 --> 36:09.700]  Prepare for the road ahead.
[36:09.700 --> 36:14.700]  This website reveals a step-by-step way for the average person to get prepared for what's ahead.
[36:14.700 --> 36:17.700]  I think the best part about this system is it gets you off the food grid,
[36:17.700 --> 36:19.700]  even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[36:19.700 --> 36:22.700]  The site is FoodShortageusa.com, one word.
[36:22.700 --> 36:26.700]  Or 877-327-0365 to learn more.
[36:26.700 --> 36:31.700]  877-327-0365.
[36:31.700 --> 36:36.700]  Alan, I said I was particularly having you on today, and we appreciate your time.
[36:36.700 --> 36:40.700]  Take calls so we can go in different directions than you or I would normally focus on.
[36:40.700 --> 36:43.700]  I'm pretty much on the same page with you and your research,
[36:43.700 --> 36:47.700]  because we just go to their own source documents with the chemical dumbing down,
[36:47.700 --> 36:50.700]  the biological attacks, what they're setting up.
[36:50.700 --> 36:54.700]  But I want to go to the calls, and we've been interrupted by a few breaks,
[36:54.700 --> 36:58.700]  and my seconding everything you're saying, but I can't help myself.
[36:58.700 --> 36:59.700]  It's also accurate.
[36:59.700 --> 37:01.700]  I want listeners to know this isn't a joke.
[37:01.700 --> 37:04.700]  This is earth-shatteringly important.
[37:04.700 --> 37:08.700]  But in encapsulating it, and then I want to go to calls,
[37:08.700 --> 37:11.700]  again, you're trying to give people the facts like you always do.
[37:11.700 --> 37:12.700]  I do the same thing.
[37:12.700 --> 37:17.700]  But going from the up close view to the wider view,
[37:17.700 --> 37:23.700]  just in a general gestalt, what their time frame is,
[37:23.700 --> 37:26.700]  what the world's going to look like, what their in-game is,
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.700]  Alan Watt from CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[37:28.700 --> 37:32.700]  Yeah, they want to manage the take down of society.
[37:32.700 --> 37:37.700]  At the same time, they want a unified world to come out of the very end
[37:37.700 --> 37:43.700]  with the survivors, with a new system, a standardized world system,
[37:43.700 --> 37:47.700]  where they can literally replace all the old types with better,
[37:47.700 --> 37:51.700]  enhanced, genetically enhanced types, that will serve the elite better.
[37:51.700 --> 37:55.700]  Now, we know that the elite themselves are not going to dumb themselves down.
[37:55.700 --> 37:59.700]  Charles Colton Darwin was very explicit about that in his writing.
[37:59.700 --> 38:04.700]  Arthur Kessler said, we, the elite, must retain our survival capabilities
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.700]  because we will be guiding planet Earth,
[38:06.700 --> 38:09.700]  but the rest of the people will not need theirs
[38:09.700 --> 38:12.700]  because the state will be making all the decisions for them.
[38:12.700 --> 38:15.700]  So that's what they want to come out of the very, very end,
[38:15.700 --> 38:19.700]  a placid, compliant, genetically enhanced, more productive species,
[38:19.700 --> 38:22.700]  but a far reduced, more efficient population.
[38:22.700 --> 38:27.700]  And when you tie that in with the Department of Defense's think tank study
[38:27.700 --> 38:30.700]  for NATO, which was echoed by the U.S. military's one,
[38:30.700 --> 38:34.700]  as far as they're identical, they see nothing but riots starting
[38:34.700 --> 38:40.700]  around 2010 to 2012 to do with food and various other things, necessities, really,
[38:40.700 --> 38:42.700]  and escalating for 30 years.
[38:42.700 --> 38:47.700]  Now, that ties in with the timelines that the United Nations has talked about
[38:47.700 --> 38:51.700]  for their new global society with the reduced population.
[38:51.700 --> 38:53.700]  They say in their own documents now
[38:53.700 --> 38:59.700]  that we have vastly reduced population by the year 2030-2035.
[38:59.700 --> 39:05.700]  So we're looking at a long-term business plan that's going to reduce population.
[39:05.700 --> 39:08.700]  During that time, they will be putting big money
[39:08.700 --> 39:13.700]  into genetic enhancing of specific people to serve them better new strains.
[39:13.700 --> 39:18.700]  And at the end, as the old man dies off, they'll bring in the new type.
[39:18.700 --> 39:21.700]  In fact, the old man will be unable to even procreate and reproduce.
[39:21.700 --> 39:23.700]  So they'll bring in the new type.
[39:23.700 --> 39:26.700]  And this will be the reason for bringing in the new type.
[39:26.700 --> 39:28.700]  Well, we've all gone sterile. We have to do it.
[39:28.700 --> 39:31.700]  And no one will complain. No one will object.
[39:31.700 --> 39:35.700]  They'll think it's just a necessity and a strange thing in nature.
[39:35.700 --> 39:38.700]  That's how, see, most people don't think on a conscious level.
[39:38.700 --> 39:42.700]  They're in a state of almost perpetual hypnosis.
[39:42.700 --> 39:47.700]  And this has been done by scientific indoctrination from birth,
[39:47.700 --> 39:51.700]  plus the masses of entertainment they take.
[39:51.700 --> 39:53.700]  And they cannot tell fact from fiction.
[39:53.700 --> 39:55.700]  They have no reasoning abilities.
[39:55.700 --> 39:57.700]  And they do expect, like Brzezinski says,
[39:57.700 --> 40:00.700]  they expect the media to do the reasoning for them.
[40:00.700 --> 40:03.700]  And unfortunately, for most folk, that has happened.
[40:03.700 --> 40:06.700]  And that's why we see all the pre-programming.
[40:06.700 --> 40:11.700]  I mean, the Pentagon back in 2000, as you know, said,
[40:11.700 --> 40:14.700]  we'll use Hollywood. We'll use movies. We'll use security.
[40:14.700 --> 40:17.700]  We'll use the call for Alzheimer's patients.
[40:17.700 --> 40:21.700]  We will use the FAD-driven PR peer pressure system,
[40:21.700 --> 40:27.700]  public relations system, to sell the public on taking microchips.
[40:27.700 --> 40:30.700]  And they talk in all these government white papers and documents.
[40:30.700 --> 40:32.700]  I covered one on Sunday.
[40:32.700 --> 40:33.700]  I think I'm going to play that clip later.
[40:33.700 --> 40:36.700]  Dr. Kaufman talking about it from the document about how
[40:36.700 --> 40:38.700]  most people don't even have their own thoughts.
[40:38.700 --> 40:41.700]  How we're pathetic slaves.
[40:41.700 --> 40:44.700]  I mean, they're really doing this to you.
[40:44.700 --> 40:48.700]  And I just feel so sorry for the yuppies and people who are so arrogant
[40:48.700 --> 40:50.700]  and so into themselves being powerful.
[40:50.700 --> 40:52.700]  They've been trained to laugh at us.
[40:52.700 --> 40:55.700]  And then they wonder why their son, you know, is sterile,
[40:55.700 --> 40:59.700]  or why they are sterile, or why they're so unhappy,
[40:59.700 --> 41:02.700]  or why their wife has breast cancer at 40.
[41:02.700 --> 41:03.700]  And it's all engineered.
[41:03.700 --> 41:07.700]  And they just sit there dying, still loving the lie.
[41:07.700 --> 41:11.700]  And they do, they do, they truly, the trick was,
[41:11.700 --> 41:14.700]  and it's been written about too, is to make a generation believe
[41:14.700 --> 41:17.700]  that they were on the cutting edge,
[41:17.700 --> 41:20.700]  that no other society's ever had foreign history,
[41:20.700 --> 41:23.700]  and that all information is out there, and it's all true.
[41:23.700 --> 41:26.700]  And therefore, in other words, there's nothing you can tell them.
[41:26.700 --> 41:29.700]  They truly believe everything that they've been told.
[41:29.700 --> 41:33.700]  An arrogance, a haughtiness, a self-false satisfaction
[41:33.700 --> 41:35.700]  is that they're members of the elite.
[41:35.700 --> 41:37.700]  And here's a microcosm.
[41:37.700 --> 41:39.700]  There have been tens of thousands of urban warfare drills
[41:39.700 --> 41:41.700]  the last 25 years.
[41:41.700 --> 41:43.700]  I mean, they have thousands a year.
[41:43.700 --> 41:45.700]  So, I mean, it's got to be tens of thousands,
[41:45.700 --> 41:47.700]  more than tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands.
[41:47.700 --> 41:50.700]  And they always tell the town or city,
[41:50.700 --> 41:53.700]  even though they may have been there 15 times over the years,
[41:53.700 --> 41:55.700]  you are the first city to have this drill.
[41:55.700 --> 41:56.700]  You are special.
[41:56.700 --> 41:59.700]  You are the first city to have us tax you to drive your car
[41:59.700 --> 42:00.700]  with transponders.
[42:00.700 --> 42:01.700]  You are the first.
[42:01.700 --> 42:03.700]  And I always see that and go,
[42:03.700 --> 42:05.700]  I'm not the first, but again, it's part of that.
[42:05.700 --> 42:07.700]  Oh, my God, I'm part of the first.
[42:07.700 --> 42:08.700]  I'm cutting edge.
[42:08.700 --> 42:09.700]  I'm a trailblazer.
[42:09.700 --> 42:10.700]  Go ahead, please.
[42:10.700 --> 42:11.700]  Exactly.
[42:11.700 --> 42:13.700]  That is how it's done.
[42:13.700 --> 42:15.700]  And they truly believe that the most advanced species
[42:15.700 --> 42:17.700]  has ever existed.
[42:17.700 --> 42:21.700]  That's exactly what Bertrand Russell and others said in the 50s.
[42:21.700 --> 42:24.700]  They said, we shall create an egocentonic society,
[42:24.700 --> 42:27.700]  a hedonistic society where they'll live for themselves
[42:27.700 --> 42:29.700]  and think they know it all,
[42:29.700 --> 42:32.700]  and they will be with the willing fools for our strategy.
[42:32.700 --> 42:33.700]  That's happened.
[42:33.700 --> 42:34.700]  That's happened.
[42:34.700 --> 42:36.700]  And you can take them to the documents,
[42:36.700 --> 42:38.700]  the published works, government policy,
[42:38.700 --> 42:41.700]  and they will just laugh at you.
[42:41.700 --> 42:44.700]  They'll get this pre-programmed little smile and go,
[42:44.700 --> 42:47.700]  hey, here, man, I tell you.
[42:47.700 --> 42:50.700]  And now they're openly announcing world government, Alan.
[42:50.700 --> 42:52.700]  They're now openly announcing the banks are going to run it all,
[42:52.700 --> 42:55.700]  carbon taxes, and still people email me
[42:55.700 --> 42:59.700]  and post on infowars.com and prisonbonnet.com in the comments.
[42:59.700 --> 43:02.700]  They say, oh, they're announcing world government,
[43:02.700 --> 43:04.700]  but that's different than the one you're talking about.
[43:04.700 --> 43:06.700]  Governance isn't government.
[43:06.700 --> 43:10.700]  It says Lord Rothschild called last week for governance.
[43:10.700 --> 43:12.700]  Well, governance is, in the definitions,
[43:12.700 --> 43:14.700]  government, the system of government,
[43:14.700 --> 43:16.700]  so global system of government.
[43:16.700 --> 43:20.700]  And then they say, OK, they're calling.
[43:20.700 --> 43:22.700]  They truly believe this.
[43:22.700 --> 43:24.700]  I've had them tell me that, too.
[43:24.700 --> 43:26.700]  And I stated on that, well, don't forget,
[43:26.700 --> 43:28.700]  they're going to be central computers to program that chip,
[43:28.700 --> 43:30.700]  which means you're not going to be in control
[43:30.700 --> 43:32.700]  of your own mind anymore.
[43:32.700 --> 43:34.700]  And they're just laughing.
[43:34.700 --> 43:37.700]  Yeah?
[43:37.700 --> 43:38.700]  Yeah.
[43:38.700 --> 43:40.700]  So they're a lost cause.
[43:40.700 --> 43:42.700]  And I realized this is a war,
[43:42.700 --> 43:45.700]  and the vast amount of people are the casualties.
[43:45.700 --> 43:47.700]  That's just the plain fact.
[43:47.700 --> 43:52.700]  But in a war, you've got to see the war that's still going on
[43:52.700 --> 43:54.700]  and accept those who have fallen, have fallen,
[43:54.700 --> 43:57.700]  and you go for those who are still standing.
[43:57.700 --> 44:01.700]  That's the ones who try to help.
[44:01.700 --> 44:03.700]  Well, the good news is there are more people than ever
[44:03.700 --> 44:06.700]  that do want to hear, that do want to know.
[44:06.700 --> 44:09.700]  And it's so three-dimensional and even four-dimensional
[44:09.700 --> 44:11.700]  how it's all interlocked.
[44:11.700 --> 44:14.700]  And after decades of study, you can get a map of it
[44:14.700 --> 44:15.700]  in your own mind.
[44:15.700 --> 44:16.700]  You can articulate it.
[44:16.700 --> 44:21.700]  But still, it's so hard to articulate the subtleties to people.
[44:21.700 --> 44:23.700]  The globalists in their own documents articulate it
[44:23.700 --> 44:25.700]  and try to articulate it.
[44:25.700 --> 44:28.700]  And because the public can't see it as one-dimensional
[44:28.700 --> 44:31.700]  or two-dimensional, they'll just throw it out of hand saying,
[44:31.700 --> 44:33.700]  that's too complicated for anyone to run
[44:33.700 --> 44:37.700]  when it is being run and they say they're running it.
[44:37.700 --> 44:40.700]  They say, and that's the key to the term they're using
[44:40.700 --> 44:41.700]  of governance.
[44:41.700 --> 44:44.700]  You see, the new system that's already here,
[44:44.700 --> 44:46.700]  it's been here for a long time,
[44:46.700 --> 44:49.700]  is a system that, to the public,
[44:49.700 --> 44:51.700]  appears to be something called democracy.
[44:51.700 --> 44:55.700]  In reality, you have a power or government run by foundations
[44:55.700 --> 45:00.700]  which, in turn, are a front for the ancient establishment,
[45:00.700 --> 45:02.700]  the very wealthy rich establishment.
[45:02.700 --> 45:05.700]  They fund the non-governmental organizations that appear
[45:05.700 --> 45:08.700]  to speak on behalf of the public,
[45:08.700 --> 45:10.700]  and in reality, they're speaking on behalf
[45:10.700 --> 45:12.700]  of the very foundations that fund them.
[45:12.700 --> 45:15.700]  That's the new type of governance they're talking about.
[45:15.700 --> 45:17.700]  It is the Soviet system.
[45:17.700 --> 45:21.700]  The Soviet means ruled by councils,
[45:21.700 --> 45:25.700]  and in the Soviet Union, they had NGO groups
[45:25.700 --> 45:28.700]  with their leaders appointed from the Politburo.
[45:28.700 --> 45:30.700]  We have the exact same system here
[45:30.700 --> 45:32.700]  as they merged the two systems together.
[45:32.700 --> 45:36.700]  That came out from the Ford Foundation
[45:36.700 --> 45:38.700]  during the Rease Commission,
[45:38.700 --> 45:40.700]  and with Norman Dodds, the senator,
[45:40.700 --> 45:43.700]  they said that they were blending the Soviet system
[45:43.700 --> 45:45.700]  seamlessly with that of the West.
[45:45.700 --> 45:50.700]  The Club of Rome said they favored the collective system
[45:50.700 --> 45:52.700]  more than any other system
[45:52.700 --> 45:54.700]  because it's easier to control the people.
[45:54.700 --> 45:57.700]  It is here, and they're using the Soviet-style system
[45:57.700 --> 45:59.700]  with the NGOs, and governance literally means
[45:59.700 --> 46:03.700]  that those groups with the power and the voice
[46:03.700 --> 46:06.700]  who get the voice, and the media is too happy to listen to them,
[46:06.700 --> 46:08.700]  they are the new type of government.
[46:08.700 --> 46:11.700]  This is the new Soviet that has been brought in.
[46:11.700 --> 46:13.700]  If you don't belong to a big group,
[46:13.700 --> 46:15.700]  you have no voice whatsoever,
[46:15.700 --> 46:18.700]  and they call them stakeholders.
[46:18.700 --> 46:20.700]  The individual has no voice,
[46:20.700 --> 46:23.700]  but all these subgroups who then have heads
[46:23.700 --> 46:25.700]  who are globalists, who speak for them
[46:25.700 --> 46:27.700]  and really control them,
[46:27.700 --> 46:29.700]  they are stakeholders,
[46:29.700 --> 46:31.700]  and we see all this nomenclature
[46:31.700 --> 46:34.700]  now coming in and replacing everything.
[46:36.700 --> 46:38.700]  Alan, I want to go to calls here,
[46:38.700 --> 46:40.700]  but just in closing before we do that,
[46:40.700 --> 46:44.700]  the plan, the official UN documents, as you know,
[46:44.700 --> 46:48.700]  and government documents say they want to reduce this by 80%.
[46:48.700 --> 46:50.700]  And everything we've seen up till now
[46:50.700 --> 46:52.700]  is just testing the soft kill weapons,
[46:52.700 --> 46:54.700]  testing how to sell the public,
[46:54.700 --> 46:56.700]  how to not have the public notice
[46:56.700 --> 46:58.700]  that people are dying all around them,
[46:58.700 --> 47:01.700]  how to try to cook the numbers and spend things.
[47:01.700 --> 47:03.700]  But we know there's been hot kill going on in Iraq,
[47:03.700 --> 47:05.700]  hot kill in Serbia, Afghanistan,
[47:05.700 --> 47:07.700]  Africa, Latin America,
[47:07.700 --> 47:10.700]  where large portions of populations are being killed,
[47:10.700 --> 47:12.700]  10%, 20%, 30%, 40% in some cases.
[47:12.700 --> 47:16.700]  The hot killing, the fast killing in the West,
[47:16.700 --> 47:20.700]  when are they going to start launching those?
[47:20.700 --> 47:23.700]  I think fairly shortly they have big plans
[47:23.700 --> 47:26.700]  to standardize the world quickly.
[47:26.700 --> 47:28.700]  What they're doing, and that's exactly what they're doing,
[47:28.700 --> 47:31.700]  they're eradicating all older cultures
[47:31.700 --> 47:34.700]  that haven't gone along and accepted this
[47:34.700 --> 47:37.700]  very vague term of democracy.
[47:37.700 --> 47:40.700]  They haven't accepted World Bank running their system.
[47:40.700 --> 47:42.700]  They haven't accepted the, basically,
[47:42.700 --> 47:45.700]  the British-style parliamentary system,
[47:45.700 --> 47:49.700]  because this whole world system was born in London, England.
[47:49.700 --> 47:51.700]  It's from the 1500s.
[47:51.700 --> 47:54.700]  John Dee wrote about the creation of a world empire
[47:54.700 --> 47:56.700]  based on the British system.
[47:56.700 --> 48:00.700]  And it's now come out that the Crown, MI5 and MI6
[48:00.700 --> 48:02.700]  run the whole parliament, spy on it.
[48:02.700 --> 48:05.700]  They kill any member or set them up against that line.
[48:05.700 --> 48:08.700]  It is totally ceremonial, just like the Congress.
[48:08.700 --> 48:11.700]  Yes, and after World War II,
[48:11.700 --> 48:14.700]  there were big talks with the United Nations
[48:14.700 --> 48:17.700]  that once they set it up that those colonial countries
[48:17.700 --> 48:19.700]  would not be pulled out of by Britain
[48:19.700 --> 48:22.700]  until they had set up in those countries
[48:22.700 --> 48:25.700]  a mini British-type system of government,
[48:25.700 --> 48:28.700]  and then they could pull out and withdraw.
[48:28.700 --> 48:31.700]  And they wrote hundreds of books from Quigley's to others
[48:31.700 --> 48:34.700]  bragging about the system, but you go to Wikipedia,
[48:34.700 --> 48:36.700]  or to the mainline encyclopedia Britannica,
[48:36.700 --> 48:38.700]  and they say the neural border doesn't exist.
[48:38.700 --> 48:41.700]  Doesn't matter if it's taught at Princeton and Harvard and Oxford,
[48:41.700 --> 48:44.700]  and they admit the system of world governance
[48:44.700 --> 48:46.700]  through the shadow roundtables,
[48:46.700 --> 48:49.700]  they will just still laugh at us and say it doesn't exist.
[48:49.700 --> 48:52.700]  That's right, even though the historian
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.700]  for the Council on Foreign Relations,
[48:54.700 --> 48:56.700]  which is part of the parallel government,
[48:56.700 --> 49:00.700]  Carl Quigley himself, wrote this big book on it,
[49:00.700 --> 49:03.700]  Angle American Establishment and Tragedy and Hope,
[49:03.700 --> 49:06.700]  and he outlines them near their whole agenda.
[49:06.700 --> 49:08.700]  It was quite fascinating.
[49:08.700 --> 49:11.700]  Yeah, that's a great book. I read that back when I was about 15,
[49:11.700 --> 49:14.700]  and I had no idea what I was reading was the keys to how it all worked,
[49:14.700 --> 49:16.700]  and this is the government commissioning.
[49:16.700 --> 49:18.700]  The people in government really have to know how it works.
[49:18.700 --> 49:20.700]  These are the slaves. We're poisoning them.
[49:20.700 --> 49:23.700]  We're going to hear rid of them. Okay, and if you work with us,
[49:23.700 --> 49:26.700]  you'll be allowed to procreate, and we won't kill you. How's that sound?
[49:26.700 --> 49:29.700]  Another odd thing, too, was back in the 90s.
[49:29.700 --> 49:32.700]  I don't know if it's the same in the US,
[49:32.700 --> 49:35.700]  but politicians in Canada and the British Commonwealth countries
[49:35.700 --> 49:40.700]  made a law to treat the politicians and their families
[49:40.700 --> 49:43.700]  in special military hospitals,
[49:43.700 --> 49:46.700]  and I thought at the time, what's all this about?
[49:46.700 --> 49:49.700]  Aren't the hospitals that we have good enough for them?
[49:49.700 --> 49:51.700]  And I realized, too, what it is,
[49:51.700 --> 49:54.700]  is all these coming plagues that are scheduled to come out,
[49:54.700 --> 49:57.700]  they do have treatments for them.
[49:57.700 --> 49:59.700]  They do have the real antidotes to them,
[49:59.700 --> 50:02.700]  and I think they've been giving the politicians and the families
[50:02.700 --> 50:05.700]  these particular antidotes, and so in other words...
[50:05.700 --> 50:07.700]  Well, that's actually already come out.
[50:07.700 --> 50:10.700]  They get all the cancer cures, they get it all,
[50:10.700 --> 50:13.700]  and this is so diabolical.
[50:13.700 --> 50:16.700]  And that's why they go along with these politicians,
[50:16.700 --> 50:18.700]  and they will keep their mouth shut, they will play the game,
[50:18.700 --> 50:20.700]  because they're getting all these benefits,
[50:20.700 --> 50:25.700]  and a fairly good guarantee they will live.
[50:25.700 --> 50:29.700]  Ultra vicious, ultra wicked, ultra selfish,
[50:29.700 --> 50:32.700]  and a lot of you listening will continue to laugh,
[50:32.700 --> 50:36.700]  but God forbid, as you're burying your children and your wife,
[50:36.700 --> 50:40.700]  your husband, from what your masters are going to do to you,
[50:40.700 --> 50:42.700]  maybe then you'll fight back.
[50:42.700 --> 50:45.700]  Then you'll be facing the drone aircraft and the Swords
[50:45.700 --> 50:48.700]  and the brainwashed chip troops,
[50:48.700 --> 50:51.700]  but we can still get into their deep underground bases,
[50:51.700 --> 50:54.700]  even after this happens and probably beat them.
[50:54.700 --> 50:56.700]  But we'll see.
[50:58.700 --> 51:01.700]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off,
[51:01.700 --> 51:04.700]  Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans

[51:10.700 --> 51:13.700]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.

[51:52.700 --> 51:56.700]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[51:57.700 --> 52:00.700]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[52:00.700 --> 52:04.700]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:04.700 --> 52:06.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[52:06.700 --> 52:08.700]  But who is the enemy?
[52:08.700 --> 52:09.700]  Bin Laden.
[52:09.700 --> 52:10.700]  This is his MO.
[52:10.700 --> 52:11.700]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:11.700 --> 52:13.700]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[52:13.700 --> 52:16.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[52:16.700 --> 52:20.700]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:20.700 --> 52:23.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[52:23.700 --> 52:27.700]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:27.700 --> 52:31.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:31.700 --> 52:33.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[52:33.700 --> 52:35.700]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[52:35.700 --> 52:36.700]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:36.700 --> 52:38.700]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:38.700 --> 52:39.700]  warnings in war games,
[52:39.700 --> 52:40.700]  the shadow government,
[52:40.700 --> 52:41.700]  and much, much more.

[52:57.700 --> 53:00.700]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[53:00.700 --> 53:02.700]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly,
[53:02.700 --> 53:06.700]  but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[53:06.700 --> 53:10.700]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded,
[53:10.700 --> 53:15.700]  locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in Taser technology.
[53:15.700 --> 53:17.700]  If this sounds scary,
[53:17.700 --> 53:21.700]  imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend,
[53:21.700 --> 53:23.700]  loved one, or even yourself.

[54:09.700 --> 54:13.700]  You can run on for a long time.
[54:13.700 --> 54:15.700]  We're going to Don in Costa Rica.
[54:15.700 --> 54:20.700]  Jimmy, Dustin, Donna, Ringo, Dustin, Jeremy, and others.
[54:20.700 --> 54:21.700]  I've done a lot of hit pieces.
[54:21.700 --> 54:25.700]  I've gone on a lot of national TV shows where they tape you for days
[54:25.700 --> 54:28.700]  or hours and then cut up what you said.
[54:28.700 --> 54:30.700]  They never let you put out your real evidence
[54:30.700 --> 54:35.700]  of 9-11-minute inside job or the New World Order.
[54:35.700 --> 54:38.700]  The key is the mainstream media has lost all their credibility.
[54:38.700 --> 54:41.700]  They've been caught putting out their disinfo forever.
[54:41.700 --> 54:45.700]  I said I'd do this first history channel thing and others,
[54:45.700 --> 54:47.700]  and I did them.
[54:47.700 --> 54:52.700]  It's a stacked deck, but this newest one, Alan,
[54:52.700 --> 54:57.700]  was a guy that specializes in hit pieces on JFK researchers
[54:57.700 --> 55:02.700]  and others and really puts out ridiculous pieces
[55:02.700 --> 55:05.700]  where it's not even based on reality.
[55:05.700 --> 55:08.700]  The very foundations of it aren't.
[55:08.700 --> 55:12.700]  He's doing a big piece for National Geographic.
[55:12.700 --> 55:14.700]  I said I don't think I'm going to do that interview.
[55:14.700 --> 55:15.700]  No, I'm not going to be interviewed by it.
[55:15.700 --> 55:18.700]  They just can't believe that I don't care about going
[55:18.700 --> 55:21.700]  on their national TV show so that I can have them
[55:21.700 --> 55:27.700]  stack the deck and do that.
[55:27.700 --> 55:33.700]  I mean, again, the culture is so sick wanting to be on TV.
[55:33.700 --> 55:34.700]  Alan?
[55:34.700 --> 55:35.700]  It's true.
[55:35.700 --> 55:39.700]  It's interesting as well to recognize that Professor Cowell
[55:39.700 --> 55:42.700]  quickly himself mentioned that that was a technique
[55:42.700 --> 55:45.700]  that he used in mainstream media because they often called
[55:45.700 --> 55:48.700]  on him to bring on with a guest who was coming out
[55:48.700 --> 55:52.700]  with a theory of the world being manipulated and it bring him
[55:52.700 --> 55:55.700]  on to try and repudiate the guest.
[55:55.700 --> 55:57.700]  So that was part of his function and he admits that
[55:57.700 --> 56:00.700]  in his own book that they try and stack the deck
[56:00.700 --> 56:02.700]  and make the person look ridiculous.
[56:02.700 --> 56:05.700]  Yeah, to go on TV, here he is, government historian
[56:05.700 --> 56:07.700]  who's writing a book for the government,
[56:07.700 --> 56:10.700]  laughing at how he would go a lot of the American people
[56:10.700 --> 56:11.700]  and say this didn't exist.
[56:11.700 --> 56:13.700]  I mean, how do they get these guys to do this
[56:13.700 --> 56:15.700]  against their fellow man?
[56:15.700 --> 56:19.700]  Now, many people out there are so easily bribed,
[56:19.700 --> 56:24.700]  ego status, self-benefit.
[56:24.700 --> 56:26.700]  I've been asked by the leaders themselves,
[56:26.700 --> 56:28.700]  you know, why don't you simply join us?
[56:28.700 --> 56:31.700]  You know, you have the skills to tell me IQ and so on.
[56:31.700 --> 56:34.700]  And they cannot understand that you have something
[56:34.700 --> 56:36.700]  which we call integrity.
[56:36.700 --> 56:38.700]  They can't understand that at all.
[56:38.700 --> 56:41.700]  It's a foreign, they actually go into a stunned look
[56:41.700 --> 56:42.700]  when you say it.
[56:42.700 --> 56:46.700]  Well, I mean, they killed 3,000, 3 million Iraqis
[56:46.700 --> 56:48.700]  in the last 18 years.
[56:48.700 --> 56:49.700]  I mean, I don't want to be part of that.
[56:49.700 --> 56:51.700]  I mean, killing little kids.
[56:51.700 --> 56:53.700]  Yes, and to them, that's nothing.
[56:53.700 --> 56:54.700]  That's nothing at all.
[56:54.700 --> 56:55.700]  They sleep well.
[56:55.700 --> 56:56.700]  They plan this kind of thing.
[56:56.700 --> 56:58.700]  They don't need sleeping pills.
[56:58.700 --> 57:02.700]  They are psychopathic types and we really cannot relate to them.
[57:02.700 --> 57:05.700]  They're so far removed as a species in psychopathy
[57:05.700 --> 57:10.700]  and so inbred that it's guaranteed to pass on to their offspring.
[57:10.700 --> 57:13.700]  All right, let's talk about that term later.
[57:13.700 --> 57:16.700]  But right now, let's go to Don in Costa Rica
[57:16.700 --> 57:17.700]  and then we'll hold him over.
[57:17.700 --> 57:23.700]  Don, thanks for holding her on the air without water.
[57:23.700 --> 57:27.700]  Phone in Costa Rica, a first-time caller, former Californian.
[57:27.700 --> 57:28.700]  Can you hear me okay?
[57:28.700 --> 57:29.700]  Yes, sir.
[57:29.700 --> 57:30.700]  Okay.
[57:30.700 --> 57:33.700]  I just wanted to talk a little bit about global warming
[57:33.700 --> 57:39.700]  and supposedly it's caused CO2,
[57:39.700 --> 57:43.700]  which a lot of people call greenhouse gas,
[57:43.700 --> 57:46.700]  but if you want to find some information on it,
[57:46.700 --> 57:52.700]  you could better find it by looking up industrial gases on the internet
[57:52.700 --> 57:57.700]  and you'll find all the uses that industry uses CO2 for.
[57:57.700 --> 58:02.700]  So my plan to stop all talk of global warming
[58:02.700 --> 58:07.700]  would be simply just to outlaw the sale of CO2.
[58:07.700 --> 58:12.700]  And when you do that, the first people to raise a stink about it
[58:12.700 --> 58:18.700]  would be the soft drink industry and also maybe their consumers.
[58:18.700 --> 58:19.700]  Yeah, well, they're not going to do that.
[58:19.700 --> 58:20.700]  They're going to tax it.
[58:20.700 --> 58:24.700]  They know it's based on all manufacturing life on this planet.
[58:24.700 --> 58:29.700]  You know, a key, it's sunlight, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide,
[58:29.700 --> 58:30.700]  makes the world go around.
[58:30.700 --> 58:31.700]  Stay there.
[58:31.700 --> 58:32.700]  We'll get down and watch.
[58:32.700 --> 58:33.700]  Take on this when we get back.
[58:33.700 --> 58:36.700]  Yeah, the global feudalism tax.
[58:36.700 --> 58:40.700]  Stay with us.
[58:40.700 --> 58:43.700]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:43.700 --> 58:49.700]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.700 --> 58:51.700]  May I have everyone's attention, please?
[58:51.700 --> 58:54.700]  I've come with a message of information.
[58:54.700 --> 58:56.700]  9-11 was an inside job.
[58:56.700 --> 58:57.700]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:57.700 --> 58:59.700]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[58:59.700 --> 59:02.700]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[59:02.700 --> 59:04.700]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[59:04.700 --> 59:08.700]  that's all that we're commissioning to see for.
[59:08.700 --> 59:10.700]  The day that we stop asking questions
[59:10.700 --> 59:13.700]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[59:13.700 --> 59:15.700]  to grow at our own door.
[59:15.700 --> 59:18.700]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[59:18.700 --> 59:21.700]  a global awakening has taken place.
[59:21.700 --> 59:23.700]  An inside job.
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.700]  How dare you?
[59:25.700 --> 59:27.700]  I don't think that's the subject, sir.
[59:27.700 --> 59:28.700]  9-11.
[59:28.700 --> 59:29.700]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[59:29.700 --> 59:31.700]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:31.700 --> 59:34.700]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[59:34.700 --> 59:36.700]  And if the government has not told the truth
[59:36.700 --> 59:40.700]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[59:40.700 --> 59:41.700]  Please rise.
[59:41.700 --> 59:43.700]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[59:43.700 --> 59:45.700]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:45.700 --> 59:48.700]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:51.700 --> 59:53.700]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:53.700 --> 1:00:03.700]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:05.700]  All right, Don.
[1:00:05.700 --> 1:00:10.700]  Yes, CO2 is just used at almost every type of manufacturing,
[1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:14.700]  imaginable, soft drinks.
[1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:17.700]  The oceans are free.
[1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:20.700]  The ocean is free.
[1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:23.700]  The ocean is free.
[1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:26.700]  The ocean is free.
[1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:28.700]  The ocean is free.
[1:00:28.700 --> 1:00:31.700]  The ocean is free.
[1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:34.700]  The oceans are filled with it.
[1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:36.700]  The atmospheres of the plants breathe.
[1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:39.700]  But it's the perfect thing to restrict.
[1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:41.700]  It's what humans exhale.
[1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:43.700]  And as the club of rums said,
[1:00:43.700 --> 1:00:45.700]  Richard in Haas has a CFR writing for them.
[1:00:45.700 --> 1:00:48.700]  He said it's about making humans the enemy
[1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:52.700]  and the state is the solution to deal with the enemy.
[1:00:52.700 --> 1:00:54.700]  So it's about making us bad.
[1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:56.700]  Alan, what?
[1:00:56.700 --> 1:00:59.700]  Yes, that's in the book, The First Global Revolution.
[1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:02.700]  And that's put out by the club of rums.
[1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:04.700]  And they said that back in the 70s,
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:06.700]  they were looking at a way to unite the planet
[1:01:06.700 --> 1:01:08.700]  and allow the public to be dominated,
[1:01:08.700 --> 1:01:10.700]  to allow themselves to be dominated.
[1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:12.700]  And they said that they hit upon the idea
[1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:15.700]  of making man the enemy to an environment.
[1:01:15.700 --> 1:01:18.700]  And they said that global warming was caused by man.
[1:01:18.700 --> 1:01:20.700]  They said that would fit the bill.
[1:01:20.700 --> 1:01:21.700]  That excuse would fit the bill.
[1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:22.700]  Yeah, that's a quote.
[1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:23.700]  Now, this is published publicly.
[1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:25.700]  Now, think about this.
[1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.700]  Listeners, openly saying it's fake
[1:01:27.700 --> 1:01:30.700]  and openly saying they want a global state
[1:01:30.700 --> 1:01:34.700]  waging war against the individual and exterminating us.
[1:01:34.700 --> 1:01:36.700]  These are not nice people.
[1:01:36.700 --> 1:01:38.700]  Alan, any comments on that, Don?
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:43.700]  And what we know too is that the club of rums
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:46.700]  is not just a think tank, it's a premier think tank
[1:01:46.700 --> 1:01:48.700]  that creates strategy for the future
[1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:51.700]  and hands it to governments to put into policy.
[1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:53.700]  Meanwhile, you have all these well-meaning liberals
[1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:56.700]  and mainline people and having global warming parties
[1:01:56.700 --> 1:01:59.700]  and getting involved in knifing tires of SUVs.
[1:01:59.700 --> 1:02:02.700]  I'm proving, oh, I'm so loving.
[1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:06.700]  And then now Obama openly has announced these youth brigades,
[1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.700]  three million men, environmental squads,
[1:02:08.700 --> 1:02:10.700]  one million men, domestic spy force.
[1:02:10.700 --> 1:02:12.700]  He says it on TV.
[1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:14.700]  His chief of staff says it.
[1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:15.700]  All of them do it.
[1:02:15.700 --> 1:02:17.700]  He puts it on his website and pulls it off.
[1:02:17.700 --> 1:02:19.700]  And I'm getting hundreds of emails every day, Alan,
[1:02:19.700 --> 1:02:21.700]  saying I'm a liar.
[1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:24.700]  I mean, they openly, and then I was watching PBS Sunday,
[1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:26.700]  a show called Fueled.
[1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.700]  And they had a round table on PBS
[1:02:29.700 --> 1:02:31.700]  with Robert Kennedy and others saying,
[1:02:31.700 --> 1:02:33.700]  we're going to take everybody out of work
[1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:35.700]  and have them work for the environment,
[1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:36.700]  fighting for the environment.
[1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:39.700]  Can you imagine all these dumb-down fluoride heads
[1:02:39.700 --> 1:02:42.700]  sterilized, running around, literal zombie creatures
[1:02:42.700 --> 1:02:46.700]  coming after us that know what's going on?
[1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:49.700]  Does the government give them a little uniform?
[1:02:49.700 --> 1:02:50.700]  That is right.
[1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.700]  And what the club of rums also said about that agenda
[1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:56.700]  was that the only time that the public will allow themselves
[1:02:56.700 --> 1:03:00.700]  to be completely ruled, 100%, is during a war scenario.
[1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:03.700]  And therefore, they'd have to make a war scenario
[1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:06.700]  to do with an environment and man against the planet.
[1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:09.700]  And then they would change all of society by the laws.
[1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:11.700]  They would then introduce.
[1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:13.700]  So it's a war scenario.
[1:03:13.700 --> 1:03:15.700]  They're using all the techniques right now.
[1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:16.700]  So you're quite right.
[1:03:16.700 --> 1:03:18.700]  A land army was spoken about, the First Earth Army
[1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:20.700]  at NATO of all places.
[1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:23.700]  And actually, NASA came out with it.
[1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:25.700]  And they now have it, yeah.
[1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:27.700]  And they mentioned, let's get more into that after the calls,
[1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.700]  but they also mentioned the other part of the pincer.
[1:03:29.700 --> 1:03:34.700]  It says, fake environmentalism, carbon tax, terrorism,
[1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:36.700]  threat of stage terror.
[1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:40.700]  And then like a beetle grabbing a wasp, he's got you.
[1:03:40.700 --> 1:03:44.700]  Pincer attack, fake terror, fake environment.
[1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:45.700]  Got you.
[1:03:45.700 --> 1:03:47.700]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:49.700]  That's due to a lot of your plexi-analogy.
[1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:53.700]  Your alternation of children at kindergarten now is terrifying
[1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:58.700]  because they're going to grow up to be real staunch environmentalists.
[1:03:58.700 --> 1:04:01.700]  And you can see it all coming, what's been planned.
[1:04:01.700 --> 1:04:04.700]  They always go for the youngsters to train them for their role
[1:04:04.700 --> 1:04:05.700]  when they're adults.
[1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:07.700]  Well, you saw these articles in the New York Times and others
[1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:10.700]  where, I'm glad my three-year-old and five-year-old
[1:04:10.700 --> 1:04:12.700]  rebuke me for taking a hot bath.
[1:04:12.700 --> 1:04:13.700]  I won't anymore.
[1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:15.700]  I'm glad my children are my bosses.
[1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:18.700]  So reversing roles with mindless five-year-old Nazis
[1:04:18.700 --> 1:04:20.700]  in red and black uniforms, climate cops,
[1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:22.700]  we're not making it up, just storming around,
[1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.700]  deporting everyone.
[1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:26.700]  Oh, it's so good.
[1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:28.700]  I mean, how did you make this up, Alan?
[1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.700]  It's too insane.
[1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:33.700]  Yeah, and George Orwell had that in his book.
[1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.700]  Can you see it in the movie to the British version
[1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:38.700]  with Richard Burton, excellent movie in 1984?
[1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:39.700]  The Spies.
[1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:41.700]  The children have little uniforms on.
[1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:44.700]  They call the adults thought criminals are going to report them.
[1:04:44.700 --> 1:04:45.700]  This is all here.
[1:04:45.700 --> 1:04:49.700]  And the uniform is red and black, just as it is now in England and the US.
[1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:52.700]  Red and black uniforms, kids running around.
[1:04:52.700 --> 1:04:54.700]  By 15, they give them machine guns.
[1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:56.700]  We're going to skip this break for Internet listeners.
[1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:58.700]  I'm going to let Don finish up in Costa Rica.
[1:04:58.700 --> 1:04:59.700]  Here we go.
[1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:02.700]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[1:05:02.700 --> 1:05:05.700]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates
[1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:07.700]  that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:09.700]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[1:05:09.700 --> 1:05:11.700]  We are under the microscope.
[1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:13.700]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money,
[1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:16.700]  not for your safety, but you don't have to be defenseless
[1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:18.700]  against these unconstitutional devices.
[1:05:18.700 --> 1:05:21.700]  Have a fighting chance with sprayyourplate.com's photo blocker.
[1:05:21.700 --> 1:05:24.700]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself
[1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:27.700]  to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.
[1:05:27.700 --> 1:05:30.700]  Invisible to the naked eye, your license plate when flashed
[1:05:30.700 --> 1:05:33.700]  will be overexposed and unreadable to the cameras.
[1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:34.700]  Save your money.
[1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:36.700]  Go to sprayyourplate.com.

[1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:40.700]  showing the photo blocker in action,
[1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:43.700]  proving that the sprayyourplate's photo blocker works against traffic cameras.
[1:05:43.700 --> 1:05:45.700]  Go to sprayyourplate.com
[1:05:45.700 --> 1:05:49.700]  or call 1-800-276-9601.
[1:05:49.700 --> 1:05:53.700]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[1:05:53.700 --> 1:05:54.700]  Don't give your money to the state.
[1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:55.700]  Spray your plate.
[1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:58.700]  And when the cameras flashed, you'll save some cash.
[1:05:58.700 --> 1:06:02.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:05.700]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:05.700 --> 1:06:08.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:06:08.700 --> 1:06:09.700]  Who is the enemy?
[1:06:09.700 --> 1:06:10.700]  bin Laden.
[1:06:10.700 --> 1:06:11.700]  This is his MO.
[1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:13.700]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:15.700]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:18.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:22.700]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.700]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:06:25.700 --> 1:06:28.700]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:32.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:34.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:06:34.700 --> 1:06:36.700]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:06:36.700 --> 1:06:38.700]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:40.700]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:41.700]  warnings in war games,
[1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:42.700]  the shadow government,
[1:06:42.700 --> 1:06:43.700]  and much, much more,
[1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:44.700]  fabled enemies.

[1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:22.700]  Also included are three credit strategies
[1:07:22.700 --> 1:07:25.700]  attorneys and credit repair companies don't want you to know about.
[1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:27.700]  This alone could save you up to $1,000

[1:07:55.700 --> 1:07:58.700]  This message has been brought to you by RadioCreditSecrets.com.
[1:08:00.700 --> 1:08:03.700]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:03.700 --> 1:08:06.700]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:09.700 --> 1:08:11.700]  They have trained the public, Alan Watt, as you know,
[1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:15.700]  to believe that what they believe is reality
[1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:18.700]  and that the general public is with the elite.
[1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:23.700]  And as you were saying, that the general masses
[1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:29.700]  well-being is the same well-being of the elite
[1:08:29.700 --> 1:08:31.700]  or that we're all together.
[1:08:31.700 --> 1:08:33.700]  We're all going in the same direction.
[1:08:33.700 --> 1:08:36.700]  We all have the same interest.
[1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:39.700]  The public's also been trained not to have respect for themselves
[1:08:39.700 --> 1:08:41.700]  and to imagine Hollywood people as like gods
[1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:44.700]  who float around on clouds and elitist with eggheads
[1:08:44.700 --> 1:08:48.700]  in fancy suits on TV no more than they do.
[1:08:48.700 --> 1:08:50.700]  When in truth, once you really know what's going on,
[1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:52.700]  you watch the eggheads, the experts.
[1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:54.700]  They're putting out false disinfo on purpose
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:08:57.700]  that isn't even meant to make sense.
[1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:58.700]  Alan?
[1:08:58.700 --> 1:09:01.700]  That is true, and with science, they can rationalize anything
[1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:04.700]  to an ignorant populist.
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:06.700]  Let's take more calls here.
[1:09:06.700 --> 1:09:08.700]  Let's talk to Dustin in Ohio.
[1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:11.700]  Dustin, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:13.700]  Welcome.
[1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:15.700]  Dustin dropped off.
[1:09:15.700 --> 1:09:17.700]  Okay, I see that there.
[1:09:17.700 --> 1:09:20.700]  Donna in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[1:09:20.700 --> 1:09:21.700]  Hello.
[1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:22.700]  Hi.
[1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:23.700]  How are you today?
[1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:24.700]  Fine, thank you.
[1:09:24.700 --> 1:09:26.700]  Hi, Alan, as well.
[1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:28.700]  I'm going to raise a point that never gets raised
[1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:31.700]  in terms of the global climate change debate,
[1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:33.700]  and it's one that really gets under my skin
[1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:35.700]  because I researched it extensively,
[1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.700]  and that is heating of the ionosphere
[1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:41.700]  using electromagnetic energy from towers
[1:09:41.700 --> 1:09:43.700]  or from projects such as HARP,
[1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:46.700]  one of many, I think over 60 countries now
[1:09:46.700 --> 1:09:48.700]  are heating the ionosphere.
[1:09:48.700 --> 1:09:50.700]  And I don't see how we can even have a discussion
[1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:52.700]  about climate change and so forth
[1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:55.700]  without including this in this quote-unquote debate.
[1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:57.700]  The debate itself is polarized.
[1:09:57.700 --> 1:09:59.700]  It comes down on two sides,
[1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:01.700]  those who believe in naturally occurring climate change,
[1:10:01.700 --> 1:10:03.700]  that's one side, and those who believe
[1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:05.700]  in the global warming myth, and it is a myth.
[1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:06.700]  There's no doubt about that.
[1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:08.700]  It takes you about five seconds to figure it out
[1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:10.700]  if you look it up.
[1:10:10.700 --> 1:10:14.700]  What we see when we experience this ionosphere heating
[1:10:14.700 --> 1:10:16.700]  with electromagnetic energy
[1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:19.700]  is severe changes in jet stream,
[1:10:19.700 --> 1:10:22.700]  increase in volcanic, increase in earthquakes.
[1:10:22.700 --> 1:10:25.700]  Now, my understanding is that HARP would operational
[1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:29.700]  approximately sometime right before 2004.
[1:10:29.700 --> 1:10:31.700]  And right after that, we had the dramatic
[1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:33.700]  earthquake tsunami in Indonesia.
[1:10:33.700 --> 1:10:35.700]  Let me be specific here
[1:10:35.700 --> 1:10:37.700]  because you're bringing up a really important point
[1:10:37.700 --> 1:10:39.700]  that I have made, but not often enough.
[1:10:39.700 --> 1:10:42.700]  In fact, this morning, I was meaning to make this very point,
[1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:44.700]  and then you have these thousands of thoughts
[1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.700]  that never get on air,
[1:10:46.700 --> 1:10:50.700]  and then I want you to comment more on it to Donna.
[1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:53.700]  And then we'll have Alan comment on it.
[1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:55.700]  But it's this.
[1:10:55.700 --> 1:11:00.700]  We know the sun was in a particularly hot phase,
[1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:03.700]  putting off more heat radiation in the last 30 years.
[1:11:03.700 --> 1:11:05.700]  Now, the last few, it's cooled down.
[1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:09.700]  The entire solar system is cooling.
[1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:12.700]  The ice caps that we're receiving on Mars
[1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:13.700]  are getting larger.
[1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:16.700]  Same thing for the moons of Saturn and Jupiter and others.
[1:11:16.700 --> 1:11:18.700]  Now, separately from that,
[1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:21.700]  they're getting upset that because of the cooling,
[1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:23.700]  it's becoming obvious that it's not global warming.
[1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:25.700]  So now they're just saying climate change.
[1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:27.700]  But then that's very childlike.
[1:11:27.700 --> 1:11:28.700]  We're always having climate change.
[1:11:28.700 --> 1:11:29.700]  We have seasons.
[1:11:29.700 --> 1:11:32.700]  We know we go through hot and cold periods,
[1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.700]  but you're right.
[1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:37.700]  None of that even matters when it's declassified
[1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:41.700]  that they're doing thousands of aerosol spraying operations.
[1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:42.700]  Just Google it.
[1:11:42.700 --> 1:11:43.700]  The government now admits they're...
[1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.700]  I'm watching one right now.
[1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:48.700]  Well, I mean, I'm just finishing this thought for folks
[1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:51.700]  that don't know what Donna knows, that don't know what Alan knows.
[1:11:51.700 --> 1:11:53.700]  I'm just throwing this out because it's so important.
[1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:55.700]  And I meant to make the point today,
[1:11:55.700 --> 1:11:57.700]  and I'm glad you called in that synchronicity or serendipity,
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:11:58.700]  whichever one.
[1:11:58.700 --> 1:12:06.700]  The point here is that just finishing with thought,
[1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:11.700]  they are clearly, as Secretary of Defense Cohen said in 97
[1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:14.700]  in Army Times in the April issue,
[1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:15.700]  they do have weather weapons.
[1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:17.700]  They do have tectonic earthquake weapons.
[1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:18.700]  They said it.
[1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:19.700]  They admit it.
[1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:21.700]  They are manipulating the weather.
[1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:23.700]  So finish up your comment, and then I want to get Alan
[1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:25.700]  to watch take on that.
[1:12:25.700 --> 1:12:26.700]  Okay.
[1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:29.700]  Well, there is a misconception about missile defense shield.
[1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:31.700]  The prevailing...
[1:12:31.700 --> 1:12:33.700]  What the mainstream puts out there is that missile defense shield
[1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:37.700]  are these interceptors, which fail nine times out of 10.
[1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:41.700]  And in fact, missile defense shield is post-energy,
[1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:43.700]  electromagnetic energy into the ionosphere,
[1:12:43.700 --> 1:12:46.700]  and I'm leaning toward thinking that the chemtrails
[1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:48.700]  that I'm witnessing right now outside my window
[1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:50.700]  have something to do with that.
[1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:54.700]  So what we have here is this shield of energy being created
[1:12:54.700 --> 1:12:56.700]  by antennas such as harp, and you say harp,
[1:12:56.700 --> 1:12:58.700]  and you've got this horrible stigma,
[1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:00.700]  just like you have when you say chemtrails.
[1:13:00.700 --> 1:13:02.700]  But it's a very real thing,
[1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:04.700]  and it's impacting everybody, everything,
[1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:05.700]  every living organism.
[1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:08.700]  Well, governments admit that they use antennas
[1:13:08.700 --> 1:13:10.700]  to manipulate the atmosphere, and that's in thousands,
[1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:13.700]  literally thousands of mainstream newspapers
[1:13:13.700 --> 1:13:14.700]  have reported on that.
[1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:18.700]  China does it, Russia does it, but the problem is
[1:13:18.700 --> 1:13:20.700]  we don't know the full extent of that.
[1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:24.700]  We do know that there are thousands of spraying programs
[1:13:24.700 --> 1:13:28.700]  going on with aluminum, dioxide, with barium salts
[1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.700]  being added to jet fuel, perfect compartmentalization.
[1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:33.700]  The companies don't even know.
[1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.700]  It's only the three big jet fuel makers
[1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:38.700]  that are adding an Alan Watt comments on this.
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:40.700]  It's much bigger even.
[1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:43.700]  The harp technology was used in the 1970s,
[1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:46.700]  early 70s, from Russia, Riga, in fact,
[1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:49.700]  the Soviet system, and Latvia.
[1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:54.700]  And we find out now there's over 54 of them worldwide.
[1:13:54.700 --> 1:13:56.700]  The US has one in, I think, Iceland,
[1:13:56.700 --> 1:13:59.700]  and one in Greenland as well, as one in Alaska,
[1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:01.700]  and now one in Australia in Pine Grep.
[1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:04.700]  Now, they can work these in concert with each other.
[1:14:04.700 --> 1:14:06.700]  It was in the British papers,
[1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:09.700]  they used it in the First Gulf War in Iraq,
[1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:13.700]  and it literally affected the minds of the soldiers
[1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:16.700]  who were just walking out of the desert, completely stunned.
[1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:18.700]  There hadn't been another bombardment,
[1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:20.700]  at least a visible bombardment,
[1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:22.700]  and yet they were complete zombies.
[1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:24.700]  So it can affect the mind.
[1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:26.700]  Now, the harp technology, there's no doubt about it.
[1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.700]  This ties in with technotronic warfare
[1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:30.700]  that Brzezinski talked about in his book,
[1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:32.700]  Between Two Ages.
[1:14:32.700 --> 1:14:35.700]  He says, shortly, a technique will be used on the public,
[1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:37.700]  and it will affect their minds,
[1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:39.700]  become very placid, et cetera.
[1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:43.700]  And they can also use it to put thoughts right into your head
[1:14:43.700 --> 1:14:46.700]  if necessary by using a secondary beam.
[1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:50.700]  The United Nations signed a document with all the countries
[1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:53.700]  that had harp technology in the 1970s.
[1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:56.700]  You look into that as under weather warfare.
[1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:59.700]  And the whole idea was dreamed up in the 50s
[1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:02.700]  with Teller, who was the inventor of the H-bomb.
[1:15:02.700 --> 1:15:06.700]  He said if they can dose the atmosphere with barium salts,
[1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:08.700]  aluminum oxide, and others,
[1:15:08.700 --> 1:15:10.700]  he said we can be very conductive,
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:15.700]  and it will help this ELF frequency cover vast distances,
[1:15:15.700 --> 1:15:18.700]  and they could use it either for altering the weather,
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:22.700]  weather modification, or they could cause global warming with it,
[1:15:22.700 --> 1:15:23.700]  or freezing.
[1:15:23.700 --> 1:15:26.700]  One or the other depends on the type of frequency they hit it with,
[1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:30.700]  and they could also affect the mindset of a target population.
[1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:34.700]  So this is actually in the treaty at the United Nations from the 70s.
[1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:35.700]  They have this technology.
[1:15:35.700 --> 1:15:37.700]  They're using it extensively across the world.
[1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:42.700]  And by the way, the Baltimore Sun eight years ago
[1:15:42.700 --> 1:15:47.700]  did a big report admitting that DARPA is testing antenna arrays
[1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:51.700]  across the United States, and it said to calm the American people.
[1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:53.700]  We put off these waves.
[1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:55.700]  We love you with the government.
[1:15:55.700 --> 1:15:59.700]  Yeah, I put photographs from Canada, the States,
[1:15:59.700 --> 1:16:02.700]  and Europe to putting up these strange antennas.
[1:16:02.700 --> 1:16:07.700]  They look like tall lamp posts with a windsock on the end of it.
[1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:11.700]  I've seen this construction and photograph the construction
[1:16:11.700 --> 1:16:15.700]  where they have massive thick cables going into the bases of them,
[1:16:15.700 --> 1:16:18.700]  and this is part of the Tetronic series setup
[1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:21.700]  where they can control crowds during,
[1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:23.700]  and whole populations during times of crisis.
[1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:28.700]  They can make you literally zombified and very placid if they wish to.
[1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:30.700]  But that's freedom, Alan.
[1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:31.700]  That's the freedom.
[1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:32.700]  That's the freedom.
[1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:35.700]  That's their new freedom.
[1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:40.700]  Freedom was redefined by Mr. Bush himself.
[1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:43.700]  Well, for the people that think they're going to enforce this system,
[1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:45.700]  most of them are going to be part of the brave new future.
[1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:47.700]  Either are they?
[1:16:47.700 --> 1:16:49.700]  No, they will not.
[1:16:49.700 --> 1:16:53.700]  But I think too, that'll start freaking out some as they closer to their target
[1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:56.700]  when they personally will see their end coming.
[1:16:56.700 --> 1:16:58.700]  That's where it will be necessary.
[1:16:58.700 --> 1:16:59.700]  This is interesting.
[1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:01.700]  You see, technology is very old,
[1:17:01.700 --> 1:17:05.700]  because the true sciences are kept back from the public,
[1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:07.700]  and even from professors,
[1:17:07.700 --> 1:17:11.700]  there's much higher levels of technology and science existing.
[1:17:11.700 --> 1:17:13.700]  And we know this from Nick Bigidge,
[1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:17.700]  who had a documentary on television on the Wendy Mesley show,
[1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:21.700]  where he demonstrated the obsolete technology,
[1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:25.700]  little handheld remotes that the CIA used back in the 1950s,
[1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:29.700]  where they could put thoughts directly into a target's mind.
[1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:34.700]  By the way, they had said Ted Stevens was beating his brother,
[1:17:34.700 --> 1:17:38.700]  but it looks like Senator Stevens is going to be Senator Stevens.
[1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:40.700]  Looks like he's beating.
[1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:43.700]  That's the Nick Bigidge's brother, Mark Bigidge.
[1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:48.700]  So it looks like he's winning right now in that highly contested Senate race.
[1:17:48.700 --> 1:17:49.700]  Just a program note.
[1:17:49.700 --> 1:17:51.700]  You're absolutely right.
[1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:53.700]  They've suppressed a lot of technologies.
[1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:57.700]  Anything else you wanted to add there, Coller?
[1:17:57.700 --> 1:18:00.700]  Yes, one more thing, and this is really important.
[1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:03.700]  The powers of observation for everybody are critical,
[1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:06.700]  not just in terms of the geopolitical situation.
[1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:09.700]  I mean, we really have to use our minds.
[1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:12.700]  But in observing nature every day,
[1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:16.700]  if you really pay attention, you will see things you've never seen before.
[1:18:16.700 --> 1:18:18.700]  We had a period of six weeks.
[1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:20.700]  I live in a small mountain village in northern New Mexico,
[1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:22.700]  where we have farming and ranching.
[1:18:22.700 --> 1:18:26.700]  There was a period of about six weeks or more where things stopped growing,
[1:18:26.700 --> 1:18:28.700]  literally stopped growing.
[1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:30.700]  Flowers didn't bloom.
[1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:34.700]  Crops that had been planted weren't getting any bigger.
[1:18:34.700 --> 1:18:39.700]  And when I noticed it myself, with regard to my indoor plants and my outdoor flowers and so forth,
[1:18:39.700 --> 1:18:42.700]  these are plants that are potted, mind you, not even in the ground,
[1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:43.700]  I pointed out...
[1:18:43.700 --> 1:18:46.700]  Everything these elites do is about playing God.
[1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:49.700]  Total matrix dominance, total...
[1:18:49.700 --> 1:18:52.700]  I mean, they have all these terms, but go ahead.
[1:18:52.700 --> 1:18:53.700]  Full spectrum dominance.
[1:18:53.700 --> 1:18:55.700]  Well, this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[1:18:55.700 --> 1:18:57.700]  They weren't dying, but they weren't flourishing.
[1:18:57.700 --> 1:18:59.700]  They weren't growing.
[1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:01.700]  So when I talked to local people, local farmers about it,
[1:19:01.700 --> 1:19:03.700]  they said, yes, they had observed the same thing.
[1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:05.700]  They didn't know what was going on.
[1:19:05.700 --> 1:19:08.700]  I posted on a message board that it goes out across the country,
[1:19:08.700 --> 1:19:09.700]  and people posted the same thing.
[1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:11.700]  They said, yes, we noticed it was very strange.
[1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:12.700]  So what if?
[1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:13.700]  I mean, it's a what if.
[1:19:13.700 --> 1:19:17.700]  What if this energy that they're manipulating could be used to stop things from growing?
[1:19:17.700 --> 1:19:19.700]  No, it could be used to kill you.
[1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:20.700]  So of course...
[1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:21.700]  Exactly.
[1:19:21.700 --> 1:19:24.700]  But listen, 2 billion bees, or close to 80% of them in England,
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:25.700]  just dropped dead.
[1:19:25.700 --> 1:19:26.700]  They're dropping dead everywhere.
[1:19:26.700 --> 1:19:27.700]  Other animals are dropping dead.
[1:19:27.700 --> 1:19:29.700]  Whole bird species are dying.
[1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:31.700]  Meanwhile, the globalists can't surround going,
[1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:33.700]  it's for the earth, for the earth.
[1:19:33.700 --> 1:19:36.700]  When really, they want to destroy the earth and rebuild it
[1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:38.700]  in their image playing God.
[1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:40.700]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:43.700]  Again, we'll be right back for everybody on the AM and FM Dial.
[1:19:43.700 --> 1:19:45.700]  We're going to take some more calls to get to everybody
[1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:50.700]  here on the impowars.com streams only during this break.
[1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:52.700]  You know, I joke around about all this
[1:19:52.700 --> 1:19:54.700]  because it would be too stressful if I didn't,
[1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.700]  but this is all very serious.
[1:19:56.700 --> 1:19:59.700]  It's all very, very painful to admit that we've gotten this.
[1:19:59.700 --> 1:20:01.700]  The headlines are clear.
[1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:04.700]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[1:20:04.700 --> 1:20:07.700]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[1:20:07.700 --> 1:20:09.700]  The mark of a beast is at hand.
[1:20:09.700 --> 1:20:12.700]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:15.700]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[1:20:15.700 --> 1:20:17.700]  To stay free.
[1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:20.700]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast kit.

[1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:06.700]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:09.700]  No. I can't find my keys.

[1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:38.700]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?
[1:21:38.700 --> 1:21:40.700]  Oh, here they are.
[1:21:40.700 --> 1:21:43.700]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that flashes.

[1:30:43.700 --> 1:31:09.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:36.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:58.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:25.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:40.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:33:05.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:32.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:58.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:33:58.700 --> 1:34:25.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:34:25.700 --> 1:34:52.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:34:52.700 --> 1:35:18.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:44.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:35:44.700 --> 1:36:11.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:11.700 --> 1:36:37.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:37.700 --> 1:37:04.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:31.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:58.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:25.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:38:25.700 --> 1:38:53.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:38:53.700 --> 1:39:19.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:39:19.700 --> 1:39:46.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:39:46.700 --> 1:40:12.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:38.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:40:38.700 --> 1:41:05.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:34.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:41:35.700 --> 1:42:01.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:23.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:51.700]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:51.700 --> 1:43:06.700]  The doctor decided to drug test me and apparently I came out positive for certain things that were not prescribed and did not come up for what they prescribed me.
[1:43:06.700 --> 1:43:21.700]  After that, they urine tested me and then I went and had a blood test done.
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:37.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:43:37.700 --> 1:44:02.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:28.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:44:28.700 --> 1:44:50.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:45:19.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:45.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:46:12.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:46:12.700 --> 1:46:38.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:46:38.700 --> 1:47:02.700]  They are trying to make this a criminal procedure.
[1:47:02.700 --> 1:47:13.700]  There is a global meltdown coming. It is a global depression and one world currency and one world financial system is the end game.
[1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:16.700]  China said last week they want one global currency.
[1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:26.700]  France said yesterday or the day before that they want one world order, a new world order at the end of this event.
[1:47:26.700 --> 1:47:33.700]  They had a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of South America.
[1:47:33.700 --> 1:47:44.700]  It is a plan from the business elites, the political elites that will cost more American jobs, cost American sovereignty, but it would fulfill the president's father's vision.
[1:47:44.700 --> 1:47:52.700]  This time a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy, effectively surrendering the sovereignty of the United States.
[1:47:52.700 --> 1:47:59.700]  Which is what Bilderberg is into by and large, the idea of a one world community, a new world order.
[1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:04.700]  They see themselves as a government as opposed to a group of world leaders or people with influence.
[1:48:04.700 --> 1:48:13.700]  The European leaders have been pressing for an overhaul of the whole international financial system and they will continue to do so.
[1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:25.700]  They are calling for an organization of a global summit as soon as next month.
[1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:32.700]  Chancellor and Joseph very much for the transatlantic economic integration plan.
[1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:35.700]  And for that too we need to develop a common market, common standards.
[1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:43.700]  So this is indeed a very important agreement.
[1:48:43.700 --> 1:48:50.700]  Within the next four years we will see the emergence of a new international order.
[1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:53.700]  A new world order of a new world order.
[1:48:53.700 --> 1:48:54.700]  A new world order.
[1:48:54.700 --> 1:49:01.700]  You're free and freedom is beautiful and it'll take time to restore chaos.
[1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:13.700]  The forces shaping this world at this moment are so strong and they all tend in one direction.
[1:49:13.700 --> 1:49:16.700]  We will expose the new world order.
[1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:19.700]  We will expose the global crime syndicate.
[1:49:19.700 --> 1:49:20.700]  The David Rockefeller.
[1:49:20.700 --> 1:49:22.700]  The Rothschild representatives here.
[1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:24.700]  The Queens and the Netherlands.
[1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:30.700]  All of you, we tell you you are not our queen, you are not our king, you are not our god.
[1:49:30.700 --> 1:49:32.700]  We do not belong to you.
[1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:34.700]  We are not your slaves.
[1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:42.700]  We stand as free humans as good as the beginning of time against the strong men, against the pogs, against the bullets.
[1:49:42.700 --> 1:49:46.700]  We are here telling you we will resist the new world order.
[1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:48.700]  We will defeat the world government.
[1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:53.700]  And if you hear this shouting, it's a group of demonstrators who've come.
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.700]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:57.700]  Oh, get a light.
[1:49:57.700 --> 1:50:04.700]  They're going after everybody. How do we know? How do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage, was engineered by you?
[1:50:04.700 --> 1:50:09.700]  David Rockefeller, the collateral commission, the CFR, and Bilderberg Group, sir.
[1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:14.700]  David Rockefeller, we know about your new world order.
[1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:19.700]  Our government stays without the possibility to start the Vietnam War.
[1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:23.700]  An inside job. And how dare you?
[1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:28.700]  Germany will prevail. Germany will fall.
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:37.700]  The answer to 1934 is 1776.
[1:50:37.700 --> 1:50:39.700]  The 21st century is going to be a new century.
[1:50:39.700 --> 1:50:41.700]  Not the century of slavery.
[1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:44.700]  Not the century of lies and human notion gimmick.
[1:50:44.700 --> 1:50:48.700]  And classism, statism, and all the rest of modes of control.
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:53.700]  It's going to be the age of humankind standing up for something pure, something right.
[1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:57.700]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[1:50:57.700 --> 1:51:01.700]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it. Do you got me?
[1:51:01.700 --> 1:51:09.700]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do.
[1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:10.700]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:17.700]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:26.700]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:51:26.700 --> 1:51:33.700]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:51:33.700 --> 1:51:36.700]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:51:36.700 --> 1:51:42.700]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:49.700]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv

[1:51:54.700 --> 1:52:00.700]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:52:00.700 --> 1:52:04.700]  Fuel prices are up and down, fighting into everyone's budget.

[1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:04.700]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[1:54:04.700 --> 1:54:09.700]  A world in which there is a very real prospect of a new world order.
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:25.700]  It is a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges for the future.
[1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:45.700]  The question is, will they kill untold millions as they did in the last century?
[1:54:56.700 --> 1:55:00.700]  It is not the elite cockroach that determines that.
[1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:13.700]  It is you.
[1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:31.700]  New world orders are in-bred, alias control freaks that are scared of free humanity and scared of your dynamic human spirit.
[1:55:31.700 --> 1:55:33.700]  They think you're stupid.
[1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:35.700]  They think they can suppress you.
[1:55:35.700 --> 1:55:37.700]  They are sure they can win.
[1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:43.700]  They thought we could go wildly in the night and we're not going to do that.
[1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:52.700]  They have done this.
[1:55:52.700 --> 1:55:55.700]  They have been born against us.
[1:55:55.700 --> 1:55:57.700]  Their system is imploding.
[1:55:57.700 --> 1:55:59.700]  They are failing.
[1:55:59.700 --> 1:56:01.700]  We are rising.
[1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:04.700]  New world orders have been defeated.
[1:56:04.700 --> 1:56:07.700]  Again, I know what I'm saying.
[1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:15.700]  But if you want to know more about our society, we have to come to grips with just how evil this elite is.
[1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:17.700]  It has been so hard.
[1:56:17.700 --> 1:56:21.700]  First problems in history were just good, decent adversaries to your folks.
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:28.700]  Instead, if we have trouble drastic, we look at the world with our eyes and we think that other people think like we do.
[1:56:28.700 --> 1:56:35.700]  But history shows there's not the case. There are dangerous individuals who want to preach and hateful.
[1:56:35.700 --> 1:56:41.700]  There are nothing adversive of you that are jealous of the freedom you've got and jealous of the love you have.
[1:56:41.700 --> 1:56:45.700]  They hate you because you're not miserable like they are.
[1:56:45.700 --> 1:56:49.700]  And they think that they're going to be able to continue to enslave us.
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:51.700]  That's not the case.
[1:56:51.700 --> 1:56:54.700]  New world orders are in-bred.
[1:56:54.700 --> 1:56:59.700]  This isn't just the system of revolution.
[1:56:59.700 --> 1:57:03.700]  This is a worldwide revolution.
[1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:08.700]  We shall win!
[1:57:08.700 --> 1:57:15.700]  We shall win!
[1:57:15.700 --> 1:57:18.700]  The world government has now been exposed.
[1:57:18.700 --> 1:57:20.700]  We know you are in trouble.
[1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:22.700]  We know you are in trouble.
[1:57:22.700 --> 1:57:26.700]  Today the Rocks and Fellows are off-dials representatives here.
[1:57:26.700 --> 1:57:28.700]  This is way better than ever once.
[1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:31.700]  From all of you, we tell you you are not our queen.
[1:57:31.700 --> 1:57:34.700]  You are not our king. You are not our god.
[1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:37.700]  We do not belong here. We are not your slaves.
[1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:41.700]  This land is free to us and stood for the beginning of time.
[1:57:41.700 --> 1:57:45.700]  Against the strong men, against the gods, against the rolling.
[1:57:45.700 --> 1:57:48.700]  We will defeat your world government.
[1:57:48.700 --> 1:57:52.700]  We will defeat world taxation. We will defeat world control for it.
[1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:54.700]  The gods are on our side.
[1:57:54.700 --> 1:57:57.700]  I stand before the creator of the universe.
[1:57:57.700 --> 1:58:03.700]  I ask the creator of the universe, as our Mali father did in 1776,
[1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:08.700]  to please guide and respect us, and to give us the power and the support side
[1:58:08.700 --> 1:58:12.700]  of the understanding and the will to stand against your entire agenda,
[1:58:12.700 --> 1:58:17.700]  including your final plan of world population reduction of 80%,
[1:58:17.700 --> 1:58:21.700]  the Henry Kissinger pen in 1973.
[1:58:21.700 --> 1:58:24.700]  Now, believe that you are invincible.
[1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:27.700]  You will and you are failing now.
[1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:30.700]  Your new world order will fall.
[1:58:30.700 --> 1:58:33.700]  Humanity will defeat you.
[1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:38.700]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:58:44.700 --> 1:58:46.700]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:46.700 --> 1:58:51.700]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:55.700]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:58:55.700 --> 1:58:58.700]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:58.700 --> 1:59:01.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:02.700]  But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.700 --> 1:59:03.700]  Bin Laden.
[1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:04.700]  This is his M.O.
[1:59:04.700 --> 1:59:07.700]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:59:07.700 --> 1:59:11.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:59:11.700 --> 1:59:15.700]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:18.700]  Many U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:59:18.700 --> 1:59:21.700]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.700 --> 1:59:25.700]  I am aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.700 --> 1:59:27.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:59:27.700 --> 1:59:29.700]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:59:29.700 --> 1:59:31.700]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:31.700 --> 1:59:32.700]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:32.700 --> 1:59:33.700]  warnings in war games,
[1:59:33.700 --> 1:59:34.700]  the shadow government,
[1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:35.700]  and much, much more,
[1:59:35.700 --> 1:59:36.700]  fabled enemies.
[1:59:36.700 --> 1:59:39.700]  Get the DVD at infowars.com
[1:59:39.700 --> 1:59:41.700]  or see it in super high quality,
[1:59:41.700 --> 1:59:44.700]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:44.700 --> 1:59:46.700]  Either you are with us,
[1:59:46.700 --> 2:00:15.700]  or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:18.700]  All right, folks, we are back.
[2:00:18.700 --> 2:00:23.700]  It is Tuesday, October 28th, 2008, one week from Election Day.
[2:00:23.700 --> 2:00:26.700]  And we've been talking to Webster Tarpoli in the past hour.
[2:00:26.700 --> 2:00:28.700]  We're taking your calls right now.
[2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:31.700]  And in these last, in these five minutes,
[2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:33.700]  before we go to the next segment,
[2:00:33.700 --> 2:00:35.700]  I'm Webster and take more callers.
[2:00:35.700 --> 2:00:37.700]  I want you to go over those three points.
[2:00:37.700 --> 2:00:38.700]  Now, obviously, your agenda is to stop
[2:00:38.700 --> 2:00:47.700]  Obama at all costs.
[2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:48.700]  What are the other two big points
[2:00:48.700 --> 2:00:50.700]  that we have to get by on this election?
[2:00:50.700 --> 2:00:51.700]  And then a few more comments.
[2:00:51.700 --> 2:00:52.700]  First of all, no Obama.
[2:00:52.700 --> 2:00:53.700]  Stop Obama at all costs.
[2:00:53.700 --> 2:00:55.700]  If you don't stop Obama,
[2:00:55.700 --> 2:00:56.700]  you're going off a cliff.
[2:00:56.700 --> 2:00:58.700]  You're leaping into an abyss.
[2:00:58.700 --> 2:01:00.700]  And most people have very little idea
[2:01:00.700 --> 2:01:01.700]  of what fascism was
[2:01:01.700 --> 2:01:03.700]  and what this is going to look like.
[2:01:03.700 --> 2:01:06.700]  Again, reread that thing from Biden.
[2:01:06.700 --> 2:01:10.700]  A tremendous, crushing, brutal economic austerity
[2:01:10.700 --> 2:01:12.700]  within the first 12 months.
[2:01:12.700 --> 2:01:14.700]  And an international confrontation,
[2:01:14.700 --> 2:01:17.700]  probably with false flag or some form of aggression
[2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:18.700]  in the first six months.
[2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:21.700]  Secondly, anybody who voted for the bailout
[2:01:21.700 --> 2:01:22.700]  has to be punished.
[2:01:22.700 --> 2:01:24.700]  You've got to vote against any elected official
[2:01:24.700 --> 2:01:26.700]  who supported that bailout.
[2:01:26.700 --> 2:01:28.700]  Obama, of course, was the one who organized
[2:01:28.700 --> 2:01:30.700]  the whole Black Caucus with a conference call
[2:01:30.700 --> 2:01:32.700]  to switch their votes into it.
[2:01:32.700 --> 2:01:34.700]  McCain, I think, vacillated
[2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:36.700]  because there were a lot of Republicans
[2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:37.700]  who were against it.
[2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:38.700]  You remember in the House,
[2:01:38.700 --> 2:01:40.700]  it was stopped for the first time around
[2:01:40.700 --> 2:01:42.700]  with quite a few Republican votes.
[2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:44.700]  The third one, you've got to come out of this
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:45.700]  with gridlock.
[2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:47.700]  No one-party state.
[2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:49.700]  We do not want the presidency,
[2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:51.700]  the Senate, and the House of Representatives
[2:01:51.700 --> 2:01:53.700]  in the hands of the same people.
[2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:55.700]  The monstrosities of the Bush era
[2:01:55.700 --> 2:01:57.700]  are largely in the period
[2:01:57.700 --> 2:01:59.700]  of one-party Republican rule,
[2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:02.700]  which is from about January of 2003
[2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:05.700]  to about January of 2007.
[2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:07.700]  That's the Republican one-party state,
[2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:09.700]  and that's what gets you the Iraq War
[2:02:09.700 --> 2:02:12.700]  and a lot of other things going with it.
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:14.700]  As far as these third parties go,
[2:02:14.700 --> 2:02:16.700]  Cynthia McKinney, Rosa Clemente
[2:02:16.700 --> 2:02:18.700]  is somebody that I've known from broadcasting
[2:02:18.700 --> 2:02:19.700]  in New York City.
[2:02:19.700 --> 2:02:21.700]  She needs to develop
[2:02:21.700 --> 2:02:23.700]  a much more aggressive critique of Obama.
[2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:25.700]  She could be very, very effective.
[2:02:25.700 --> 2:02:28.700]  Nader has probably attacked Obama more
[2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:30.700]  than others on the idea that Obama
[2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:32.700]  betrayed the black community,
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:35.700]  doesn't care about them, uses them.
[2:02:35.700 --> 2:02:38.700]  Bob Barr's running mate, Wayne Root,
[2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:42.700]  is somebody who graduated from Columbia in 1983
[2:02:42.700 --> 2:02:44.700]  and points out that he was in the same year
[2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:46.700]  and the same department as Obama
[2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:48.700]  at Columbia College,
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:49.700]  and nobody ever heard of Obama.
[2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:52.700]  There's no sign that Obama ever attended Columbia
[2:02:52.700 --> 2:02:53.700]  during those years.
[2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:55.700]  This is the big mystery.
[2:02:55.700 --> 2:02:58.700]  I think that's when he was recruited by Brzezinski.
[2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:01.700]  If you're in a state where it's clear
[2:03:01.700 --> 2:03:03.700]  that it's going to go one way or another,
[2:03:03.700 --> 2:03:06.700]  if you're in a state like Texas
[2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:09.700]  is pretty much a lost cause for Obama,
[2:03:09.700 --> 2:03:13.700]  then you can think about trying to make a statement
[2:03:13.700 --> 2:03:15.700]  with these third-party votes.
[2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:17.700]  You've got to do what's congenial for you
[2:03:17.700 --> 2:03:20.700]  and some people obviously are going to want to support them
[2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:23.700]  and maybe out of that some of these third parties
[2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:25.700]  can come out with a permanent infrastructure
[2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:26.700]  and some government funding.
[2:03:26.700 --> 2:03:28.700]  That would be a good thing.
[2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:29.700]  Yeah, I mean, obviously,
[2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:31.700]  the way I look at it in New York,
[2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:33.700]  they're going to vote Obama no matter what.
[2:03:33.700 --> 2:03:37.700]  I don't see McCain getting the New York vote.
[2:03:37.700 --> 2:03:38.700]  I'm voting third-party,
[2:03:38.700 --> 2:03:41.700]  and I hope other people in New York vote third-party as well.
[2:03:41.700 --> 2:03:43.700]  New York can show there's a lot of change.
[2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:45.700]  I think California is the same way.
[2:03:45.700 --> 2:03:46.700]  I mean, that's going Obama.
[2:03:46.700 --> 2:03:47.700]  I mean, you don't think that John McCain
[2:03:47.700 --> 2:03:49.700]  has a shot in either of those two states.
[2:03:49.700 --> 2:03:51.700]  No, but this is a very, very close election,
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:53.700]  and I do believe that any place
[2:03:53.700 --> 2:03:55.700]  where you have blue-collar workers,
[2:03:55.700 --> 2:03:57.700]  the thing, the group that's undercounted
[2:03:57.700 --> 2:03:59.700]  are the Puma Democrats,
[2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:02.700]  the Reagan Democrats, the Hillary Clinton Democrats.
[2:04:02.700 --> 2:04:06.700]  It's about 25% of the Democratic Party
[2:04:06.700 --> 2:04:09.700]  who just, they will not vote for Obama,
[2:04:09.700 --> 2:04:11.700]  and I think there's going to be a surprise.
[2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:14.700]  The whole Appalachian area in particular
[2:04:14.700 --> 2:04:16.700]  is fundamentally hostile to Obama
[2:04:16.700 --> 2:04:18.700]  because they have a class instinct.
[2:04:18.700 --> 2:04:21.700]  They can see that Obama is a class enemy.
[2:04:21.700 --> 2:04:23.700]  He's somebody who's coming to impose
[2:04:23.700 --> 2:04:26.700]  crushing austerity in the name of the Wall Street banks.
[2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:29.700]  He's an elitist. He's an oligarch.
[2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:32.700]  He's a puppet. He has no life of his own.
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  Everything that he's got has been given to him
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:36.700]  by these bankers.
[2:04:36.700 --> 2:04:38.700]  All right, Web, so we're going to take some other calls
[2:04:38.700 --> 2:04:40.700]  on the next segment,
[2:04:40.700 --> 2:04:43.700]  and in about, I think, 20 minutes,
[2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:46.700]  it's going to be Willie Nelson on the tour bus,
[2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:48.700]  the legendary country music icon
[2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:50.700]  here at infowars.com, prisonplan.com.

[2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:03.700]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[2:07:03.700 --> 2:07:05.700]  What does humidity mean to you?
[2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:07.700]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days,
[2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:09.700]  but many people are beginning to realize
[2:07:09.700 --> 2:07:11.700]  that humidity can be a valuable source
[2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:13.700]  of pure drinking water.
[2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:15.700]  That's why I'd like you to visit

[2:08:21.700 --> 2:08:23.700]  our guests, and we've got callers on the line,
[2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:25.700]  we're discussing the bailout, the elections,
[2:08:25.700 --> 2:08:27.700]  you know, Webster's books,
[2:08:27.700 --> 2:08:29.700]  Obama the Post, Modern Coon.
[2:08:29.700 --> 2:08:31.700]  What is Obama the Presidency H2O?
[2:08:31.700 --> 2:08:33.700]  What was it? I'm sorry, man.
[2:08:33.700 --> 2:08:35.700]  What is it?
[2:08:35.700 --> 2:08:37.700]  Obama, the unauthorized biography.
[2:08:37.700 --> 2:08:39.700]  The unauthorized biography,
[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:41.700]  kind of like your George Bush
[2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:43.700]  unauthorized biography, which is really a tradition.
[2:08:43.700 --> 2:08:45.700]  Let me just add one quick thing.
[2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:47.700]  You know, one person from the 9-11 Truth Movement
[2:08:47.700 --> 2:08:49.700]  who I think completely understood
[2:08:49.700 --> 2:08:51.700]  the profound change,
[2:08:51.700 --> 2:08:53.700]  the phase change that we've gone through
[2:08:53.700 --> 2:08:55.700]  is Phil Berg.
[2:08:55.700 --> 2:08:57.700]  And Phil Berg, I believe,
[2:08:57.700 --> 2:08:59.700]  will be at the Supreme Court
[2:08:59.700 --> 2:09:01.700]  here in Washington, the United States Supreme Court
[2:09:01.700 --> 2:09:03.700]  attempting to argue his case
[2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:05.700]  which has been defeated.
[2:09:05.700 --> 2:09:07.700]  Yeah, he's appealing it, right?
[2:09:07.700 --> 2:09:09.700]  Yeah, this is an appeal.
[2:09:09.700 --> 2:09:11.700]  It's a direct interlocutory appeal
[2:09:11.700 --> 2:09:13.700]  to the Supremes
[2:09:13.700 --> 2:09:15.700]  that Obama is not a natural-born citizen,
[2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:17.700]  as a citizen of Indonesia,
[2:09:17.700 --> 2:09:19.700]  making him an illegal alien.
[2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:21.700]  And people who are concerned about illegal aliens
[2:09:21.700 --> 2:09:23.700]  better start with this one,
[2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:25.700]  or it's going to be a lost cause
[2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:27.700]  any other way.
[2:09:27.700 --> 2:09:29.700]  So Berg is waging a valiant struggle
[2:09:29.700 --> 2:09:31.700]  and I urge people to support him.
[2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:33.700]  He's got a website called Obama Crimes.
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:35.700]  You can go there and give him a contribution.
[2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:37.700]  Encourage him.
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:39.700]  He's gotten tremendous media impact.
[2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:41.700]  He's got 70 to 80 million hits
[2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:43.700]  on this website in about two months.
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.700]  And this is an example of somebody
[2:09:45.700 --> 2:09:47.700]  who learned the lesson of 9-11,
[2:09:47.700 --> 2:09:49.700]  which is covert operations
[2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:51.700]  by the intelligence agencies
[2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:53.700]  designed to manipulate public
[2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:55.700]  opinion are bad,
[2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:57.700]  whether they're left cover like Obama
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:09:59.700]  or the right-wing racist
[2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:01.700]  war on terror stuff from 9-11.
[2:10:01.700 --> 2:10:03.700]  Not to get off on the tangent
[2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:05.700]  before we go into calls,
[2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:07.700]  but you just mentioned the
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:09.700]  Kenya citizenship thing.
[2:10:09.700 --> 2:10:11.700]  Do you think that's something that might come out after
[2:10:11.700 --> 2:10:13.700]  this man is already president
[2:10:13.700 --> 2:10:15.700]  and will automatically amend the Constitution?
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:17.700]  No, I think there are a lot of things
[2:10:17.700 --> 2:10:19.700]  that are held over Obama's head for control.
[2:10:19.700 --> 2:10:21.700]  In other words, the whole Resco
[2:10:21.700 --> 2:10:23.700]  complex, the whole
[2:10:23.700 --> 2:10:25.700]  sewer and cesspool
[2:10:25.700 --> 2:10:27.700]  of corruption with
[2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:29.700]  Tony Resco, not Kami Auchi,
[2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:31.700]  Al Samari, these characters
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:33.700]  from, well, from Chicago,
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:35.700]  but also from the Eastern Mediterranean.
[2:10:35.700 --> 2:10:37.700]  They're all Levantine Arabs.
[2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:39.700]  Obama's got
[2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:41.700]  these three convicted felons that are his godfathers.
[2:10:41.700 --> 2:10:43.700]  I'm sure that the feds
[2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:45.700]  could indict Obama at any time,
[2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:47.700]  but they're holding that over his head.
[2:10:47.700 --> 2:10:49.700]  If people are interested in
[2:10:49.700 --> 2:10:51.700]  Obama, the unauthorized biography,
[2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:53.700]  I do that in comparison to Harry S. Truman,
[2:10:53.700 --> 2:10:55.700]  who was controlled, among other things,
[2:10:55.700 --> 2:10:57.700]  in the same way. With Truman, it was
[2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:59.700]  the Pendergast machine
[2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:01.700]  in Missouri that he came out of.
[2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:03.700]  Truman could have been indicted at any point
[2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:05.700]  that the bankers decided that he wasn't
[2:11:05.700 --> 2:11:07.700]  obeying them.
[2:11:07.700 --> 2:11:09.700]  Obama will be the same story. I'd rather think
[2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:11.700]  that the hope of the ruling elite
[2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:13.700]  is to keep the citizenship issue
[2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:15.700]  as yet another means to beat him over the head
[2:11:15.700 --> 2:11:17.700]  if he starts getting rambunctious in office.
[2:11:17.700 --> 2:11:19.700]  All right, let's go to
[2:11:19.700 --> 2:11:21.700]  callers. Let's take Aaron in California.
[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:23.700]  Aaron, are you with us?
[2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:25.700]  Yeah, hi, Jason and Webster.
[2:11:25.700 --> 2:11:27.700]  Just wanted to talk
[2:11:27.700 --> 2:11:29.700]  about Michelle Obama,
[2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:31.700]  when she gave that big speech where she was wearing
[2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:33.700]  that teal shirt of some type, right
[2:11:33.700 --> 2:11:35.700]  smack in the middle of her shirt was a sun symbol.
[2:11:35.700 --> 2:11:37.700]  Sure enough, today on the Drudge Report,
[2:11:37.700 --> 2:11:39.700]  there's a picture of her from yesterday
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:41.700]  on Jay Leno
[2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:43.700]  or maybe a few days ago
[2:11:43.700 --> 2:11:45.700]  when she's got a sun symbol right on her shirt.
[2:11:45.700 --> 2:11:47.700]  Is that a coincidence?
[2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:49.700]  I don't think so.
[2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:51.700]  I'll say this. They're CFR.
[2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:53.700]  They're obviously globalist.
[2:11:53.700 --> 2:11:55.700]  They're obviously
[2:11:55.700 --> 2:11:57.700]  social climbers as well.
[2:11:57.700 --> 2:11:59.700]  Are they into the occult? I don't know.
[2:11:59.700 --> 2:12:01.700]  I don't know if they go to Bohemian Grove.
[2:12:01.700 --> 2:12:03.700]  I don't know how seriously they would take that.
[2:12:03.700 --> 2:12:05.700]  I've seen a whole lot of evidence,
[2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:07.700]  but it does follow suit. It does seem like
[2:12:07.700 --> 2:12:09.700]  a lot of the upper echelon elites
[2:12:09.700 --> 2:12:11.700]  do get into that sort of thing.
[2:12:11.700 --> 2:12:13.700]  So is it a possibility? Yes.
[2:12:13.700 --> 2:12:15.700]  Is it a probability?
[2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:17.700]  Let me weigh in with some more evidence.
[2:12:17.700 --> 2:12:19.700]  These people, this is
[2:12:19.700 --> 2:12:21.700]  the deployment of the trilateral
[2:12:21.700 --> 2:12:23.700]  Bilderberg Rand
[2:12:23.700 --> 2:12:25.700]  Chicago School right now.
[2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:27.700]  In other words, this is what the trilaterals
[2:12:27.700 --> 2:12:29.700]  and Bilderbergers are doing right now
[2:12:29.700 --> 2:12:31.700]  in our time.
[2:12:31.700 --> 2:12:33.700]  It's not like they want McCain or Hillary Clinton
[2:12:33.700 --> 2:12:35.700]  or John Edwards.
[2:12:35.700 --> 2:12:37.700]  It's these people.
[2:12:37.700 --> 2:12:39.700]  They are the prime deployment.
[2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:41.700]  That thing, I suppose, that's the old
[2:12:41.700 --> 2:12:43.700]  stolen Victor Smithra
[2:12:43.700 --> 2:12:45.700]  from the Byzantine Empire.
[2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:47.700]  The other thing you've got to see about these people
[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:49.700]  is the foundation.
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:51.700]  I haven't talked about that enough.
[2:12:51.700 --> 2:12:53.700]  The mother of Obama worked for the Ford Foundation,
[2:12:53.700 --> 2:12:55.700]  top official. Obama's whole life
[2:12:55.700 --> 2:12:57.700]  is working for foundations.
[2:12:57.700 --> 2:12:59.700]  The Joyce, the Camelio, the Woods,
[2:12:59.700 --> 2:13:01.700]  his friend, the weatherman, terrorist,
[2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:03.700]  bomber, killer, butcher,
[2:13:03.700 --> 2:13:05.700]  cop killer, Bill Ayers.
[2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:07.700]  You've got all sorts of money from
[2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:09.700]  the Annenberg Foundation.
[2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:11.700]  Tens of millions of dollars.
[2:13:11.700 --> 2:13:13.700]  Bernardine Dorn, another weatherman,
[2:13:13.700 --> 2:13:15.700]  terrorist, butcher, cop killer
[2:13:15.700 --> 2:13:17.700]  comes with money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[2:13:17.700 --> 2:13:19.700]  How does this happen?
[2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:21.700]  Well, my explanation is, having known
[2:13:21.700 --> 2:13:23.700]  these people, I knew them personally
[2:13:23.700 --> 2:13:25.700]  at least from a distance in SDS
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:27.700]  40 years ago,
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:29.700]  those were always agents.
[2:13:29.700 --> 2:13:31.700]  They were always operatives.
[2:13:31.700 --> 2:13:33.700]  They were foundation-funded terrorists
[2:13:33.700 --> 2:13:35.700]  in the middle 1960s,
[2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:37.700]  and Obama has bought into this
[2:13:37.700 --> 2:13:39.700]  mentality. In other words, with Obama,
[2:13:39.700 --> 2:13:41.700]  you are, in effect, putting a weatherman
[2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:43.700]  terrorist into the White House
[2:13:43.700 --> 2:13:45.700]  or someone who thinks like a
[2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:47.700]  weatherman terrorist, because as far as
[2:13:47.700 --> 2:13:49.700]  I can see, Bill Ayers is the guy's
[2:13:49.700 --> 2:13:51.700]  best friend, and that represents
[2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:53.700]  a very, very personal choice for him.
[2:13:53.700 --> 2:13:55.700]  All right, let's jump to
[2:13:55.700 --> 2:13:57.700]  Daniel in California.
[2:13:57.700 --> 2:13:59.700]  Daniel, what's on your mind?
[2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:01.700]  You there, Daniel?
[2:14:01.700 --> 2:14:03.700]  Yes, Jason. I'm a first-time caller,
[2:14:03.700 --> 2:14:05.700]  and I wanted to bring up
[2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:07.700]  the subject on why
[2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:09.700]  Obama supporters are so
[2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:11.700]  fervorite over Obama.
[2:14:11.700 --> 2:14:13.700]  Okay.
[2:14:13.700 --> 2:14:15.700]  Basically, I've
[2:14:15.700 --> 2:14:17.700]  found a pretty plausible
[2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:19.700]  theory as to why that's the case.
[2:14:21.700 --> 2:14:23.700]  Basically,
[2:14:23.700 --> 2:14:25.700]  he uses hidden
[2:14:25.700 --> 2:14:27.700]  or covert hypnosis techniques
[2:14:27.700 --> 2:14:29.700]  in his speeches.
[2:14:29.700 --> 2:14:31.700]  Let me say this before we get
[2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:33.700]  into hypnosis and things like that.
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:35.700]  People
[2:14:35.700 --> 2:14:37.700]  orate and speak a certain way. They move their hands.
[2:14:37.700 --> 2:14:39.700]  There's a guy out in the UK that does a
[2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:41.700]  show. It's not David
[2:14:41.700 --> 2:14:43.700]  Blaine's stuff. His name is Darren Brown.
[2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:45.700]  It's more how the mind works,
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.700]  how you're able to plant certain
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:49.700]  words, so
[2:14:49.700 --> 2:14:51.700]  certain parts of the brain activate to move
[2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:53.700]  certain manner. And these people are especially
[2:14:53.700 --> 2:14:55.700]  agents that are recruited
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:14:57.700]  by intelligence organizations like
[2:14:57.700 --> 2:14:59.700]  the CIA and the NSA when they're going
[2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:01.700]  to be speakers or taught these techniques
[2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:03.700]  that are there
[2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:05.700]  to basically corral people
[2:15:05.700 --> 2:15:07.700]  to convince them to persuade
[2:15:07.700 --> 2:15:09.700]  them to do things. Isn't that correct, Webster?
[2:15:09.700 --> 2:15:11.700]  Yes. In particular, though,
[2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:13.700]  there's also the emotional need.
[2:15:13.700 --> 2:15:15.700]  In other words, when somebody joins
[2:15:15.700 --> 2:15:17.700]  what amounts to a fascist mass
[2:15:17.700 --> 2:15:19.700]  movement or neo-fascist mass movement of the Obama
[2:15:19.700 --> 2:15:21.700]  type, they're doing this
[2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:23.700]  for the satisfaction of immediate emotional needs.
[2:15:23.700 --> 2:15:25.700]  In effect, they
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:27.700]  want to be duped.
[2:15:27.700 --> 2:15:29.700]  Part of it is the hatred for Bush
[2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:31.700]  Cheney and the neocons, which I can understand,
[2:15:31.700 --> 2:15:33.700]  which I, in some ways, I share,
[2:15:33.700 --> 2:15:35.700]  has blinded people, and that's where
[2:15:35.700 --> 2:15:37.700]  you have to part company. They've lost
[2:15:37.700 --> 2:15:39.700]  all criteria of judgment
[2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:41.700]  as long as you're something other than
[2:15:41.700 --> 2:15:43.700]  Bush Cheney. There's also this question
[2:15:43.700 --> 2:15:45.700]  of alienation.
[2:15:45.700 --> 2:15:47.700]  The previous caller mentioned Michelle Obama.
[2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:49.700]  The centerpiece of Michelle Obama's
[2:15:49.700 --> 2:15:51.700]  speeches during the primaries was
[2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:53.700]  this stuff about our souls are broken.
[2:15:53.700 --> 2:15:55.700]  We all have broken souls.
[2:15:55.700 --> 2:15:57.700]  We need the healing touch
[2:15:57.700 --> 2:15:59.700]  of the beatific
[2:15:59.700 --> 2:16:01.700]  personality, the one, the Messiah,
[2:16:01.700 --> 2:16:03.700]  the Mahdi, Barack Obama.
[2:16:03.700 --> 2:16:05.700]  There's a
[2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:07.700]  passage in mind comp by Hitler
[2:16:07.700 --> 2:16:09.700]  where he talks about the fact that if
[2:16:09.700 --> 2:16:11.700]  you're a worker and you're in your factory,
[2:16:11.700 --> 2:16:13.700]  you're living an alienated life
[2:16:13.700 --> 2:16:15.700]  where nothing really belongs to you
[2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:17.700]  emotionally, but if you go to
[2:16:17.700 --> 2:16:19.700]  a national socialist rally,
[2:16:19.700 --> 2:16:21.700]  then you feel fulfilled
[2:16:21.700 --> 2:16:23.700]  nationally, racially, and in all these
[2:16:23.700 --> 2:16:25.700]  other ways. And there's a very similar
[2:16:25.700 --> 2:16:27.700]  dynamic in these Obama mass
[2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:29.700]  meetings. The fact that he
[2:16:29.700 --> 2:16:31.700]  prefers stadiums,
[2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:33.700]  he prefers large crowds.
[2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:35.700]  Again, read mind comp. Hitler says
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:37.700]  the bigger the crowd,
[2:16:37.700 --> 2:16:39.700]  the more easy it is to control.
[2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:41.700]  The more people that are there,
[2:16:41.700 --> 2:16:43.700]  the more you can brainwash them.
[2:16:43.700 --> 2:16:45.700]  The more undifferentiated.
[2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:47.700]  In other words, what you want is the messy mass.
[2:16:47.700 --> 2:16:49.700]  Not people who are there as consumers
[2:16:49.700 --> 2:16:51.700]  or workers or housewives, but just
[2:16:51.700 --> 2:16:53.700]  the mass. And when you've got
[2:16:53.700 --> 2:16:55.700]  the mass, especially at night,
[2:16:55.700 --> 2:16:57.700]  he says, at night is better
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:16:59.700]  because people are more irrational.
[2:16:59.700 --> 2:17:01.700]  Then you can get them in the palm of your hand
[2:17:01.700 --> 2:17:03.700]  and you're not convincing them with arguments.
[2:17:03.700 --> 2:17:05.700]  You're convincing them with an emotional
[2:17:05.700 --> 2:17:07.700]  experience which is irrefutable.
[2:17:07.700 --> 2:17:09.700]  You know, like the hive-like mentality
[2:17:09.700 --> 2:17:11.700]  of being around all these things and just
[2:17:11.700 --> 2:17:13.700]  going with the flow. Yeah, but it's dangerous.
[2:17:13.700 --> 2:17:15.700]  In other words, when you get a mass movement
[2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:17.700]  of this sort under depression conditions,
[2:17:17.700 --> 2:17:19.700]  after all the tremendous damage
[2:17:19.700 --> 2:17:21.700]  done to the society by Bush and
[2:17:21.700 --> 2:17:23.700]  Cheney, this is where it gets really,
[2:17:23.700 --> 2:17:25.700]  really scary. What we need is some time
[2:17:25.700 --> 2:17:27.700]  to build an alternative. Right now,
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:29.700]  there's tremendous confusion.
[2:17:29.700 --> 2:17:31.700]  People say, oh, I want the Austrian
[2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:33.700]  school, I want the free market.
[2:17:33.700 --> 2:17:35.700]  This is impossible in a depression.
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:37.700]  I advocate return
[2:17:37.700 --> 2:17:39.700]  to New Deal methods. They work before
[2:17:39.700 --> 2:17:41.700]  they work now, but it's going to take a
[2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:43.700]  discussion process to get people to understand
[2:17:43.700 --> 2:17:45.700]  this, and they're also going to have to see
[2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:47.700]  in the course of this depression
[2:17:47.700 --> 2:17:49.700]  that a lot of that, the free market,
[2:17:49.700 --> 2:17:51.700]  Friedmanite, Von Hayek, Austrian
[2:17:51.700 --> 2:17:53.700]  school, simply doesn't work. But right now,
[2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:55.700]  the main thing is to stop Obama
[2:17:55.700 --> 2:17:57.700]  so that you have at least a breathing
[2:17:57.700 --> 2:17:59.700]  space to try to get some kind of an alternative
[2:17:59.700 --> 2:18:01.700]  together, which you don't have right now.
[2:18:01.700 --> 2:18:03.700]  Well, you were just talking about schools
[2:18:03.700 --> 2:18:05.700]  of philosophy, so I just got to ask you,
[2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:07.700]  have you seen the zeitgeist agenda yet?
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:09.700]  I'm not interested in this stuff because
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:11.700]  of this vulgar attack on religion,
[2:18:11.700 --> 2:18:13.700]  which I think is just useless
[2:18:13.700 --> 2:18:15.700]  and pointless.
[2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:17.700]  You've got to remember, the British intelligence
[2:18:17.700 --> 2:18:19.700]  is running a huge attack on Christianity
[2:18:19.700 --> 2:18:21.700]  with Christopher Hitchens
[2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:23.700]  with this awful Darwinian
[2:18:23.700 --> 2:18:25.700]  character Dawkins, an absolute
[2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:27.700]  reactionary imperialist.
[2:18:29.700 --> 2:18:31.700]  Well, there's some counter stuff out there too.
[2:18:31.700 --> 2:18:33.700]  Ben Stein just put out a movie called
[2:18:33.700 --> 2:18:35.700]  Expelled, the case for intelligent design
[2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:37.700]  where he takes Dawkins and others on pretty hard
[2:18:37.700 --> 2:18:39.700]  core. He talks about social Darwinism
[2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:41.700]  with the eugenics. Here's the problem.
[2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:43.700]  We live in a Leibnizian
[2:18:43.700 --> 2:18:45.700]  least action universe.
[2:18:45.700 --> 2:18:47.700]  The problem with Darwin
[2:18:47.700 --> 2:18:49.700]  and the problem with Malthus and anybody
[2:18:49.700 --> 2:18:51.700]  who follows them is that it assumes
[2:18:51.700 --> 2:18:53.700]  that the universe is entirely random
[2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:55.700]  and that it's a matter of
[2:18:55.700 --> 2:18:57.700]  indifference, whether there's development
[2:18:57.700 --> 2:18:59.700]  or higher energy states or whether there's
[2:18:59.700 --> 2:19:01.700]  not. Therefore, Darwin has to assume
[2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:03.700]  that all the
[2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:05.700]  progress in evolution, which undoubtedly
[2:19:05.700 --> 2:19:07.700]  is there, there's no doubt about evolution
[2:19:07.700 --> 2:19:09.700]  and the progress towards
[2:19:09.700 --> 2:19:11.700]  humanity from lower life forms,
[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:13.700]  that's all clear. But he says
[2:19:13.700 --> 2:19:15.700]  this is the blind watchmaker.
[2:19:15.700 --> 2:19:17.700]  This is all a matter of just
[2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:19.700]  chance interaction and it
[2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:21.700]  could happen or it could not happen. No,
[2:19:21.700 --> 2:19:23.700]  it's wrong. The Darwinian
[2:19:23.700 --> 2:19:25.700]  Malthusian universe is not the universe
[2:19:25.700 --> 2:19:27.700]  that you see. The universe that
[2:19:27.700 --> 2:19:29.700]  you see is a gut-fried Wilhelm Leibniz
[2:19:29.700 --> 2:19:31.700]  least action universe
[2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:33.700]  where there is, if you will,
[2:19:33.700 --> 2:19:35.700]  a built-in bias
[2:19:35.700 --> 2:19:37.700]  in the physical order of things in favor
[2:19:37.700 --> 2:19:39.700]  of development and higher energy states
[2:19:39.700 --> 2:19:41.700]  because that's what you see.
[2:19:41.700 --> 2:19:43.700]  Can you stay one more second with us?
[2:19:43.700 --> 2:19:45.700]  Can you stay one more second with us?
[2:19:45.700 --> 2:19:47.700]  Alright, thank you so much. We're going to be back after this
[2:19:47.700 --> 2:19:49.700]  with more calls. It's the Alex Jones show
[2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:51.700]  with infowars.com and

[2:20:25.700 --> 2:20:27.700]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:20:27.700 --> 2:20:29.700]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:20:29.700 --> 2:20:31.700]  Everyone is telling me now how much
[2:20:31.700 --> 2:20:33.700]  healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:20:33.700 --> 2:20:35.700]  healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body

[2:20:59.700 --> 2:21:01.700]  Today, unlike any other
[2:21:01.700 --> 2:21:03.700]  in the long course of American history,
[2:21:03.700 --> 2:21:05.700]  a terrorist act of war
[2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:07.700]  against this country.
[2:21:07.700 --> 2:21:09.700]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[2:21:09.700 --> 2:21:11.700]  But who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.700 --> 2:21:13.700]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:21:13.700 --> 2:21:15.700]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:15.700 --> 2:21:17.700]  We have to look to the Psalm of Bin Laden.
[2:21:17.700 --> 2:21:19.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11
[2:21:19.700 --> 2:21:21.700]  film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:21:21.700 --> 2:21:23.700]  ties to intelligence networks inside
[2:21:23.700 --> 2:21:25.700]  the United States. Some
[2:21:25.700 --> 2:21:27.700]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:29.700]  again very much engaged in spying
[2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:31.700]  in and on the US.
[2:21:31.700 --> 2:21:33.700]  I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:21:33.700 --> 2:21:35.700]  citizens have been detained.
[2:21:35.700 --> 2:21:37.700]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:39.700]  the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[2:21:39.700 --> 2:21:41.700]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:43.700]  intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:45.700]  the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:21:45.700 --> 2:21:47.700]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:22:05.700 --> 2:22:07.700]  The crowds, the countless hours in traffic,
