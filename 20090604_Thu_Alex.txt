[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:45.800]  we are live ladies and gentlemen have a very important transmission lined up for you today
[00:46.760 --> 00:53.960]  we have Philip Klein a filmmaker in studio he has made a film called begging for billionaires
[00:53.960 --> 01:02.440]  dealing with the new new London kilo decision of four years ago where wealthy companies and
[01:02.440 --> 01:10.280]  individuals openly can pay off local politicians to have them then take your property and basically
[01:10.280 --> 01:18.040]  give it to them and so we will really do a retrospective on what's happened the last four
[01:18.040 --> 01:25.880]  years since the new London kilo decision and the horrors that have transpired against property
[01:25.880 --> 01:32.280]  rights in this country then we have Richard gauge popping in for 30 minutes or so with a lot of big
[01:32.280 --> 01:36.920]  new developments in architecture engineers and scientists and peer-reviewed journals all over
[01:36.920 --> 01:48.120]  the world from the Netherlands to Japan from Denmark to the United States from Canada to Brazil
[01:48.840 --> 01:54.520]  looking at the evidence of thermite thermate in the World Trade Center's complex when the
[01:54.520 --> 02:04.280]  globalists bloom up via controlled demolition back in September 11 2001 and in Gerald Salente
[02:04.280 --> 02:12.360]  with his latest trends forecast on the economy joining us in the final hour today and taking
[02:12.360 --> 02:19.880]  your phone calls okay that said I have a lot of economic news I have a lot of police state news
[02:20.760 --> 02:28.040]  we have a federal judge ruling that telecoms can spy without warrants the complete
[02:28.040 --> 02:34.520]  end of the fourth amendment certified from congress and the courts just open tyranny and despotism
[02:34.520 --> 02:40.280]  the government is declaring itself at all levels rogue and completely despotic and criminal
[02:42.200 --> 02:46.600]  it is the bona fide tyranny the tyrannous maximus
[02:50.360 --> 02:55.320]  but all of that has to go to the back burners in this first hour today every month or so
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.720]  I run into a story where I wish to clear all the decks but I'm not going to cancel these
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.720]  three guests we have today because they're all very important very informative very important
[03:03.720 --> 03:10.840]  topics but I will tell you that I don't want to just come out of the gates and cover this
[03:10.840 --> 03:16.840]  because it doesn't give it enough import I have noticed that if I want something to get
[03:16.840 --> 03:21.400]  attention if I want it to break through into mainstream media if I want to make a mark on
[03:21.400 --> 03:27.480]  the psyche of the planet with my listeners I have to first get our wonderful dynamic intelligent
[03:28.280 --> 03:33.320]  incredibly influential audience who have driven thousands of major stories into the mainstream
[03:33.320 --> 03:40.760]  media with our angle our spin the establishment would say and I need you to blow through the
[03:40.760 --> 03:49.480]  gatekeepers I need you to blast them in the info war this is a prime directive in the fight against
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.440]  the new world order and I know you use whatever means necessary in the info war to get the information
[03:54.440 --> 04:03.480]  out and it ties into obama's visit to the middle east it ties into the latest fear mongering by
[04:03.480 --> 04:13.720]  the cia and the control corporate organs of this information it deals with glenn back it is a story
[04:13.720 --> 04:19.880]  up on info wars.com right now by Kurt Nemo I asked Kurt Nemo last night to do a story on this I asked
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.000]  Steve Watson to do a story on this and he's finished up in one story and doing another today on this
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.320]  because I want to get his perspective and angle on it which you're all different than slightly
[04:29.320 --> 04:34.040]  different than mine or Kurt Nemo's because covering this tyranny you know it's all through the eye of
[04:34.040 --> 04:45.480]  the beholder the staggering level of duplicity and deception and evil but um Howard glenn back
[04:45.480 --> 04:52.760]  the DHS reports saying gun owners and veterans are terrorist uh some have been laden's latest
[04:52.760 --> 04:58.680]  fake speech from the grave obama's visit to the middle east how do they all tie together we'll

[09:05.560 --> 09:10.840]  private property anytime they want any way they want and the supreme court ruled you've got a
[09:10.840 --> 09:17.160]  second amendment but it's open to the federal government and states to interpret what that
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.240]  second amendment is including complete bans so it literally states you have a right to
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.920]  hand all your firearms in you gotta love these lawyers they go yeah you got a right to uh
[09:30.920 --> 09:35.640]  keeping bare arms we have a right to ban them the right means you hand them over
[09:37.480 --> 09:43.800]  you have a right to be slapped upside the head repeatedly and drug by your hair often to the
[09:43.800 --> 09:46.440]  night to be raped by the new oral order that's what it comes down to
[09:46.440 --> 09:58.360]  i saw this yesterday when it was first in the washington times one of the official
[09:59.880 --> 10:06.040]  organs of cia disinformation i mean they had have it been on record that they put out this info
[10:06.040 --> 10:12.680]  for the federal government so does the new york times with fake yellow cake uranium from niger
[10:12.680 --> 10:23.240]  to iraq and uh fake stories about aluminum tubes and nuclear purification centrifuges that are
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.520]  complexes that are the size of a hundred football fields they claim were buried under
[10:28.520 --> 10:37.160]  rose bushes in iraq mobile weapons trucks supposedly for producing anthrax that they
[10:37.160 --> 10:46.600]  knew day one from jane's weapons dictionary or british mobile trucks for pumping up hydrogen
[10:48.200 --> 10:57.080]  surveillance balloons to direct artillery it's a world war one era technology for directing
[10:57.080 --> 11:03.000]  artillery in the iran iraq war sold to them by the british with us funding they said those were
[11:03.000 --> 11:14.920]  anthrax trucks that's how dumb they think the public is they openly show the world four hydrogen
[11:14.920 --> 11:21.240]  trucks for pumping up hydrogen balloons they've got make model serial number every military on
[11:21.240 --> 11:27.480]  earth instantly knows what they are the united states has these but uses helium because we
[11:27.480 --> 11:35.800]  have some of the only helium mines in the united states but i digress off into uh
[11:38.040 --> 11:39.240]  issues that really don't matter
[11:42.520 --> 11:48.680]  they've been striking helium in east texas very interesting on one of the ranches nearby ours
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.920]  i wish they'd strike helium on our property our problems will be over very quickly wouldn't they
[11:52.920 --> 12:00.200]  the point is i digress ladies and gentlemen
[12:05.320 --> 12:11.640]  they think you're idiots and and i wouldn't call people idiots are even stupid people are
[12:11.640 --> 12:17.880]  distracted they are knowledgeable about hot rods men are knowledgeable about bud wiser and tattoos
[12:17.880 --> 12:21.800]  and acting tough and i'm not saying if you drink bud wiser or have tattoos you're bad i'm saying
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.640]  that's what people are knowledgeable in they're knowledgeable in surfing or they're knowledgeable
[12:25.640 --> 12:28.840]  in skateboards or they're knowledgeable in football or they're knowledgeable in their
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.440]  particular business if it's selling carpet and tile or use cars or if you're a doctor
[12:34.440 --> 12:40.200]  you're knowledgeable in your specialty but all your extra time is golfing and
[12:42.840 --> 12:49.400]  parasailing who knows but people have almost no knowledge of how the world works or say
[12:49.400 --> 12:56.040]  the muslim factions seventy nine percent sunni
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.040]  nineteen percent Shiite and the other two percent are different groups of
[13:07.720 --> 13:09.640]  splinter organizations from islam
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.920]  and they know that the public doesn't know they just think of a muslim as somebody with
[13:18.920 --> 13:27.240]  dark skin wearing a turban or a headdress they don't even know they're muslims in indonesia
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.160]  they don't even know they're muslims in china they don't even know that they're muslims in
[13:31.160 --> 13:36.840]  latin america they don't know anything about islam they have no idea i've seen a lot of people
[13:36.840 --> 13:45.960]  that think islam predates judaism and christianity which it doesn't they have no idea about anything
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.800]  and so the media can sit up there and say iran is funding al qaeda really
[13:55.080 --> 14:02.920]  al qaeda is sunni wahabi to be specific out of saudi arabia it is the branch of islam
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.600]  that says you don't have to have a genetic relation to the prophet muhammad or his family
[14:08.600 --> 14:19.560]  to be a religious leader that is the majority group 79 percent and they hate the shiites
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.680]  and the shiites hate them a lot more than they even hate jews or christians on average
[14:27.560 --> 14:34.760]  and so the media has the nerve to get up on tv and radio and the print and say iran is al qaeda
[14:34.760 --> 14:42.200]  and funding al qaeda that's like saying superman is lex luther the average america but no that's
[14:42.200 --> 14:49.480]  ridiculous everybody knows lex luther is the arch nemesis the leader of the legion of doom against
[14:49.480 --> 14:56.760]  superman or jurrell from the planet crepton you know all about that fairy tale and you know that
[14:56.760 --> 15:11.160]  lex luther is not superman now to the arabs and to the muslims it is as ridiculous to see our news
[15:11.160 --> 15:18.120]  which they watch and to read our newspapers which they read and to see them saying that iran is al qaeda
[15:18.120 --> 15:27.880]  on top of it sighers reported four years ago we reported five years ago now mainstream news
[15:27.880 --> 15:31.960]  the last two years is reported the white house a year and a half ago the bush white house put out
[15:31.960 --> 15:39.000]  a the huge news is coming i want to build up to this put out a press release on white house
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.920]  dot gov and i covered it on air at nauseam you can go pull it up saying yes we're funding
[15:44.920 --> 15:54.040]  four freedom fighting organizations out of iraq to fight iran in iran and to destabilize and
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.280]  overthrow the country and israel's put out press releases saying the same thing over and over again
[15:58.840 --> 16:04.600]  and who do you think the four groups are well one of them's Kurdish but the other three are
[16:04.600 --> 16:11.000]  wahhabi is funded out of Saudi Arabia the u.s allies who do you expect the wahhabi is are the army
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.800]  of the new world order ladies and gentlemen al qaeda is the army of the new world order
[16:15.800 --> 16:23.000]  everywhere you go they are the strike force they are the people the cia sins in that mosad sins in
[16:23.560 --> 16:30.200]  they are the people they are the sword of the new world order and and that's why
[16:30.200 --> 16:40.600]  iraq is saying obama bowed to the saudi king and that's why i have the headline here from the
[16:40.600 --> 16:47.480]  washington post obama sought saudi king's advice before kairos speech prostrating himself before
[16:47.480 --> 16:54.040]  him again because there was an alliance made you know the movie laurence of arabia it's a true story
[16:54.040 --> 17:02.200]  watch it with peter otul watch it those tribes he's giving machine guns and granados to hang
[17:02.200 --> 17:12.280]  grenades to that is the house of sod one little tribal fiefdom dutchie that made an alliance with
[17:12.280 --> 17:18.040]  england and that's why they weren't given saudi arabia and that's why the british tried to give
[17:18.040 --> 17:21.720]  them iraq and that's why they've given them the whole of the middle east and that's why they
[17:21.720 --> 17:27.960]  they overthrew iran using them and that's why they started a war with the russians in 79 on
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.520]  record brazinski's written a book about it bragging to classify but you can go to him
[17:32.520 --> 17:39.000]  himself admitting it the russians invade to stop the attack on the other stands to the north of
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.240]  afghanistan they use al qaeda to attack serbia as a pretext to then say oh look the serbs are
[17:45.240 --> 17:53.240]  killing innocent muslims and go in they use al qaeda everywhere they use al qaeda in chechnya
[17:53.240 --> 18:00.840]  against russia it's just a fact it's like they use pole pot to kill 30 of the population
[18:03.800 --> 18:14.360]  of cambodia and brazinski brags about that these are murdering criminals sunni islam works for the
[18:14.360 --> 18:22.360]  new world order now 99.9 percent of sunni muslims are not terrorist or not out attacking anybody
[18:24.120 --> 18:30.360]  and i respect their religion and their culture and i'm not saying that sunni islam itself
[18:30.920 --> 18:38.760]  works for the new world order i'm stating a fact that radical sunni extremism is the sword of the
[18:38.760 --> 18:44.600]  british us and israeli empire and it is a fact and i will state it here on record
[18:47.400 --> 18:53.240]  just like haritz and jurislam post and upi and ap have all reported
[18:54.600 --> 18:59.640]  and it's in my film roda tyranny you can just search engine the headline
[18:59.640 --> 19:09.800]  israel created hamash israel brags and they said oh yes is a counterbalance to who to who
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.080]  hezbollah hezbollah sheite i ran
[19:19.720 --> 19:24.520]  now there's your fact ladies and gentlemen and no one will talk about this no one will
[19:24.520 --> 19:32.440]  put the pieces together that are admitted on record why and the sheites are not innocent
[19:33.400 --> 19:40.280]  as well member iran contra the weapons to the iranians this is a very dark and devious game

[24:36.200 --> 24:40.200]  the intrigues of the king's court he studied the Byzantine empire

[25:12.840 --> 25:20.200]  of germany leadership of japan they are all what you would call evil they are all ruthless they
[25:20.200 --> 25:26.280]  are all about being top dog and using deception and subterfuge to maintain power and they need
[25:26.280 --> 25:31.800]  wars with each other to dominate and control their internal populations so more often than not
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.280]  they stage these conflicts at a certain level with each other there is enmity there is hatred
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.360]  there are occasional true overthrows and coups but if you look at the hundreds of wars between the
[25:44.360 --> 25:51.480]  French and their the Norse French and their Norse cousins the British which were Germanic
[25:51.480 --> 26:01.960]  themselves foreign monarchs so it was really when the Germans 270 years ago took England back over
[26:01.960 --> 26:07.960]  with a purely German dynasty it was only a Germanic rulers coming coming back home
[26:10.360 --> 26:19.560]  and they had endless endless wars with the French and every time the French got in trouble
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.320]  politically and needed a distraction needed to be able to raise taxes and get away with it
[26:23.880 --> 26:30.040]  every time the city of Paris was in danger of falling to the little barianese around it
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.560]  they would start a new war with England and there are famous letters in fact i want to do
[26:35.560 --> 26:39.960]  a film and mention this and show some of the famous letters where they would talk about
[26:39.960 --> 26:46.280]  ah cousin i'm having problems here i think it's time for a war and they would have five year 10
[26:46.280 --> 26:55.160]  year 20 year 30 year 40 year 100 year wars to consolidate control over their own populations
[26:56.680 --> 27:00.200]  it's a big game they play with people's lives
[27:02.920 --> 27:10.680]  you know that famous line in Braveheart which may not be historical in that film but there are
[27:10.680 --> 27:18.200]  many historical examples of where the king orders his men long shanks to fire into the ranks
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.000]  of both his soldiers and the scots and they say but we'll hit our own men but yes we'll hit some of
[27:23.000 --> 27:34.680]  theirs as well this is the at the attitude this is the mindset this is the system and so you have
[27:34.680 --> 27:46.360]  the Sunnis the wahhabis all the subgroups of islam originating out of its birthplace Saudi Arabia
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.960]  it is the majority of islam 79 to 80 depending on which encyclopedia of religion you look at
[27:53.960 --> 28:03.720]  it they are tools of british intelligence and they are always used they were used in 53 to overthrow
[28:07.480 --> 28:10.360]  the secular president Muhammad mozadak
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.320]  they were used to attack the russians they were used to attack the serbs they have been
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.760]  used over and over again they were used to take the blame of of attacking the american people
[28:22.760 --> 28:29.880]  so that the Saudis enemies iraq and iran could then be attacked by the united states
[28:33.160 --> 28:35.880]  see how that works the israelis and the Saudis
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.080]  get the united states to attack their enemies is that the smart way
[28:43.080 --> 28:52.280]  to take the chinese fighting fish the smartest fighting fish if there is more than
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.120]  more than two one will sit off normally the dominant one will sit off and wait while the
[28:58.120 --> 29:05.000]  weaker two weaken each other and when one is dead the survivor will then have to face the fresh
[29:05.000 --> 29:12.920]  more intelligent fighting fish i mean this is elementary chess this isn't even chess this is
[29:12.920 --> 29:20.680]  checkers can the american people can the british people can the iranian people can the people of

[38:11.720 --> 38:16.920]  i was listening to rush limbaugh 19 years ago i was listening to rush limbaugh when i was a
[38:16.920 --> 38:22.360]  senior in high school one of the first places he got syndicated to was austin texas in dallas
[38:22.360 --> 38:28.120]  and i could listen to him on two different stations and he was different it was all about
[38:28.120 --> 38:35.560]  the second amendment and socialism and corruption and i i watched limbaugh morph into what he is
[38:35.560 --> 38:42.840]  today and he really is a shameful egomaniac whose minds partially rotted from a synthetic heroin
[38:42.840 --> 38:47.640]  known as oxy cotton and he's a horrible hypocrite who says put people in jail for their first time
[38:47.640 --> 38:53.400]  with cocaine but don't put him in jail doctor shopping and taking 100 oxy cottons a day but
[38:53.400 --> 39:02.040]  he's a sad person i hear him on air slip in anti new world water stuff occasionally i hear him
[39:02.040 --> 39:07.480]  tell the truth sometimes i hear him going to the edge i i i have discernment i have research i
[39:07.480 --> 39:14.200]  have history i can tell that at his core limbaugh is not a bad person same thing with michael
[39:14.200 --> 39:19.800]  savage michael savage i agree with about 80 of what he has to say i don't agree with putting
[39:19.800 --> 39:24.440]  people that disagree with the war in fema camps and then quote because we don't want to pay for
[39:24.440 --> 39:30.840]  them making them work force labor camps and then bitching and moaning when the now disgrace

[39:44.680 --> 39:49.720]  to restrict his free speech now i still defended his free speech because we all hang together
[39:49.720 --> 39:56.280]  or we hang separate but i can listen to savage and i can tell you that guy believes what he's saying
[39:57.720 --> 40:04.680]  and he's an ideologue so you can respect someone who is real
[40:04.680 --> 40:14.600]  but i don't respect con artists i do not respect shysters and slime balls i do not

[42:44.120 --> 42:53.720]  about iran funding al qaeda to attack the united states but that isn't even the news that isn't
[42:53.720 --> 43:04.520]  even the big issue i'm about to cover i um before i went to sports you know i've been on 98 now
[43:04.520 --> 43:10.920]  before it went spanish and 1260 before it went sports and i'm on 590 it's been talk radio since
[43:10.920 --> 43:20.440]  the 60s hopefully they won't change formats that'll never happen hopefully but but but the issue is
[43:20.440 --> 43:31.400]  i remember hearing back oh eight years ago seems like yesterday but but seven eight years ago on
[43:31.400 --> 43:40.840]  1260 when he was first being syndicated and i'm they didn't just carry my show rearing it at night
[43:40.840 --> 43:50.280]  i would go in and fill in sometimes for uh paul prior cactus prior son who did a show there
[43:50.280 --> 44:01.960]  and so i would listen to this guy and i thought man that guy's disingenuous man
[44:01.960 --> 44:06.840]  that guy's a fake and he would admit back then i'm an entertainer i'm an actor he did great
[44:06.840 --> 44:11.560]  readers of war of the worlds you know he does great radio theater the guy's talented
[44:15.320 --> 44:19.960]  so understand when i criticized glenn beck you know what shocked me was when he came out and
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.760]  said ron paul supporters should be arrested they're really timothy mcvay's ron paul's
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.680]  dangerous he's bad and i came on air and criticized him a year and a half ago i got a lot of mean
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.760]  emails and calls saying you're just jealous of glenn beck and i'm like no he's following a talking
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.320]  point that i see o'reilly and hannity and everybody else following saying militias are
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.720]  terrorists and work with al qaeda and they're gonna attack us and i said don't you understand
[44:45.720 --> 44:54.040]  that's a talking point and that went on and on
[45:00.280 --> 45:04.760]  and then i told people four or five months ago i said glenn beck every day says he's
[45:04.760 --> 45:08.840]  gonna cover this fema thing hyping it and that he thinks they're real i said you watch he's
[45:08.840 --> 45:15.640]  gonna say they're fake and i called a month beforehand what his program would be and exactly
[45:15.640 --> 45:20.520]  what fake camps he would cover because i identified these 12 13 years ago on air
[45:21.080 --> 45:29.240]  linda thompson's baloney about railway stations and track depots and it was exactly what i said
[45:29.240 --> 45:34.520]  but even worse with popular mechanics herce publishing the fathers of yellow journalism
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.360]  literally in the encyclopedia next to their name is yellow journalism you know the joke of next to
[45:40.360 --> 45:44.520]  ugly in the dictionary is a picture of you well next to yellow journalism there's a picture of
[45:44.520 --> 45:54.040]  popular mechanics literally and so it was worse than i said but exactly what i said to a point
[45:54.040 --> 46:01.000]  and then and then some i mean i know the mind of this guy i know the enemy i know their playbooks
[46:01.560 --> 46:09.560]  and let me tell you glenn beck is a actual cia officer he's that or he's a defense intel or
[46:09.560 --> 46:17.240]  something else i mean that guy he is an officer he holds rank guaranteed no doubt it's like or
[46:17.960 --> 46:24.520]  george arwell held rank in bbc is a wartime propagandas he'd been a member of the secret
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.840]  police before that in india and that's how he woke up to the whole thing and of course he found out
[46:28.840 --> 46:34.840]  while he was there that the british had been funding hitler and stalling the entire time that's why he
[46:34.840 --> 46:39.320]  wrote 1984 and hit out while he did it and they clearly killed eric blair known as george arwell
[46:41.640 --> 46:47.080]  that's a glenn beck that decided to tell the truth his name is eric blair you know him as george arwell
[46:51.560 --> 46:57.560]  there is no doubt glenn beck i'm calling you out just like when general tommy franks was
[46:57.560 --> 47:03.000]  saying the exact same words as jacar fissionado and cnn and fox and and good morning america that
[47:03.000 --> 47:11.240]  gee i'm real sad that america is going to have to get rid of the bill rights and constitution
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.240]  but it's what the people want it's the only thing that'll keep us safe that's a lie saying the people
[47:15.240 --> 47:20.520]  want it putting it out there like oh gee i'm sorry this is what we got to do and it was we got to
[47:20.520 --> 47:25.320]  have marshal law in america and i said that guy's on pentagon payroll after he left the pentagon
[47:25.320 --> 47:29.480]  like all these other former generals which they now have declassified and admitted they got weird
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.720]  tapes with the top five retired generals saying with rumsfeld we need another nine eleven should
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.280]  we have one i mean they're basically saying yeah they're even in on it i mean this is incredible
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.200]  and i said that guy's on payroll like billions of dollars you know of other cash that goes to
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.520]  other media people and then it came out he was paid five hundred thousand dollars in that year alone
[47:50.520 --> 47:57.560]  to go give a couple dozen talks on tv and to print saying marshal law is what we need
[47:57.560 --> 48:03.160]  for five hundred thousand dollars tommy frank's destroyed his name forever
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.040]  that's i mean that's buying somebody cheap benedict arnold well i'm calling you out glen back
[48:10.040 --> 48:17.000]  you got 40 plus million dollars to do what you're doing and you are a travesty and a shame
[48:21.320 --> 48:25.000]  again i don't do this i ignore other talks you'll host i move forward this guy is so
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.120]  dangerous and i've called him every step of the way he says ron paul people are mcvay terrorists
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.240]  that need to have the quote army used against him he comes out and says none of the fema cams exist
[48:35.240 --> 48:41.720]  and does it a straw man debunking exactly as i told you and remember i can't stand watching him it
[48:41.720 --> 48:47.160]  hurts my guts to see something this phony this fake this bad it because it's it's it's it's anti
[48:47.160 --> 48:56.840]  matter to me this is kryptonite alex jones the green stuff i mean i can't hardly look at him
[48:56.840 --> 49:03.720]  this guy literally is one of the most evil people i've ever seen he's right up there with rumsfeld
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.840]  just a oh he revels it's a psychopathic enjoyment there's a lot of cold-blooded globalists that
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.680]  do what they do because they've they're on the team they're on they've thrown in there a lot
[49:12.680 --> 49:16.600]  they've decided to sell their soul they know their family's in danger if they ever join us
[49:16.600 --> 49:22.680]  so they just bite your tongue bite the bullet and do it not bet he revels in it like a george
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.560]  soros he revels in it rush limbaugh does not revel in what he does
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.480]  except when he particularly drugged out like he was during that speech and clearly the guy's
[49:35.480 --> 49:40.280]  bombed out of his mind anybody who's you know seen drug addicts can tell that guy's in a narcotic
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.280]  delirium when he gave his republican speech a few months ago poor guy he's already gone
[49:46.280 --> 49:54.280]  deaf from the stuff but the issue is he is not a he is not reveling in the evil he's not just
[49:54.280 --> 50:00.840]  just loving it loving the disinformation it's the same thing with oberman he's a democratic hack and
[50:00.840 --> 50:05.320]  but you kind of people that know oberman and i can watch him i can tell he he at least believes
[50:05.320 --> 50:12.120]  most of his baloney and he's come out and attacked obama now and then been slapped down for it about
[50:12.120 --> 50:21.560]  secret arrest and things like that he's got some soul left when the system lets them on air because
[50:21.560 --> 50:26.360]  they know if they don't show some reality they'll lose all credibility but when we get back the
[50:26.360 --> 50:33.320]  latest outrage by glenn beck he is coming out and going along with the dhs report that basically all
[50:33.320 --> 50:38.920]  conservatives and gun owners are with al qaeda and i told you he was going to do this and he's
[50:38.920 --> 50:44.840]  going to do more and more of it he has to get your confidence first he's got to get in he's got an
[50:44.840 --> 50:51.640]  infiltrate let's use a modern pop culture analysis he's a terminator he's got skin on the outside he

[54:20.040 --> 54:25.720]  reason i don't like beck is because he's dangerous to the republic back before they know they can't
[54:25.720 --> 54:33.480]  beat it so they're trying to join us and take us over and it's so obvious but he suckers in
[54:33.480 --> 54:41.720]  he takes in the american people what's happening is the population is awakening
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.320]  for the new world order the global government and so he can come out and cover that and talk
[54:47.320 --> 54:51.000]  about that and talk about the new global currency in the new world order but then
[54:51.000 --> 54:58.280]  then he parrots the exact obama administration slash george w bush administration line
[55:01.160 --> 55:07.240]  about how american militias he then ties those to white supremacist to then demonize the second
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.960]  amendment just as the dhs reports have done for over a decade
[55:14.760 --> 55:20.120]  and he then ties that to al qaeda and this is what he's been doing for years more boldly
[55:20.120 --> 55:23.640]  than anybody else so he his symbol is the unite or die
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.680]  revolutionary flag of the snake cut up in parts with the 13 colonies and he says we
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.640]  got to fight the new world order and then the way we fight the new world order is we arrest
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.080]  everybody who's basically a gun owner because that's what the dhs report says it's saying veterans
[55:41.080 --> 55:46.360]  they're going to come home and bomb all our cities gun owners you know they're dangerous people buying
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.880]  guns with the number one terror threat in america they're going to join up with al qaeda and here's the
[55:51.880 --> 56:01.800]  key i analyzed and analyzed why did they have al husaini hussein and all these other iraqis these
[56:01.800 --> 56:07.160]  3000 george bush brought in 2000 bill clinton brought in george bush senior after the war and
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.320]  then bill clinton why did they put them in black ops why did they put them in us cities everywhere
[56:11.320 --> 56:16.040]  they're trafficking and different things why were they with mcvay on the surveillance tapes
[56:16.040 --> 56:20.680]  fbi agents told the la times that why were there iraqis why were they working for us
[56:20.680 --> 56:24.760]  intelligence and i should i analyze it and i thought about it and i made a film wrote a
[56:24.760 --> 56:34.360]  tyranny about it and i said down the road they want to claim that militias work with muslim extremists
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.440]  and so they've planted this story and have these surveillance tapes to later use this if
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.760]  they need to and launch these arab sleeper cells which really work for the globalist
[56:48.360 --> 56:52.600]  and then also fit in with 93 and it fit in with some other operations and now i'm more sure than
[56:52.600 --> 56:59.160]  ever how many years have i told you that when they try to link up muslim extremists with the
[56:59.160 --> 57:05.720]  domestic patriot movement and tie it to oklahoma city that that's the green light that they're
[57:05.720 --> 57:11.640]  getting ready to go after american gun owners they're real enemy they're going to say we're all al-qaeda
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.480]  and every piece i mean i already knew what they were going to already knew their plan but when
[57:21.480 --> 57:29.800]  it's confirmed when it happens when the research and the revelations then come true the horror
[57:29.800 --> 57:36.680]  intensifies and beck is in the key cockpit manipulating all these levers the judas goat
[57:36.680 --> 57:47.240]  to lead us into the slaughter he is the judas oscarion and he is a vomitus venomous viper in
[57:47.240 --> 57:56.280]  our bosom we have a guest coming up but when the guest leaves us i'm i'm gonna spend more time in
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.200]  the third hour on this because gaige is only with us about 20 30 minutes because i want to play the
[58:00.200 --> 58:07.400]  fox news clip i want to go over it words cannot describe how treacherous and treacherous this
[58:07.400 --> 58:16.120]  is he goes i keep warning you about the unholy alliance of the malicious and al-qaeda and now

[58:21.880 --> 58:27.800]  about america and he's sitting there he starts doing a fake crying and then he laughs the son of a

[1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:31.880]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:39.240]  so glenn bat comes out a year and a half ago and says basically the ron paul movement works
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:44.520]  with al qaeda and mcvay and is going to attack us and kill us and want to blow up america and
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:50.360]  those are basically quotes i'm paraphrasing but he said all that word for word we played the
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:01:00.360]  clips there many times and that's when i really noticed that i go my gosh this guy's following
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:05.000]  the exact script that i predicted would come out when they're ready to make their big move
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:10.600]  and then he would mix that in with his anti-new world order stuff but never really telling you
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:18.280]  who runs it or the full scope and they're forced to do this now because we're becoming the majority
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:22.440]  and then he comes out and says the femacamps aren't real we're saying they were real and
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.680]  he does all this other and i'm not even really watching him or tracking him but i had a bad
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:31.560]  feeling last night when i saw the washington times exclusive al qaeda eyes bio attack from
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.560]  mexico says they're working with the u.s militia and they tie that to white supremacist
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:43.720]  and i googled and there was back sure enough last night right on cue with it already and set up
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:50.120]  saying i've been warning you the militias and the gun owners are with al qaeda he's following
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.000]  the exact department of homeland security report you notice when he covered the dhs reports that
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.200]  we broke he would say well i mean is this a little bit of an exaggeration he had one of the guys
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:04.200]  from pennantel are on and he agreed with part of it disagree with part and said well the people
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:13.960]  are dangerous so you see he shows you who he is and he's so what is it about someone so disingenuous
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:16.040]  can sell the blind
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:22.760]  so he's really bad news let's go ahead and play part of this clip and we got a guest
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.200]  coming up i'm gonna get more into this later but it's a big big deal because it ties into
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.440]  the stuff of two years ago when they came out and said why al qaeda here's a training video
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:34.680]  of them preparing to attack america they showed white guys and then later they admitted oh that
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:40.120]  was a british training seminar for british special forces with british officers dressed up like al
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:48.920]  qaeda just like they use the video of mohammed adda confessing to attacking 9 11 you know weeks
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.240]  before in afghanistan and they later admit oh it's a computer morphing for a british tv show
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:58.360]  they think you're so dumb they show you computer morphing like forest gump shaking hands with
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:06.200]  jfk it's not real i assure you you know slimer and ghostbusters flying around isn't real either
[1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:12.520]  they show you fake computer morph and say it's real that's how dumb they think you are and then
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:17.720]  they have beck who's going to lead the 9 12 movement remember how you felt right after 9 11 you would
[1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:22.360]  torture children you would go along with police state you would waive all your rights well i
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:29.160]  glenn beck will bring back that spirit as he fights the new world order by pushing their entire agenda
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:34.040]  that's like wrapping a cyanide pill with a jelly bean taking a little cyanide pill and
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:38.200]  sticking it in a jelly bean and giving it a little kid that's what glenn beck is he is a
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:45.480]  candy coated cyanide tablet he admits he's cyanide to liberty and freedom
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.560]  and he laughs at you in your face go ahead and play the first minute of the club

[1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:46.600]  rights in america and for those that don't know this isn't just imminent domain they now
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:52.280]  on the supreme court ruling can say if a private interest can lobby and pay money to state and
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.920]  local governments open bribes bribes are legal for the supreme court and that they can then
[1:08:56.920 --> 1:09:01.880]  take your property and in many cases if you refuse to sell they don't just take it they then charge
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:08.760]  you attorney bills so you're paying to have your land stolen and under taxpayer property
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:13.080]  owner bill of rights in texas we've all my family gotten letters from the state saying

[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:22.600]  or build something on it you got a few months uh to accept our deal or we'll just basically take
[1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:30.280]  it this is the new america and uh he is the official selection for quite a few big film
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:35.880]  festivals minneapolis st paul uh best of the festival international film festival official
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:42.600]  selection uh texan dance film festival selected for uh the new bronfils big film festival to be
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:49.240]  their main film coming up uh in a few days and so we're joined by philip kline uh here in studio
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:53.160]  we're going to play a trailer for those listening on the radio you'll be able to see it at prison
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:58.840]  planet dot tv we are sambal casting right now at prison planet dot tv uh mr kline thanks for
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:05.080]  coming in thank you and alex for having me it's uh good to have you here so so tell the listeners
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:09.160]  uh a little bit about how you made this film why you got involved in about the film itself well
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:14.280]  i got involved with this film because a good friend of mine uh was losing his property for the
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:20.200]  second time i mean they he's gone through about 40 years of threats of imminent domain and this one
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:28.520]  was really threat was real and i decided being a filmmaker decided to document his process and his
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:35.320]  struggle trying to keep his property we also had five other families both in uh sugar creek uh
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:44.200]  and st louis arnold missouri and um and some another couple areas and we spent four years
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:51.400]  following their struggle and their anguish and their story and i think that's very important
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:58.680]  for people to see their story and actually see the the turmoil of their losing their property
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:03.000]  they're losing their memories you know it's not just about the brick and mortar it's about the
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.840]  memories and the things in the house well it was stolen evil genius that he was that said
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:15.800]  uh you know one death is a tragedy 10 000 deaths is a statistic so by going in and personalizing
[1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:20.840]  i've done that on the radio but not like film can do these families in new london a connecticut of
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:27.000]  you know as an example uh they would uh have lived there three four generations nice homes
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.320]  waterfront and they'd say we don't want to sell and they would just come force and take it this
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:37.240]  was for private interest well what's interesting was up at the uh saint louis at st paul um
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:42.040]  minneapolis film festival we know we had a a discussion afterwards and we had one of the
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:47.960]  guys from the institute of justice and he said after four years that property is just a big empty
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:53.640]  lot of weeds and broken buildings they haven't built anything the development basically never
[1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:58.440]  materialized they just wanted it yeah and they tore down all those homes and businesses
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:04.120]  and sitting empty and this happened in canada city with the glover plan it's said for eight years
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.320]  they tore down all the homes and businesses until we threatened to turn them in for bond fraud
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:14.040]  because they were using this bond money and i haven't seen your film you know it's gotten
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:20.360]  rave reviews i've been so busy just came in a few days ago but uh we interviewed gore seafood down
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:26.280]  in texas there since world war two fifteen million dollar profit a year and the air to mobile wanted
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.800]  it for a yacht parking lot and was trying to take it last time i talked to him i mean this is crazy
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:38.520]  yeah it's crazy what what's interesting about the documentary is we went in and we exposed
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:45.720]  the collusion between the developers and the politicians and uh and their little back room
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:54.040]  deals and all and basically what it is is the politicians basically would developers would
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:59.960]  come to the politicians and saying we want a certain block or 10 blocks or whatever it is
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:04.360]  which they've cruised around neighborhoods especially where they're really targeting
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:10.760]  is low income areas because they can't fight back yeah uh minority areas but they're but
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:14.520]  they're they've kind of run through a lot of those snacks though they're even going after
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:21.160]  wealthy people now yeah and and uh which is interesting is that the politicians basically
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:27.480]  have a sign on their front lawn we can be bought you know and for those that don't know the supreme
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:34.680]  court uh a ruling uh said that they said you people can give money politically to counties and cities
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:40.280]  and and states to have them take other people's property and in the case of new london connecticut
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:45.320]  if you fight it they then don't just take your property and condemn it with no money they then
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:51.240]  charge you lawyer bills for you fighting it i mean this is a people got mad in the us thinking
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:57.000]  they were just taking it for eminent domain they didn't know that this is this is where they rob
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.960]  you and then you've got to pay a fine to them because they robbed you kind of like when monsanto
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:06.200]  their their genetics gets into your crops you can prove you didn't steal their seeds
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:11.240]  then they contaminated you but they own the st louis federal court and so that's the one
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:15.960]  court nationwide it goes to and so they always rule for them they contaminate you and then
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:20.680]  it's and then you've got to pay them for being contaminated but it's interesting if you don't
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:26.920]  want to move and a good example is daryl penner what they did to penner is they turned off his
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:31.880]  electricity which is illegal tell folks where he was located tell them the background that he was
[1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:40.200]  he was on main since the early 1940s this is like the second generation of a tuxedo rental place
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:46.200]  and what's funny about it is the same politicians that took his property rent tuxedos from him
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:53.560]  because it's right down from city hall and um they turned off his electricity his power
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:59.640]  they put a fence around his property and then they finally to force him out blocked off the street
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:05.960]  cutting off his customers coming so he had no choice to move and i mean that's terrorism yeah
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:11.800]  and they use oh by the way they also use code enforcement with police to come in and terrorize
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:17.160]  them oh no in austin they have special code enforcing cops they're like kept minions and of course
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:21.160]  you've seen this around the country and we always found that the hospitals have a database it goes
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:25.960]  to the health department then they seed this out when an old man has cancer had a heart attack
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:33.000]  and uh they profile them $2,000 a day fines roland ellison for three inch grass and the neighbors
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.720]  next door could have four inch grass they didn't care the cops would come and fine him and then
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:42.760]  if he smarted off they would arrest him i mean how do they get that is so evil it's interesting that
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:48.200]  you brought that up because in the documentary we went around to all these politicians a tool
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:54.520]  that they use is called blight now it's a very effective tool that they use they did that here
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:57.720]  but i wouldn't show their houses were worse than the houses they were taking it's interesting when
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:02.840]  we took the camera and we found out being an activist the camera and i'll tell the audience
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:08.040]  this is the most powerful weapon you have the politicians can't stand it's like a cross to
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:14.280]  November yeah so we went in and interviewed these politicians and not one of us could tell us
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:22.760]  what the definition of blight was they gave us these half truth half question uh explanation
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:28.600]  they never let you pin them down yeah exactly they couldn't pin as pin them down to what blight
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:36.360]  really meant and and this is a tool they use it could be a gunner off newspapers on your driveway
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:43.240]  your grass too high or maybe some of your i have seen them saying two planners and an old lady's
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:50.040]  backyard that had no plants in them just having that was blight wow i've seen an old doghouse be
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:56.280]  blight i've seen a creek 20 yards off the property line blocked up with brush that's blight and that
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:00.520]  was my grandparents they said you we're going to give you $2,000 a day fines in austin till you
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:05.880]  clean that out and my grandpa wasn't the type to not think to call people to come do it or to say no
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:10.520]  i don't own that property he went back there did it had a heart attack then that later killed him
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:13.640]  but you know so austin you know pretty much killed my grandfather i mean they're really
[1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:19.000]  nice people the government's great people yeah well it's interesting you know that what happened
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.280]  in sugar creek is another example they basically forced all the people out in this whole block
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:31.800]  except this one woman uh penelope marsh and what happened was she stayed and they harassed her
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:37.400]  and interesting she tells the story in the documentary that the guy head of the redevelopment
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:44.760]  agency lived right across the street was getting a wine tasting business in this new shopping center
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:50.280]  and he was the one pushing it i mean it's that's what you find in austin they fund malls that
[1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:56.440]  are government paid for and then the city council people's wives get free shops i mean it's just
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:02.520]  crime syndicate yeah and and the funny part is you go to the feds you go to the law enforcement
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:08.840]  they just laugh at you well they're on the payroll yeah and it's and it's really shocking to see in

[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:21.800]  myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging
[1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:27.160]  yeah fudged since d1 in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:34.440]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs

[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:09.080]  cyber spies from russia and china have now penetrated our power grid even as energy experts
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:13.800]  are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:19.000]  some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:24.520]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:29.720]  prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:34.840]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:40.200]  electrical power if so this will be the most important information you have ever heard solar
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:45.160]  powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to wear out or break and
[1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:51.960]  require absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:59.480]  backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com check out my solar backup dot com before you lose your
[1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:17.080]  power you know we saw that this film was coming to town rob do did and so we called the director
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:22.200]  of this new film begging for billionaires philip kline and he came into town early to be on the
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:26.760]  show in fact turned out he's a listener of the show so we're flattered to have him here and
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:30.200]  he was telling me all the other stuff he's investigating in kansas city and other parts of
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:37.560]  the country and it all dovetails them own research so this guy is bonafide from my perspective
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:41.800]  and we're going to play the trailer for the film coming up but it's winning a lot of film festivals
[1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:46.280]  it it's it's it's it's it's definitely gonna get a lot of attention and i can't wait till it comes
[1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:51.240]  out on dvd we'll try to buy some in bulk and sell them on the online video bookstore at info wars
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:56.360]  dot com because you do personalize it this is a short segment but but but we kind of got started
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:01.720]  on a good foot but kind of shotgun pattern breakdown exactly what's going on just in a
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:07.400]  microcosm of kansas city and and and what this film shows the fact that you got harassed attacked
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:13.240]  detained arrested i mean this is hardcore everything you're talking about i've experienced it personally
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.160]  and then i've experienced it through nationwide research so i'm people know
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:22.280]  it's worse than what you're even saying go ahead well the interesting part is we think four years
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:28.280]  making this documentary missouri by the institute of justice is basically considered as one of the
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:33.160]  most abusive states in the united states for the abuse of imminent domain and your property
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:39.400]  is being attacked and not only being attacked that you really don't own your property someone
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:45.400]  could come along decide they want your property and and go to the gun you talk about how they use
[1:25:45.400 --> 1:25:49.800]  ngo's like we have lower colorado river authority here with its own swat teams you're mentioned
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:53.960]  another group but you don't want to get to them on air exact same system the north american union
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:26:00.120]  hub in kc yeah no we're going through that too but what's interesting is they use tactics
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:08.760]  terrorist tactics and making this documentary as you mentioned uh the first real shake up on me
[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:15.080]  was i went to a public hearing that was being held in a hotel uh mayor k well no barns of
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:21.240]  assistant basically said she didn't want me there had the police removed me from the hotel telling me
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:27.080]  that i could not come in the hotel if i came back in the hotel i would be arrested my first
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:34.680]  cameraman basically his vehicle parked downtown while we were shooting the redevelopment and
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:39.960]  then tearing the buildings down and all this actually they trashed broke all his windows and
[1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:44.680]  kicked in the side of the vehicle another time they always ran him on the road off the road and
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:51.960]  killed him so and i was threatened by the mayor's woman she had a woman uh bodyguard who was an
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:59.160]  off-duty police officer this is typical cana city police basically is made a threat to me basically
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:06.600]  threatened me you know and what did she say she basically said uh you still live at 8301
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:13.480]  briar lane my old house and i go yeah because i thought so basically is an indirect threat oh
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:18.680]  how's the family doing yeah it's like a kind of a mafia threat goes yeah we know where you live
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:24.920]  even it's in kansas i was living in kansas at the time you know for cana city missouri police
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:31.960]  to come into kansas and find out where i live is really nerve wracking oh that happened yeah yeah
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:37.400]  this is big business snatching everybody's property uh and again with the new london kilo
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:41.960]  decision nationwide they're just taking whatever they want when they want in many cases not even
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:45.960]  paying you for it so this isn't the government taking your land and paying you for a highway
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:50.840]  this is and that's what a lot of these nafta highways are about snatching land on 10 miles of
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:56.760]  either side and giving it to their select cronies as well but i keep going yeah and uh they don't
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:02.040]  they pay you like 10 cents on the dollar for real property what happened with pennor was he had two
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:06.360]  buildings they were going to only pay him 360 thousand dollars for the building he actually
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:13.080]  had to go to court and he won and won 1.5 million for both buildings which and i've seen cases
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:17.720]  interrupt you where somebody will be paying two million in taxes on on a house or a building
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:21.960]  and the government will say oh it's worth a hundred grand you're like my tax bill says
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:26.760]  it's a two million and they go we have swat teams and they send these farms and ranches and homes
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:31.960]  police and they just throw you off but go ahead yeah and and this is the the tactics they do
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:37.160]  um a case that's not in our documentary and one of the first imminent to my cases i worked on
[1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:45.480]  besides the uh others was in mariam kansas was bill gross he had a used car dealership
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:54.040]  that he had was leasing out to van chevrolet and uh b and w next door was run by a bunch of
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:58.040]  millionaires wanted his piece of property he wanted a million and a half for the property
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:03.960]  they didn't want to pay us they went to iran french the mayor the redevelopment director
[1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:09.320]  and they took his property for the next three years going through court and everything he had
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:16.040]  a massive heart attack and now he's partly in a wheelchair yeah no it's very very stressful and
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:20.280]  and the way they harass old people when they come out of the hospital and we know they're using the
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:25.160]  health department databases the nurses of the health department for their safety after report
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:30.520]  any at risk or hurt old people or families or and then the health department is feeding that out
[1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:36.360]  to their units we've confirmed that in austin i mean this is so wow sinister oh it's it these
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:41.240]  people are disgusting well and it's also racist uh what happened at richmond height well we'll stay

[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:15.560]  he said hr block was a century 21 in his house to sell it and then he gets a swat team raid they
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:19.400]  said he had a meth lab there was nothing even in the house i don't know it's just a side issue but
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:26.600]  go ahead yeah this is actually uh the former mayor k-woldo barns and she's in the documentary and
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:32.360]  one of my favorite moments in the whole documentary is i asked her at the end of the documentary
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:38.840]  about the uh the businesses of downtown that she's taking out with eminent domain and throwing the
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:44.360]  side of the street she looks at me and goes i'm sorry i'm not i don't answer non-media questions
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:49.800]  even i was invited in as a media person she refused to answer my question and that's how
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:58.200]  we end the documentary i do want to also mention the website yes uh which is www beggingforbillionaires.com
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:06.600]  and you also hear uh see our trailer on there a lot of information articles uh and and g gordon
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:13.080]  liddy we did in the beginning of may and and i think you'll get a lot more information from the
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:18.680]  website this is going on all over the country and i was saying earlier are you kidding they're
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:22.920]  they're using phony environmentalist uh where we've got property in east Texas to try to steal
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:29.400]  everybody's land it's all phony they're just thieves yeah but it's also racist which oh yeah
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:37.240]  richman and richman heights which is the original first black community in st louis it was built
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:42.360]  for people who are working in the brick factory that was there richman heights has a lot of shopping
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:48.920]  centers and joanne bailey basically says we don't need any more shopping centers they're taking out
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:54.440]  three blocks of this black community because she says in her own words they don't want us here
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:03.400]  and they're going to build the high-rise condos expensive uh buildings and also a shopping center
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:07.720]  and then all that does is actually drive up real estate prices where the working folks and poor
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:13.720]  folks can't pay to live it's unbelievable but my favorite case i think in the whole documentary
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:21.160]  is jim roux jim roux is a minister out of st louis he lost quite a bit of property
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:29.880]  of what he basically does is he runs low income housing for the poor and they took out a bunch
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:35.320]  of his property behemian heights the bill the shopping center so he had one building that
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:41.560]  they were going to take and they didn't take it and what happened was it looks overcoming east
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:46.760]  into the highway into downtown canna city he had this tall building so he put a great big
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:52.840]  anti-eminent domain mural on his building well the redevelopment agencies he told me take it down
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:57.960]  or they'll come and remove it well he had a couple lawyers and finally the institute of justice
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:05.160]  came in and he won saying his first amendment that so now they're so mafia they're going hey
[1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:09.960]  on your own property you don't put up signs talking bad about us or we'll send by some guys to take
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:15.240]  care as he is yeah and i well i told jim i said if they come on your property take the mural down
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:21.160]  you have the sheriff's department arrest him for trespassing and which is interesting the court
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:27.000]  really ripped the redevelopment agency that they had no authority but that's what i mean government
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.280]  and these quasi government groups are getting crazier and crazier like cops will see an ambulance
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:37.400]  drive by speeding and they'll say he thinks he's above the law i'm pulling the ambulance over
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:43.640]  i mean i mean they're going crazy it's like it's scary out there it really is because and you know
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:48.600]  you look at your property you know go outside and look at your property and think is it really yours
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:53.800]  you're already paying way too high of property tax on it most people can barely hold on their
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:57.560]  property even if you can it's really not yours because they can just come by and steal it yeah
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:03.080]  but the even funnier we found out in the investigation which is not in the documentary there's developers
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:08.920]  driving around with maps looking at people's property and areas that they can go no no no
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:16.040]  you know what we found it was on um west 36th street west 37th because he had a house he had
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:21.160]  two houses he built a world war two roland elingston a retired arborist i need to go see if rolling's
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:26.200]  alive he was he was dying of cancer and i saw him years later to rally barely alive he's just a really
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:34.280]  tough old guy and he this is how i found out about this like a 1996 and i uh go out there and i noticed
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:39.400]  the same pattern he had two houses he built nice houses but there were like mercedes and yuppies
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:44.040]  and you know three four bedroom little houses but nice they were built in the 20s and 30s and stuff
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:49.560]  40s that were going for 600 700 000 back then that was high for austin must be millions now
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:54.600]  and the realtors would come and try to buy it some of his neighbors and he would sell
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:58.840]  and so then it was the three inch grass finds and it was the cops coming and arresting yeah
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:05.480]  so i guess it's these parasitic uh uh realtors yeah and yeah they're they're part of it and
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:11.080]  which is interesting is getting back to hr block it's not just hr block it's a lot of five
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:17.000]  four to 500 companies walmart is probably one of the worst abusers of imminent domain target
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:22.120]  i mean i could name well target's really a ci ansa front did you know their big business
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:27.800]  is security like the cameras and grids and biometrics you see no target is the leader in that
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:33.000]  but let's put that on screen uh google targets security business and then you'll see a bunch
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.880]  of headlines on that yeah no it's well i mean ibm's a government front microsoft's a government
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:42.920]  front this is really on record is people don't know it wow yeah targets really wicked so yeah
[1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:48.520]  they tell us about target well yeah they've gone in and they've taken out homes and businesses
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  and to build a target or a shopping center which target will be in uh and they've done walmart's
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:59.480]  that way all over the country because i'm i work with imminent domain groups all over the country
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:05.160]  from both coasts and i get emails of people telling me their stories google targets real
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:12.120]  business or target stores real business so go ahead and and when you really find out
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:18.840]  that it's just kind of like a mafia type of deal with the what happened is big fortune 500 to become
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:22.600]  the new mafia no they're the global government yeah and they come into third world countries
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:26.840]  the us anywhere and they buy off the local politicians then they got the cops and they say
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:36.280]  look we have weapons stand down it's ours actually if you go to google on on youtube there's actually
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:45.000]  a uh a a film on there of a woman being dragged at new um and connecticut being dragged out of
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:51.400]  her home by police sheriff's office actually pulling her out of the house and some of these people
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:56.280]  in new london connecticut these were three four five generations these were doctors and lawyers
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:01.560]  that mean this was and the point is if they'll go after middle class people and and homes that have
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:07.000]  been in the family three generations nobody's land is safe well that's what happened in uh in
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:13.960]  sugar creek of panellope marsh talks about how her uncle lived down the street her uncle lived in
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:21.560]  this house her mother her grandfather uh died in the house she was born in the house and her
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:27.800]  mother breaks down in tears and goes i can't eat i can't sleep knowing that my house is going to be
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:34.440]  gone but what we really show in this document is the psychological impacts it has on people we just
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:40.680]  don't have a bunch of talking politicians and a bunch of experts we have actually the people
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:45.560]  telling their story i think that was yeah that's what's important what i mean look a lot of people
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:50.600]  don't care about money and power we're the normal people we care about ancestral homes we care about
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:55.800]  family we care about comfort we care about roots and these dirty robber barons just run around
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:43:03.000]  all over the world kicking look i remember 20 years ago being in southern mexico and yucatan
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:09.560]  and there were brochures and all the nice hotels get you in biosphere land for super cheap and now
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:13.640]  they've built it all up and then later i learned they would kick the indigenous peoples all over
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:18.600]  mexico off their cornfield lands they'd been on for a thousand years they'd say where's your deed
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.320]  well we've always lived here in this village this is our land and they that's why they're all in
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:28.360]  mexico city that's why mexico city went from 12 million to 33 million in just 15 years is they
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:32.680]  force them all up there off their land and then to the us to have jobs you can't blame them wanting
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:39.400]  to come here and it's the same thing there but it was un sanctioned where the un and big corporations
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:43.560]  just paid the mexican government and they said okay come on in and just take whatever they got
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:51.800]  wow you know yeah and and uh richmond hide and well i'll tell you arnold we were really shocked
[1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:56.440]  what was what happened in arnold we went to i don't know if you know about dr decancus he was
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:02.280]  the dentist that's there was a lot of publicity about it they were building the development
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:07.720]  around him and they put dirt mounds and tore up the road so his patients couldn't come and they
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:13.880]  were harassing him well we went down to do the interview for the documentary and uh we met this
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:19.320]  guy named steve who had a trailer park originally arnold was all trailer park and now it's i couldn't
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:24.360]  believe it it's like one shopping center cross from another they have like 20 shopping center for
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:30.280]  this little town um and he write us to the city council mean he goes you're not going to believe
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.560]  this since you're doing this documentary well if you show up at the city council and talk about
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:41.880]  imminent domain or redevelopment they bear at that time the mayor pro tam when we were there
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:47.400]  said uh this is your warning um you're out of order oh that's all over the country that you're
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:52.120]  arrested they say there's no free speech we know i've seen it a million times but no i didn't know
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:58.040]  about this case yeah and they basically dragged him out of the meeting escorted three cops uh
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:02.520]  escorted arnold is one of the worth he's been trying to get documents for a year and a half
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:06.840]  they won't give a document i said i said listen under zoning in illinois did you see this in the
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:11.960]  illinois papers about five six years ago people wake up at six a.m and the cops were in front of
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:17.000]  them they come in your house without a warrant for a home inspection of zoning to make sure more
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.080]  people aren't living there that are supposed to and even if there's two people zoned for the house
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:25.480]  they will go look and see if there's more than two toothbrushes and then give you a fine if there's
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:30.040]  more than two toothbrushes now for two people now i've got like three in my drawer you know there's
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:35.400]  like what happens if you're using a toothbrush to clean your dog or your cat you can't make this up
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:39.800]  this was in the newspapers and they were saying it was good and the people were back because they
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:43.240]  didn't like it what's the name of the youtube video we're going to play your trailer first
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:47.560]  we're the dragon the lady out you remember the name uh... it's it's a new one new london
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:51.720]  it's one of the new london new london woman taken from home woman yeah uh... uh... well
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:57.080]  uh... well it's just like oh i interviewed them many times yeah oh yeah yeah new london
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:02.520]  uh... canada kid uh... castello family yeah and they show her dragging her out of the house and
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:06.360]  it's probably one of the most shocking youtube they've ever seen we're going to find that before
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:11.480]  you go but right now let's play the trailer to begging for a billionaires not enough for these
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:17.480]  from pigs to and they are pigs uh... to run our lives they've got to have it all they've
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  got to have it now and here it is
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:35.560]  some of our elected officials are undermining our constitutional rights with the name of
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.360]  the big business yeah it's understood that they don't have the assets to fight it
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.840]  you know what's that for the funny thing he says let's it pause well you're as bad as i am
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:49.000]  back it up let's start it over when i'm not reading the text for people on the radio
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.400]  and when you're not you know what i'm sorry you thought we were off air i'm i was i was reading
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:57.880]  the subtitles here let's let's start over i want folks to see this watching on prism planet on tv
[1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:11.880]  and listening on the radio here it is
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:20.280]  when people hear the word eminent domain uh... it's understood that uh... they don't have the assets
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:26.440]  to fight it you know once they put the gun on me we didn't have a choice because you know the law
[1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:33.080]  is on their side not our side so just imagine if every tree every view a familiar touch that
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:37.880]  your family had ever known for 80 years was going to be destroyed by a developer for a plan
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:44.280]  for a planned project it's been nothing but a nightmare where you can't sleep you can't eat
[1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:53.240]  you can't can't even begin to function right because of all the harassment the threats
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:58.280]  to our knowledge there were never any uh... any problems with our property
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:02.600]  they just coveted it and they were going to take it
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:11.640]  we've always had eminent domain for public works for roads for bridges for schools for streets
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:19.160]  but the idea that we would take private property away from one person and give it to another
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:26.840]  private interest that's a new idea those that have power those that have the ability to influence
[1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:32.520]  what happens in city hall are the ones that are going to profit from it that is exactly
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:37.160]  what our founding fathers were trying to prevent when the fifth amendment to the constitution was
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:43.480]  added to the bill of rights you simply couldn't stop it if we couldn't stop it and it didn't matter
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:53.160]  how beneficial and substantial and established our presence was we could not stop it
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:05.320]  there's the mural that the city was trying to tell them they didn't have a first amendment
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:10.200]  right to and it just gets worse and worse for those watching and listening to that tell us a
[1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:13.720]  little bit about people in the trailer you were you were telling me a particularly about the black
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:20.200]  fellow something that happened to him yeah well he he's the spokesperson he he basically explains
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:26.520]  different things to the whole documentary and uh... he has had a bunch of homes that he bought
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:34.120]  to redo and he's a former city council member of Richard Tobert and every time he goes against the
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:39.720]  mayor they would come in the middle of night and tear down his house and with all his stuff in it
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:46.760]  his furniture his personal belonging he and one time they actually the demolition guy called him
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:53.080]  and let him come in to take out his property and he talks about uh... his property and everything
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:58.040]  and but the best story he tells and i think it's the best piece in the documentary is a
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.400]  reverend ick story i don't know if you know about reverend ick reverend ick was a black
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:09.240]  preacher in the thirties who would tell people that you're too poor to have money send me your
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:15.800]  money and watch me enjoy it and i will send you a prayer cloth and what he's saying richard is
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:26.520]  you're too poor to pay for an entertainment district or a a arena which was part of the redevelopment
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:32.360]  section both of them were where daryl penner was and they always use taxpayer money to build those
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:37.160]  as well well it's interesting that is total bond fraud which we didn't cover in the documentary
[1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:42.440]  because it was too complex but basically it's a piezy scheme with the city because those bonds
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:47.160]  never get paid off let's say they're final segment we got to have you back when we come back let's
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:53.080]  tell folks about some of the bond fraud and more about the film begging for billionaires the attack

[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:15.080]  it gives the address and everything of where the theater is good when when can we get this on dvd
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:20.040]  how long till there's a dvd release because i'd like to carry the film a year and a half probably
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:24.120]  yeah i mean the regular film process for those that don't know that say put it in theaters alex with
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:28.440]  my stuff you have to go through this circuitous route of getting all these awards then sell it get
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:33.560]  it in art houses you have the small theaters maybe get big ones but then if you get ahead it's a hit
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:38.520]  i think this film should end up end up being as big as in ron smartest guys in the room or
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:44.280]  something like that that's what happened with ruso with uh fascism what was it american freedom
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:48.360]  of fascism yeah we carry that it went into the theaters for a little bit and then it just kind
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:55.080]  of disappeared yeah my experience is i mean look at terminator salvation big company 200 million
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:56:01.800]  dollar budget it's a flop i mean even big huge companies most their stuff's a failure uh i mean
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:06.280]  take scanner darkley now it made its nine million dollar budget back and then some but still wasn't
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:10.760]  a big success i think total it's made like 30 million dollars or something and the stars
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:15.320]  basically work for free keanu reeves and all that they'd usually get 20 million dollars more than the
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:20.280]  budget to be in something like scanner darkley but that was a love affair film they made so uh you
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:26.360]  know but side issue i think i was paid 600 bucks to be in that film oh you were and i offered to do
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:31.880]  it for free yeah and rick linklater said no you gotta but i just want to let taft heart lead into
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:37.160]  this film you have to be in it this will let audiences know that the reason why i made this
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:44.360]  film and i think it's important is after keelow the media is basically part of the problem with
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:50.600]  corruption uh i just had a thing with clay chastain where i went after a media guy for the cancini star
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:55.000]  cancini star is probably one of the biggest forms of corruption in cana city because they
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.480]  basically are in the pockets of developers and the downtown council the chamber of commerce
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:06.760]  and any act of issue we've had security guards on the side of the sidewalk in canza city tell my
[1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:11.320]  cameraman they're not allowed to be on the sidewalk it was i mean it's like they're god yeah well
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:16.120]  actually that happened in downtown when we're making this film i went into the power light district
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:20.760]  which is downtown where they took out penners building right actually across from pennard
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:27.640]  building and security guards told me that i could not film on this property not only that
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:32.200]  that the buildings you're gonna love this were copyrighted and i could not film the building
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:38.200]  oh i know in new york city the cops walk out and you gotta have permission to film this building
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:43.480]  i go first amendment all right take him to the department what do you think this is a free country
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:51.320]  punk we run things now i mean literally it's ah and i've had austin cops come up and tell me that
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.880]  we can't protest or can't have video cameras and i go look i'm gonna have to sue you personally
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:58:00.040]  if you take me to jail and i go you'll beat the rap but you won't beat the ride and they back off
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:06.200]  but the fact is how do they get cops to think we are slaves i think it's it's a mentality
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:12.440]  that's of their training and and i think one of the things i've always said when i see cop beatings
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:19.560]  and and all this stuff that the cops need to go back to school and be taught a whole course on
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:24.120]  first amendment rights they should actually have a first amendment but the system doesn't want them
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:28.120]  to know no you're absolutely right you know what you know what let's do a few more minutes

[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:45.640]  originally it was the silo project but then after it was put in k-wolder mayor k-wolder barn
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:53.800]  decided in memory of stan dirwood who ran amc theaters going to call it the uh the power
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:02:00.120]  light district well i went to them met with this woman fbi agent and the first thing she says to me

[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:13.560]  auto tape you well the next meeting she bought a second which i knew was a uh a recorder the next
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:22.200]  thing i knew was they had fbi agents interviewing me and then she bought in a profiler now gotta

[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:37.400]  the profiler her partner and she was getting very very angry because i was calling her her
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:41.240]  partner for some strange reason because you know she worked with her as a partner you're supposed
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:47.480]  to call it your partner yeah you know that's what they do in law enforcement and um well the fbi

[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:57.080]  psychologically in the psychopathic mindset to you know but the funny story is what i did tour was

[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:44.360]  think if they would i don't think you're going to find it on the web because i don't think the fbi

[2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:15.160]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in this
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:20.120]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:25.880]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it
[2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:31.080]  can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:35.960]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:42.200]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival
[2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:48.120]  seed bank dot com or give them a call at eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[2:07:48.120 --> 2:07:55.320]  that's eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:07:59.720]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:13.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:32.280]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:44.920]  man two hours and eight minutes went by like it was five minutes i mean these four hour shows
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:50.440]  i went from three hours to four hours about a year ago because i felt like i needed more time and
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:56.600]  now four hours doesn't seem like enough time and four hours locked down every day burns a lot of
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:09:01.400]  the time i've got to film make and do research and set up gas and everything else we do there's
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:05.880]  just not enough hours in the day as they say for people that are busy fighting the new world
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:12.520]  order gerald solente coming up next hour coming up in about 40 minutes a huge news blitz and the
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:17.240]  government and the media are saying gun owners conservatives veterans basically all work for
[2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:22.360]  al-qaeda we broke the dhs documents people said they were fake of course and the mayak documents
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:27.080]  so they were fake till the news had to admit they were real that went on for several weeks
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:33.480]  uh and uh we're telling you that glenn beck is involved in this operation and i'll be exposing
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:37.720]  him and again i don't get into these ego wars i'm not going after beck because he's a big tv host
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:44.200]  people see me email saying that i'm going after him because he's saying 911 truthers need to be
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:48.840]  arrested because he's saying ron paul supporters are quote mcvay terrorists need to have the army
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:54.120]  used on them i'm saying that because he came out and said he thought fema camps were real but that
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:02.040]  he was going to expose them and then i predicted exactly how he straw man debunked them and now
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:07.720]  he comes out and says oh yes american militias are going to release anthrax and the american people
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:13.400]  hey beck uh the white house launched the anthrax attacks of 2001 i'm going to recap that coming
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:18.040]  up you know you know what you're doing and it's not funny and you say you're this patriot fighting
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:24.280]  the new world order you are a judas go you are a camouflaged enemy and you're camouflaged in

[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:45.720]  up blaming on their cis at menladen and i lost two-thirds of my stations and got attacked and
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:51.720]  had people cuss at me on the street and then on the day it happened uh my tv show for months
[2:10:51.720 --> 2:10:55.640]  before happened to re-air we got hundreds of phone calls thinking that i was talking about
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:11:00.040]  it being an inside job that day no that was two months before that's what i'm here for i'm here

[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:13.240]  research is paid off now richard gauge for the next 30 minutes or so we really appreciate him
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:18.040]  coming on he's the founder of architects and engineers for 911 truth but not what year and a
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:22.760]  half two years hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds look at the exact numbers of engineers
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:30.200]  architects physicists peer reviewed papers top physicists top engineers people worldwide people
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:37.960]  in uh holland and uh people uh in europe and people in the united states and japan members of
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:44.920]  parliament coming out former german defense ministers uh people just all over the place who
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:50.200]  are scientists waking up looking at the samples looking at the evidence of explosives and getting
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:55.800]  more and more media attention and and and now we've had a senator questioned by we are changed it
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:02.040]  made fox news uh lucredowski and others looks on tomorrow saying to them hey should it be a new
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:08.360]  911 investigation she says yes it becomes a national news story uh the fact that obama's covering up
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:12.920]  for all this becomes a national news story we've had government sponsored terror before that's
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:17.560]  declassified admit it the government admits they've staged terror attacks before in other
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:22.360]  countries and domestically so why don't we look at them in this case then when you do look it's
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:26.920]  unbelievable so but richard gauge is going at this from a scientific perspective that's been
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:30.120]  getting a lot of news attention i'm gonna play a clip of that coming up but i wanted to get
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:34.760]  richard on to give us a progress report on architects and engineers 911 truth and
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:39.880]  where it's going and all these uh you know peer reviewed journals and things that are coming out
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:46.600]  and all these scientists uh that are coming out uh in copenhagen and other places uh exposing
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:51.080]  what's happening richard gauge good to have you on with us thanks alex it's just incredible to be
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:55.160]  here with you again oh it's incredible to have you're my friend tell us about the organization
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:59.240]  the group for those that don't know have been hiding under a rock what your numbers are up to
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:05.480]  the huge breakthroughs you're having well we're uh we have almost 700 architects and
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:11.880]  engineers now demanding a new investigation of the three world trade center high-rise buildings
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:19.400]  uh on 9 11 the destruction of those buildings we we are marching forward there's been a lot
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:28.600]  of activity as you've suggested most recently we were at the national convention of architects
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:35.000]  the american institute of architects in san francisco and we had a booth there and we handed
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:43.880]  out a thousand dvd of our latest dvd the companion dvd to 9 11 blueprint for truth it has the 10
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:51.320]  minute 30 minute and 60 minute a bridged versions of our two-hour uh presentation where we outlay
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:57.000]  all of this evidence that we're going to be talking about today um and so we gave these dvds
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:03.960]  out to the architects we educated them our booth was like two or three levels deep with architects
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:11.320]  with their jaws dropped looking at the these buildings on the widescreen flat monitors
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:19.000]  and of building seven going down symmetrically at freefall speed acceleration straight down
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.640]  into its own footprint same with the twin towers they're saying well wait a minute that's that
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:29.560]  happened on 9 11 and we're going yep it's the third worst structural failure in modern history
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:35.720]  and you didn't know about it no well never did i three years ago before i started and so they're
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:43.800]  just in shock we got 60 of these architects to sign our petition which was extraordinary so
[2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:51.480]  we kind of see it as a new mission um to go to these uh convention throughout the united states
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:57.240]  there was the over 15 000 architects at this convention we couldn't reach all of them they're
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:03.160]  just simply wasn't enough time and there's a huge number of booths but there's regional
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:09.560]  conventions all through the united states and so we're now raising funds to go to all of them we
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:18.840]  have a hundred sustaining members now um and we need that number to grow to 200 uh very dedicated
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:24.920]  people providing us uh as little as ten dollars a month they can become sustaining members of
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:32.120]  a 9 11 truth and so we with that in our fundraising efforts to obtain the booth fees
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:35.880]  for these conventions to a washington dc for instance is happening
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:40.440]  mid july that's the the the one that we're very excited about because once we go to
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:46.200]  washington dc we're right in of course contact with um government officials we hope to visit
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:52.200]  there as well as the national aia where we hope to finally meet with the board of the
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:59.640]  american institute of architects and his president who did allow us after a lot of controversy
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:06.440]  to have the booth in san francisco at the national convention and while we were there we actually
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:12.360]  met the ceo of the virginia chapter uh in richmond virginia of the american institute of
[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:17.880]  architects and he says where you guys been we've been waiting for you uh this is fantastic i knew
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:23.240]  all about this but i didn't know about you so he wants us to come to his regional convention
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:28.680]  in mid november and an early november let me stop you there richard gauge because this is
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:33.320]  what's key what you're explaining we don't realize we're really the majority and i keep trying to
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:39.240]  explain this to everybody that four years ago we had polls for over 60 percent of americans
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:43.720]  scientific polls believe we're being lied to about 9 11 now we have polls of over 80 percent
[2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:48.600]  i went to the beach um because my daughter wanted to go there for a birthday little texas beach
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:54.360]  this weekend and i rented a golf cart was driving around motorized golf cart at the pack port aransas
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:59.880]  and it was like a joke i mean here i'm in a t-shirt and shorts i'm driving and i've been
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:06.680]  recognized for 10 years places but as i was going every 10 cars every five cars alex jones alex
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:12.840]  jones everywhere we went to eat we got recognized uh and that's just a gauge and i can go to england
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:17.640]  i can go to central america i can be in canada everywhere we're getting i mean like every
[2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:22.760]  10 people i walk by are recognizing and again that's a gauge here you are feeling like you're
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:28.280]  all alone and others and then you find out that major heads of architect societies are on the
[2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:34.680]  same side again we just have to show ourselves not let the chilling effect scare us into submission
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:39.080]  i talked to so many neighbors that go yeah i'd like our kids to play together but won't the
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:42.760]  government do something to me or i've wanted to order your videos but won't they you know when
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:48.600]  i'll be on a list or or yeah and you know my wife runs into these people that swim meets and things
[2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:53.560]  and you know middle class people well to do folks you folks like that again you're already
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:57.800]  living in tyranny yes they're watching us yes they're tracking us but the government's full
[2:17:57.800 --> 2:18:03.480]  of our people too we this is a fight if we let the chilling effect win they're gonna win i love
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:09.320]  how you've just doggedly through all the attacks everything just continued and you're having success
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:14.840]  success success just like steven jones and others uh professor steven jones who sent me a nice note
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:18.520]  want to say hi to him he's listening right now from germany boy he's got some big news coming
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:23.080]  up so i'm sorry to interrupt there it's just that this is this is amazing what's happening go ahead
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:30.760]  yeah it is incredible and so this particular leader of the aia chapter is having a regional
[2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:35.800]  conference they get they're going to give us a free booth um which is you know cost thousands
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:40.280]  of dollars two thousand at least there um we paid uh four thousand dollars just for the
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:45.480]  booth be at the national convention and i had a big fundraising effort for that and all together
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:49.480]  it cost about ten thousand dollars for that convention what was the response like though
[2:18:49.480 --> 2:18:53.880]  when you're there amongst the architects and engineers oh it's it's amazing i would say about
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:19:04.840]  them 20 um 20 well 80 percent of them will will will stop and then we will will invite them to
[2:19:04.840 --> 2:19:11.320]  stop they do stop many of them 20 percent maybe we figure walk by kind of shaking their heads
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:17.720]  but the majority will stop and actually talk to us of those uh we were we were able to get
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:24.120]  it very lively and i mean positive lively conversations going uh because once once
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:30.680]  they actually see building seven go go down we've got them and a good percentage of them
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:35.640]  will say this is incredible i've got to look at this more and we signed up about 60 of them
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:42.120]  that richard gauge again this is exponential if you continue we will route the enemy the mainstream
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:46.200]  media can't ignore this forever we're going to play that some of that clip just uh you're getting
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:51.560]  on more and more mainstream television with the facts as a degree to architect engineer
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:56.200]  so we're going to come right back with richard gauge the founder and head of architect engineers
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:05.960]  find love and truth stay with us in the new world order's war against humanity barack obama is the
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:11.880]  tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[2:20:11.880 --> 2:20:18.280]  just as strong just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:23.400]  obama is working for the best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:28.680]  yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:35.160]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:41.000]  oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one world government

[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:52.200]  consumers millions of dollars if you owe ten thousand or more in taxes to the irs the number
[2:23:52.200 --> 2:24:05.880]  to call is 1-800-506-5904 that's 1-800-506-5904 call today from his central texas command center
[2:24:05.880 --> 2:24:13.400]  deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:23.720]  richard gauge let's start blasting into it now you know the evidence of the control demolition
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:29.240]  people know those basics but the evidence now has been looked at peer reviewed journals other top
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:34.760]  engineers scientists physicists around the world are coming out doing their own research separate
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:39.320]  verifying your research the other architects and engineers in your group the other physicists
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:44.920]  professor steven jones information being verified uh major universities i mean this is
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:50.520]  really got to worry the establishment at the point of for those that don't know this is in
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:56.520]  politico today it's up on um prison planet dot com obama i am aware that some question
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:04.200]  question or justify the events of 9-11 so so they either justify it saying it was good he
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:09.240]  tries to mix those two so now if you say the government did 9-11 or was involved you want
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:15.560]  9-11 to happen see how that's a very that's a quote i am aware that some question question
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:20.520]  or justify the events of 9-11 wait a minute questioning the events of 9-11 isn't justifying
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:26.920]  me see see that's oh you like the killers uh no i'm saying why is that building falling that way
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:32.600]  shut up al-qaeda well actually al-qaeda is a CIA creation shut up al-qaeda you know this is the
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:37.560]  mindlessness they like to engage in we're just asking the serious questions here so they're
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:42.520]  really starting to get worried just like george bush saying those that you know put out outrageous
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:47.720]  conspiracy theories concerning the events of 9-11 he told people they better shut up but they didn't
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:53.160]  uh so richard gauge uh it's it's it's getting exciting what's happening on the scientific front
[2:25:54.360 --> 2:25:59.560]  yeah it is and uh with the the uh the 700 architects and engineers that i represent
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:05.720]  are technical and building professionals not conspiracy theorists and not not that there
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:11.960]  are conspiracies out there there obviously is a conspiracy in fact we know the official story
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:17.480]  is a conspiracy actually it turns out to be an outrageous one uh when you look at the
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:22.200]  facts the scientific forensic facts found at the crime scene of the destruction of these
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:30.040]  three high rises uh you you find uh of facts that all seem to line up in support of the theory
[2:26:30.040 --> 2:26:36.040]  of explosive control demolition of the science that we're looking at and so the the architects
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:43.640]  um are as i mentioned are first dumbfounded by the uh free fall acceleration of building seven
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.680]  and this is acknowledged by the government actually i tried at first niss denied it
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:54.360]  but you guys confronted them and they have to admit the building did free fall it wasn't fuel oil
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:27:00.280]  it wasn't kebler elves it wasn't structural uh failure because of bad building they don't know
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:07.480]  then they made up a magic thermal expansion and the thermal expansion is is the is it is
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:13.400]  their uh their magic bullet that we they first of all they claim that there are massive fires
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:18.440]  on floors 12 and 13 during the last couple hours of the building but the photos and videos show
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:23.880]  those fires out in that area the last hour and a half of the building uh and this is in
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:31.400]  at the area of column 79 under the east penthouse so this new phenomenon is is what they call it
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:37.080]  uh thermal expansion because of these massive fires that weren't even there but they expanded
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:43.320]  these long span 50 foot beams pushing the girder off of its feet off of column 79 causing
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:51.160]  uh a floor failure and then five uh set to nine floor failures leaving column 79 unbuckled
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:57.240]  so what then happens is an internal cascading and failure of the building a few seconds prior
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:03.080]  to the overall building coming down the problem is is that that would require 400 structural
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:09.800]  steel connections to fail per second in order and and their model shows actually like sand
[2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:14.280]  to just all of these beams just giving up the ghost all of all of a sudden and all of these
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:19.240]  columns which is ridiculous in the few as you know as an architect engineer for those that don't
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:24.920]  there have been a few older buildings where small areas have collapsed under the main structure
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:29.800]  and and that's how it is it's not symmetrical you don't have a building with unsymmetrical fires
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:35.080]  that couldn't bring it down anyways magically falling straight down unless it's boom a control
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:41.000]  demolition well in in in order to bring a building straight down symmetrically into its own footprint
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:48.440]  and at freefall acceleration uh you have to take out at least the the core columns there's 24 of
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:55.800]  them within a tenth of a second of each other uh it precisely timed synchronistically floor by floor
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:29:03.000]  and and so this the fire doesn't have this level of precision and and people really get that part
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:08.360]  of it as well exactly jawless didn't attack the sand crawler but we're made to think they did only
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:16.680]  imperial stormtroopers are so precise yes so the the the the acknowledged it
[2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:21.960]  most previously actually acknowledge this is the national institute for standards and technology
[2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:26.680]  responsible for the report they previously acknowledged that if the building did freefall
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:31.080]  that would mean there would be no structure now they acknowledge the freefall but they don't
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:36.040]  acknowledge the implications that those columns had to have been forcibly removed in order to
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:42.120]  facilitate it all right stay there stay there richard gotta come back we're gonna come back
[2:29:42.120 --> 2:29:47.480]  and talk about more of the evidence and all the science building uh how you see the crisis
[2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:54.360]  coming up in the future of the establishment story we're on the march the empire's on the run
[2:29:54.360 --> 2:30:03.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:08.680]  consider buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:13.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[2:30:13.640 --> 2:30:18.840]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:23.560]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:30:23.560 --> 2:30:28.040]  power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead number
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:32.360]  four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[2:30:32.360 --> 2:30:37.160]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar power generator
[2:30:37.160 --> 2:30:41.640]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science a long time sponsor of ours you can get more

[2:33:27.320 --> 2:33:47.560]  everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor the rich get and everybody does know how it goes they are awakening so why are we all called afraid the government get me if I speak up or stand up no this is mafia
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:34:16.560]  we are saying no this is our forbearers did 230 plus years ago in 1776 by the way you want to meet like minded people you want to wear your liberty on your sleeve getting everybody's face about it say hey we're not ashamed of this you're the criminals go to info wars dot com we've produced 14 new shirts we're adding new ones every week in the last few months and this is my favorite really I kind of like the Gadsden flag
[2:34:16.560 --> 2:34:37.560]  the yellow don't tread on me too but live free or die this is the very shirt I was wearing this weekend in Port Aransas at 930 at night buying this pad of paper and some milk and stuff and the security guard came up and looked at my shirt and looked on the back and acted all scared and people on the beach when I was walking would see it and either like it or be scared
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:49.560]  especially cop types with their wives out walking on the beach because they've all been told the DHS report is coming up with Glenn Beck now that we're terrorists folks you know Glenn Beck can use these symbols and say big government police states what it symbolizes
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:35:18.560]  but when we use these symbols and tell you what it really means liberty sovereignty the truth second amendment they're not going to put up with that so we got this t-shirt and a lot of others available at info wars dot com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139-888-2533139 we have these in your face things that say live free or die with Paul Revere on the front and info wars dot com on the back so radical and the Gadsden flag don't tread on me
[2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:36.560]  but if that's too radical for you we have stuff like the answer to 1984 1776 and things are a little little less radical evil free speech and of course the Obama deception detailing who Barack Obama really is the preeminent film exposing this guy have viewing party show it to your church or school
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:49.560]  show it to your liberal conservative friends it exposes the right and the left shows it's a controlled paradigm that's why this film is number one online right now get it in high quality on DVD with all the extras see it in high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:36:04.560]  and by the way we just put out the Aaron Russo film available on DVD it's a it's a presentation of the interview I did with him before he died it already put out for free on the web it has the added extras interview that we hadn't put out and an update commentary from myself reflections and warnings
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:18.560]  interview with Aaron Russo that's available in info wars dot com we're carrying American freedom to fascism again and his mad as hell video great material that needs to be seen that everybody's library needs and your purchases support this show and what we're doing so please
[2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:35.560]  get reflections and warnings interview with Aaron Russo that's also up there in high quality at prisonplanet.tv for members and tomorrow we're going to launch it prisonplanet.tv expanded extras from the Obama deception 30 minutes behind the scenes
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:50.560]  Bilderberg 2008 and a bunch of other stuff it's really hot stuff that hit the cutting room floor because we couldn't make the film three hours long that's going on for prisonplanet.tv members tomorrow night so you don't have a prisonplanet.tv membership folks now is the time to get a
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:37:08.560]  prisonplanet.tv membership and again your prisonplanet.tv membership also makes this radio show possible what we do here every day we also simulcast for prisonplanet.tv members at least two hours usually three hours of doing today of the radio show live at prisonplanet.tv and then
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:25.560]  Jason Bermas back live at prisonplanet.tv in the same studio nine to midnight at prisonplanet.tv simulcast with GCN radio network. Okay let's go back to Richard Gage Richard we're almost out of time because I want to play the clip of you on Fresno TV at least part of it and I want to
[2:37:25.560 --> 2:37:43.560]  cover some other news before Gerald Salente joins us next hour on the economy but again going over the evidence it's incontrovertible it's been peer reviewed this is really upsetting the debunkers and I know you've taken a lot of threats and things and I just want to commend your spirit.
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:38:06.560]  Thank you Alex I haven't actually received threats but really I've seen the threats on the web to you. Don't forward him to me I don't want to see him then. Okay I'm happy in my blissful mission here of educating architects and I don't actually go to the debunker websites I don't want to
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:20.560]  but you have gotten a lot of bizarre phone calls and things I've not actually I haven't gotten any any phone calls nobody really knows my phone number as a matter of fact and or where I where I live which is the way I wanted to
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:40.560]  I thought I talked to you in the past I thought you said that it happened but I'm glad I must be thinking of somebody else but go ahead. Yeah so I just wanted to introduce that you brought up the concept of these peer reviewed papers Dr. Jones's work is so important here
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:59.560]  but the several first responders iron workers and others have found this molten metal underneath all three high-rise buildings after the collapses and in fact it's pouring out of the side of the South Tower and it turns out to be molten iron Dr. Jones is confirmed that this is not melted structural steel
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:17.560]  it's confirmed that it has in it the evidence the chemical evidence of thermite an incendiary used by the military to cut through steel like a hot knife through butter and not only this molten metal has in it this iron aluminum oxygen flooring manganese
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:32.560]  the the the fears that you've talked about in your show before are ubiquitous the millions billions of them throughout the death samples and independent scientists with independent samples have confirmed this in fact R. J. Lee has confirmed molten iron
[2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:48.560]  it's smaller than a human hair and they put it through these what spectrographs or what are these different tools and electrons scan and it all has the exact chemical makeup of the byproducts of thermate thermite then they even find thermite chips separately
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:40:04.560]  well that's that's the that's the big step and Dr. Jones has found hundreds and hundreds of these chips in the samples and by weight he estimates that there'd be nine tons of this unignited thermite and there's even more ignited thermite spheres but the unignited
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:13.560]  thermite chips turn out to be extremely small particles of aluminum and iron oxide and other particles a thousand times smaller than a human hair
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  and then people ask how could this happen these were all spook run buildings building seven was the FBI CIA defense intelligence and other agencies command center it had the FEMA emergency bunker the city and county and state emergency
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:45.560]  bunker and they had special unconventional insulation put on the pillars a few years before and then the NIST experts that try to debunk you they just so happen to be the world leading experts of just a few dozen just so happen to be the NASA experts in explosive
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  thermite for cutting through things and for NASA rocket decouplers oh very interesting to have the experts in explosive thermite involved in debunking you yes and you can read about that your listeners on the journal of nine eleven studies dot
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  com that's a fascinating topic as well Kevin Ryan exposes this and and that the twenty five page peer reviewed paper by Dr. Jones Neil Garrett and other scientists document nano thermite this is extremely high tech stuff
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:27.560]  it is made only in a defense department contracting laboratories not in a cave in Afghanistan
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:37.560]  yeah just so happens to match up with what the defense department obsessed with hmm but you know Al Qaeda got up in the buildings and they got this defense department
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:50.560]  thermite and put it in there kind of like defense department super weaponized grade US patented miniaturized coated in bentonite gets mailed out they claim Muslims do it but it turns out the White House is on Cipro the anthrax fighting
[2:41:50.560 --> 2:42:06.560]  antibiotic on September 10 three and a half weeks before anthrax pops up and all the bushes enemies get sent the anthrax and congress gets personally shut down partially shut down so they can then be under fear to pass the patriot act again there's no evidence
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:22.560]  the government's involved is there Mr. Gage well we we're we're not going to point the finger but you can it turns out that after the Al Qaeda was clearly unlikely to have access to this stuff as well they couldn't get access
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:34.560]  most likely to the Al Qaeda didn't have the NASA the NASA explosives okay they got it at Cape Cronaveral I mean you know they were the Al Qaeda's got a basic Cape Cronaveral
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:40.560]  nor did they have access to these three of the highly most secure buildings in the United States outside the Pentagon
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:44.560]  you mean Al Qaeda didn't have keys to the CIA command bunker in building seven
[2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:48.560]  well they may have been given them perhaps I don't know
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:58.560]  you know that's a wild conspiracy theory I think it's normal that they snuck in with NASA grade explosives all over the buildings by themselves and didn't get caught
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:04.560]  and of course I think it's pretty it's no big deal that a spook command base building seven blows up like this and falls at freefall
[2:43:04.560 --> 2:43:10.560]  Richard I mean I I think you're an extremist for even questioning this why don't you just believe the story
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:14.560]  I can't I in fact I'm not even working anymore I'm earning half the salary
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:20.560]  working for architects and engineers for 911 truth that I was a full time as an architect but I don't have time
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:28.560]  that's right you built some you built some big buildings and and and I mean you were had a pretty successful business tell folks about that
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:38.560]  well we I was managing or helping to manage a $400 million project in Nevada for general growth one of the largest mall firms and this had
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:56.560]  1,200 tons of steel framing in in in six malls basically in a row and including a mid-rise office space the deal is up the developers bankrupt and 18 of us were laid off on this project which turned out to be a blessing because
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:10.560]  I had I just didn't have time for it I was working a fewer and fewer hours trying to keep up with my speaking schedule and the research and the effort the marketing effort that we're trying to educate all of the architects and engineers
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  amazing tell us about this news clip I'm about to play because you're getting on more and more mainstream television they're being somewhat respectful
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  well let me tell you that the incredible hard-working folks at from we are change Fresno a new we are change chapter Fresno California they they threw lots of effort at contacting not just this one media outlet KMPH
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  Fox TV local affiliate down there but that they contacted several different affiliates and and wherever I go we we try to do this but it takes a lot of effort a lot of contact a lot of pressure and consistent
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:45:08.560]  and they broke through we were able to get on the great day show which is broadcast throughout central California on on Fox affiliate so it's pretty incredible it's a seven and a half minute interview which was very positive where I was able I feel to get out most of this
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:20.560]  we're going to let you go in a moment and play that we'll have you back up in the near future the Chronicle the great worker doing all over the world you travel in Europe and Canada the United States people should go to the website and support you
[2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:41.560]  and the last question are the people on the other side who are now discovering literally have the hands on the plungers the evidence shows how do you deal with the creepiness of some of the events you and Stephen Jones others go to where you've confronted these people and how do you deal with also knowing
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:55.560]  that you're met you and others are making history that that that your momentum and your evidence is is is really changing things because I'm starting to see a lot of fear in their eyes that they realize this is like Galileo you know arguing that the
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:08.560]  planets moved and they locked him up for a bit later it came out that he was right even before he died or Copernicus before him you know saying that saying the earth was round I mean they're in deep trouble because the science is on your side
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:21.560]  yeah and then the numbers are too are are are architects and engineers are growing and we're going to be presenting this petition to Congress hope that the thousand by October when we when we go out there to Washington DC
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  personally I'm I'm I'm delighted I'm fired up every time we get a new breakthrough in the media I'm I'm I'm incredibly delighted in fact we're going to be on coast to coast AM Tuesday night at 11 p.m. Pacific time and that that's
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:51.560]  it nationally syndicated like your show it we were just making some incredible progress and that you know that shows a lot bigger than this one it's got it's the second biggest show in the country that in fact I heard George during the news segment a few weeks ago cover the
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:47:03.560]  peer review journals about the thermite and the chips and the rest of it so more and more is happening Richard gauge I want to commend you for all you do and we'll talk to you again very soon I'm going to I'm going to let you go and play this clip
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:14.560]  thanks great Alex I'll listen thank you so much Richard okay yeah go ahead and start rolling the clip will go to break and come back and play the rest here is a pretty fair report broadcast all over California here it is
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:27.560]  he's an architect experienced in steel structures now Richard gauge is touring the country with a controversial message about September 11 Richard gauge is here to show us why he's calling for a more thorough investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:36.560]  building thank you so much for joining us you're very welcome it's great to be here well first of all give us a little bit of more about your background I'm an architect of 20 years member of American Institute of
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  Architects and have been studying steel frame fireproof buildings for about that long we ask that for clarification because as we get into this we want people to make sure that you're not just somebody with a wacky idea right
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:48:05.560]  okay you come with some science to you what is the official reason for the collapse of the World Trade Center tower we're told that the planes hit the buildings and the there was an explosion and a fire and about an hour and a half later in the case of the
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:24.560]  north tower the buildings collapse due to structural weakening due to the fires the problem is is that we don't have large gradual deformations associated with collapses and fires in high rises have never brought down a steel frame of high-rise building at all
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:39.560]  ever and what we have unfortunately is the evidence in the twin towers and the third skyscraper to collapse that day which most people don't know anything about it we have the evidence of the ten key features of controlled demolition in the case of
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:57.560]  building seven it collapses straight down into its own footprint at freefall speed in the first hundred feet it's it's dropping as you can see symmetrically smoothly at freefall speed in the first hundred feet two and a half seconds this is uncanny there's
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:09.560]  forty thousand tons of structural steel designed to resist this collapse of what a forty seven story building yeah it's just called building seven right a football field away from the twin towers okay so what we're showing is
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:28.560]  what happened in fact I won't throw a point in here then they first they said there was no freefall and they admit it okay first hundred hundred and fifty it is freefall at freefall then they go but the last couple hundred it didn't that's because it's now piling up on itself but it's barely falling slower than freefall after that point
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:46.560]  then they measure that with other control demos it's exactly the same that was done conventionally with a control demo tower one and two were blown up the opposite way top down let's go back to it this is uncanny there's forty thousand tons of structural steel designed to resist this collapse
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:50:02.560]  of forty seven story building yeah it's just called building seven right a football field away from the twin towers okay so what we're showing is left what happened in fact right is a controlled where you are using or the people who made this happen used demolition
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:20.560]  and you can see that indeed almost freefall speed freefall acceleration through forty thousand tons of structural steel that is uncanny so we have seven hundred architects and engineers demanding a new investigation as a result of this evidence and the evidence in the
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:32.560]  world trade center that is very explosive almost every architect and engineer we show this information to agrees with us that these are controlled demolitions before we stop right there and come back and play the wrestling in a glen back in the
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:50.560]  drill salentate look folks think of the courage of the seven hundred women and men like the founding fathers signing our john Hancock's on that piece of paper and he's like he said everybody ninety percent you talk to know it they're afraid to sign we have to
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:51:04.560]  step up the plate we have to say I'm not afraid I'm a patriot that's the first big step in winning against the new world order is stop powering they want to intimidate get past the fear worry if you don't you don't understand the situation hi summer's
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:16.560]  coming and now's the time to learn self sufficiency if you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants remember there's a learning curve experiences the best teacher but that means time to speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has
[2:51:16.560 --> 2:51:29.560]  lifted author Linda Runyon is that teacher her wild food knowledge package is the crash course the DVD gives you a three hour overview of her world directly from her the book gives you an in depth reference with all of the insider know how you'll

[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:14.560]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:54:14.560 --> 2:54:34.560]  I'm going to play a little bit more of this TV newscast with Richard Gage out of California then I'm going to cover a little bit more about Glenn Beck coming out and saying the militia gun owner groups are working with Al Qaeda this is the new Obama pitch with Department of Homeland Security saying veterans gun owners the number one terror threaten working with Al Qaeda
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:52.560]  the other thing that outrage conservatives I mean Beck is just really out of control but he's following a script and we got Gerald Salente coming up I want to tell you about a sponsor quickly before we do that they're EatFoodsDirect.com a great storeable foods company where I chose to get my storeable foods before they were even a sponsor that's why I approached them to be a sponsor
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:55:10.560]  as long as continually operating storeable foods company in the nation other people claim they are it's not true this is the group they are the biggest they are the best non-GMO non-hybrid clean quality food best prices brand new food not old stuff they're selling you from 10 years ago last more than 10 years and climate controlled

[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:47.560]  okay let's go back to this video at prisonplanet.tv and on the radio with the audio of a pretty fair newscast that we're breaking down here with Richard Gage going over what really happened on 9-11
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:56:07.560]  this evidence and the evidence in the World Trade Center that is very explosive almost every architect and engineer we show this information to agrees with us that these are controlled demolitions if we can get them to look at the information because obviously the implications of a controlled demolition are dark for our country
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:14.560]  because that means somebody besides Al Qaeda was involved because these have to be easily three of the most highly secure buildings outside the Pentagon
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:25.560]  the controlled demolition would there not be any evidence at the ground level of explosives within the building itself that's the debris that's left
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  indeed and what we find down there is pools of molten iron
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  what is that
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:42.560]  several tons exactly what is that doing there the first responders see it the structural engineers see it it's documented by FEMA the melting of steel normal office fires is what's supposed to have brought these buildings down along with jet plane impacts
[2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:56.560]  the jet fuel and office fires don't produce molten iron or molten steel it doesn't begin to melt until 3000 degrees but what we have is the fires only produce maybe fourteen sixteen hundred degrees so what produced all that molten iron
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  well it has in it the chemical evidence of a special incendiary which is thermite a high-tech incendiary used to cut through steel like a hot knife through water
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:24.560]  indeed in all of the dust throughout lower Manhattan we have four to six inch thick layer of this dust and throughout it we have evidence of tiny spheres billions of them several tons of previously molten iron
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  well how does that happen if you have molten iron the byproduct of thermite is molten iron and it's dispersed throughout all of this dust
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:36.560]  now you are allowed to go in and get samples and examine it
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:54.560]  oh there's there's plenty of dust a lot of people have this dust and four of these samples have been sent to physicist Stephen Jones formerly a Brigham Young University and they find in it not only these spheres with which which others have found to USGS RJ Lee doing
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:58:08.560]  archaeological studies this these spheres have iron aluminum fluorine manganese very unusual elements associated only with thermite and there's small chips of unignited thermite as well this is very high tech
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:32.560]  thermite yeah let's stop right there you can watch the rest of it on YouTube we got a link up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but that's key the federal government and other branches found the spheres in the thermate and didn't know what they were and wrote up in reports that's key folks go all Stephen Jones and other people you know they got these people that live nearby construction workers people that saved it and you know that there's
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:50.560]  not chain of custody oh I'm sorry the federal government's own studies admit it all they blew those buildings sky high thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live dot com today
[2:58:50.560 --> 2:59:04.560]  many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals

[2:59:53.560 --> 3:00:00.560]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCN radio network
[3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:23.560]  gold is up $16.70 today i'm not going to get too much into that
[3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:39.560]  i'm going to cover some of the first hour and then come up to rebroadcast at the girls linton choices is the washington times exclusive al-qaeda says bio attack from mexico i was on neoconsites months ago with this government operative
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:59.560]  sitting up there saying oh yes we're going to ship anthrax and we have 300 plus thousand u.s. militia members and then they say they're white supremacists so they always take militia as gun owner the dhs reports and they say they are white supremacists so the lies stack on the lies and then they're
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:13.560]  going to kill hundreds of thousands americans with anthrax and then right on time obama is saying this in speeches right as al-qaeda bin laden you know they've done the voice prints this fake tapes pops up you got the grandson of the head of the adl
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:30.560]  adam gadan popping up agreeing you know they do this all at one time in the intel center publicly run by the former head of army black ops and the former head of cia black ops that both work for rumsfeld they run the intel center publicly puts out videos of adam gadan
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:48.560]  and al-qaeda american al-qaeda with the intel center logo loaded in the same video layer as the al-qaeda logo they were put on together at the same time it's the same generation you understand what that means it's totally fake
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:02:01.560]  and then glenn beck comes out let's let's play this clip right now just part of it he comes out and i love america he's always crying he does this fake thing and he'll laugh at you
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:18.560]  like ron paul we need to use the army against american people and i've talked about this and holy alliance of al-qaeda and the militias which is all with the dhs report says which is all what the feds have been saying since oklahoma city when they had Arabs with mcvey in that government operation
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:33.560]  but for some reason pulled back from saying Arabs were involved and i predicted for in the future to bring that back out and claim that Arabs and al-qaeda work with american gun owners to sick homeland security on the american people which is now happening years later
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:36.560]  here's the clip
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:51.560]  he goes on to suggest that al-qaeda will work with what he claims are three hundred thousand american white supremacist militias who also hate the u.s. government if you're a longtime viewer of my program you know that i've been talking about that
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:03:16.560]  unholy alliance for a while there is no need for airplanes conspiracies timings and so on one person with the courage to carry four pounds of anthrax will go to the white house lawn and will spread the confetti all over them
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:21.560]  and then we will do these cries of joy
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:46.560]  this is something i mean is this just a non-sense recruiting or is this something that we do have evidence that he really used this and he has the ability to do this
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:04:01.560]  this is an exclusive al-qaeda is bio attack from mexico in the news said the flu is al-qaeda al-qaeda is a cia program named brzezinski brags about it al-qaeda was used to attack the serbs the russians they to take the blame for attacking the u.s.
[3:04:01.560 --> 3:04:20.560]  and the white house admits they are using al-qaeda the number three in al-qaeda to attack iran bomb their mosque and airplanes to bring down the shia government but they think our media is so dumb and they think our people are so dumb the globalists say iran is backing al-qaeda when i ran a shia
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:35.560]  and then israel admits they founded hezbollah hamas israel admits they founded hamas to counter hezbollah which is shia so again ladies and gentlemen the military industrial complex is taking america over
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:47.560]  it needs to have an excuse what's going to stage terror attacks as a pretext put north com on the streets of this country and it's all designed in north com admits their main mission is fighting american gun owners farmer veterans
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:05:02.560]  to do that they got to say veterans and gun owners are al-qaeda working with the white supremacist and that's the script blend back and the washington times are putting out we told you they would
[3:05:02.560 --> 3:05:18.560]  hi this is steve shank e-foods does it again the three day responder provides one adult with three days worth of healthy delicious easy fix food the price of the three day responder is almost ridiculous at twenty seven dollars and ninety five cents for actually twelve meals plus snacks

[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:21.560]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:06:21.560 --> 3:06:37.560]  well obama is already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:06:37.560 --> 3:06:52.560]  it's not about left or right it's about a one world government this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda get your copy of the obama deception today at info wars dot com

[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  and being proactive the first rule of close combat is to attack the attacker
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:00.560]  action is faster than reaction the same holds true for the future
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:09.560]  you know the future is coming attack it before it attacks you founder the trends research institute nineteen eighty gerald salante is a pioneer trend strategist
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:22.560]  he is author of the national bestseller trends two thousand and trend tracking Warner books and far better than mega trends and publisher of the internationally circulated trends journal newsletter
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:31.560]  and that's putting it lightly he's made a lot of accurate predictions been very accurate for i mean for decades and we always enjoy having
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:38.560]  gerald salante up here because we understand that we need to see where the leader going with the globalists are setting up what's happening in the future
[3:09:38.560 --> 3:09:49.560]  gerald you and i and many others predicted gm would go bankrupt they're hacking it up in pieces giving it to china russia and brazil the public doesn't seem to know that
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:58.560]  even though it's in bloomberg in the news it's buried that we're paying the bailout money through world trade organization agreements that the bailout money can't be spent
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:07.560]  exclusively here so large portions have to be spent internationally so we're paying to have it shipped out overseas banks are collapsing real estate market you predicted
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:16.560]  a year ago on the show is you know really imploding faster and you said the big thing would be commercial real estate now that's accelerating
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:24.560]  they're openly announcing youth brigades red and black uniforms replace a video of that we found a new bill bermas did earlier
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:33.560]  as you recover tonight nine to midnight here on the present planet dot tv recover that with you where they openly say again national compulsory service
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:41.560]  it's even though you and i predicted this is coming and many others have seen you know the tyranny it's still hard to believe it's actually manifesting
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:54.560]  gerol solante it is hard to believe it it began up really under info blast under bush with his top programs and buying out as we did with
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:07.560]  Bear Stearns was at thirty billion they guaranteed that sale to i believe it was jp morgan to take over fanny and freddie the mortgage companies owning
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:21.560]  AIG the world's largest insurance company now Chrysler and GM and as we know the definition of the merger of corporate state powers
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:33.560]  is called fascism according to Mussolini we knew a thing or two about it and that's what we're seeing now the first stages of a recalling fascism light
[3:11:33.560 --> 3:11:45.560]  and you're pointing it out very well with the uniforms the compulsory service the compulsory service and and all of the steps that they're taking
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:56.560]  where the government is now being fringing deeper and deeper into our lives to the point where now one out of every six dollars
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:08.560]  that are being spent in this country is coming from the government so it's a trend that happened really in in a little over a year
[3:12:08.560 --> 3:12:19.560]  where America went from the world's greatest entrepreneurial country where no one was too big to save where or to fail
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:32.560]  where now the rest of us are too small to save and we're becoming servants of the major companies again current events form future trends
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:43.560]  we just look at the expansion plans for Walmart it's very ironic they used to say as goes General Motors or was good for General Motors is good for America
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:55.560]  and now we can say as goes Walmart so goes America Walmart's cool way they're going to create another with a bragging about a 22,000 jobs
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:13:05.560]  would be compare those to the jobs we used to have when this country had a manufacturing base Walmart I mean don't they on the whole food chain
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:15.560]  they feel kind of the vulture or maggot position that sure the vultures and maggots do well when the rest of the economy is dead but only for a time
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:25.560]  well that's exactly in the kind of jobs they they produce I mean who really wants to go to college or anywhere else even get a high school degree
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:32.560]  and then be relegated to working at Walmart you know I know a lot of folks with college degrees you are working at the grocery store
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  or Walmart and they're not too happy that's something else you talk about the college bubble but go ahead
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:45.560]  so what we're doing is when you hear these advertisements Alex where Walmart brags about you know every day low prices
[3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:56.560]  well sure every day low we're turning into a Walmart economy every day low prices with every day low prices comes every day low paying jobs
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:04.560]  with every day low paying jobs comes every day low quality so every day America is sinking lower and lower
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  the GM bailout in this country it should be I believe that these people in Congress from the president down should be being brought up on criminal charges
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:27.560]  after abrogating our Constitution and becoming so involved in private industry to the levels that they've become
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:38.560]  and when you read their their in defense for it they use quotes like well we had to do this and we hope to be what do you mean you had to do this
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.560]  who said you had to do this certainly not the American people
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:50.560]  notice Gerald Salente that the more they do the worse it gets for all of us but the better for them and this is my question for you
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:57.560]  and then finish the point we're making is that we have the IMF and World Bank bragging about imploding third world nations by design
[3:14:57.560 --> 3:15:04.560]  buying off their governments destroying confidence in the supposed recovery then consolidating even more
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  the big government system the big central banks offshore George Soros saying he's having a great crisis culmination of his life
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:19.560]  they're bragging that they love it everything's falling apart because then they are flush with all the fiat currency and credit they create
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:26.560]  of nothing they get to buy up all the real assets they get to pose as the saviors of the crisis they created
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:33.560]  they're openly announcing a new bank of the world will pay our carbon taxes too they're telling us the new recovery is lower quality
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:44.560]  less jobs less freedom less mobility so they're advertising bondage and chains as the recovery I mean they know these people are crazy like a fox
[3:15:44.560 --> 3:15:57.560]  or do you disagree well you know to some extent yes and no in the sense that I think they're crazy like a fox in that the objective is to take control of our lives
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:09.560]  and they're doing it in every way possible and they use these crises not that they're so much as manufactured but they exploit them for everything that they're worth
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:20.560]  and that as Rahm Emanuel had noted that you never let a good crisis be squandered and that's what they're really doing as we see it
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:29.560]  the second thing Alex is in building on what you said is one of our forecast as you know we're calling for the bailout bubble
[3:16:29.560 --> 3:16:37.560]  and work and just briefly we had first the dot com I gotta stop you you said that first I remember like a year ago or nine ten months ago
[3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:43.560]  now they're calling it bailout bubble on the news without giving you credit sorry go ahead well that happens a lot doesn't it
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:52.560]  yeah so now the bailout first thing we had well not first but the most recent was the dot com bubble
[3:16:52.560 --> 3:17:01.560]  the dot com bubble burst five trillion dollars is lost in the markets rather than what they're too big to fail friends lose big money
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:08.560]  they created the other bubble they lowered interest rates to 46 year lows flooded the marketplace with cheap money
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:14.560]  again every time they do that they devalue our standard of living but they created the real estate bubble
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:22.560]  go out and borrow on your house it's a piggy bank want to build that new addition go on a vacation buy a new car it's cheap
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:30.560]  just go do it they created the next bubble that bubble burst and of course they love to blame the little people not talking about
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:41.560]  everything's leveraged buyout firms like Carlisle and and Blackstone and Seribus on and on who bought companies of virtually no money
[3:17:41.560 --> 3:17:48.560]  down with tens of billions of dollars that was where the real credit crisis happened by the way and by the way I before you
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:54.560]  I forget let me bring this up I'm sure you've seen all the news where they do stress tests on healthy banks and the government says
[3:17:54.560 --> 3:18:02.560]  no you haven't done well so the bank plunges and then the government basically hands it over to Carlisle I mean this is just piracy
[3:18:02.560 --> 3:18:10.560]  well again look who's involved with Carlisle look at the members of the Carlisle group you know they're there it's the it's the
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:18.560]  bush it's the bush wing of the mafia you know so as we look at the players you know where the money goes follow the money
[3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:26.560]  so now we have the bailout bubble and this really what we're talking about now is that and building on what you said
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:34.560]  now when this bubble burst and it's going to burst when this one burst is no way to reinflate another bubble
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:41.560]  this is the mega bubble this is the fake complete the Coot-A-Gross this is the final bubble the final bubble because now what's
[3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:50.560]  happened is unlike those other bubbles our economic superstructure has been changed because now government has printed
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:19:02.560]  phantom money out of thin air based on nothing producing practically nothing has taken equity positions in private enterprise
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:12.560]  with executive control and management powers over these corporations so now when this breaks there's nothing left to refill it
[3:19:12.560 --> 3:19:25.560]  and here's the next step with each failure they create an even bigger failure we are concerned that after this bubble breaks
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:32.560]  the next crisis they create will be taking us to war they do it all the time
[3:19:32.560 --> 3:19:41.560]  stay there Gerald Salente break that down we get back and by the way what he's saying mirrors with Paul Watson wrote about
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:51.560]  six months ago the rand corporation this is big news in Europe not on the news here said we need a world war two size global crisis
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:59.560]  to be able to get us out of this and they call it a bubble so they're certainly doing some trends forecasting over at
[3:19:59.560 --> 3:20:06.560]  rand in a very wicked way you ever thought about what's in your shampoo so per detergent how about chlorides dies ethanol
[3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:14.560]  sulfate sodium formaldehyde and more even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4000 separate ingredients most of which are
[3:20:14.560 --> 3:20:21.560]  synthetic hi this is Alex Jones I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing

[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:20.560]  would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:27.560]  while Obama's already fucking yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:37.560]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:46.560]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told

[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:41.560]  it's going to cause rioting and revolution they don't care they're all buying duchies off shore and by the way I know quite a few
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:52.560]  millionaires they evacuated years ago they know what you're also going to know is they know what we know this is the
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:25:01.560]  court of the crimson king of the time this is done a lot of blood is going to flow on the streets I'm not looking forward to it
[3:25:01.560 --> 3:25:08.560]  and all you foolish petty tyrants that serve the system I really feel sorry for you because California is already going
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:15.560]  to grow predicted on the show eight nine months ago Gerald Salento you were getting into the new mega bubble a cascade of
[3:25:15.560 --> 3:25:24.560]  failures starting a war let's get into that because as bad as this news is it's better to know what's coming I mean if I lived
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:29.560]  in a valley and somebody called me and said the dam just broke you'll be in 20 feet of water in 10 minutes get out of
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:35.560]  there I'd be I would thank them that I could get to high ground we get bitched at because the delusional public thinks
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:43.560]  some of them that all will just be positive and and if we just make up it's okay it'll be okay they'd rather not be
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:51.560]  warned that the dam just broke up strange Harold and well that's it I mean people living on illusion they don't want to
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:26:01.560]  face the reality and of course this is a Disney world and people do live in it we were talking about the war Alex of
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:09.560]  course you know we're not saying that this is going to happen we're saying it's likely to happen considering the trends
[3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:17.560]  that are taking place they're adding up to it each time again that's why we're talking about one bubble after the next
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:25.560]  with each bubble they reinflated to a bigger bubble to get a bigger bubble and then when there's nothing else left to do
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:34.560]  they come in bold and by their failures and they take you to war you go throughout history and it's this is historical
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:42.560]  they do it all the time they can no longer cover up their failures that's what ran corporation says they say World War
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:48.560]  two got us out of the depression we need something that big and they look at Korea they look at Iran they discuss
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:58.560]  how to start a war my god it looks like at this moment and from listening to president Obama he's putting a lot of
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:08.560]  focus on Pakistan yeah and we're seeing what's happening there as the war is being prosecuted and of course they're
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:18.560]  escalated the Afghan war put in a new commander and the crystal and it's spreading into afghan and there's a there's a crisis
[3:27:18.560 --> 3:27:27.560]  going on over there now in the Swat Valley over a million people who have been homes have been displaced and so what happens
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:36.560]  is this is a very logical progression the more people you kill in foreign countries the more they hate you and the more
[3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:46.560]  they're going to want to retaliate so what we're we're forecasting is there's going to be a retaliatory strike against the
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:56.560]  United States coming out of the Middle East as a result of our escalation of wars in those areas what will happen is
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:28:06.560]  they'll call it terrorism rather than getting it even getting even and they'll blame it on people that hate our liberty and
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:14.560]  freedoms and they'll escalate it into something bigger it's an old story and it will be repeated just the players will
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:26.560]  change the lines will be almost the same so we're talking about encirclement of Russia Pakistan India Kashmir with Pakistan and
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:34.560]  Afghanistan escalating North Korea out of control you can just see all the fires all over that that that that crescent there
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:45.560]  from from Eastern Europe all the way into Southeast Asia I mean this is just horrifying what's what's your timeline on this
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:54.560]  well again it's very difficult to put a timeline on these because you know for example in our we had we had predicted
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:29:04.560]  that the crash of 09 would have taken place already we believe that would have happened in March and it was right on schedule to do so
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:13.560]  the market hit a low in March 9th but they come up with schemes undreamed of who would have thought for example as you pointed out
[3:29:13.560 --> 3:29:22.560]  that so much has changed with this country where now we own General Motors with 60% owners of this company who would have dreamed
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:32.560]  that they would be pumping $12.8 trillion into the system unbelievable Gerald Salente stay there quick break long segment coming up

[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:33.560]  the problem is the establishment isn't listening it doesn't care so how do solutions even matter
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:39.560]  well I guess once we overthrow the system the danger will be that some new tyranny will be brought in as Ron Paul has said
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:43.560]  it's very rare to have a revolution that doesn't turn to something as bad or worse
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:48.560]  that's why I'm not all raw, raw revolution unless it's what the founders did
[3:33:48.560 --> 3:33:53.560]  it's so special what this country did I want to talk to someone Gerald before he leaves us about that

[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:22.560]  right is trendsresearch.com that's trendsresearch.com and what we encourage them to do is to look at our past trends journals
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:31.560]  for example we have the top trends of 2008 that they could look at the whole journal and they could judge for themselves
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:37.560]  the model of course of the trends research institute is think for yourself and so they could see what we have forecast
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:45.560]  what has come true and what's going to happen and many of what much of what we've written is in the headlines news today
[3:36:45.560 --> 3:36:56.560]  and about the things to do by the way in survival I'm a strong believer and I do it myself is I buy gold
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:04.560]  and we are forecasting gold 2000 an ounce and you can see again current events form future trends
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:12.560]  we can see they just sent Timothy Geithner our treasury secretary over to China to try to soothe them soothe out the deal
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  because the world is starting to unload dollars you can see for example again current events form future trends
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:28.560]  gold is now moving back toward the thousand dollar an ounce mark crept up very quickly the dollar is again losing against
[3:37:28.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  the key basket of currencies several months ago was 124 to a euro now it's about 142 so the world knows that you cannot print
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:50.560]  phantom money out of thin air based on nothing and producing practically nothing without destroying the economy
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:58.560]  well Gerald interrupt I saw a bunch of news articles I forgot to cover my last few days in fact guys Google this for me
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:05.560]  top insurance company buys gold first time in a straight 400 million they bought
[3:38:05.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  tell folks about that I'm Mr. Salinas I believe it was Northwestern or Northwest mutual they 400 to 200 million dollars worth of gold they bought
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  that's what it said and then I did more searches and found out a bunch of governments like the Chinese the Arabs the Europeans
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:37.560]  and other insurance companies are quietly moving into gold they've never done that what does that tell you Gerald Salente it tells us that
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:45.560]  the fiat currencies particularly the dollar are not going to be worth the paper they're printed on again even when you
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:58.560]  heard the Treasury Secretary excuse me Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke yesterday warning that there's a risk of another crisis on the horizon and they're
[3:38:58.560 --> 3:39:08.560]  not going to be able to print more money to bail us out they're running out of games so the timeline by the way Alex during the summer
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:18.560]  things usually quiet down Europe goes on vacation things start getting real again around September October again you just look through
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:27.560]  history when we saw the crisis that happened in 2008 it happened in September I think it was September 15 it was with
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:39.560]  Lehman Brothers went belly up the biggest bankruptcy in our history AIG crisis Merrill Lynch the and in one after another what happens
[3:39:39.560 --> 3:39:46.560]  is when people come back from vacations they start looking at the books in a lot of different ways they get real about it so September
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  October is one way time to look the other one and this is the one that's going to tell the final story it's going to be Christmas sales
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:40:05.560]  two thousand and nine watch how those sales come in you're going to see them in way way worse than they were last year and they were
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:17.560]  terrible last year then you move into the new year and that's where things in 2010 really start to unravel that's our timeline
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:25.560]  you're saying the only rabbit in the hat they've got that you see for another bubble this is the end of the bubbles unless they start a huge war
[3:40:25.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  yeah but this time it's different than the times before in the sense that this time we'll have wars and weapons of mass destruction
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:43.560]  it's not going to be giant fleets fighting each other in the Pacific or tanks coming at each other over the battlefields
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:53.560]  this will be suitcase size nuclear weapons matter of fact my book trends two thousand which came out in December of 1996
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  the whole front of it was front loaded with the breakup of the former Soviet Union and all of the nuclear materials on the black market
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:10.560]  that was spread throughout the world and they're still out there so we're going to see a very different war
[3:41:10.560 --> 3:41:22.560]  this will be this will be out of control no one will know what to do and the chaos will be beyond what any Hollywood movie could ever dream up
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:33.560]  so you're talking about a black ops special ops war yes again you know anybody could get over into anybody's country it's not a big deal
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:42.560]  borders are very porous I remember writing in the trends journal I believe was nineteen ninety eight about over a hundred suitcase size
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  nuclear weapons were lost in Russia we lost you know so it's going to be that kind of thing weapons of mass destruction
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:42:03.560]  we call the W.W.M.D. three world wars okay I want to go over that with you because you know you've talked about it government sponsored terror
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:11.560]  there's certainly some real terror and real wars between powers but look at these global banks they're bringing in their world government
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:17.560]  they're using the global crisis to get their global carbon tax they engineered the crisis whether by design or by their idiocy
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  the point is they're clearly getting power and control out of it now they need to have a world government come into place out of this
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:31.560]  bigger crisis they need to have a war just like they used to World War one to get League of Nations World War two to get you in
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:38.560]  now they say we need one more big war to bring in the final world government I see all the evidence that this is planned out
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  and if suitcase nukes aren't brought in if somebody isn't stupid enough to attack then I see them staging it because it's the only bubble
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:56.560]  the only crisis that they have left to bring them into power so I agree with what you say Gerald and I see them making the preparations
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:05.560]  hardening government facilities preparing tattletale squads domestic infrastructure DHS reports that Americans are terrorists youth brigades
[3:43:05.560 --> 3:43:14.560]  I see huge industrial buildup for war against the people north com making announcements you said this a year ago we've been talking about it for a long time
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:22.560]  Zollick warns stimulus sugar high won't stem unemployment what you just said with Bernanke saying the money has to end because they've already bought everything up
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:31.560]  he says unemployment increases that will cause political combustible issue and destabilization and conflict
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:41.560]  he says rising joblessness threatens to set off political unrest across the globe so they're saying this but like beaters beating the bushes to drive out
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:50.560]  you know the mastodons over the cliff where the mastodons this is all crazy like a fox going right towards their world government
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:44:03.560]  so Gerald Salente your take on that whether they whether they cause it or exploit it it's going to happen in the sense that you also have worldwide on West Latvia
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:21.560]  we sorted in Greece Iceland you're seeing it in France you look what's happening over in Spain the unemployment rate is almost 20% Ireland the UK and in the US you're going to start seeing it happening
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:31.560]  whether or not and then again as I said they are fermenting war in the Middle East with the escalation in Afghanistan and in Pakistan
[3:44:31.560 --> 3:44:44.560]  so that's clearly a false flag that I mean clearly there they know they're stirring up the pot on purpose exactly so whether or not they create the terror or the terror is created from their actions
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:45:04.560]  one way or another they're setting the stage for it so what we're saying at this point is that the escalation of the Afghan Pakistan wars are setting the stage for terrorism at 9-11 levels again whether manufactured or real
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:23.560]  we're going to see it and the people look you look at the poll data now most people are in favor of these wars in the United States so if they say you know we're being attacked by Islam or fascist because they hate our liberty and freedom the people are going to swallow it again
[3:45:23.560 --> 3:45:38.560]  Gerald Salente Trans forecaster what did you think about or did you see the Pakistan president they're saying why are you helping terrorists he goes Al-Qaeda Taliban was created by the US against the Russians and pushed
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:54.560]  you guys are using them to destabilize us which is what's really going on you know they don't control all the groups but they you know they nudge them and fund them and stir them up and he made that point and the person interviewing them on NBC kind of shut up
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:45:59.560]  it seems like this trick is starting to wear a bit thin
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:16.560]  precisely as a matter of fact in this next trend journal summer edition that'll be coming out in a few weeks we're reviewing the history of Pakistan which we had written about when they assassinated Benazir Bhutto in January I believe it was December 2007
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:36.560]  and now her husband Zidari is the president of Pakistan well they used to call him Mr. 10% because he's to take 10% of all of the government action he did try to jail for being accused of raping the government of five billion dollars
[3:46:36.560 --> 3:46:42.560]  I mean it's one criminal enterprise after another and we're in the thick of it
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:44.560]  absolutely
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:53.560]  Gerald Salente I don't know if you've seen this yet it just came out last night Washington Times playing some one of millions you know crazy
[3:46:53.560 --> 3:47:13.560]  emoms bragging about if we had one fighter to bring anthrax to America and kill hundreds of thousands I've seen this months ago they take this like it's breaking news and say he works with the gun owning militia then they time militia to white supremacist same thing that they do in the DHS report that says gun owners veterans are the number one threat
[3:47:13.560 --> 3:47:35.560]  and we see all of homeland security north com being set up to suppress to suppress a legitimate revolution by the American people or restoration what you've been predicting we've got Zolik at the World Bank saying this is coming they're clearly now swinging around the homeland security system the apparatus to point it at the
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  American people saying we are al-qaeda so they clearly know they're about to do some things politically where they're gonna sick homeland security on the general public and they're training local police departments nationwide this is confirmed that veterans will come back and bomb you with IEDs and that the veterans work with al-qaeda do you think this new load of bull is going to sell
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:19.560]  well again if there's an attack of any kind whether it's a manufactured or legitimate the people respond very quickly by fear as we saw with Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-qaeda they're swallowing most of what's said to them
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:27.560]  but now they're gonna say the gun owners are the terrorists they're gonna say oh al-qaeda hit us take the people's guns the gun owners are al-qaeda I mean that is really over the top
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:37.560]  we don't believe by the way that that second amendment rights will be repealed I mean that's that's our our strong advocate of second amendment rights
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:39.560]  why because they can't get away with it
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:51.560]  they can they will not be able to get away with it no matter how hard they try you're gonna have states that are gonna be more stringent than others but overall they're not gonna be able to stop it the protest will be too too strong
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:49:07.560]  we will say that in our lifetime unless of course there's something beyond anything that we're talking about right now that happens they will not get away with taking away our second amendment rights
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:17.560]  well I agree we've got a good chance the pro-gun cultures growing women are getting into guns people are finding out how great it is to defend yourself but what I'm asking is I really want your opinion on this is
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:37.560]  the homeland security documents that we broke it makes a nexus between gun owners veterans and says they're the number one threat and basically are al-qaeda are white supremacists now I'm seeing that as a drumbeat white al-qaeda it's totally asinine that white al-qaeda works for bin Laden is gonna release anthrax
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:46.560]  what I'm saying is clearly they're trying to get ready to sick north com on the American people I mean how asinine is that in your view a b will they get away with it
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:50:02.560]  well I don't think that that's going to be one of their first steps and yes they can get away with anything at any given time if the conditions are right but we wouldn't see that as the issue right now
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:20.560]  well they've got a lot of hoots but though to try to try anything out but you know that and then they keep throwing out these trial balloons to see how far they'll go but the thing that we have to watch out for on an individual basis as we see it right now is an economic meltdown
[3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:34.560]  and people making sure and then those and then for example with the seed companies you're talking about planting your own gardens being as self-sufficient as possible understanding where your money is will you be able to get a hold of it
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:43.560]  finding careers that are going to pay because you're not going to be able to get a job going to college with a useless degree that they're putting out now
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:54.560]  stay there final segment with Gerald Salente will put his website up on screen for you friendsresearch.com friendsresearch.com my sites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:51:01.560]  just always amazing having Gerald Salente on final segment straight ahead we'll talk about how he sees the economy unfolding here
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:13.560]  you already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher

[3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:14.560]  we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
[3:52:14.560 --> 3:52:21.560]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[3:52:21.560 --> 3:52:25.560]  while Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:52:25.560 --> 3:52:36.560]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism

[3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:03.560]  Gerald Salente in the four minutes we have left man I can have a million more questions for you break it down
[3:55:03.560 --> 3:55:18.560]  you say Christmas is going to be really bad then we go into 2010 how do you see this unfolding you know towards depression and then how do you see the establishment responding
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:25.560]  you've already said war but specifically domestically what's this going to look like domestically we're going to see crime go through the roof
[3:55:25.560 --> 3:55:37.560]  yeah they actually argue that as economic conditions to crime crime doesn't work yes it does and not at all kinds of crime but top down
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:51.560]  there's going to be more scammers with fevery Wall Street doing more deals to steal every penny they can get crime is going to increase in terms also of gang violence
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:56:05.560]  we're already seeing in the numbers of course you know people buying guns buying safe only only the people that can't read the handwriting on the wall are going to be caught with what's going to happen
[3:56:05.560 --> 3:56:14.560]  because we're moving in to what we're saying unequivocally it's going to be the greatest depression and it's going to be worldwide
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:33.560]  again the data doesn't lie globally the trade is off over 20% you can't keep business going with those kind of numbers we're going to see a temporary reprieve because of all of the money they're dumping into the system
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:47.560]  so that's going to knock people off they're going to believe there's going to be the green shoots of recovery but when you dump this money manure all over the planet as they're doing now with the tens of trillions of dollars
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:57:05.560]  it's going to look like recovery but it's not going to be so when it collapses from this one down boy you better be in a good place you better have a job that's going to be we withstand depression proof tremors because a lot of people aren't going to make it
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:24.560]  house foreclosures are going to skyrocket and the commercial real estate bubble is already popped they're just not announcing it absolutely you know a lot of different animals dolphins ferrets they know when a hurricane or tornado is coming a day before an earthquake
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:34.560]  do you think the public sees the political changes or do you think they instinctively are buying all the guns and safe off the shelves I mean that tells me the public's ready to ready to defend themselves
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:49.560]  not so much against the government normally my reasons for example of owning weapons is to defend myself against the lunatics that are running out in the street
[3:57:49.560 --> 3:58:00.560]  uneducated, wrapped out on drugs, their minds are blown, the bank right around the corner from me the key bank in Kingston New York was robbed twice in a week
[3:58:00.560 --> 3:58:09.560]  oh I know crime is just exploding in the news and saying it's not and the police are under attack and then they're acting crazy as well just society's going nuts
