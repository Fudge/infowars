[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.000]  I have been almost completely silent on the oil well fire that's been going on
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  off the shore of Louisiana since the day before Earth Day last week hundreds
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.840]  and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil spilling into the gulf
[00:41.840 --> 00:48.680]  of Mexico but I've reserved comment while I had time to watch things unfold and I
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.560]  do have to say it is very very suspicious now this happened the day before
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.840]  Earth Day this happened weeks after Obama announced limited drilling in the
[00:58.840 --> 01:04.880]  Gulf of Mexico the big suppressor system that all these wells have on it was
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.440]  not activated the explosion was very suspicious and now he said he's
[01:10.440 --> 01:16.600]  dispatching SWAT teams to all of the offshore drilling rigs do you have any
[01:16.600 --> 01:23.320]  idea how many that is I guess that means the rigs that are being drilled right
[01:23.320 --> 01:26.680]  now not all the platforms that have been left out there for
[01:26.680 --> 01:30.960]  maintenance thing wells that have already been drilled for natural gas and
[01:30.960 --> 01:38.200]  oil why would he not say I'm dispatching FBI investigators why would he say SWAT
[01:38.200 --> 01:44.200]  teams special weapons attack teams that's their real name the public as told
[01:44.200 --> 01:48.120]  they are special weapons and tactics why would you dispatch special weapons
[01:48.120 --> 01:53.520]  attack teams that's the original name given by the L.A. police chief to the
[01:53.520 --> 01:59.680]  SWAT teams in the 60s and 70s why would he be doing that and and and saying it
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.240]  may be a terrorist event now that's what they're starting to to hint at very
[02:05.240 --> 02:13.920]  very suspicious it stinks to high heaven and we'll be discussing it coming up in
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.760]  the next segment also playing a clip of Obama announcing he will be sending SWAT
[02:17.760 --> 02:25.440]  teams to the oil rigs period all the oil rigs whatever that means just
[02:25.440 --> 02:31.120]  completely ridiculous as if SWAT teams running around in their black ski mask
[02:31.120 --> 02:38.560]  you're going to find something on the oil rigs this is just asinine but it
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.560]  could have just been a natural occurrence an accident though it's
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.120]  suspicious and they're just grandstanding I mean of if a thunderstorms
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.480]  coming dispatch a SWAT team if your kids got low grades dispatch a SWAT team if
[02:49.480 --> 02:54.600]  you've got cancer dispatch a SWAT team they just wave a magic submachine gun
[02:54.600 --> 03:01.720]  wand and all the problems are handled what are the SWAT teams going to do I
[03:01.720 --> 03:06.120]  guess they're now our chief investigators here in this country just
[03:06.120 --> 03:11.720]  ridiculous I thought SWAT teams were for hostage situations well now they're
[03:11.720 --> 03:14.920]  for everything in fact in the last 10 years we've seen police departments
[03:14.920 --> 03:18.920]  across the country having SWAT teams at checkpoints searching people it's all
[03:18.920 --> 03:26.320]  about domination and intimidation as the federal government grabs every form of
[03:26.320 --> 03:33.640]  unconstitutional power unto themselves continuing Fed opens criminal probe of
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.680]  Goldman Sachs will be getting into that US economy grows at 3.2% in the first
[03:38.680 --> 03:41.960]  quarter if you believe that I've got a bridge I'd like to sell you this is the
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.240]  same group that tells us we have a 9% unemployment rate when all the other
[03:46.240 --> 03:52.480]  independent economists say it's above 22 speaking of that Spain jobless rate
[03:52.480 --> 04:00.360]  tops 20% adds to debt worries Portugal's now being brought down the circling
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.760]  drain the circling debt black hole created by Goldman Sachs and others why
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.880]  doesn't Spain just lie and and say it's 9% like the US does of course they may
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.800]  be doing that it may be more like 35% some estimates have it at 35% they're
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.320]  lying as well so I guess when we're 35% unemployment they'll say it's a 20 20
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.080]  percent here in the United States just don't just lie to people that's I mean
[04:23.080 --> 04:28.000]  why not they've told millions of lies why not tell a few more grief needs
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.200]  austerity measures to survive the Prime Minister says that's right raise all
[04:32.200 --> 04:37.120]  your taxes he says and cut your benefits kind of like the IMF announced last week

[08:12.440 --> 08:19.960]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[08:19.960 --> 08:23.600]  alex jones
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.920]  former to us congressman james trafficant will be joining us in the third
[08:33.920 --> 08:41.920]  hour today and we've got Wayne madson of Wayne madson report national security
[08:41.920 --> 08:51.720]  reporter he has got several new sources and he's written a very important
[08:51.720 --> 08:57.080]  article that we have up on info wars comm prison planet comm detailing the
[08:57.080 --> 09:05.560]  national security group through the compartmentalized NSA that ran the 9
[09:05.560 --> 09:15.400]  11 attacks and of course identifies as the previous information all has the
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.000]  Dick Cheney was of course running the operation on 9 11 so that's in the last
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.200]  30 minutes of the broadcast today of course Ron Paul's been warning the
[09:27.200 --> 09:31.520]  public about this for a long time I've been warning the public every immigration
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.840]  reform bill they brought forward just legalizes all illegals let's unlimited
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.680]  numbers come in and issues them instantly a national ID worker card and
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.760]  makes the American people have one to have a job now they've already
[09:46.760 --> 09:49.760]  standardized the driver's license they're already a national ID card and the
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.800]  real ID act but this goes a step further and here's the hill newspaper
[09:54.800 --> 10:01.240]  Democrats spark alarm with call for national ID card here's another one from
[10:01.240 --> 10:09.280]  yahoo news national ID card included in Democratic immigration bill US immigrants
[10:09.280 --> 10:18.280]  plan huge May 1st marches for reform hey illegal immigrants almost to a man you
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.080]  vote for big government and an anti-second amendment so of course I'm
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.040]  against you just out of the gates on that front then I happen to read the
[10:26.040 --> 10:31.320]  legislation unlike you and I know this means a total open North American Union
[10:31.320 --> 10:35.880]  and I will have to have a worker ID card to have a job it will track
[10:35.880 --> 10:40.680]  everything I do and of course that ties into the health care where the IRS will
[10:40.680 --> 10:43.720]  garnish your wages if you don't have government health care and tracks
[10:43.720 --> 10:47.400]  everything your employers are doing and adds a new layer of expensive
[10:47.400 --> 10:55.440]  bureaucracy that's another reason I'm against what's going on here the
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.760]  globalist are hell bent to get rid of every nation on Earth's borders so the
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.120]  global corporate stake and have its way with the population now Obama is saying
[11:06.120 --> 11:11.440]  he is taking immigration reform off the agenda remember last year's fordson
[11:11.440 --> 11:17.560]  anger said he was going to vote against that he was not going to sign the bill
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.560]  basically registers everyone's ammo when they buy it makes you register to buy
[11:22.560 --> 11:31.000]  ammo and he said he was going to vote against it or veto another bill that made
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.080]  firearms basically put imprints on every casing to track you know who
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.120]  supposedly bought the ammunition or he who used it or what firearm discharged
[11:43.120 --> 11:51.600]  it and then he did sign both of those bills and so this is a tactic they use
[11:51.600 --> 11:58.440]  to lessen citizen lobbying to kind of shut people down it's like Vietnam the
[11:58.440 --> 12:08.480]  Tet offensive supposedly you know the new year and the holiday and people are going
[12:08.480 --> 12:12.600]  to be out getting drunk and having a good time and of course that's when the
[12:12.600 --> 12:18.160]  communist launch their biggest offensive of that decade long war that's the same
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.960]  thing I don't believe this for a minute when Obama says zig I zag when he says
[12:23.960 --> 12:29.360]  down I say up when he says left I say right when he says jump I stay still I
[12:29.360 --> 12:37.040]  don't believe this for one millisecond and what they're going to do is try to
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.720]  attach immigration reform on the other bills and that's now actually being
[12:40.720 --> 12:46.800]  admitted in the fine print so that's all that's going on here more deception
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.840]  just like six months ago their Copenhagen treaty failed or five and a half
[12:50.840 --> 12:54.120]  months ago and so they just came right back and called it a global financial
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.320]  regulation treaty signed between the G20 to set up global taxation on all
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.880]  financial transactions including individual transactions to be paid to the
[13:03.880 --> 13:10.040]  top elite banks that's why the Federal Reserve is supporting the International
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.720]  Treaty that's why the Federal Reserve is supporting the quote reform bill the
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.800]  Federal Reserve is the holding company the consortium of the robber barons and
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.880]  they're gonna be able to gobble up all their competition that's why local and
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.280]  regional banks are against it and all the big mega banks are for it but it's
[13:28.280 --> 13:34.120]  being billed in the media as a way to get Goldman Sachs when Goldman Sachs CEO is
[13:34.120 --> 13:38.600]  actually out there promoting the legislation I mean it's not hard to
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.600]  figure out what's going on here and you know the problem is the GOP yesterday
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.960]  ended their filibuster blocking financial reform bill of course you read
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.920]  these articles they never tell you what's in the bill well I've scanned over it
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.160]  and I've read what other analysts have said about the bill what Ron Paul said
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.640]  about the bill without a doubt it gives the Federal Reserve almost complete
[13:58.640 --> 14:01.600]  dictatorial power over the whole economy you've heard Judge Napolitano who's
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.080]  analyzed the bill and a previous incarnation talk about how even a hot
[14:06.080 --> 14:12.560]  dog stand will be regulated all businesses everything anything has to do
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.680]  with the economy the Federal Reserve will control it these are the same people
[14:16.680 --> 14:19.680]  that engineered the housing collapse we now have the internal Goldman Sachs
[14:19.680 --> 14:23.160]  documents do you say but that's the Federal Reserve yeah yeah piloted by
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.920]  former Goldman Sachs executives they are in every key position every key
[14:27.920 --> 14:35.600]  position not just here Greece Chile England Portugal Spain New Zealand
[14:35.600 --> 14:40.280]  Australia just randomly go check a country that's being imploded by banks
[14:40.280 --> 14:43.680]  right now and they're having quote bailouts which are just robberies and
[14:43.680 --> 14:47.880]  in every case the president the prime minister or the finance minister or all
[14:47.880 --> 14:53.680]  three sometimes some countries have prime ministers and presidents are all
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.880]  Goldman Sachs they're just all Goldman Sachs it's just it's that's it that's
[15:00.880 --> 15:08.680]  the global government oh and so now they have been indicted
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.720]  civilly and a criminal probe has been opened by the Justice Department which
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.440]  is completely financed the entire Obama White House financed by Goldman Sachs
[15:17.440 --> 15:22.760]  and JP Morgan and the other big six mega banks again I say six I say eight I
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.120]  say 10 six one way half a dozen the other there's less than 10 global mega
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.360]  banks and different ratings agencies say between six and 10 but I I'm getting
[15:32.360 --> 15:38.520]  stuck on how many angels can dance on the head of a pin so that is some of
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.100]  what we'll be covering today as well but again James Travacan and Wayne
[15:42.100 --> 15:47.960]  Madsen joining us today that is coming up what I want to do right now is play
[15:47.960 --> 15:53.160]  this a video clip of Obama yesterday announces he will be sending SWAT teams
[15:53.160 --> 16:00.480]  to the oil rigs what is wrong with this picture so I hate to intrude on it but
[16:00.480 --> 16:04.680]  before we begin I do want to speak briefly to the American people about the
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.800]  recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico I've been receiving frequent
[16:09.800 --> 16:14.200]  briefings from members my cabinet and White House staff including an update
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.320]  last night on the additional breach and another update this morning and while
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.960]  BP is ultimately responsible for funding the cost of response and cleanup
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.480]  operations my administration will continue to use every single available
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.600]  resource at our disposal including potentially the Department of Defense
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.680]  to address the incident earlier today DHS Secretary Napolitano announced that
[16:37.680 --> 16:41.720]  this incident is of national significance and the Department of
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.680]  Interior has announced that they will be sending SWAT teams to the Gulf to
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.160]  inspect all platforms and rates and I haven't ordered the Secretaries of
[16:50.160 --> 16:54.040]  Interior and Homeland Security as well as Administrator Lisa Jackson the
[16:54.040 --> 16:58.840]  Environmental Protection Agency to visit the site on Friday to ensure that BP and
[16:58.840 --> 17:02.680]  the entire US government is doing everything possible not just to
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.840]  respond to this incident but also to determine its cause and then CBS News is
[17:07.840 --> 17:15.760]  reporting that they are looking at terrorism this is a giant drilling
[17:15.760 --> 17:19.000]  platform that costs hundreds of millions of dollars what they're saying the rigs
[17:19.000 --> 17:27.480]  800 million dollars it's crawling with engineers and roughnecks and petroleum
[17:27.480 --> 17:33.200]  geologists these are not pushover people it's hundreds and hundreds of miles off
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.360]  the coast and 11 people died there were many other witnesses I just said there
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.600]  was a big explosion you don't insert al-qaeda terrorist and black pajamas
[17:43.600 --> 17:48.360]  onto one of these to blow something up so this is just ridiculous and if they
[17:48.360 --> 17:56.360]  say that al-ciatab blew up the rig that is the equivalent of saying the moon is
[17:56.360 --> 18:02.000]  made out of Swiss cheese it is just not true and regardless you don't send
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.280]  SWAT teams to the rigs to check all the rigs there's got to be a thousand of
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.320]  them out there or more he's gonna check all the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico with
[18:14.320 --> 18:20.680]  SWAT teams and notice how everything is psych warfare it's the government has
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.560]  declared this is serious as if they're God as if we when we walk outside in the
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.480]  morning of the Sun comes up we have to go turn the TV on and see if the
[18:29.480 --> 18:32.680]  government says the Sun came up or if there's birds tweeting in a tree we
[18:32.680 --> 18:35.600]  have to I don't know if birds are tweeting in a tree I better go have it
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.920]  announced to me by the government well I remember about two years ago the
[18:40.920 --> 18:48.240]  White House press secretary Perino or whatever her name was the blonde the
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.080]  reporters day after day were asking her is the dollar being devalued has the
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.240]  dollar lost value can the White House say if that's true or not and she would
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.680]  say I cannot comment on that and they'd say well we need I played these
[19:01.680 --> 19:08.360]  clubs we need the White House to tell us as if they couldn't go to any stock
[19:08.360 --> 19:13.120]  market website and look at the US dollar at the time that was plunging as if
[19:13.120 --> 19:17.160]  they can't see the red arrow aiming down and look at the exact number of how
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.640]  much it had fallen none of the US media would report the dollar was falling it
[19:21.640 --> 19:29.320]  was just all over the financial barometers you walk outside it's
[19:29.320 --> 19:33.040]  raining but you just walk around in the rain you walk the dog in the rain you

[19:36.360 --> 19:40.120]  the government didn't tell me it was it was raining outside can the White House
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.240]  tell us if this oil spill is a problem can the White House tell us if the
[19:45.240 --> 19:49.480]  dollars being devalued can the White House tell us if we brushed our teeth
[19:49.480 --> 19:54.600]  this morning and the White House show me how to wipe my behind I mean please can

[24:11.400 --> 24:17.440]  gentlemen April 30th 2010 on this Friday edition then Wayne Madsen with key 9-11
[24:17.440 --> 24:25.400]  info oh they do a bad-bad thing on 9-11
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.640]  yesterday we posted an article in info wars.com prison planet.com that's
[24:40.640 --> 24:46.160]  curtain them on Paul Watson did together and it dealt with documents from
[24:46.160 --> 24:50.800]  training drills going on the last two weeks by the U.S. Army to militarily
[24:50.800 --> 24:56.040]  engage tea parties militias and in the drills the militias and tea party people
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.880]  are drunken racist scum who hate the military so they're training the
[25:01.880 --> 25:08.720]  military to hate the tea parties and the American people this is third grade
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.080]  level brainwashing and that's what the government thinks of the military they
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.560]  think you're complete idiots look our government has been seized by offshore
[25:17.560 --> 25:23.000]  banks our military is being used to carry out evil unlawful wars our country
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.360]  is falling apart and I have confirmed from police from federal police from
[25:28.360 --> 25:31.920]  military and I've gotten the training manuals and we posted them an info
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.200]  wars.com and prison planet.com and we've gotten documents that the news is
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.440]  reported on and confirmed are real that the in the Fed rallies including rallies
[25:41.440 --> 25:47.120]  that I met have the army there surveilling us as terrorists. I mean what's
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.280]  wrong with this picture? Tea party people in the Fed folks we are not
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.400]  terrorists and you know it and this just really brings home to me just how
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.360]  illegitimate our government is and of course for two years the Pentagon's been
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.000]  announcing homeland brigade they want to jack it up to 400,000 domestic troops
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.200]  working with local police and now almost all of their training is demonization
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.640]  of the American people and preparing the military to wage war on the American
[26:18.640 --> 26:24.320]  people and hey this has happened in Russia and China and Mexico and Nazi
[26:24.320 --> 26:27.760]  Germany and it's it's it's it's happened everywhere and it's it's
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.040]  happening here and this is what tyranny is it happened in Rome 2,000 years ago
[26:32.040 --> 26:39.120]  and it's such a scyop that the Pentagon gets almost two trillion dollars a year
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.240]  1.1 trillion on budget another 800 billion or so in off budget and that's
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.120]  not even counting the secret of black budget so it's well over two trillion
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.360]  actually but let's just say right at two trillion conservatively two trillion
[26:52.360 --> 26:57.120]  dollars I mean what the income tax brings in about a trillion a year so you
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.080]  guys are getting more money than the income tax brings in you've got all
[27:01.080 --> 27:06.640]  those other taxes of course and they're levying more and the US military budget
[27:06.640 --> 27:12.900]  is bigger than the entire world combined England France Russia China Israel
[27:12.900 --> 27:21.240]  Iran South Africa Mexico Brazil Venezuela bigger budget than all other
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.720]  military expenditures combined that's on record of course the military is going
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.640]  to eat America that's what it does in each countries it sends in black ops it
[27:31.640 --> 27:37.760]  hires terrorist it hires rebel groups it overthrows systems or it backs
[27:37.760 --> 27:43.700]  dictators of course they're training to confiscate our guns of course they're
[27:43.700 --> 27:47.900]  training to round us up of course they're training to suppress the American
[27:47.900 --> 27:51.480]  people who don't want banks taking us over because who do you think runs the
[27:51.480 --> 27:56.440]  Pentagon what did Eisenhower warn you about in 61 in his farewell address have
[27:56.440 --> 28:00.480]  you listened to the full address have you watched it you could search engine
[28:00.480 --> 28:07.880]  in 10 seconds and watch the 14 minute final address okay and I wouldn't be
[28:07.880 --> 28:11.600]  surprised if he was alive today they'd have Pentagon training manuals saying
[28:11.600 --> 28:17.360]  he's a terrorist I've got FEMA on video demonizing George Washington and
[28:17.360 --> 28:22.960]  Thomas Jefferson saying they're bad that's in road to tyranny that that
[28:22.960 --> 28:30.360]  happened before 9 11 that was in 2000 in Kansas City so it's on record that the
[28:30.360 --> 28:40.080]  military trains to confiscate your guns and last night I stayed at late to put
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.320]  together a 10 minute video boiling all this down and documenting it that's
[28:44.320 --> 28:49.000]  going to go up in the next two hours at our YouTube channel and we've got two

[30:12.840 --> 30:16.200]  all performed even golden silver before in this country and it's possible that
[30:16.200 --> 30:19.960]  could even happen again so our friends and solutions from science have put

[33:25.440 --> 33:31.240]  part of the military drills in the last decade but it's all coming to a head
[33:31.240 --> 33:35.560]  now where they're training almost the entire military not just the Army and
[33:35.560 --> 33:40.760]  Marine Corps again I have family in the military I've talked to all of them and
[33:40.760 --> 33:46.400]  every single one of them says yes they are even training the helicopter repair
[33:46.400 --> 33:50.240]  people the people that work on the tanks the people that work on the Humvees
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.120]  they are training the people that are in procurement and the people that are in
[33:55.120 --> 34:02.180]  you know running the canteens everyone is being trained to engage the number one
[34:02.180 --> 34:07.040]  enemy and that is the American people conservative gun owners and returning
[34:07.040 --> 34:10.240]  veterans and we have that in the my act of homeland security reports we have that
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.200]  in countless other documents and now we have it in these two training scenarios
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.280]  used and again not just at Fort Knox in training that's been going on the last
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.480]  two weeks where they have these scenarios where they tell the troops the
[34:26.480 --> 34:30.560]  tea partyers want to kill you the militias want to kill you I mean that's
[34:30.560 --> 34:35.120]  brainwashing we also have all the other confirmed reports and I remember three
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.480]  years ago it came out that the ROTC in San Antonio is exclusively training Army
[34:40.480 --> 34:45.440]  ROTC at the colleges when they have drills on the weekend to take on
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.360]  militias it's just malicious malicious malicious so we have all the documents we
[34:49.360 --> 34:54.880]  have mainstream news articles where oh hey in Arcadia Iowa they're gonna lock
[34:54.880 --> 34:59.240]  down the town and go searching door to door in a gun confiscation drill I mean
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.720]  that was in the newspaper then I had the colonel on and he admitted it and they
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.360]  got a local gun show owner to be part of it and play the part of the American
[35:07.360 --> 35:12.320]  gun dealer there hunting down we called the guy up and he refused to come on he
[35:12.320 --> 35:16.880]  was scared but the I even had the colonel on the show but it's it's it's one
[35:16.880 --> 35:20.760]  thing to have all these documents and even video of it it's another thing to
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.840]  hear the troops call in we had quite a few active duty calling and say
[35:24.840 --> 35:28.160]  absolutely I don't know how much I can tell you well what you're engaged in
[35:28.160 --> 35:32.520]  treason even if you don't like it how much can you tell us it we already know
[35:32.520 --> 35:36.680]  about it but it's just good to hear and I said let me guess I'm being demonized
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.880]  oh absolutely they they say you're a dint of conspiracy that you hate the
[35:40.880 --> 35:45.240]  military that you're causing cop killing well what is the ADL and Southern
[35:45.240 --> 35:48.600]  Barbery Law Center saying in all their public brainwashing then they have
[35:48.600 --> 35:53.080]  their classified intelligence reports they wrote the Mayak together they wrote
[35:53.080 --> 35:58.840]  the Homeland Security master document used by all local police forces and they
[35:58.840 --> 36:04.080]  go in and they teach them and then they they project a video and images of Alex
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.600]  Jones up on the wall they put Ron Paul up on the wall and they say these men are
[36:08.600 --> 36:12.960]  terrorist enablers well you saw them listed last week with the Southern
[36:12.960 --> 36:18.080]  Barbery Law Center Ron Paul myself and Andrew Napolitano as terrorist extremist
[36:18.080 --> 36:23.080]  enablers now now think about that we're a government of the people for the people
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.640]  you buy the people now this is a republic we don't have a king here
[36:26.640 --> 36:32.880]  Ron Paul's got a 82 percent approval rating in the last Gallup poll the the
[36:32.880 --> 36:37.400]  banks have a 1% approval rating in Gallup and Anguson read polls that we've
[36:37.400 --> 36:41.040]  covered here they got thousand to one phone calls against the banker bailout
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.120]  and you read these training manuals for police military you name it and it's
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.480]  their anti-fellow reserve their anti-banking they say the fellow reserve
[36:50.480 --> 36:55.560]  is private their liars they want to attack the banks and it's the army that's
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.520]  dispatched at the end the Fed rallies we have those documents guarding the
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.400]  fellow reserve buildings even though there's no money in them it's just a
[37:05.400 --> 37:11.040]  bureaucratic operation as if grandmas and white people and Hispanics and black
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.360]  people just an average crowd out there peacefully with signs saying stop
[37:15.360 --> 37:20.920]  looting us and there's army there watching you now that's tyranny that's
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.160]  Soviet Russia that's communist China okay period it's evil it's un-American it's
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.720]  tyranny it is banana republic it is despotism it is oppression it is third
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.000]  world cesspit by any gauge meanwhile the southern border has completely
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.400]  collapsed there are deaths every day ranchers being murdered everywhere
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.200]  police being murdered troops being shot at troops being wounded homes being
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.800]  burned down rocket attacks truck bombs going off and it's the back of the
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.320]  newspaper Mexican troops coming across our side of the border firing automatic
[37:55.320 --> 38:01.400]  weapons helicopters coming as now as much as 10 miles in Mexican Marines
[38:01.400 --> 38:07.960]  crawling all over nothing zero just massive organized training to engage
[38:07.960 --> 38:16.360]  the American people that ladies and gentlemen is treason that ladies and
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.760]  gentlemen is corruption that ladies and gentlemen is illegal and the craziest
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.360]  part about this you know I bring this up with the soldiers I talked to in
[38:26.360 --> 38:33.680]  private I bring it up to the officers I talked to in private and I say haven't
[38:33.680 --> 38:36.760]  you noticed though that they're saying there's no world government they're
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.960]  saying the military isn't training to take guns I mean in fact in these training
[38:41.960 --> 38:48.120]  manuals that are public they say these crazy people hate police and America they
[38:48.120 --> 38:52.360]  hate the military they believe private banks are taking over they believe that
[38:52.360 --> 38:59.680]  we're training to confiscate their firearms that's why we're training to
[38:59.680 --> 39:07.560]  confiscate their firearms so let me be very specific here I mean are you guys
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.200]  under total mind control are you as stupid as the Pentagon thinks you are
[39:11.200 --> 39:20.680]  you're there being trained that you have to fight the American people because
[39:20.680 --> 39:27.920]  we're crazy and believe that military is going to be deployed in America for
[39:27.920 --> 39:32.720]  checkpoints and gun confiscation and then you have drills to confiscate our
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.560]  guns to round up dissenters to go door-to-door with pickup list and pick
[39:37.560 --> 39:43.080]  people up I mean that's in this new training exercise US Army trains to
[39:43.080 --> 39:46.480]  confront Tea Party terrorist military personnel below the whistle on the
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.720]  exercise which involve troops taking protesters to concentration camps and I
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.960]  need this up on all our Facebook and all our Twitter accounts we need all of you
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.800]  to put it on your Facebook and Twitter accounts the prison planet comm articles
[39:59.800 --> 40:05.760]  on the right-hand side now on news and focus I want this sent out everywhere we
[40:05.760 --> 40:09.840]  need to get this out because it has the documents it has links to mainstream
[40:09.840 --> 40:13.880]  news with Marine Corps and Army and Homeland Security checkpoints all over
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.640]  the nation with governor saying don't do it and the feds say we're gonna do what
[40:18.640 --> 40:24.200]  we want and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and all of the proof
[40:24.200 --> 40:31.400]  of what's happening Hitler to use the military to take over Germany Julius
[40:31.400 --> 40:37.920]  Caesar did it Lenin did it now did it I mean what do you think these third world
[40:37.920 --> 40:46.320]  dictators how do they do it we know 100% what this is and the mind control is
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.320]  so hardcore that they say here are the Tea Partiers here are the conservatives
[40:51.320 --> 40:54.960]  and in all the manuals and in the new ones and here's the number one threat
[40:54.960 --> 40:59.400]  veterans that know how to use firearms and they're training the Boy Scouts to
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.320]  take them on they put it the New York Times the none of this is debatable it's
[41:03.320 --> 41:07.360]  all a hundred percent on record and they say we are training to take them out
[41:07.360 --> 41:10.840]  and confiscate their guns because they're crazy and think we're coming for
[41:10.840 --> 41:19.920]  their guns I mean that is mind control that's like saying here's some Kool-Aid
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.400]  on the table I've put a teaspoon of cyanide in it enough to kill 30 people
[41:24.400 --> 41:30.200]  and I want you to drink that but don't be a conspiracy theorist and say that I've
[41:30.200 --> 41:35.800]  just put cyanide in front of you it's good lemonade it's good Kool-Aid and
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.880]  then they give the Kool-Aid to somebody else you watch him drink it you watch
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.920]  him have a convulsion fall down dead in 30 seconds maybe a minute they're
[41:43.920 --> 41:50.240]  flopping around vomiting everywhere and they say now drink this it's good Kool-Aid
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.200]  you go you wait a minute your own manual says it's cyanide and I just watch
[41:55.200 --> 42:01.640]  what you just did to that other guy shut up conspiracy theorist drink it I mean I
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.200]  played the head of the European Central Bank at the CFR earlier this week
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.400]  saying oh more than 12 times global governance world government we've
[42:09.400 --> 42:13.240]  planned this forever now was the time we're taking over the planet for private
[42:13.240 --> 42:18.720]  banks they're all over the news admitting it and then I'm knee-deep an FBI
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.000]  federal martial homeland security documents Pentagon documents army
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.920]  documents saying we are insane none of this exists that my friends is mind
[42:31.920 --> 42:38.760]  control that my friends is brainwashing that my friends is off the chart and it
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.400]  is creepy I mean it's hard to believe I'm just some guy who grew up in the
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.480]  suburbs of Dallas Texas I'm somebody who went to college and they told me
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.600]  America was bad the Second Amendment was bad white people were bad I was bad
[42:52.600 --> 42:57.720]  and the world government was good and then in every class didn't matter what
[42:57.720 --> 43:03.280]  what class it was it was it was like a talking point and then I went and would
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.920]  watch CNN and they would say remember the mid-1990s early 1990s world
[43:07.920 --> 43:11.240]  government doesn't exist there's no new world order and I'd seen the president's
[43:11.240 --> 43:15.240]  call for it I'd seen Bill Clinton on MTV say we're gonna confiscate your guns
[43:15.240 --> 43:18.400]  we're gonna get rid of the Second Amendment I've been watching a reared
[43:18.400 --> 43:24.760]  part of the c-span when the Sarah Brady said we will ban guns for a socialist
[43:24.760 --> 43:29.840]  America I mean that's an on-record speech she gave and she wrote an article for a
[43:29.840 --> 43:34.000]  woman's magazine saying the same thing and then I go turn on CNN and they say
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.280]  none of this exists these people are terrorists who talk about it and they're
[43:39.280 --> 43:42.920]  gonna blow things up I'd go wait a minute that that that that's what I was
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.280]  taught in college that's what's on c-span but then they're saying you're a
[43:47.280 --> 43:52.160]  terrorist and then I saw the feds blow up Oklahoma City and I saw local access
[43:52.160 --> 43:57.160]  TV in Austin people had gone from Oklahoma and come down to Austin to air
[43:57.160 --> 44:01.280]  the local newscast unedited with them removing the bombs saying it was blown
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.760]  out and then the story changed then I saw Hoppy Heidelberg the grandeur and I
[44:05.760 --> 44:08.920]  saw Terrence Yakey talking about it then I found out they killed that cop who
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.960]  exposed it and I said I better get down to access TV and do a show I never
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.280]  expected 15 years later it's now been 15 years I was looking at the calendar
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.840]  he's saying 14 it's now been 15 it'll be 16 soon and 15 plus years that I've
[44:25.840 --> 44:33.120]  been doing this I never in my wildest dreams imagined that tens of thousands
[44:33.120 --> 44:36.520]  conservatively and it looks like they're giving almost all the troops this
[44:36.520 --> 44:41.880]  training now that I'm in PowerPoints produced by the Pentagon as if I am the
[44:41.880 --> 44:46.040]  domestic Osama bin Laden and they sit there and tell them that I want to kill
[44:46.040 --> 44:51.560]  the military and that I want to kill cops I mean that is hardcore I'm some guy
[44:51.560 --> 44:57.040]  from outside Dallas who started out on access TV all I do is come up here and
[44:57.040 --> 45:02.480]  cover documents and legislation and proof and make films and try to save my
[45:02.480 --> 45:11.520]  country and what do I get I get a two trillion dollar Pentagon with a huge
[45:11.520 --> 45:19.680]  covert operation surveilling me tracking me calling my wife up threatening her
[45:19.680 --> 45:22.960]  and we and they let us know it's the government they you know they tell her
[45:22.960 --> 45:27.240]  what we were just talking about I mean think about a government like that
[45:27.240 --> 45:30.320]  folks they'll kill you in a minute they'll take your bank account in 10
[45:30.320 --> 45:34.400]  seconds and they're really gauging things right now to see if they can really
[45:34.400 --> 45:39.360]  rape you and to see of all these 18 and 20 year old kids from the slums and the
[45:39.360 --> 45:43.600]  farms I don't think they're stupid but they're they're not street smart and
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.600]  they put them in all this gear and give them machine guns and put project my
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.920]  face up on the wall and say there's the bad man no I'm not the bad man you're
[45:51.920 --> 45:56.120]  the bad man you make me sick and let me tell you something it doesn't scare me
[45:56.120 --> 45:59.240]  okay it doesn't scare me that we've confirmed that I'm in all these
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.120]  manuals that I'm being demonized and I'm being singled out it makes me feel
[46:03.120 --> 46:07.680]  good my life means something I stood up for the truth I'm having a real effect
[46:07.680 --> 46:12.760]  and that tells me you can have an effect too as long as you stay out of the
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.280]  Cointel pro in fighting as long as you stay out of the disinformation as long
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.080]  as you stick to the facts as long as you take action and are commanding and have
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.640]  the info and have confidence you will have an effect in your area and be
[46:23.640 --> 46:27.200]  leaders and we've already affected that leadership role we've already taught
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.920]  people how to be leaders we've already taught people how to take action and
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.240]  never back down and never stop and so we're gonna win this thing one way or
[46:34.240 --> 46:38.200]  another the problem is there's more news out today where the government saying
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.880]  they openly want to spike the water to make us more loving and docile and
[46:41.880 --> 46:44.800]  they're now pushing that folks they're already doing it that's the only way
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.280]  they can win is they've got vaccine viruses that go in and literally
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.280]  attack certain neurons in the brain this is declassified that's already being
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.480]  put in the injections the people are on the sodium fluoride and other more
[46:57.480 --> 47:01.520]  high-tech chemicals that's why people are so docile that's why most women now
[47:01.520 --> 47:05.680]  above 40 have thyroid problems their hair is falling out you're being hit with
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.440]  chemical weapons and we would have already fixed this look we're drugged
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.200]  folks that's why we're drugged we're drugged we're drugged on entertainment
[47:15.200 --> 47:21.520]  and mind control but also on chemicals and that is why many of you cannot get
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.440]  any initiative going because they're spiking your water supply they're
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.360]  spiking the GMO foods you eat in every study they've done they say it's a side
[47:30.360 --> 47:34.840]  effect that sterilizes mammals no it's not a side effect that they are hitting
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.160]  us all and hitting us all hard and you're just gonna have to come to the
[47:39.160 --> 47:43.560]  realization that you're being drugged and that you're being poisoned people
[47:43.560 --> 47:47.760]  didn't used to be this stupid the troops didn't used to be I mean have you been
[47:47.760 --> 47:50.800]  around the young recruits I mean these guys don't even have to tie the shoe
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.760]  laces folks I mean they're on drugs okay and and and we just have to admit the
[47:56.760 --> 48:02.040]  full horror of what we're under and just somehow repent to God okay I want to
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.560]  get into the economy I want to get into the economy for the balance of the hour
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.440]  and and then we're opening the phones up for military and police and others who
[48:11.440 --> 48:18.880]  are concerned about this okay I want to go over all of this information now the
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.080]  feds have opened up a criminal probe of Goldman Sachs this is like Satan
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.040]  watching the LZ Bob but it does show the public pressure is so big now and and
[48:27.040 --> 48:33.920]  revealing the corruption to such a level that that they're now having to at
[48:33.920 --> 48:39.120]  least to have a public display of justice we also have Spain jobless rate
[48:39.120 --> 48:45.120]  drops I mean tops 20% adds to debt worries see in the US we have over 20%
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.920]  they just lie about it they're now saying Greece needs austerity measures to
[48:49.920 --> 48:57.520]  survive and remember on Monday the Washington Post with a headline IMF head
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.920]  says the good times are over for rich nations you will pay more taxes and get
[49:01.920 --> 49:06.640]  less services well here it is Greece needs austerity measures to survive
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.000]  Greece needs austerity measures to survive Prime Minister said on Friday
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.520]  rejecting calls from unions and opposition parties to reset EU IMF demands
[49:15.520 --> 49:21.120]  to raise taxes and cut public sector wages so that's how this works this is
[49:21.120 --> 49:24.240]  what they've done to hundreds of countries and it's now happening here
[49:24.240 --> 49:36.640]  gold is at a year-long high now it's cresting $1,200 an ounce it's it's
[49:36.640 --> 49:43.160]  it's it's looking like it may crest that level and I wanted to bring Ted Anderson
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.720]  up to talk about this because it looks like it's gonna go past that $1,200 mark
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.560]  very very soon and they may try to knock it down again but it's like trying to
[49:53.560 --> 49:56.800]  hold a beach ball underwater you can only do it so long Ted Anderson yeah
[49:56.800 --> 50:02.760]  yeah you're right gold jumped up another $10 today it's seen as high as 1183 so
[50:02.760 --> 50:08.000]  far right now it's trading at about 1180 so to see that $1,200 mark be
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.960]  reached it really won't take that much but a lot of people don't understand is
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.240]  that the European Union the people that use the EU for trade are looking at
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.880]  gold at the highest price it's ever been for them it wasn't this high last time
[50:20.880 --> 50:24.840]  when gold hit 1240 let's be clear gold is different prices via the currency in
[50:24.840 --> 50:27.760]  different countries they're seeing all-time record highs in Europe and
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.400]  that's what's causing the bump here well it is I mean they we're not the only
[50:33.400 --> 50:36.920]  ones in the world that know that gold is a good alternative to a fiat paper
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.280]  currency and the EU is a fiat paper currency just like the United States
[50:41.280 --> 50:45.000]  dollar is so they're seeing the same problems we are they're turning to gold
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.800]  not surprising all right Ted stay there let's talk about the economy what's
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.200]  happening in Greece now sucking down Spain and Portugal and where this is
[50:54.200 --> 51:00.800]  going we'll be right back on the other side with Ted Anderson stay with us this
[51:00.800 --> 51:04.320]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[51:08.280 --> 51:12.520]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[51:12.520 --> 51:16.800]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.240]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[51:25.240 --> 51:29.800]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[51:29.800 --> 51:33.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[51:33.920 --> 51:37.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[51:37.880 --> 51:41.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[51:41.720 --> 51:44.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[51:44.440 --> 51:50.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[52:11.840 --> 52:16.040]  through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[52:16.040 --> 52:20.120]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[52:20.120 --> 52:24.880]  control the United Nations would take over America the trilateral commission
[52:24.880 --> 52:29.400]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[52:29.400 --> 52:33.080]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[52:33.080 --> 52:37.280]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[52:37.280 --> 52:41.000]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.280]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[54:15.400 --> 54:21.920]  11 information big new developments on that front coming up with Wayne
[54:21.920 --> 54:27.400]  Madsen the super classified network that served as command and control of the 9
[54:27.400 --> 54:34.040]  11 false flag attack on America that's the headline from Wayne Madsen and
[54:34.040 --> 54:39.240]  that's up on info wars.com and prison planet.com you know something Ted I want
[54:39.240 --> 54:44.000]  to be clear about this you own the network you own Midas Resources you were
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.240]  a sponsor of my show 13 and a half well no 14 years ago and then you started the
[54:50.240 --> 54:54.560]  network 12 and a half how many years has it been Ted you know I think it's 13 no
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.520]  okay 13 years ago so I guess you've been a sponsor for 14 because I guess I had
[54:58.520 --> 55:04.160]  been on air more than 15 I keep saying 14 and saying 14 for two years and I
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.280]  remember buying my first gold of just a few coins from you you know back when it
[55:09.280 --> 55:15.000]  was $280 an ounce and now it's right at 1200 and look at all the other
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.920]  investments gold isn't really going up it's just the dollar and other
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.240]  investments are truly going down the stock market is an illusion most of that
[55:23.240 --> 55:28.120]  is inflation and you know as you pointed out before the break Europe has all time
[55:28.120 --> 55:32.200]  highs for gold right now we're getting close to it and they may push it down
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.840]  again a couple times but this gata news coming out how JP Morgan's manipulating
[55:36.840 --> 55:39.760]  it and keeping it down we already knew that we have the whistleblower coming
[55:39.760 --> 55:45.760]  on next Tuesday people need to protect themselves and they cannot find a better
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.080]  deal when you're able to offer these deals because you will buy a ton of
[55:51.080 --> 55:57.400]  gold when it dips down and then you'll sell it at the lower price when it goes
[55:57.400 --> 56:00.600]  way up now I talked to you yesterday about this you said you are getting
[56:00.600 --> 56:05.360]  close to running out of supplies that you bought when gold was $100 less an
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.280]  ounce so tell people the offer and how long you can hold this well I'm down to
[56:10.280 --> 56:14.920]  the only coin that I have available at the lower price is the Frank now
[56:14.920 --> 56:18.720]  though everything else has been pushed up because gold's up and you got to
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.320]  remember that Frank is a fifth of an ounce of gold so for every dollar
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.800]  increase in gold the Frank my cost goes up 20 cents now we've seen gold go from
[56:28.800 --> 56:38.680]  1,050 1,060 to now I'm sorry 1,060 1,160 to 1,180 now so I mean you can just do
[56:38.680 --> 56:44.680]  the math I mean the wholesale price on the coin is is up incredibly at this
[56:44.680 --> 56:48.680]  time and I'm not going to be able to hold it I'm I'm gonna hold this deal this
[56:48.680 --> 56:53.720]  240 249 68 where you get the international forecaster with it which
[56:53.720 --> 56:58.680]  just makes it a spectacular offer but I'm gonna hold this deal through Sunday so
[56:58.680 --> 57:04.320]  you can buy that Frank at 249 68 and I say that there's not I don't have
[57:04.320 --> 57:07.000]  anything else that's held down I have just a few things you'll have to talk
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.600]  to our brokers about them because it's just like I have a few ounces of this
[57:10.600 --> 57:14.320]  and that and you know the rest of this stuff the prices have gone up you can
[57:14.320 --> 57:17.760]  see it on the internet all over the place I know our prices had to be
[57:17.760 --> 57:21.520]  increased on the internet even on this particular coin I'm not offering this
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.600]  price on the internet short of that email I had you send out yesterday because
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.600]  we had such a short phone call on it anybody that's got that email should you
[57:29.600 --> 57:32.320]  know get your credit card out and pick that up you can't you can't buy a
[57:32.320 --> 57:37.600]  Frank and get the forecaster all together as one package anywhere else on in
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.680]  the world not for that price and you were smart Alex for picking up gold back
[57:41.680 --> 57:46.480]  then that's when Bill Murphy started Gata and that's when that manipulation you
[57:46.480 --> 57:51.160]  know was started that they they pegged gold to be at no higher than five than
[57:51.160 --> 57:54.840]  four hundred dollars an ounce well let me stop you real fast for those that just
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.280]  joined us if you want to take advantage of that special email it's posted as an
[57:59.280 --> 58:05.280]  article gold hits 2010 high amidst debt turmoil in Europe that's one of the top

[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.920]  nightmarish string where the Army is training all over the United States to
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.360]  militarily take on the tea parties and the military are being caught that
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.880]  you're un-American trash that your traitors and that you want to kill police
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.960]  and you can go read it for yourself the military personnel in the drill with
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.000]  police which is illegal take on the tea partiers and and then those that they
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.960]  don't kill they take to a FEMA camp you need to read this article it's up on
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.920]  prisonplanet.com US Army trains to confront tea party terrorist military
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.320]  personnel blow the whistle and exercise which involved troops taking
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.560]  protesters to concentration camps and they also teach them in the drills
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.820]  these people are crazy they think we want their guns want to put them in
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.120]  camps that's why we're gonna take their guns and put them in camps how like the
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.960]  woman last year was one of my listeners also a glimbett listener than the news
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.040]  reported as if that's important you know a mother with a good job no criminal
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.840]  record she had an AR-15 she bought at the store having to be in a trunk of her
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.720]  car she went outside a military base taking photos she told him I want to
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.840]  see if this is a FEMA camp and they arrested her and we need to look up
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.920]  whatever happened to her last time I heard that she was in jail her gun
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.680]  wasn't illegal taking photos wasn't illegal but she just disappeared you're
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.160]  crazy you think we want to arrest you and put you in a jail cell yeah we're
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.080]  gonna arrest you and put you in a jail cell these people are crazy they think
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.960]  there's a world government being announced meanwhile it's all over the
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.520]  news every day exactly as we said it would be a world government run by
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.520]  private banks so I want to open the phones up specifically for military
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.400]  veterans that are concerned about this and who over the years were given
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.440]  similar training but now it's expanding current military police firefighters
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.920]  have been part of these drills FBI federal marshals the phones are only
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:40.480]  open for you 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and some that called in
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.240]  yesterday were scared they were like I don't know if I'm even allowed to call
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.560]  in in America and tell you what we're doing what how you're secretly training
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560]  to take on the tea parties and returning veterans and gun owners I mean we
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.920]  got those documents a year and a half ago we put them out and the media
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.520]  reported on it this story needs to get just as big as the Mayak and Homeland
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.360]  Security reports and that's only going to happen if you get this article and
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.800]  get it out to everyone you know US Army trains to confront tea party terrorists
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.640]  and in the next hour a 10-minute special report on this we're also talk about
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.560]  how they're demonizing your yours truly in these events is going up on the
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.280]  YouTube channel the Alex Jones YouTube channel one of our channels we have
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.080]  quite a few but the one with the 43 million views on it that's why they're
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.360]  upset that's why they're concerned we know exactly what they're doing why did
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.520]  I know back in 1999 I interviewed the chief of police of San Antonio who told
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.080]  me there was secret government payoffs going on for martial law I interviewed
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.320]  Thomas Sanchez the head of emergency management in Kingsville Texas himself
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:52.120]  of Army intelligence veteran of Vietnam and he said look the army came in here
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  and said we're doing takeover drills for gun confiscation in America and he said
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:01.360]  we're not going along with this and that's in police state 2000 of course so
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.640]  I mean when I got police chiefs and the heads of emergency management I mean I
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.480]  knew about it before 99 we had government documents in Rex 84 and had
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.640]  seen the urban warfare drills and had gotten the videos from military
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.840]  personnel that had sent them to us where they were trying to take on Americans
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:22.680]  in different drills mainly in Louisiana and California for some reason then
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.120]  Hebron Maryland and Swansboro North Carolina and you know all these other
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.240]  places no Swansboro I forget it's all in the film the point is that I mean this
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.520]  is not our opinion and men this man is a terrorist he says we're trained to take
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.120]  guns now let's go do a gun confiscation drill because these people are crazy
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:49.800]  1-800-259-9231 are you concerned do you have any information do you have any
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.600]  intel what would you like to say the American people are your fellow
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.520]  officers in the military the police waking up or are they ready to drink the
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.840]  blood of the American people like they have the Iraqis one major world crisis
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.240]  away from having a totalitarian type of system the main event is the wholesale
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.680]  destruction of the world the color to push for every nation on the globe to
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.360]  identify and number all of its citizens friends I hope that you will order

[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.840]  us into open world government they're trying to pass the amnesty plan they're
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.520]  trying to pass the expanded banking takeover to give the Federal Reserve that
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.160]  engineered the crisis that's now come out in the internal emails that's in
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.720]  Congress now this gives them more power over society when they engineered it
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.160]  they're trying to pass the global carbon taxes they say that's the first thing
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.680]  on their agenda a new tax to the banks and internationally a value-added tax
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.440]  on all financial transfers on even individuals so that's all happening
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.800]  right now and I said I get to this yesterday I didn't I will cover it this
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.960]  hour doctor sterilize Uzbek women by stealth times of London that ties into
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.280]  things that have gone on inside this country and are still going on inside
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.640]  this country and this is a good example of how they secretly sterilize you she
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:22.120]  need to be made well aware of that but for stations that just joined us we have
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.880]  a key article up on prisonplanet.com US Army trains to confront Tea Party
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.760]  terrorist military personnel blow the whistle and exercise which involved
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.560]  troops taking protesters to concentration camps and the main mission of the
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.680]  Army in the Marine Corps now under Northcom domestically we have all the
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.480]  documents all the training manuals classified secret and public and
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.360]  mainstream stories telling you how great it is and illegal military check
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.360]  points popping up everywhere to acclimate people it's all there in this one
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.600]  article and in the next hour a video is going up a ten minute report I shot last
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.640]  night that's got all the documents in it that we need to get out to everyone
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:08.320]  virally as well but there's nothing like actually hearing it from the troops
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.640]  and so I've said veterans this has been going on for a long time or people who
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.000]  are concerned who were veterans who want to comment police officers current
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.280]  military people you know we had call after call from now serving current
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.160]  military just confirming what's already in the news Ron Paul myself many others
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.720]  they put pictures of me up on the wall and say I'm the main den I'm pure evil
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.160]  I want to kill cops I'm causing it I want to kill the military I'm a terrorist
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.840]  I'm lying and saying they want a new world order now they say anybody that
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.200]  criticizes the Federal Reserve as a terrorist I mean this is so incredible a
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.160]  two trillion dollar a year military right at two trillion and their big
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.440]  threat is Alex Jones now now why is that because the military at the top echelons
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.280]  doesn't work for America as Eisenhower warns you in 61 they work for the
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.920]  offshore banks that are trying to take over America and and they've engaged in
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.080]  so many crimes at the federal and corporate level
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.840]  that it's all or nothing exercise they're committed they're going for broke
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.560]  and we better reach out to the military and police
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.040]  and and try to break their conditioning try to get through their brainwashing
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.000]  and say look you're training to confiscate our guns you're training
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.240]  for civil unrest like you've never done before
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.400]  you you're you're being brainwashed and and and tea parties and returning
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.840]  veterans of the main target are being demonized
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.000]  see there's the proof we were right we said they would deploy troops in America
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.280]  we said it would follow a banking collapse by design
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.080]  because we have the trilateral commission we had the belterberg group
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.840]  documents where they said we're going to use a financial crisis to
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.360]  have the people accept troops on the streets and they would have a carbon
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.200]  tax to shut down all our industry they want to bankrupt us they want to make
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.760]  you dependent on government they don't want you independent
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.720]  it's so important that people become aware of what's happening
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.480]  this has happened to every other nation there has never been a nation that
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.840]  hasn't fallen to a military dictatorship run by private interest
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.320]  it has never not happened to a nation where 200 plus years old
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.840]  it's happening now what 235 years old no nation has ever lasted this long
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.120]  the roman republic only lasted a few hundred years before it came
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.400]  became a despotic empire when julia caesar google when julia caesar came
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.920]  across the ribicon i think it was uh he died in
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:42.480]  44 was it 46 bc google caesar is crossing the ribicon i need
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.600]  that date i can't stand it when i can't pull it up
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.400]  mentally and go read what happened there why the
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:56.160]  romans win 49 bc 49 bc
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:04.080]  49 bc and he got what killed in 44 bc was it 45
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.520]  look at the death of caesar i want to be exact thank you julia caesar crosses
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.760]  the ribicon 49 bc and i mean just everyone freaked out they
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.440]  had a middle class they had freedom they had private property
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.400]  over bye bye gone the military wasn't allowed in italy
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.040]  it wasn't allowed in the city of rome why because they hated the military no
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.760]  the military was their power to take over but they were a real republic that
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.600]  had an empire you were free if you lived in rome and you were a roman
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.760]  everybody else was dog meat ladies and gentlemen this isn't a roman empire
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.520]  like that where we actually get some of the spoils if you want to be a moral
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.760]  and go kill people and steal their oil and be this big vicious empire
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.600]  no no no no no no no you're a slave inside the empire
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.120]  just like after julia caesar came to power
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.800]  and became tyranus all right i'm gonna shut up now
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.400]  and go to the calls for people that are concerned about this
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.080]  let's talk to mike in illinois mike you're on the air go ahead
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.600]  hello alex i'm an employer to talk to you sir
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.240]  uh... where i live i actually am a retired police officer and the training
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.480]  that we received about though five or six years ago
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:21.520]  basically we would go quarter off an area and go to it
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.520]  and anything we've quote unquote we would find we would take up you know
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.560]  we confiscate and they would have to go to jail
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.400]  for whatever we actually found in the house like drugs
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.000]  you know what i'm saying yeah it's a warrantless search they call it knock
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.480]  and talk now and we've had blagojevic and now
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.720]  two state reps what last week or monday in the chicago tribune
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.160]  call for the army to be deployed in illinois for gun confiscation so
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.640]  this is on your news yeah so yeah well downstate folks are
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.000]  i guess that i'm retired now but downstate folks said not only know what
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.360]  hell know about you know sending our troops into
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.440]  our national guard up to chicago number one we have to pay for it number two is
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.760]  chicago's problem with them figured out
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.280]  uh... yeah they did so in the public they disarmed the public so every
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.960]  criminal in america moves to chicago where they can rape robin steel with
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.560]  impunity so chicago has what the second highest crime rate in the country go
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.960]  ahead and we also have a uh... national guard center in our area
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.080]  that uh... right in the middle of that center is a
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.640]  quote unquote training camp for our units
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:35.040]  when we go to rand or wherever iraq afghanistan
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.200]  uh... to train them to how to control
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.080]  prisoners but what's really ironic about it is is that our national guard troop
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.160]  is a engineering company it's not a that's not a
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.560]  fighting or
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.080]  uh... in peace that your unit well that's what i've been told and confirmed
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.760]  they're training everyone in this now that's never happened before
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.880]  well the other good thing too is the police officers that i'm affiliate
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.440]  so affiliated with the party been told of
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.560]  if it gets to the point where the
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.880]  you know it hits the fan that and they start the confiscation
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.000]  that there's gonna be a lot of real quick phone calls that we can't do it by
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.200]  phone calls will do it by driving to their houses until look this is coming
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.640]  down be prepared and this is not just
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.480]  me talking as a old retired cop of but
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.680]  well a little over ten years so you're saying the cops that you know that are
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.640]  still on the force are saying they're not going along with this
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.840]  exactly they're already there the boys are telling me that if
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.880]  if it comes down they said mike if it comes down
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.240]  we're gonna let you know because i know i'm gonna be one of the first people to
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.840]  get hit well that's what i mean have you read these
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.160]  all these documents that we've gotten that are i've got about 90 percent of
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.120]  them sir but but i mean the point is
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.680]  for veterans for former police you are the number one target and they've got
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.400]  you all profiled and if you're a libertarian or a
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.360]  conservative if you get a tear in your eye when they
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.840]  sing the star spangled banner you are on a list and and that's what's so amazing
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.840]  is that how dumb are the troops or or or how stupid does the government think
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.480]  they are that in almost all these training scenarios
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.680]  now they're converting from fighting taliban and al-qaeda
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.880]  to we're gonna go after former veterans and former police i mean you guys
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.880]  are the target and then here are these troops who in five ten years
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.640]  are going to be civilians don't they can't they put two and two together
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.600]  that they're training to go after their brothers
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.920]  i don't know what they're i think it's
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.920]  we've dumbed down our generation that's followed my my police generation to a
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.160]  point where no that's too stupid i'm serious that
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.000]  it's a you know it's a god awful thing to have to say that they're too stupid
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.720]  to do that but situation that i'm in i know for a fact that i'll probably be
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.800]  one of the first targets in the area um but let me tell you right now i'm
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.000]  i'm not going to go down without a fight my brother
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.080]  and when they do shoot me and i bleed out it's gonna be red white and blue blood

[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.280]  dot com this just broke when i saw him say yesterday he's going to
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.920]  send swat teams to the rigs if he was doing an investigation he'd send fbi
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.360]  this was about nationalization that's what i talked with my wife about

[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:11.040]  hey alex um when i was in the army and uh for brag when we got back from afghanistan
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.080]  we were uh tested trainees national guard tanker battalion to be infantry
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.240]  and uh i mean one of the guys had been out of his contract for 16 years i called
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.560]  him back he missed drill a couple times and it was i mean short fat and his
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.600]  fifties in no way you know in any condition to be fighting anybody
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.760]  and uh we went to iraq after that we had to be extended twice because the
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.440]  national guard unit that was supposed to uh relieve us
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.000]  was waiting for new equipment and they were all like cops and swat from
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.320]  northern california and uh i mean it was just disgusting like
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.040]  talking to these guys when they got in country like their mentality about
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.440]  i mean americans and and as if they were talking about like
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.160]  illegal aliens or something but just talking about their own citizens you
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.040]  know so so where were you with police and swat
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.880]  uh training with national guard with tanks and and and they were basically
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.720]  talking about us like like like you know kill a commie for mommy
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.080]  americans and the american flag is the new commie
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.720]  exactly and then i mean i was i was tricked into reenlisting after i got out
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.320]  and no four and uh i had to train these reserves
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.760]  civil affairs soldiers to be more effective infantry soldiers
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.680]  and then i ended up having to deploy with them to uh
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.040]  to uh support the mission in iraq again so
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.160]  so i mean what type of stuff would they say just talk about the public a scum
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.600]  or i mean yeah well i mean they were they would talk about how like you know
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.440]  nobody can be trusted and and they would they were they were blatantly
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.360]  talking about how they would entrap people with drugs or prostitution or
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.000]  things like that in order to get more information
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.080]  and they would i mean they would detain people you know even if they even if
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.920]  they they knew they weren't you know valuable or whatever and they planned
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.080]  on using all of those tactics in iraq i think one of their
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.120]  missions they mentioned was actually supporting the prisons
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.600]  and the transportation of prisoners from you know wherever to wherever
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.800]  well the pentagon is said iraq and afghanistan are laboratories and i read
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.840]  where they would take fired federal former prison guards
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.600]  who've been raping prisoners and would give them big bonuses and ship them to
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.440]  the different camps and these different torture centers
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.840]  and so you're saying national guard guys were full of swat and police
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.440]  and that they were bragging about how they set up americans and how they were
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.680]  going to bring that there i always thought of it as the reverse take troops
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.120]  put them in a bad situation to warp their minds to bring them back
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.800]  but you're saying they've been warped being paramilitary police
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.400]  and they're now exporting it well i don't know you know how their training
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.440]  went in california but i know that they were definitely
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.800]  pre-programmed and geared up for and also i don't know whatever training they
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.640]  went through you know pre-deployment they always have a mobility
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.160]  time period six months or so before they deploy
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  to uh you know kind of recertify on their training in their military
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.320]  whatever um which is another thing i wanted to ask you about because you
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.360]  mentioned about how all these national guard and reserve
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.400]  units are going and taking over these small towns like you mentioned in
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.640]  police state four um when i was at four bragg we had that
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.680]  national guard and reserve soldiers that would stay in barracks right next to
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.080]  us all the time that the government would bring in
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.480]  and we didn't even have marines that would come in and go on a four bragg
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.080]  stay there and they train them before deploying so i don't understand where
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.800]  they where they're using this as an excuse
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.280]  where they have to take over small towns oh i thought people i've talked to
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.560]  police chiefs generals kernels you name it
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.120]  and in the open um army war college uh and and
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.880]  other think tanks they openly admit they're going to use foreign troops in
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.480]  america and they admit this is for acclimating the public i mean i've
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.520]  interviewed police chiefs and emergency managers
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.240]  who have been told point blank from texas indiana you name it we've played
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.040]  clips on air we've interviewed them live on air over the years
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.880]  where they they're even telling them so if they're telling
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.520]  an emergency manager this is for a takeover of the u.s scenario
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.600]  can you imagine what the more secretive documents say
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:21.840]  but but are any of the veterans you're talking to concern do they know about
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.080]  my act i mean uh will they be concerned uh about these new documents where
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.360]  they're training the military to take on the tea partiers
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.240]  i'm trying to wake up as many people as i can
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.120]  um but i mean a lot of people it's it's too heavy you know they just
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.920]  they don't want to uh they don't want to believe it because it's so
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.200]  insane people don't even make movies about this on hollywood because it's so
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.280]  far-fetched you know but it's reality stranger than fiction stay there jesse
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.200]  one more question we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:01.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.360]  with the implementation of codex alimentarius it is clear that we must
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.560]  act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.320]  preferences are concerned as of january 1st 2010
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.760]  codex alimentarius was implemented within the european union
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.280]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.960]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.960]  continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.320]  act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.440]  privacy of your own home colloidal silver is a powerful
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.960]  antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:40.960]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous unpredictable side effects

[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.200]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.960]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.760]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.040]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.920]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:23.040]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:13.280]  daniel tony and frets calls then swat team response to oil spill is government
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.360]  takeover plies that's what levin's saying former
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.000]  reagan advisor suggests obama is greasing skids
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.240]  for nationalization of the oil industry well i mean what do you think the tsa
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.040]  is i saw ridge seven years ago on c span say
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.680]  we're going to take over the airports and then we're going to have mobile
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.040]  scanners and we're going to be at all the bus terminals and train stations and
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.680]  then on the highways at hardened checkpoints well
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.000]  bill clinton announced that in 1998 that they were going to set that up in the
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.040]  future that's in my film police state
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.840]  2000
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.840]  and i mean i saw documents what a clinton executive order from 94 about
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.400]  how they're going to take dna at checkpoints and now they're doing an
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.400]  under federal grants i mean the it takes them a while to get this done but
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.640]  everything's converging now everything's coming together
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.880]  we're in the danger zone i mean it's on okay it is on now
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.120]  so we're going to cover that and this is exactly what's going on
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.800]  because they just put the message out there swat teams we're sending swat
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.240]  teams they're not environmental experts they're not petroleum geologists
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.840]  they're not engineers if you're looking for terrorism you send the fbi you
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.320]  don't send swat teams they're there with force to seize things this sounds
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.040]  like hugo chavez or or stalin seizing
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.880]  infrastructure and and and they've been talking for years
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.080]  about seizing the oil industry nationalizing it and that'll be done by
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.760]  the big mega oil companies to shut down all their competition
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.040]  just like the fellow reserve engineers the financial crisis
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.960]  and now has a financial reform bill that's very close to passing
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.240]  that gives them even more power over all financial institutions
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.920]  then it'll be selectively enforced okay i have one more question for you jesse
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.960]  and louisiana uh...
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:07.280]  when you're trying to wake up your friends in the military and you say it's
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.120]  just too horrible i mean you can show them all the documents all the training
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.120]  many of them have probably been given the training or
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.640]  no others that have been given it i mean uh... this is on record that they want
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.120]  brigade homeland and uh... that they are training to take on veterans so i don't
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.720]  i don't see how they can't wake up jesse well
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.560]  i mean i know myself as a veteran you know multiple
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.080]  you know multiple times deploying to different countries and being in the
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.920]  horrific situations i was in you know i'm going through a hard time
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.040]  kind of recalibrating of the civilian and and
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.640]  breaking down my programming and it's it's just
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:48.400]  it's hard because it's all about perspective alex you know with with
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.760]  dealing with other people and other cultures when you're told in the states
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.880]  especially older soldiers that have been training
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.560]  for this type of thing i mean there were people in my unit
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:02.560]  that were twice my age i joined when i was 17 there's people that were twice my
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.240]  age that had never deployed and never done anything but they had been training
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.320]  for it for 20 years you know all of my command
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.200]  staff and everybody else and then they go there and they have this preconceived
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.960]  uh... view of uh... what it is what the enemy is
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.760]  you know you've hit the nail on the head i discovered 12 years ago because it was
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.800]  happening in austin and now all over the country in the
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.800]  associated press that they have unannounced
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.960]  takeover drills of colleges public schools even elementary schools
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.240]  where they run and scream we are malicious against the government we're
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.920]  going to kill you and people literally start urinating on themselves
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.680]  or they blow up a car it was smoke bombs out front the school
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.960]  march the little crying kids out this is on the news them crying
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.880]  and say quote we are home schoolers against public education
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.600]  and then they start having mock killings of teachers who they had uh... pre-worn
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.440]  just to traumatize the kids that is the essence
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.880]  of a soviet reeducation camp all of america
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.080]  is basically a giant soviet brainwashing camp
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.120]  and so when they have drill after drill with all these national guard people
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.960]  and and and you can read the drills it's their drunken racist scum who hate
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.320]  america and want to kill cops here's their leader alex
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.920]  jones and then they have simulations of killing us
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.920]  exactly that's mean that that's meant to drill a hatred
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:33.440]  of the american people into them and that's why those cops that were national
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.120]  guard that you were uh... around had such disdain
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.240]  because in this role they're told you're the good guy
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:44.080]  they're the bad guys so frame them set them up do whatever you have to
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.040]  to win the war against the enemy which is america
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.080]  right and answer your question before about how many oil rigs are off the
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.840]  coast of my fine state here
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.120]  there's about thirty eight hundred a little less than four thousand oil
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.360]  oil rigs and uh... an important point i want to make about that real quick
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.600]  and i gotta get to other calls but um... we have despite you know the
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:08.960]  stigma from katrina and everything we have a very big
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:12.080]  army corps of engineers right here in louisiana
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:16.240]  right in the delta and they're not only trained as engineers but they're
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:22.480]  soldiers so why didn't obama mobilized the corps of engineers out there who are
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.800]  trained for this type of stuff and not to mention
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.880]  i'm pretty sure that's what the national guards core intention is supposed to be
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.000]  is taking care of domestic issues such as this
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.040]  i mean he obviously has absolutely no idea what to do with the resources that
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.280]  he has and it just further illustrates his
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.720]  his complete incompetence and his complete lack of
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.400]  of qualification to be the president jesse i hear you and i appreciate your
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.400]  call but let me just add a caveat and go to other callers here
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:01.360]  that's how it's meant to look obama is a harvard slick lawyer clearly cia
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.760]  to read off a teleprompter and look handsome
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.200]  bush didn't screw up katrina they ordered walmart
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.880]  they ordered the national guard they ordered the army corps of engineers
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.840]  they ordered the coast guard not to deliver fuel not to help anybody i have
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.600]  interviewed the sheriff of that parish we've played the clips of him on the
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.320]  news fema as the storm hit hours before the levees broke
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.400]  went and cut the communication lines at the police
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.240]  fire and county departments we ought to pull those clips up
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:38.000]  when we've got prison planet articles about it that have it in fact just google
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  uh fema cut police communications in katrina pull that up
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.120]  i mean anything i say you can pull up folks we don't make anything up
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.280]  i know that sounds insane that they did that and they had to finally post
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.960]  armed police guards after they repaired the police communications
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.680]  see that's why the cops more than half of them just left
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:02.080]  suddenly none of their radios worked uh femo admittedly was jamming cell phones
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.760]  this was an operation to have it implode to say fema didn't have enough
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.200]  resources so they could get more power and more control
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.240]  obama knows they've got the army corps of engineers there
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.320]  he knows they've got the navy he knows they should have lit fire to that oil
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:24.080]  day one not day six they knew all of that okay and
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:28.080]  he just reads what's on a teleprompter so sure he he isn't even being briefed on
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.000]  why he's saying this but i appreciate your call
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.760]  they want it to fail they want it to be a disaster
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.600]  under political pressure they say they can suddenly drill in all these new areas
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.960]  because the russians and the chinese are moving in to do it because the u.s
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.200]  block companies from doing it our companies so suddenly he announces a
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.560]  month ago they're going to do this then the day before earth day this thing
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.880]  blows up the big suppressor caps uh that are almost full proof
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  didn't engage and then he says i'm sending swat teams
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.720]  swat teams just so the public thinks well i got a flat tire swat team
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.760]  if my kids acting up swat team that's why parents
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.720]  if their eight-year-old won't take a shower won't eat dinner they now call
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.480]  police and tell them taser them you know i mean i i guess if you need your
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.560]  your clogged toilet to be fixed you call a swat team
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:24.000]  and here comes the swat team no this is seizing the oil wells this is seeing if
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.240]  they can get away with it uh let's talk to uh warren and vegas you're on the
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:31.760]  air go ahead hey al thanks for holding go ahead sir

[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:54.240]  bodyguard contingency no i don't i don't i don't i don't look behind my uh
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:57.600]  back when i'm walking through a store i don't worry about anything i'm you know
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.880]  what i'm a good person i'm telling the truth
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.960]  and uh you know i'll if somebody pulled a gun out on me in a parking lot and tried
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.920]  to kill me i tried to duck or get out of the way but i'm not really worried
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.720]  about it i'm committed to what i'm doing but it just shows how twisted our
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.080]  government is that in all these manuals they're teaching
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:20.880]  them that i'm one of the main enemies of not the main enemy and and that just
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.840]  shows who the real enemy is it shows what's happened
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.240]  yeah alex you got god watching over you i think that's why you don't have
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.840]  anything to worry about well you know what if i do get killed or
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.720]  imprisoned or set up that's what god wanted to happen i'm really not worried
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:38.400]  about it i can't live in fear and i understand you know i'm gonna be honest
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.640]  a few times i have had bodyguards
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.520]  uh i've you know been planning events we get death threats
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.840]  uh and i was going to ignore it and then a hotel manager called and said look
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.240]  there's this crazy guy here and uh i'm one of your listeners
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.320]  and uh he was talking threateningly about you
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.720]  even when he was checking in and then i had a bad feeling so i um
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.920]  i uh got a local cop who i know off duty and playing close to come and sure
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.760]  enough the guy showed up and stood up at the back
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.960]  uh of the uh book people this is years ago
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.480]  and started pulling his hand out from a trench coat
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.000]  uh acting like going bam bam like he was going to shoot me
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.160]  uh but i mean that's the kind of stuff but so if i do specifically have a
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.920]  threat i'll protect myself but i'm sorry go ahead
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.880]  that's all right uh alex i'm a prior military it was back in
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:40.000]  70s about 78 i believe it was uh a base in lusiana
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.840]  air force base there had troops serving there that were foreign troops and we
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.880]  were specifically instructed not to say anything to these
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.160]  troops uh do not salute them or anything if you
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.440]  think they're officers or stuff but to be sure not to look at their faces even
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:04.080]  come to find out later we found out that they were Iranian troops
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.040]  of all things getting training there on our base
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.040]  found that kind of unusual now as far as the other day i bumped into a u.s
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.000]  soldier uh in a store here where i live uh the other day and he's
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.960]  up here visiting from a base up north and doing some td y duty down here
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:30.240]  at an army base uh he was telling me i was just asking him how things were
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:35.200]  going stuff like that you know um and ask him i said are you know
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.120]  what are you hearing about anything about gun confiscation uh
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:42.880]  is the military going to participate or anything like that and he just kind of
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.120]  smiled and he says i'm not but he said there are some very weird
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.040]  things going on at the base out there and i said well like what
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:58.240]  um he said that there was hundreds of foreign troops at this base
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:03.200]  training on the door-to-door technique and he you know
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.880]  was very disturbed in the fact and of course i thought well he might be just
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.480]  telling me that because he probably thinks that's what i want to hear
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.080]  a week later we went to a shopping center here
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.400]  and there were chinese troops everywhere
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:25.200]  in a parking lot i mean big numbers of chinese troops so i made it my
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.880]  business to go over to them and try to find out what in the world they're
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.640]  doing here uh some of them had name tags that they
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.800]  were from singapore and then some of them had name tags that they
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.720]  were from china uh they said they were here for specialized training i said
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.000]  specialized training i said what what kind of training y'all gonna be doing
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.080]  well they didn't want to answer i said are y'all doing what just military
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.640]  trainers at riot control or gun confiscation or what and they all
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.320]  started kind of looking at each other and giggling and stuff but one of them in
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.080]  the background gave it away because he was shaking his head
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.440]  up and down yes

[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:46.080]  grow pot i mean we're living like prisoners in this
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.120]  country more and more because we got a bunch of banks stealing
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.400]  trillions of dollars doing whatever they want they bought off our cities and
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.200]  counties crooks have moved in at every level
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.280]  of society they know we're waking up to it and they intend to go all the way and
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.200]  clamp down on us we got james traffic ant coming up
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.160]  we'll continue with your phone calls as well but let's go to tony and georgia
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.400]  tony you're on the air thank you for taking my call alex uh back in
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:15.440]  early 1996 before the olympics came to georgia we were all carried to conure's
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.360]  georgia to the horse ranch and we were trying to
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.840]  keep doors in shoot men women and children and confiscate weapons so what
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.960]  the rest of the guys have been telling you is accurate but it's a little bit
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.320]  more uh it's a little deeper than what everybody
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.240]  can imagine uh this this goes way back
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.600]  to the uh late fifties some of the contracts that the military was issuing
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:44.640]  out privatizing to other agencies i noticed that during that time the
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.080]  training we had we even had department heads from the department of
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.560]  education department of corrections you name it they were all involved in it
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.520]  and we were trained by one of the israeli massad
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:01.280]  well that's actually been in the new york daily news that for the last decade
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.120]  the massad has been one of the main trainers of local police
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.320]  uh and quote counterterrorism forces just thought i'd uh throw that in or
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:15.360]  alex and well to be specific well uh when and where was this
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:21.280]  this was back in early in the late spring of 96 before the olympics came to
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.120]  georgia and uh you were with the military or
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.800]  the police well i'm i'm from military but i was with
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.040]  stipe trove you were in what with the georgia
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:36.880]  stipe patrol okay state patrol and and and i mean were you guys
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:41.760]  wondering why you were drilling to take on the american people
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.800]  uh yes uh most of the guys just went along to get along that's that's a normal
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.080]  thing just go along to get along
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:53.920]  you know like don't worry about it this will never happen here
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.320]  but not me i knew that it was coming i could see it i was raised in a military
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:03.920]  family uh my great uncle was the commanding officer in fact he was a
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.520]  general in forth bending georgia so i had access to just about everything that
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.880]  was going on back when i was a child growing up and i'm 60 years old now
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:16.240]  so i've been in this battle for 44 years and it's getting worse
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:21.360]  well now they're just i know this has been going on for a long time
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.440]  we've confirmed at least 30 years but it it's clearly accelerating and coming to
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.520]  ahead do you agree i agree and i believe that before this
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:37.440]  year's out uh probably uh 1776 is going to reoccur
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.680]  well they're forcing that they they want a armed confrontation
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.600]  you're exactly right they want an armed confrontation and the reason they want
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:49.840]  people to be in the militia to have permission to be in the militia so they
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.840]  can get names phone numbers the whole nine years so they'll have a list
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.600]  the way it is now is more secretive and that's the way it should be
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:02.800]  sounds like it's a beautiful day there in georgia i can hear the birds singing
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.720]  oh you better believe it it's beautiful they just put putting cam trails out
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:10.720]  haha well i mean do you talk to any of your old state police buddies are they
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:14.640]  awake to what's happening the majority of them won't even

[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.160]  and i'm with another agency now i won't say who they are
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:26.080]  and out of 48 people six of them are very much awake

[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.000]  investigated that what happened with the pan am flight and a lot more and

[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.720]  and it's building towards a crescendo james traficant good to have you on
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.280]  with us sir glad to be back alex and i i want to
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.200]  say after appearing on your show several months ago i i didn't
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:21.360]  realize how strong a show you have now when i commend you
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.560]  as you were educating millions of american people i
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.640]  i was surprised and i'm honored to be asked to come back on your show
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.280]  well congressman we're honored to have you here because of your courage and
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:34.560]  your steadfastness uh so much is happening so much is going on i've
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.000]  got questions and issues i want to pick your brain about but
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.600]  out of the gates the state of the union the state of the taxing system all the
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.600]  new vat taxes they want telling us austerity taxes
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.920]  are going to go up our benefits are going to go down
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:51.360]  what does james traficant say about that well number one i think the country's
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.160]  bankrupt that's evident and number two i think all
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.000]  they're talking about doing is just going to further implode this nation
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.760]  and i see us dismantling like the old soviet union i really do alex
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.920]  i think that you can't continue to have the income tax the penalizes work
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.560]  subsidizes illegitimacy and rewards dependency it's time to throw it out
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:13.360]  abolish the irs repeal the 16th amendment
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:19.280]  now you know i support a flat fare 25 consumption tax on final retail sales
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.640]  and my opponents are saying that's going to hurt the poor quite frankly
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.320]  alex harvard did a study and said when you throw out the burdensome compliance
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:29.760]  of the irs he said the prices are going to drop the prices will probably be
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.280]  similar to what we have now but finally for those naysayers
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.160]  those people are under the poverty level will simply take
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.920]  their pay stubs to the government and there will be a system as there exists
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.640]  now the only difference with the traffic in bill alex
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.080]  is everybody must work who gets a government stipend
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.760]  i don't care if they have 12 children did work at the daycare center with those
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:53.200]  children but you see anybody that visits broadway or
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.960]  or visits las vegas from germany and japan did pay into our tax scheme
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:01.520]  and finally it's a trade reciprocity program if a country has barriers against
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.520]  stars we have barriers against them we also quantify the standard of living in
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.440]  each country and weigh that down with tariffs as necessary
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.120]  but it's a flat 25 percent final retail sales tax
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:19.360]  no taxes on used materials but just new new retail sales and services
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:22.960]  and alex if the country does not move to this scheme
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:26.720]  america will implode like the soviet union that's my prediction right here on
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.000]  the alex yoncho well congressman i've seen the similar studies i've
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.160]  talked to economists it would be good if we only had one federal tax
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.000]  other than the tariffs they could raise money with the problem is
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.360]  obama and others they want a vat on every level
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.200]  on top of the income tax yes this is the problem you got to throw the income
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.720]  tax out it was founded and it's the predicate of the communist platform
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.600]  of carl marx and it's done just that it's made a dependent society over here
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:57.120]  it's penalized work and that's the last thing that the founders wanted
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.840]  the reason we have the 16th amendment alex is when
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.600]  we first started the income tax which by the way was only supposed to be on the
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.960]  rich people it was taken to the supreme court and it was
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.360]  struck down as unconstitutional as a result we have this 16th amendment
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.200]  some people feel it wasn't adequately ratified to boot
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:18.880]  and that maybe we shouldn't repeal the 16th amendment we should just just
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.200]  regard it because it wasn't in fact awful but i think let's be safe let's
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.040]  repeal the 16th amendment abolish the irs we don't need a department of
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.520]  energy we don't need a department of education
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.520]  there's too damn much government here alex and what we don't need is we don't
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:38.480]  need more taxes on top of income tax james travagan stay there quick

[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:50.000]  they're terrorist uh bill clenchin says that uh there's going to be another
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.040]  oklahoma city and it's going to be the fault of the american people

[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:15.520]  james traficant former congressman is our guest i've researched his case
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.040]  he's even been on national news they've admitted he was completely
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:24.720]  railroaded set up mainly because he was criticizing foreign aid
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:28.240]  period and foreign aid to israel and they told him they were going to get him
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:31.760]  and we had jane graham oklahoma city bombing survivor
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.520]  she's on the ninth floor on last week she saw mcvay and other feds planting
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:39.840]  gray sticks of butter didn't know what they were uh she brought this info to
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:42.080]  congress they wouldn't talk to her the only person that would
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:45.520]  look at the information was james traficant and she said she talked to
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.400]  james traficant's assistant in his office she said yeah
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.320]  they came and said give us those documents back and uh
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:55.440]  james traficant refused and they said we're going to get james traficant but
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.120]  that was one of many reasons they went after him but we'll talk about
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:02.320]  that today but continuing with your campaign you're running
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.240]  for congress again you're uh you are going to file uh tell us about that
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.480]  congressman i'll be filing this coming monday
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.840]  as an independent in one of two districts i'm not sure
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:15.680]  because when i went to uh to art school if you will
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:19.440]  elec they split the district up into three ways to make sure i could never
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.480]  come back so i i'm basically have no money but i
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.280]  think money plays too much a part in politics anyway
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:28.880]  i think it's time for somebody without a lot of money just to put the hay where
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.840]  the ghosts can reach it and tell the people what's going on and
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.960]  and run and run the old-fashioned way well you certainly got a lot of name
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.720]  recognition and a lot of people love you in your uh state there and know that
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:43.840]  i know that you were railroad and we talked about that some last time but
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:47.280]  perhaps because we have you know new audience tuning in all the time
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.080]  recap what happened to you and then we're going to get into some of the
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.560]  current things that are happening and get your take on it like
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:55.280]  us army trains to confront tea party
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:58.640]  terrorist this is confirmed we have their internal training
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.400]  manuals where they prepare for gun confiscation war against the american
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.600]  people but first recapping your railroading
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.640]  well you know number one several of the people that were involved already
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.560]  now admitted they were pressured to lie there's a young man in nigeria a young
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.000]  black man that filed an affidavit with the with the nigerian
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.120]  government mr. okola that his life was ruined because he wouldn't
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.320]  perjure himself against trafficking bottom line it was a six-year
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:26.480]  investigation 15 million dollars over 250 agents
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:30.240]  honor about the time elix that the trade center and the pentagon were being
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.040]  attacked and the government voluntarily stated
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:36.400]  that this trial that they made no tapes on me at all
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:40.400]  and now it's come out then i can't prove it yet but it's all over that they
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:43.280]  burned boxes and boxes of tapes because there was no physical evidence
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.480]  that seven people have said they bribed me three of them already
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:49.680]  recanted the two major charges were dropped because
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:53.440]  those people admitted before trial they were pressured to lie so now the
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:57.040]  prosecutors were confirmed insurance company somewhere in ohio and they're
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.400]  scared to death and i want to say this on your show
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.520]  i want some whistleblower to come forward and confirm
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:06.960]  that they burned boxes and boxes of tapes they made on jim trafken
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:10.960]  over six-year investigation because the reason why they said they had no tapes
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.560]  alex i could use their own tapes against them and say where's the crime
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.240]  so now i think they're showing it i think it's coming out i think most people
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:20.880]  realize what happened and remember i'm the guy that brought
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.960]  john deminich back home from israel who was on death row for being i've been
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.560]  terrible and maybe this is exclusive on your show today alex
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.600]  that john deminich from germany on trial now
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:35.360]  has requested of his his family and his defense
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:39.920]  that they bring me into germany uh relative to this trial and if i am
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:44.480]  subpoenaed i am going to germany so that's an exclusive for you alex
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:48.640]  and to recap that the israeli supreme court said you were right you got him
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:54.080]  the documents he was not the guy you we know who he was look nothing like
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.160]  this individual and then still the u.s government grabs him and sends him to
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:01.920]  germany when israel said he's innocent yes and you know what's amazing alex
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.240]  must give israel credit for this or supreme court took my evidence that the
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:09.360]  u.s courts wouldn't accept it congress wouldn't hold a hearing because they
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.240]  said it's too sensitive and alex what i said is
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.320]  when the sensitivity quote unquote sensitivity waived the bill of rights
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.000]  my god what happened to us when you endanger the right of one american
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.920]  you endanger the rights of all american so what's happening now and i want this
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:27.520]  also as an update on your program israel would not
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:32.080]  convene a trial on this new matter so they had to go to germany
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:36.880]  our government is just trying to cover their tracks alex they should be charged
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.000]  with attempted murder they knew this man was an ivan
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.760]  and they suborned perjury the obstructed justice and they've got away with it
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:46.800]  they've gotten away with this alex and they know he's ill
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:50.640]  it's official oppression i mean they they they know he's innocent they're just
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.480]  doing this they're hoping he dies before there can even be a trial
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.920]  they're trying to cover up for what they did in the past just remember this alex
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:02.400]  the documents that i got that took him off a death row after being convicted
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.920]  we're justice department document and the justice department knew that he was
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:10.880]  not the guy oh yeah absolutely this is out of hand
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:14.560]  we need a mechanism we need a mechanism alex
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.840]  we need a mechanism where the i where the fbi and the justice department
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.600]  can be in fact tried one of my last bills was the fair justice act
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:27.040]  the president would nominate the senate would confirm for a ten-year term
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.720]  the director of the fair justice agency would have only one duty alex and that
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:34.960]  would be to investigate and prosecute crimes within the justice department
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:39.200]  my god we got a police state coming at us we've got a government that
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:43.120]  we were basically economic slaves here and no one's really looking at it
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.600]  seriously that's why i'm giving you credit
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:49.760]  you're going out on a limb and i remember telling connie chung about pan
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.760]  m103 be very careful how you handle pan m103
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.960]  and she she did an hour special on the report
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:00.640]  confidential report i got and all i want to say is this a couple weeks later
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:06.320]  she was never seen on tv again now you are very courageous guy and i've
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.800]  been following you and i know that they there are many people in the government
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:14.400]  they're very upset because you are educating the american people
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:18.160]  and american people have been dumbed down dumbed down through a mainstream media
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.320]  that has in fact aided and abetted this government i don't understand why
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.720]  jim traffic is our guest congressman i don't want to talk about myself but i
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.600]  am in the middle of this and i want to ask your advice
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.080]  uh the adl the southern property law center in the last
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:38.000]  six months or so have put out multiple reports of peace
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.680]  they're now even saying ron paul is a terrorist uh
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:45.680]  enabler uh they're saying judge depolitano is an extremist terrorist
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:48.960]  enabler the mayak homeland security reports that law enforcement sent us
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.080]  over a year ago say that gun owners conservatives returning veterans i'm
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.440]  sure you've seen that in the news now we've gotten army documents
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.800]  and we've confirmed that they're following us around at in the fed
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.000]  rallies we've confirmed that uh in these briefings for the military
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.960]  they project my photo up and like i'm the kingpin or the or the godfather
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:13.440]  and and say that i want cops to die and then i want the mill it just all lies
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.600]  and the national news nightline you name it have been down here seeing in
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.520]  the i mean the list goes on and on and they keep saying on the news
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:25.280]  and george soros's outfit keeps saying i'm calling for violence
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:28.640]  when it's the opposite what does that sound like to you i mean are they really
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:31.520]  getting ready to set me up it sounds to me
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:35.680]  is if you're a great american and you're making touch and contact with the
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:39.440]  average american and they don't like it let me just say this ellie
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:42.080]  there's no doubt that you're doing that now here's what you have to be
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:46.560]  concerned about that any technicality could be brought against you and my god
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:50.960]  yeah they can be very vicious but let me say this i think this is a badge
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.440]  of honor my name was mentioned one time in an irs review that said
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:58.800]  american people shouldn't listen to congressman jim trafficking he's just
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:01.680]  anti-government and that was one of the biggest
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.200]  compliments i ever received and i think this is a compliment to you
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.800]  because i think it shows you as a leader now the downside is i don't like what
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.920]  they're doing to this tea party these are average american people
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.520]  they don't want to blow anything up and they're not going out there and acting
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:18.640]  violently and and alex jones is not recommending that
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.800]  anybody go out and cause any violence revolution in this country and anybody
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.800]  with a bright mind and a reasonable mind understands that but what they're
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.000]  trying to do is stop this movement and the reason for it is very simple
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.920]  the american people are fed up and they should be they should be fed up
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.280]  and i think what you're doing is you're articulating the reasons why they're
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:40.480]  fed up the problem with the tea party to a degree is
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:44.640]  they're so upset but they don't really understand the total dimension of why
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:48.560]  they're upset and number one they're just opposing rather than
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:52.320]  advocating as well but i think i think they're starting to evolve now alex
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.240]  with leadership that they're hearing from individuals like yourself and from
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.320]  commentary made by you and some others that they're starting to look at say
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:04.000]  look here's what we've got to do now here's what must be done in the country
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.280]  and i think what we have underway is a powerful political revolution taking
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.520]  place united states america and i believe the powers of beer trying to stop it
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:17.120]  they're trying to say that these people radical their races their biggest
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.280]  look i've i've been hit with the anti-semite business the racist business
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:24.560]  the the bigot business but listen to what i stand for
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.160]  if you're an illegal immigrant in this country you're not just an immigrant
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:31.120]  you're an illegal immigrant you should be thrown the hell out
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.000]  enough is enough and we shouldn't be paying health care
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.480]  to take care of people that are driving our cost up so that makes me a bigot
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.840]  look that's just the way it is if you're an hispanic american you're a friend of
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:45.680]  mine if you're an illegal immigrant i don't care what nationality you are
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.960]  you're not a friend of mine and you should be thrown out and we've got to do
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:52.320]  something about that take care of our borders i really feel sorry what's
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:55.280]  going on in arizona and the way they're depicting arizona
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.360]  you know i am the congressman alex that passed putting 10 000 soldiers
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.640]  on our border and keeping people out and keeping drugs out
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:07.680]  and listen these these uh soldiers are overseas in germany and in japan and in
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:10.320]  korea they're going to the theater and going to lunch
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:14.400]  they're guarding the borders in the mid east and got our borders are wide open
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.880]  what kind of national security and homeland security does america have
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:22.960]  this is a joke both of these parties are care are
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:28.480]  basically trying to seduce this growing minority population of hispanic
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:32.960]  into a voting bloc and it's larger now than the african-american community
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:37.040]  enough is enough let's take care of our government call us what you want
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:40.960]  but i just pray to god that you just continue to do what you're doing
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.600]  the reason they're focusing on you is you're effective
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:48.880]  and that's the reason they focused on you and that's what's scary i want to go
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:51.840]  to prison with him setting me up for something don't think don't think that
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.320]  that is untoward that that's forlorn here's the thing i could be concerned
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.160]  about you know i don't know what your relationship is with your network but
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.520]  there'll be people behind the scenes trying to take that microphone away from
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.680]  you because you're having an impact i know let me tell you how i know about
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:11.040]  it i can't explain to you how many times people

[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:19.680]  i i agree with you thank you for doing the alex jones show
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:23.360]  we think alex does a great job we were surprised you're on there
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.320]  some people may be afraid to be on there and they say we don't know why
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:30.240]  we're glad you were on there jim and people but the bottom line is i've
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.080]  heard this all over people commenting about this everywhere i go
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:37.360]  alec so you're reaching people and i think you're
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:40.560]  you're reaching people with an intelligent approach
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:43.760]  and there's certainly no doubt in my mind you're not advocating
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:47.760]  any type of uh violence or anything none of us are congressmen thank you for
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.800]  your kind words on that subject and your advice let's come back in to get in

[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:16.320]  former congressman is our guest mexico has collapsed because of their phony drug war
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  it's totally criminal there's murders ranchers being killed texas arizona i mean it's a mess and
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.040]  then meanwhile washington post human rights observers killed an attack in mexico and it
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:31.200]  talks about all over mexico they're shutting the power and water off to indian groups that live
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:36.800]  down there mexico's very racist towards the indian population i don't know why i mean that it's i mean
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.880]  the folks in mexico are indian and spanish mainly and some germans that uh immigrated there during
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:47.920]  the colonial system and then here's another one mexico acknowledges migrant abuse pledges changes
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:53.840]  i mean they don't give free welfare to any people they arrest illegals instantly i as an american
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:58.720]  can't go down there with my wife and have a baby and have it all paid for i mean this is a sick joke
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:04.320]  congressman absolutely elixir right on target i think we even have to change the constitution if
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:09.600]  someone comes across our border illegally for the purpose of having a child and having an american
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:14.240]  citizen i think that should be changed and the citizenship should be denied and the woman should
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:18.960]  be removed from the country enough is enough no one realizes you know we had a case up here in
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:24.640]  northeast ohaha just real quick elix where a fella went in with a card and got a surgery on his
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:29.760]  pancreas and 10 days later another fella came in with the same card to get surgery and they did
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:34.560]  the surgery they didn't realize it till they checked the paperwork and they were both illegal can't find
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:39.680]  them and did two particular surgeries that the american people our people up here ended up paying
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:46.480]  for i mean this is in our own backyard now imagine what this like in voting booths with fake ids fake
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:52.400]  uh driver's license fake social security card it's gone too far and now we're talking about
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:59.360]  we're talking about making citizens and the state out of illegals who jump the fence by god
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.080]  elix this is putting a neon sign right on the border saying hey jump the fence and eventually
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:09.280]  you become an american citizen well too far well the feds are financing illegal checkpoints to
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:14.480]  the states everywhere all this arizona law says is that if they have suspicion and then you're an
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:18.720]  illegal when they pull you over for drunk driving or whatever it is that the state's going to take
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.840]  you to the feds i mean all that's doing is enforcing the law since winter states not supposed to
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.920]  you know if they catch somebody committing a federal crime to not arrest them amen it's the
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:32.560]  united states through america not the federal government of america let me say this on your show
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:38.320]  i support the arizona law because the reason for the arizona machination is simple the federal
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:43.360]  government has failed to act on behalf of the american people the federal government's job
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:48.640]  is for national security and how the hell can you have national security with a border that's not
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:54.720]  secure someone tell me that so i support i support what they're doing in arizona and they've got to
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:00.160]  stand up bring this is a microcosm of the failed policies of america bring the american people
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:05.600]  attention to it now the mainstream media is making arizona look like racist look like bigots and
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:10.080]  they're going to lose conventions and they're going to lose money look the bottom line is the
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:14.800]  federal government has caused this problem for arizona and for all these borders states
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.480]  the federal government should be taking the brunt of the attack and that's why they don't like
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.280]  ellie jones and that's why don't like jim travagan because the truth of the matter is very plain for
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.080]  us to see the federal government has failed to secure our borders how can you have a homeland
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:33.440]  security border program with a border wide open ellie well what do you think about obama
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:40.000]  announcing yesterday he's sending swat teams to quote all the oil regs uh and uh some regan
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.360]  administration officials are on record saying they believe this is greasing the skids for the feds
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:51.280]  nationalizing oil i wouldn't be surprised the way the country's going we've nationalized everything
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:58.480]  just keep this in mind general motors government motors stock is now trading at 27 cents a share
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:04.560]  let's be honest about this we have buoyed up a false economic illusion here all these new
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:09.280]  hires they're talking about elix were census workers now you've got a health bill with listen
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:17.840]  to this 159 new boards programs and entities to be created more irs enforcement plus an additional
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:26.400]  16500 irs employees to be hired at a cost of 1.7 trillion dollars all of these jobs we have more
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:31.440]  government workers and factory workers are ready and this is a false illusion i think the best thing
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:37.120]  that could be done is the states have got to put their foot down here and that we have no more states
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:43.200]  right their background music in a doctor's office and maybe arizona will highlight the issue of the
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:50.000]  united states of america remember there used to be a nation known as ussr and now they broke up don't
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.920]  think we can't implode and i predict that i predict unless there's a direct intended change in taxes
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:01.840]  it starts a reward work that we're going to implode it's just a matter of time well you got the
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:06.480]  federal government calling for carbon taxes but then china and india and mexico and others don't
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:10.800]  have to have the carbon taxes i mean that will kill the economy why does the federal government
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:15.680]  want to kill the economy you know what elix what's really funny is uh the reports now say the
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:20.560]  forensic reports say that most of the carbon problems in america are brought in from the trade
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:26.880]  wins from the far east from china and japan and these countries don't want to do anything about
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:32.320]  their carbon emission emission i think look i think it's time for us to say we can handle our
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:37.040]  economic problems and the world can handle theirs too but good fences make good board
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:42.960]  make good friends stay there stay there jim traffic ant former congress from ohio is our

[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:42.880]  underwear bombing was a staged event with eyewitnesses that we interviewed that were on the plane
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:47.120]  and that saw the feds getting him on the plane and that's now been admitted by the way police state for

[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:09.280]  live broadcast that we simulcast for the radio at prison planet dot tv going back to jim traffic
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:15.760]  and jim oklahoma city i mean take us back to 1995 and again i the reason i bring this up is
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:20.720]  uh i mean you've been involved in everything i investigate if it's exposing tyranny you you
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:25.200]  find jim traffic ant there i didn't even know that no member of congress would talk to her
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:30.240]  and other survivors of that horrible bombing that she saw the feds in there which he later
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:35.120]  learned planting bombs with telephone wire and gray sticks of butter uh in the weeks before
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:41.680]  including tim mcvay and others uh and that when she and others brought you this information
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:46.000]  that you were the only person that would look at it and that she said that uh your staff said
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.920]  that you were threatened uh to to shut up about it but that you wouldn't shut up so uh give us
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.960]  your take on what happened there number one i don't think there's any way that truck load of
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:05.280]  fertilizer that exploded outside could have had the type of impact internally that showed from that
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:12.000]  and immediately i had my doubts what's amazing about it is the reason i was the only one is congress
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.840]  is afraid most members of congress don't want to get involved in anything they're first of all
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:20.640]  they may look like a cook if you do second of all they may look like you're an american if you do
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:25.440]  because they're going to have the mainstream press against you but since the deminia case everybody
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:29.840]  would rely on me and i got most of the information what i found out and what i felt would happen
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:35.600]  oklahoma city but there was much broader conspiracy and activity involved there and i wouldn't be
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:40.160]  surprised for some reason that there were complications that involve government and
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:46.640]  government officials as well that's what my deduction was but i couldn't get to first base
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:51.120]  with anything alex and you have to understand you have to have something concrete which i was able
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.600]  to develop in the deminia case they couldn't get around the evidence but i had to send it to an
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:00.320]  israeli supreme court to get anything done with it so you could imagine the problem i was getting
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:06.960]  trying to uh get in garter and glean more information relative to the oklahoma city bombing
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:12.880]  but what i can't say is this there's a lot more to it and i don't believe anything anymore the
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.440]  government is telling the american people i don't want to get involved in the 911 issue
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.520]  but i have my doubts about 911 as well now remember i got the deminia information and i got the
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:30.320]  actual factual information on panam 103 and i know exactly what happened to panam 103
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:35.200]  and it's not what our government said happened tell us what happened with panam 103 the report
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:40.400]  i got was an intelligence report that said a man named akmed gibril and monzer al-qasar
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:46.640]  were hired by iran to respond to america shooting down of that iranian airbus if you recall that
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.080]  yes and they put together an international team and they couldn't find a target
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:58.400]  and monzer al-qasar who shipped heroin from the from the golden triangles to new york through
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:07.280]  frankford started to see akmed gibril's people around frankford airport and supposedly he was
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.520]  worried he was going to ruin his gravy train and there was an anonymous call made warning there's
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:17.440]  going to be an a terrorist act around the airport but there was no increase in security to to more
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:23.680]  or less chase akmed gibril away the bottom line is the plane went down over lacherby it was supposed
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.160]  to go down over the ocean but winddrift took it over rockerby here's things i could tell you
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:33.200]  number one there there wasn't an anonymous call made at frankford international with no increase
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:39.120]  in security and second of all two weeks after the incident first president bush asked for akmed
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:47.600]  gibril to be extradited united states and syria united monzer al-qasar was the biggest heroin man
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:56.000]  and he made his living shipping to america now what the report said was that he was influential
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:02.080]  alex in getting french hostages released from iran and he was working with the cia 11 on office
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:06.960]  to get american hostages at the time i believe there were eight there alex it said that there
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:12.400]  was nothing good happening so the cia sent the team to see what was going on headed by an army
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:21.200]  major mckay from pittsburgh on leave to the cia alex all of those five cia agents and major mckay
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:30.960]  were killed on that 103 flight but what it was is our government the report says covered up the
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:36.320]  truthful incident because of the american people knew that heroin was being overlooked because
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.200]  this valuable asset monzer al-qasar did be a revolution over here so the first thing the
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:46.640]  government said is trafficking anti-government cia said it's nonsense and naturally no one went with
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.760]  it but connie chung went with it and the truth of the matter was they ended up arresting these two
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:56.640]  libyans one of them was even released and believe me if they were guilty they had choked on a chicken
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:01.680]  bone over there in qaddafi's prison this is the truth of what happened in 103 so i didn't have the
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:07.760]  time to look into 911 but i'll tell you this i was starting to get reports alex people were
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:13.760]  starting to confide in me and what i don't like is i don't believe the commission i didn't believe
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:19.680]  the warrant commission i didn't believe the commission on 911 i believe these commissions
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:25.200]  are nothing more than to ensure that there's no reprisals and repercussions from the american
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:30.160]  people and i think that's why they're concerned about you i think you're exposing these things
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:34.960]  and i think america is better off if we know the truth we know the truth about our government
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:39.360]  and this is where i think the problem is the american people don't trust the government anymore
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:47.920]  and i see a tremendous upheaval i see an american political revolution on maybe 2010 may not be the
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:54.320]  actual welcome for that occurring but it's not far off alex you're going to see a tremendous
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:58.800]  upheaval in this country where the american people are going to respond to this illegal immigration
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.800]  issue this so-called cap and trade type issue this big government health care issue with 159 new
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:13.200]  boards and and going to in fact in fact ensure almost 50 million illegal immigrants there's a
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:18.160]  hell of a lot more than 12 to 15 illegals in this country alex when the truth comes out i think you're
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:23.200]  going to the american people are going to revolt but i think it's going to be a peaceful revolution
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:28.640]  and let me say this i know that you've never advocated violence but you are advocating that
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:34.000]  the american people take a stand now what bothers me is they're trying to paint this tea party
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:39.680]  is something sinister and it's not you know what bothers me more than that is all these politicians
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:43.920]  keep saying we need you to vote we need you to get involved in government well here's a group
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:48.480]  that's getting involved they're getting very involved everybody's saying whoa we don't want
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:53.440]  you to be involved well it's what they're calling for i mean they're calling for lower taxes abolish
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:58.400]  the fellow reserve have national sovereignty defend our borders defend the second amendment
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:03.280]  do what this country was built on to be americans and and that was the question i was about to bring
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:10.080]  back up bill clinton and others go on tv and say gee i hope there isn't another oklahoma city
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.360]  caused by the tea parties but i'm afraid it's going to happen the only card that criminal
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:21.040]  elements of the government can play is to stage a terror attack another oklahoma city in this
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:26.400]  country to go after the american people and i see them framing myself by name but the entire tea
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:32.800]  party and libertarians and ron paul as causing whatever is about to happen i mean that looks
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:38.160]  like two plus two equals four to me i mean the only card they can play is a stage terror attack
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:42.800]  ellie is very unfortunate now i've said this without disrespect but i'm going to say it right
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:48.160]  here on your show they don't call clinton slick willie for nothing the democrats have worried
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:51.840]  they're worried that american people are going to take their venom out on the party in power
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:56.960]  as they did years ago when they drew hasterd and the republicans out truth of the matter is both
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:02.320]  of these parties have been compromised i talked about it on the gredibond susten show i talked about
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:08.320]  on your show i've been labeled anisemite we have basically a foreign nation israel who's controlling
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:14.320]  the american congress they've got us in two wars and it bankrupted us and now we're in a situation
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.800]  where the american people are saying why are our kids coming back and body bags what are we doing
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:24.240]  over there why are we continuing to go bankrupt with these wars now they're starting to sense that
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:29.520]  the american people don't even control their congress which they don't this is the tragedy here
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.640]  but they have former president clinton who is still very popular come out and say my god if
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.120]  something something bad is going to happen because this tea party this tea party can produce some
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:44.080]  bad things look if there's anything bad that happened is because the american people are
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:50.560]  totally disgusted a man who flew his plane into an irs building in texas a man who bulldozed his home
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:56.480]  in ohio because he was tired of the bank this is what's happening you're seeing the american people
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:01.200]  react because their government is failing to address the problems that exist in the country
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:06.160]  period i agree with you and there's lots of things happening that are real but
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.360]  if you look at the preconditioning in the build up and even the hatari militia we've documented
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:16.400]  that was a total federal setup with people inside provocaturing them to shoot their mouths off and
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:22.720]  so they they're having these busts to create this background story that oh look the gun owners are
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:28.560]  about to attack to attack and we know we have the documents that they're training the military
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:35.200]  for gun confiscation and we've had the mayor of schenectady new york we've had uh house reps
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:40.560]  in the legislature of illinois and others calling for troops on the streets i mean this is getting
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:45.520]  really creepy well let me tell you the politicians should be calling for troops troops on the border
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:50.160]  and stay off of the american people and that second amendment wasn't protect duck hunters
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:54.000]  it was to protect the american people from a government and let me tell you some they're
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:59.360]  bringing this on themselves but the the good thing is happening is all these issues are now
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:05.280]  coming to light ellie they're coming to light because you and i as a leader you as a leader
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.840]  and there are others out there but they're not as strong and this is what i'm saying to you
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:15.920]  now you have to be very careful they will make some technicality into a major cardinal crime
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:21.120]  and that's the way it works so i think you having heard these comments i think you know
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:25.920]  that you're very no i know and i'm very aware of it i appreciate you talking about it i i mean
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:29.200]  i never intended to have this big of an effect i mean i wanted to have an effect but i didn't
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:32.720]  know i'd get in the position of within so many of these documents they're saying there's the
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:36.720]  enemy getting and getting but but i've talked to so many troops that have called me and sent us
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:42.080]  information they say that's why the troops and police then tune into the show because they're
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.840]  told don't listen to alex jones he's bad i mean the government is smart at certain levels but it's
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:54.160]  also stupid alex you know the amazing thing when i brought john deminich home i got a number of calls
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:00.480]  sorted just like this just listen good job congressman we're proud of you hang up good job
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:05.760]  congressman hang up the reason those calls were so quick as they were coming from the justice department
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:11.360]  believe me the people in the government knew what they did to deminich people think there's a lot of
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:15.280]  people the government don't like what's going on alex there's a lot of people in the government
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:19.840]  that are listening to you now the problem is we're starting to get all this militia talk we need
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:25.280]  militia because we've got all these groups that are establishing look all of the the government's
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:31.200]  troops should be concentrating on securing our borders getting us out of these wars overseas
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:36.720]  that have bankrupted us and take care of america's issues they shouldn't be targeting american people
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:40.640]  and that's what they're doing and what i don't like about it is if you look at the tea party
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:45.840]  the tea party are basically frustrated americans but they're republicans and they're democrats
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:50.240]  they voted for republican presidents and they voted for democrat presidents and what they're
[02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:55.600]  saying loud and clear and everybody's trying to dilute it because they're afraid that the party
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:00.640]  in power is going to be removed and that's where president clinton come in i think it's very
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:05.680]  unfortunate that he made that statement but i'm going to make this statement on the alex jones show
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:12.320]  they don't call him slick willy for nothing and i made that statement on a robert novak show
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:18.320]  when the irs threatened a veto of the irs reform bill because of the trafficking language that
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:23.440]  changed the burden of proof and i said on the robert novak show that president clinton isn't
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.160]  called slick willy for nothing he could sign the bill and help the american taxpayers or he could
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:33.600]  veto the bill and help them a few irs agents and he signed the bill and that's the type of pressure
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:38.560]  we need to put back president clinton should not have made that statement he should reverse that
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:45.520]  statement let me sorry go ahead and this is what i'm saying disregard that statement that's a
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:51.040]  political statement that's not a national security statement and it's unfortunate let me bring up
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:54.480]  another issue i'm gonna take a few calls for you and also give out your address for people that
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:58.560]  want to support your campaign or physically get involved you're filing a money we want to have you
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:03.920]  back as that unfolds you're very gracious with your time sir again a jim trafficking joining us
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:10.240]  it has come out that a lot of republicans and democrats are gay and i'm not attacking them
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.160]  for that but but that they're being blackmailed like if they're a drug dealer or they're taking
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:18.400]  bribes or there's a lot of different ways you can get compromised and the word from really good
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:24.320]  sources is obama's being compromised and blackmailed uh... that congressman lindsay gramm was
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:29.920]  the head of alley pack which is a very serious focus guy who i've been watching for over a decade
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:35.200]  i've never heard mr. geene say something that wasn't true he says he's got it down pat that
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:40.720]  lindsay gramm is just running around basically all over the place you know in the streets cruising
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:44.560]  and that they're blackmailing him five days after that information was released
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:51.440]  gramm said i'm not doing immigration reform i'm not going for the carbon tax he he said i'm i'm
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:58.240]  done and uh... how big a problem is blackmail in congress for congressmen and women who really
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:04.160]  are involved in hanky panky it's very big alex now look i can't speak on any individual case
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.440]  but again as i got personal information remember i'm the fellow on the house floor
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:15.520]  that said that janet reno was a lesbian and she was controlled by organized crime
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:21.600]  who had photographs of her with young women now i was protected by the speech and debate clause
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:28.080]  but i went on again a national tv show to robert novak show and i re-edit those statements
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:33.280]  and i said go ahead janet i'm not protected by the speech and debate clause take me to court
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:39.040]  because maybe now we'll find out why you will not allow an investigation in ten million dollars
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:46.240]  from a red chinese army general that went to president clinton's campaign fund and i never
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:52.240]  heard a word from her now they put me in prison but listen to what i'm telling you she was controlled
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.160]  the attorney general united states was controlled the cia and anybody listening to this fbi
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:03.440]  come on and pick up jim traffic and i'm on probation right here on alex jones show i'm saying
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:10.000]  that she was a lesbian she was in fact appointed an assistant prosecutor in date county the cocaine
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:16.320]  capital of america she was ultimately after the prosecutor resigned appointed the prosecutor
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:24.800]  then one reelection now that's what i knew about but i can guarantee you there are people in washington
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:30.800]  that are afraid to say anything because of their background there are people who are afraid and
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.040]  this is this is the thing i don't like and this is the thing congressman i've got to interrupt i'm
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:39.600]  skipping a network break this break belongs to the network station should not run over this
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:44.640]  i'm skipping the break for time uh go ahead congressman okay the bottom line is i don't
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:51.040]  know if you remember but jane harmon from california was picked up on a voice recorder
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:55.520]  of promising american israeli public affairs committee they should get their two spies out
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:59.440]  of prison if they use their influence to make her the chairman of the intelligence committee
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:05.840]  that was on the news yeah but it was hidden away real fast and it was hidden away real good
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:12.800]  but do you know that the two spies were ultimately turned loose by by our attorney general holder
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:18.000]  and he said we're not sure that they had bad intent well keep in mind alex that the man
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:23.760]  that they were working with in a pentagon larry franklin is still in prison for 12 years for giving
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:29.920]  secrets and what their efforts were they were attempting to mobilize the pentagon to attack
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:35.840]  iran look enough is enough everybody's afraid down there alex and the thing i don't like
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:43.120]  is the irs has thousands of times testified before congressman said the only weapon we have
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:51.760]  to collect voluntary taxes is the element of fear alex how does fear and the word fear and the
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:57.680]  process of fear even enter into the bill of rights and the declaration of independence my god what
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:03.360]  has happened to us alex well congressman uh i did the research at the time i know it was in two
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:10.640]  major florida papers that she was actually caught when she was just a prosecutor so drugged out on
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:16.720]  alcohol and pills vomiting uh in the back of a car in a parking garage with a 13-year-old girl
[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:22.160]  it also came out and i believe it was lawsuits and pull this up that she would go check out kids
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:28.720]  that that had been cps from the cps did you ever see that info no the information that i had was
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:35.520]  that the powers to be in the cocaine business had photographs of her with young ladies in
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:41.440]  compromising situations and she was she was really ineffective and impotent in anything she
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:47.040]  had tried to do the thing that i the reason that i got so involved with janet rino as she testified
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:52.160]  before congress about wake up that they did everything not to push david koresh over the edge
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:58.000]  listen no one got more information than me on that case alex and listen to this david koresh
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:02.720]  went jogging every morning and went for lunch and went for breakfast in the local town they could
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:08.000]  have arrested him in town there'd been no problem they wanted that siege they wanted that siege to
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:13.840]  try and change the irs law of this exemptions for these church related activities and it blew up in
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:18.320]  their face but when she testified that congressman said we didn't want to presser him and push him
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:23.680]  over the edge i wasn't on that committee right after this question then my god why did you have
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:31.040]  strobe lights on that building all night and played the the recordings of dying rabbits at the screaming
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:36.400]  decibel level so high it was hurt in villages five miles away if you didn't want to push anybody
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:42.880]  over the edge she lied but the thing that bothered me is we had a general the red chinese army alex
[02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:48.560]  they gave ten million dollars to the clinton campaign and she never investigated she said it
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:54.560]  wasn't worth even investigation now my god we have china right now that is controlling much
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:59.680]  of the money supply in america they're controlling the commerce and trade of america you have israel
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:04.880]  that's controlling the national and international policies of america where the hell did american
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:11.280]  people come in and why isn't anybody saying it well this is a incredible interview with
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:15.600]  james trafficking i know you're on the road right now traveling and if you can't do it it's fine
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:19.760]  we're going to break her in about five minutes for one minute can we have an extra additional
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:24.960]  five minutes with you i'll be be honored and let me tell you something i am concerned about you
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:28.800]  but you're making one hell of an impact well i'm concerned about you and everybody else that has
[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:33.840]  courage and god bless you again jim trafficking is our guest and you're going back to wake up
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.800]  briefly i remember the flare footage of the bradley fighting vehicles with the troops firing
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:46.320]  their their assault rifles and it came out the delta force was there it was in time magazine that
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:52.960]  israeli troops of all people and british troops were there as a congressman who was there during
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:55:00.240]  those investigations what's your intel on that it was a joke the way the mainstream media actually
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:05.440]  turned it around where many americans at their dinner table was saying they got just what they
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:12.000]  deserve down there in texas my god alex there were 17 kids incinerated children incinerated in
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:18.080]  that building i had seen films of it where many of those guns and many of those heavy artillery
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:24.640]  was re aimed right at the exit points where no one was coming out of there look janet rino and the
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:31.280]  justice department should have gone to prison over that and another one was very bad now so you're
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:35.920]  you're not a white supremacist and you're not a racist i know that neither am i but this fellow
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:41.760]  randy weaver out there in idaho they shot his wife holding their infant child right between the eyes
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:47.360]  of marksman killed it killed a dog and killed his 14 year old boy i made a speech every week until
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:51.760]  they settled and he ended up settling for about five million dollars with the government but they
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:58.560]  did that and and they they entangled that man because he was supposedly a white supremacist
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:03.840]  and was a political target united states government look i'm not into any white supremacist black
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.840]  supremacist black power business i'm for a straight and honest american society but regardless of
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:15.680]  what your politics are i don't think that you should be singled out well i know weaver he was
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:20.320]  a former special forces they wanted to be an informant against the arian nations we'd only
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:26.560]  visited once uh... he was quote separating himself from society none of that was even true
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:30.400]  and when he wouldn't go be an informant for them they went and did what they did
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:35.200]  yeah it was a shame what they did is they came to him and trapped them to cut this off two barrels
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:38.720]  off shotguns he said why don't you do it they said well you know we don't want to get into that we
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.160]  don't know what we're doing you know you know what you're doing and then trapped the guy
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:46.640]  but the way they come in with this watch team and the way to destroy that family but see this is
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:51.360]  what america's not saying they're not seeing the other side of the one i jack let me tell you some
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:57.280]  alec and that's seven and a half years in prison i'm probably more knowledgeable than anyone that
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:01.600]  ever served in congress that isn't self-serving because i've seen the other side of this thing
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:08.160]  and see i know what you're talking about you're very unpopular in the nation's capital but your
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:13.040]  popularity is growing because people know you're telling the truth and you're touching you're
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:19.280]  touching subjects that people are afraid to even comment on this is what bothers me do we have freedom
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:24.320]  of speech in america well do we have my sir men i mean i'm not looking for trouble but i can't
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:29.200]  control myself when i see corruption and people being oppressed i've got to stand up against it
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:33.920]  and i quite frankly don't don't give a damn if they kill me i don't want that to happen but i'm
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:38.560]  committed well let me tell you something the truth of the matter is there are a lot of americans like
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:43.040]  you and they don't have the microphone and they respect the hell out of you for it and that's
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:48.000]  why you have a tremendous responsibility you have a tremendous responsibility with the pressure
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:54.320]  that you're going to be getting and after having an interview with jim trafficking my god uh they're
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:58:00.080]  going to have their antenna completely but what i'm saying are things that i know that i've
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:06.720]  investigated myself and when i brought a man home off a death row for mass murder and israel called
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:12.320]  me at my hotel in jerusalem and said he'll be in televieve tomorrow night congressman take him home
[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:19.680]  that tells you that i got the right information and the government knew it and then you're demonized
[02:58:20.640 --> 02:58:25.920]  and they set you up and put you in prison we're going to come back uh i'm sorry to the callers
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:29.920]  it's just that all the info he keeps bringing out i want to you know get every minute we can because

[02:59:49.360 --> 03:00:05.280]  bank dot com waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:27.840]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live jim traffic in final segment with him
[03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:32.880]  we have talked about so many issues but but going back to blackmail and congress you know they can
[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:38.480]  selectively either falsely charge somebody or use a crooked toenail to put them in prison
[03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:42.640]  and then meanwhile i've been talking for years about goldman sacks openly robbing everyone
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:47.600]  and the and the people we've talked to the experts here they believe that these justice department
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:53.680]  criminal research criminal investigation is just a big cover-up and that the civil indictment is
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:58.320]  just a big cover-up because goldman sacks is obama's biggest contributor where do you see this going
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:03.120]  congressman well i don't see anything happening to anybody i think there's a big network of people
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  that surround our government they control our government and i think we have to start looking
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:12.800]  again at foreign entanglements like first president washington warned us of and back then it was
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:18.720]  brit but now believe me we have israel is very powerful and they're very powerful on wall street
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  the thing that bothers me is much of our government has been coming from goldman sacks
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:28.240]  they've been sending their people into our decision-making process i think it's time
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:33.760]  audit the fed isn't enough we got to end the fed coin money as the constitution says and we
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:38.080]  could promulgate a plan to do that i think it's time to throw many of these departments of government
[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:42.640]  out department of energy was supposed to take our dependence off of foreign oil hell we have more
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.200]  dependency now than we had back then department of education i think it's time for the states they
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:51.680]  handle that and the local school boards that make salient decisions and i think there's so many
[03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:57.840]  things but alex i'm saying this on your show if we do not in fact abolish the irs and repeal the
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:04.320]  income tax and let the american people get their entire pay with no withholding no tax on savings
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:09.920]  no corporate tax no capital gains tax no inheritance and death taxes no more social security no more
[03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:14.880]  medicare tax no more audits no more paperwork no more receipts no more accountants no more
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:22.480]  attorneys and that 25 percent tax will cover these problems and second of all as harvard
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:28.240]  studies said when we take the burdensome compliance off this communist progressive income tax
[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:34.000]  that prices will drop so significantly that we will have hardly no increase in prices we have now
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:39.760]  and finally for those under the latter they take their receipts into the government and the government
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:44.960]  would give them as they have now assistance programs but that would be coupled with work
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:50.800]  and finally all this underground narcotic business they pay taxes and they're they're now on ssi and
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:54.800]  their wives are in public housing by the way second of all all these people come to visit
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:01.600]  broadway in las vegas germany japan all over the world canada they would pay into our tax scheme
[03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  and we can turn to you men the people are not free and we will not be free until we take the yoke
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:14.080]  of the income tax off the american people we've got to reward work and personal industry that's my
[03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:19.360]  statement all right congressman we are out of time very gracious to give us this much time people

[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:33.200]  i would just add kennedy cut the income tax by 50 percent and government tax receipts doubled
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:37.040]  the government knows when they cut taxes they get more money because the economy speeds up
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:42.640]  they want to control the economy and and that's why they're only expanding government we've got
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:47.600]  at least just stop the growth of it or it's over as you said give us your address so people can

[03:08:53.920 --> 03:08:58.560]  remote areas where we were going to go out to reefs and dive and and it was the people that
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:04.480]  ran the dive place who were americans or british it was the villagers i'd i'd go into some shack to
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:09.440]  eat some fried fish and those people and i'd say how do you know who i am oh they make copies of
[03:09:09.440 --> 03:09:15.440]  your dvds you know we watch it down at the church and and then i get callers calling in you know

[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:58.400]  i mean the point is is that is that i've said over and over again i am in over my head i mean adl
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:04.560]  southern poverty law center reports government reports secret army reports and i don't just have
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:11.440]  the reports i then talk to military i then talk to family uh who are in the military and they say
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:18.480]  no that you're in briefings i mean the pentagon has me in briefings i mean i don't know how much
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:24.720]  longer i got here folks i mean this is getting to the point of insanity i mean and i said i'm
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:29.520]  going to go to terry christian larry tony and others before trafficking came on we were taking
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:34.480]  calls from military and police who were confirming the marshal law drills state police in georgia
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:38.880]  where they're training to go in and just kill whole families uh to take their guns and and
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:43.840]  we have the internal drills where they take on the tea partiers and the military shows up in
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:49.280]  sandiego with sound cannons uh what was that five months ago for the tea party and they're
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:54.000]  attacking everybody i mean it just does this nightmare have to happen does goldman sacks
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:59.200]  have to steal everything do we have to have carbon taxes do we have to have open borders
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:06.000]  am i really the bad man and and why am i other than ron paul but i'll go a lot further than ron paul goes
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:15.600]  uh why why am i why does this have to be me this is not fun uh you know for all of the co entel
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:20.080]  pro individuals who pose as patriots and attack me and we've confirmed that in many cases like
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:25.200]  halterner and others we know what's going on there but so much of the other attacks i go
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:31.360]  through in the trolling it's just jealousy uh you know all these people out there when when my
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:35.600]  listeners not not really alex jones i understood the power of people and getting them to take action
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:40.720]  and getting them to make copies of films and put them on access tv you know i i had read a lot of
[03:11:40.720 --> 03:11:46.000]  history books so i read about the printing press uh freeing europe from the dark ages and i read
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:51.840]  about the founding fathers with little handheld presses with one page handbills waking up the
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:56.800]  american people over the 15 years before the revolutionary war so i day one made films and
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:12:02.000]  said make copies you carried the ball we've had a big effect on that front and other fronts
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:07.040]  and now all these am and fm stations that thought i was a cook 10 years ago i've done more than 5000
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:12.000]  interviews so i've done interviews on almost every talk station in the country over and over and over
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:16.560]  again and i have radio executives and big radio hosts and others that call me and say we thought
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:22.000]  you were a cook it's all true you know my sons and the marines they're training for gun confiscation
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:28.320]  my daughter's in the army you know same thing that's what they're scared of because we were
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:36.480]  here for so long telling people what was being set up that now it's openly happening and our
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:43.360]  credibility is rocketing upwards but it's this audience that generated much of what is the
[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:47.440]  modern patriot movement i mean i remember ron paul and i didn't really know this three years ago
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:51.840]  he was on for an interview about three four months into his campaign he said i just want to
[03:12:51.840 --> 03:12:57.920]  say on air half of our support half the people that come up to me and give me support are saying
[03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:03.120]  they came from your show so ron paul in the aggregate is bigger than the work i've done
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:07.680]  and that's wonderful i'm glad there's bigger targets out there than me and he's a great man
[03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:14.080]  but it's this audience from texas and others that were a big part of the launch pad that
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:20.480]  propelled ron paul to where he is and i told people at the time you know i i off the record
[03:13:20.480 --> 03:13:23.520]  many others pressured him to run and i said look it doesn't matter if you don't win
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:28.960]  he'll create a big movement and you'll be able to talk about real issues and he said yeah but
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:34.000]  then if we don't win people will get mad he understood that responsibility but then i
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:39.360]  told listeners when he didn't win the presidency i said resistance was victory now look at how
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:44.560]  he's been mainstreamed now look at how they try to destroy him and they failed uh so they're trying
[03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:51.440]  to act like they're his friend and spin when he's saying uh in the media and i hope to get to that
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:56.160]  point myself i'm now at the testing point where they're saying that i'm calling for violence and
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:01.600]  i'm calling for killing cops they're telling cops and military and i arrest this to try to manipulate
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:07.520]  them into tearing me limb from limb but it won't matter if they tear me limb from limb i will still
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:12.640]  win with my message and my mission and so it's the mission that matters and i understand the
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:18.560]  responsibility i have i understand every day i'm just human like everybody else i have my own
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:25.520]  problems uh just like everybody else uh you know every day i when i'm driving home i've got to stop
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:30.080]  stop myself from pulling over and buying a six pack of beer and going home and grilling a 20-ounce
[03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:36.320]  steak i mean you know those those are my vices uh you know every day i've got a it's almost like
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:40.880]  a vice that i want to go fishing and do nothing but spend time with my children but i know that's
[03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:45.520]  not a vice that's why i'm going to be taking some more days off here in the future uh just because
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:48.960]  if i am going to get put in prison or if i am going to get killed i just want to be with my
[03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:53.520]  children a little more because every moment is precious but then i was going to take my son
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:59.120]  fishing today but then some radio and tv called that will reach millions of people so i've got a
[03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:04.400]  show up tonight and telling sorry we don't get to go fishing and then i've got the government
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:10.160]  and the media lying saying i'm telling people to kill cops you know what that feels like that that
[03:15:10.160 --> 03:15:16.880]  i am sacrificing everything i am i'm putting my entire body and my name my family name everything
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:24.560]  on the railroad tracks folks to stop this train and i get to see all these other so-called patriot
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:29.120]  leaders i'm not mad that they're jealous and lie about me and attack me and some of them are feds
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:35.200]  but most of them aren't i'm angry that they didn't become real leaders i'm angry that they're involved
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:43.440]  in petty uh jealousy and and and envy i'm upset for them i'm upset that there's so many people
[03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:49.040]  i can't work with because they're morally bankrupt and mentally ill i mean i'm facing you know just
[03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:56.240]  a nightmare situation for myself individually but also the payoff is liberty and freedom
[03:15:56.240 --> 03:16:01.440]  and i passed the point of no return a long time ago and it feels good to be here telling the truth
[03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:05.680]  and taking action in fact i've got a 10 minute video up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:11.920]  dot com i shot yesterday let's put that on screen just the video and video title so so so people know
[03:16:12.800 --> 03:16:19.200]  what they're going to be uh looking for it's up there on the screen i i told the guys to
[03:16:19.200 --> 03:16:23.200]  title it they just got it up an hour ago and we're not going to have time to play it but you can go
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:28.560]  to the website info wars dot com or prison planet dot com to watch it um alex jones sets the record
[03:16:28.560 --> 03:16:32.480]  straight reaches out to military there it is alex jones sets the record straight reaches out to the
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:36.160]  military and it's just a 10 minute video that breaks a lot of this down in the state of the
[03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:42.320]  republic right now but enough about myself it's just that when when james travacant is saying oh
[03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:45.680]  you've got you know you're having this big effect i mean he's not a guy that just said you know says
[03:16:45.680 --> 03:16:51.200]  stuff uh you know you're having a huge effect you better watch it you have a big responsibility
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:55.440]  believe me it's like an echo chamber this is what i'm thinking every minute this is what i'm
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:16:59.280]  understanding every second i wake up in the middle of the night and write down all these notes and all
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:04.080]  these ideas and things i want to talk about and never get to half of it and i i feel like i haven't
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:09.360]  done a good enough job but you know what i've done the best job i could and god knows that and and
[03:17:09.360 --> 03:17:15.280]  look this country is falling into pure evil there is no doubt anymore there's no denial about this
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:18.400]  people have to get out of denial okay i'm gonna go to your calls quickly i apologize for making
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:25.600]  you hold terry in ohio you're on the air go ahead uh yeah alex uh i've called you before being ex vet
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:31.760]  and everything and uh listen to glenn becky's talking about the black robe brigade now i think
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:37.440]  he's that kind of gives you a hint of who i am um you know with everything that's going on and the
[03:17:37.440 --> 03:17:44.080]  troops firing on american citizens you know one thing about it is is this you know you can't
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:49.840]  understand why troops would do that even at nom one of the things was we knew we weren't there
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:54.960]  fighting for our country because if we were we'd be doing it back here in the states and what
[03:17:54.960 --> 03:18:04.160]  happened was is we got the mentality that we were to we were going to uh defend each other okay it
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:10.160]  wasn't so much about you know you and me me friend that kind of thing it was we were going to do
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:14.880]  everything we could to protect ourselves well you got that you're going to have the same scenario
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:22.880]  when if u.s troops come in to start you know shooting and things like that american citizens
[03:18:22.880 --> 03:18:28.000]  and i've thought about this i've even prayed about this and one of the things that keeps coming to my
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:35.120]  mind is that i need to buy a bullhorn and the reason i say that is is this you know in those
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:42.160]  type of situations if the troops realize all you got to do is tell them over with a bullhorn
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:50.320]  that hey your family is going through this exact same thing back home now are you going to allow
[03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:55.920]  others to shoot your families like you're fixing to shoot us and you know what that's going to
[03:18:55.920 --> 03:19:02.720]  that's going to have somewhat of a of a wake-up call because you know what i don't care how hardened
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:10.400]  you are you know by war or how many tours of duty you have you when it comes to shooting a human
[03:19:10.400 --> 03:19:18.080]  being you know that that takes a that takes life out of you and i know that for a fact because it
[03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:26.000]  took me 12 years to finally realize that god would forgive me for what i did you know what i'm saying
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:29.600]  no this is very touching what you're saying and that is the mentality and they're going to stage
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:35.120]  attacks against the military and police to get them whipped up into a fury to go up against the
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:39.840]  population and then in the process we're all going to kill each other which is exactly what these
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:46.480]  offshore bankers want instead of arresting gordon brown and morocco obama and loyd blank fine
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:51.680]  they're setting it up for us to kill each other like a bunch of idiots and i take no pleasure
[03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:56.640]  and thinking about what's going to happen to our military and police because if one out of
[03:19:56.640 --> 03:20:02.640]  one percent of the gun owner stands up in this fight it's over for him hi this is steve shanky

[03:33:04.880 --> 03:33:09.600]  claymore she's alson camarada we're gonna head to afghanistan this morning one of the biggest
[03:33:09.600 --> 03:33:15.120]  obstacles in front of the u.s. troops there in afghanistan is the opium trade the taliban is
[03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:21.040]  using it to intimidate the population joining us from halmog province is heraldo reveron good
[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:25.760]  morning to you heraldo tell us what you've seen during your days there in afghanistan
[03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:33.200]  hi alison david playton yes in some ways the marines brilliantly executed invasion
[03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:40.240]  a marja this town in the middle of helman process province was the easy part the hard work now is
[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:45.600]  governing this province a province as you suggest that has become addicted to opium in many many
[03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:52.400]  ways that is the principal crop that is being grown here the taliban lend the farmers the money
[03:33:52.400 --> 03:33:58.000]  they are indebted to the taliban they have to grow the opium now the marines in their success
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:04.160]  are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is you know they have these
[03:34:04.160 --> 03:34:09.680]  opium fields and we are tolerating it we are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because
[03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:14.160]  we know that if we were to destroy it now the population would turn against the marines and
[03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:18.240]  it would be a real security risk let me introduce lieutenant colonel brian christmas he's the
[03:34:18.240 --> 03:34:24.400]  commanding officer of the third battalion six marines really a wonderful group of marines here
[03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:29.920]  i know that you care deeply about this this contradiction the fact that here you have one
[03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:35.600]  of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted and in a sense you're watching as this
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:40.960]  opium is being grown i know it it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing
[03:34:40.960 --> 03:34:46.080]  about it well frankly this is a part of their culture so while it might grind in my gut and
[03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:51.600]  it's what they do we provide them security we're providing them resources and we're providing them
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:56.080]  alternatives the alternatives are different crops to grow they're getting the seed and the fertilizer
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:35:00.640]  to do it they can they can rotate any of their crops that they want if they want to get rid of
[03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:04.080]  their wheat grow cotton for the winter they can do that and we're going to help them do it so the
[03:35:04.080 --> 03:35:08.640]  same thing goes for the pop so you think that you know we were at the market and everywhere we go
[03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:14.000]  they're selling these little devices take a shot of this great their hand car these are the little
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:20.720]  devices they used to scrape the opium sap off the off the plant and i watched as you bought
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:25.600]  everyone that was for sale because you care so deeply why did you do that i want them off the
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:30.480]  street the idea is that uh we don't want to harvest the poppy hopefully turn the poppy over do you
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:38.160]  see that mind control the troops help them grow the poppies but then they get the paraphernalia
[03:35:38.160 --> 03:35:43.360]  off the streets that's a that's a psyop that's saying yes we help grow it but then we're going
[03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:50.880]  to arrest you if you have it but but but but then on the street it's bad opium production was almost
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:57.280]  down to zero now over 91 percent you can just google that of all the opium in the world that
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:05.360]  creates heroin it comes out of afghanistan uh the news was reported a 12 plus that numbers over
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:12.000]  year old increased to record numbers the russians last month nato rejects russian call for afghan
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:17.600]  poppy spraying said no we're going to let it be grown this is nothing to do with the quote taliban
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:23.040]  we're there one of the main reasons is to get the hundreds of billions of dollars a year of opium
[03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:28.160]  laundered through us banks and of course i've been on air for eight years exposing this but this is
[03:36:28.160 --> 03:36:33.120]  mind control this is the normalization of pure evil because pat tell them was writing letters
[03:36:33.120 --> 03:36:37.600]  home saying they're growing opium we're protecting it this war is a fraud back when that was a secret
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:42.480]  they had to kill him now because they can't cover it up they just normalize it hide it in plain view
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:49.200]  yes we're helping them grow it we don't like it but we've got to defeat al qaeda now let your kid
[03:36:49.200 --> 03:36:54.000]  be caught with some heroin of course it wouldn't be here if there wasn't so much money in it and if
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:58.800]  our government wasn't growing it just like mexico our government is criminal and brings in most the
[03:36:58.800 --> 03:37:04.480]  drugs now i want to go to wane madson dc base investigative journalist author and syndicate
[03:37:04.480 --> 03:37:11.040]  of columnist he's appeared all over cnn fox cbs pbs he worked for the national security agency
[03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:18.800]  worked for a naval uh uh encryption i mean he worked for the uh the department of state
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:23.280]  the data automation command national security agency on and on and on he's here to break some
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:28.160]  major nine eleven truth news but he's also exposed government narcotics trafficking so let's cover
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:34.720]  that first wane madson and wane madson report dot com uh why i mean do you agree with me this is just
[03:37:34.720 --> 03:37:40.320]  the main lining of the double think of the mind control because they can't hide it anymore that
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:47.120]  okay we're growing it but we're doing it to fight al qaeda oh absolutely and it's not just uh now we
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:52.880]  have reports uh from the united nations that it's not just uh heroin and opium coming out of
[03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:59.120]  afghanistan but it's cannabis so they've uh actually uh found a new cash crop to deal in
[03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:06.000]  and you heard them the troops help grow it and so our our men and women are now farmers for the
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:13.760]  cia that's right and and the biggest problem is it where is this uh heroin uh going to it's it's
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:20.080]  getting across the border into tajica stand to the north and winding up on the old silk route
[03:38:20.080 --> 03:38:26.880]  the silk road it's going east into china and west into europe and uh of course uh the russian
[03:38:26.880 --> 03:38:31.760]  government the chinese government are well aware of the fact that uh this stuff is coming out of
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:37.360]  afghanistan and who's involved in this elicit trade you got carzai hami carzai's brother is one of
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:43.680]  the biggest drug warlords in afghanistan oh let me stop you again new york times just admits the
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:49.360]  whole thing right here u.s turns blind eye to opium and afghan they're not turning blind eye
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:54.720]  they're right there getting the goodies go ahead right and and the biggest fear of china is that
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:38:59.600]  uh they're looking at this as a as a as another opium war you know we already have reports coming
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:05.600]  out of yunnan province in china that uh young men are getting hooked on this stuff they know
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:10.640]  where it's coming out of uh and uh they're not good frankly they're not happy about it and the
[03:39:10.640 --> 03:39:16.880]  history of the opium wars with the british uh and china they they uh understand uh that that's
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:22.640]  what helped defeat the chinese uh before and they're worried that the west has similar designs now
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:31.120]  well that's important i mean this is a british model skull and bones that set up our cia on record
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:35.920]  was a british model to use a drug war to take over the us because they'd already done it
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:40.800]  a hundred years before in china with the opium war that's how they corrupted the police that's
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:47.280]  how they took over the society right and what and uh but we also know that the the route to the
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:52.800]  west to europe uh it goes through turkey and what we're seeing now with the present turkish
[03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:57.920]  government uncovering this deep state that existed has existed in turkey for a number of years that
[03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:04.560]  uh part and parcel of that deep state it's called the ergenicon network is is the uh trafficking
[03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:14.480]  in uh in uh opium and the opium's coming uh by a land from afghanistan continuum and uh so
[03:40:15.280 --> 03:40:19.360]  you know from from turkey where does it go it goes through the Balkans where our friends
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:24.320]  our friends with the kosovo liberation army have dealt with that for years you know that's
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:31.200]  madeline albright's good friends she set up the kla and once it hits kosovo boom France Germany
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:38.320]  scandinavia the netherlands italy uh that's where the money's made on the street now government
[03:40:38.320 --> 03:40:45.040]  drug dealing white slavery running kidnapping all of it takes us back full circle to 9 11
[03:40:45.040 --> 03:40:51.520]  civil edmunds fbi nsa translator she's now been able to finally break her gag order in court
[03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:59.200]  last year she told congress this behind the scenes they they put a gag order on her that she
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:04.080]  was listening to the taliban and al qaeda senior leadership including a sum of bin laden
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:10.880]  running slaves running drugs running weapons all over the middle east and central asia
[03:41:10.880 --> 03:41:19.760]  under direct command of the central intelligence agency even to the day of 9 11 she was hearing this
[03:41:20.320 --> 03:41:26.240]  on the day of 9 11 and then now the Turkish government has discovered that they have a
[03:41:26.240 --> 03:41:32.720]  military deep state just like we have a deep state uh system here and before we get into this new 9
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:36.720]  11 information you're dropping on folks and i've done the research everything you put this report
[03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:44.240]  ties into separate public info but it's devastating we now have confirmed army drill manuals where
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:49.840]  they're training to take on tea parties gun owners and returning veterans much worse than the mayak
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:54.000]  and homeland security report in there it's the biggest troop training we've ever seen this has
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:00.560]  been going on for decades this is a total training op to prepare for martial law well that's right
[03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:08.000]  and a lot of this goes back to the 1980s when we had rex 84 cobbled together by oliver north and
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:15.120]  his chums on basically uh just uh you know uh taking everybody into custody who didn't agree
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:21.040]  with the bragan administration and and putting them into uh facilities detention facilities
[03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:28.480]  this is this is an old uh an old uh plan uh come back uh to haunt this uh decades later
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:33.520]  again wane madson know so many times when i'm watching c span and watching a national security
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:38.400]  hearing you see him there in the background reporting you have amazing sources in dc the
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:43.680]  headline and wane madson report dot com it's also an online journal and info wars dot com
[03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:50.640]  the super classified network that served as command and control for 9 11 false flag attack
[03:42:50.640 --> 03:42:56.720]  break it down for our audience this incredible information okay what uh what i gathered uh
[03:42:56.720 --> 03:43:03.040]  was that there was a very highly classified system with limited number of people now
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:08.160]  you know it doesn't it didn't take a lot of people that uh you know being charged as command and
[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:13.840]  control operation because all it entailed that day was letting people know the uh
[03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:19.840]  certain people know this is not a training drill this is real time uh and do the
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:27.520]  the take the necessary actions to carry out uh the attacks the the system i first heard the
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:36.400]  the phonetic uh description of the system called pds pdas and i i i didn't find out what it stood
[03:43:36.400 --> 03:43:42.800]  for until a few days later and what i've gathered is that the system stands for planning a decision
[03:43:42.800 --> 03:43:48.800]  aid system there's only about 75 to 100 terminals throughout the u.s government
[03:43:48.800 --> 03:43:55.440]  uh maybe a couple hundred people have access to this they all have what's known as the top secret
[03:43:55.440 --> 03:44:01.520]  special compartment sensitive compartmented information clearances special access program
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:08.720]  clearances and uh this was the system i do know one message was transmitted from the
[03:44:08.720 --> 03:44:15.680]  chief of staff of the air force on the morning of 9 11 uh two other terminals the pds terminals
[03:44:15.680 --> 03:44:23.360]  that basically stated uh the air force has successfully intercepted the target over pennsylvania
[03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:29.760]  now whether that was flight 93 i don't know but that certainly uh corresponds with um
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:36.880]  similar stories about uh what happened uh with the target that was moving in on the on
[03:44:36.880 --> 03:44:42.720]  washington dc uh where the cheney is sitting there with menetta menetta says the cheney
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:48.400]  uh the young enlisted man came in and said does the order still stand and cheney responded of
[03:44:48.400 --> 03:44:52.880]  course the order still stands have you heard anything the contrary uh it's quite apparent
[03:44:52.880 --> 03:44:58.720]  that it was pds which is operated under the secretary of defense this was the system that
[03:44:58.720 --> 03:45:05.440]  was used to provide the alternate the alternate command and control system on 9 11 and and again
[03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:11.120]  this corresponds with another system called the critic comm system run by the n f a where a similar
[03:45:11.120 --> 03:45:17.360]  message came over that morning and is that why even anderson cooper and cnn and cbs confirmed
[03:45:17.360 --> 03:45:25.120]  doomsday planes from before the attack and after we're all videotaped at about 50 000 feet circling
[03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:32.480]  because it's this it's this doomsday uh c o g uh deep state emergency dictatorship system that
[03:45:32.480 --> 03:45:37.840]  they were using to run the attack yes well the national emergency airborne command post that
[03:45:37.840 --> 03:45:43.040]  you call the doomsday plane where the joint chiefs of staff goes in the event of a nuclear war
[03:45:43.600 --> 03:45:49.760]  it does have a pds terminal on board that aircraft so obviously it was very much instrumental in this
[03:45:49.760 --> 03:45:56.800]  whole operation and uh there was another another intelligence system run by the n f a called critic
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:46:03.680]  comm which again a similar message came across that same morning that stated the the air force
[03:46:03.680 --> 03:46:10.480]  has successfully uh intercepted the uh the target over pennsylvania so we have two very highly
[03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:15.120]  classified intelligence systems that morning talking about the interception of the target over
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:21.280]  pennsylvania so the whole thing about the cell phone calls uh the you know the the the the
[03:46:21.280 --> 03:46:29.360]  passengers storming the cockpit all obviously uh a a major a major psi operus to uh let the
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:34.960]  try to convince people that uh you know some guys that let's let's roll well former blackout commander
[03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:39.520]  colonel don de grand prix when he was dying on the verge of heart failure came on our show and
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:44.080]  then died a few weeks later and and and said look i've talked to all the pentagon boys and this was
[03:46:44.080 --> 03:46:51.040]  right after 9 11 and he said the pentagon a separate general uh base in virginia but it was
[03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:57.920]  the squadron out of north dakota the happy hugh uh huligans they put two aim nines into that aircraft
[03:46:57.920 --> 03:47:04.240]  and that they buck the order and we know this is declassified we have the document uh two and a
[03:47:04.240 --> 03:47:10.080]  half months before 9 11 chaney took the norad shootdown power that generals always had as a
[03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:15.120]  default they didn't need to have a president or vice president tell them and took that power only
[03:47:15.120 --> 03:47:21.120]  unto himself they put a whole new command structure in uh in the week before the 9 11 so they'd be
[03:47:21.120 --> 03:47:26.480]  confused and not know what was going on and then right after 9 11 chaney gave the shootdown power
[03:47:26.480 --> 03:47:33.600]  back to uh norad well and i also think it's significant that this pdas message that was sent
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:40.000]  by the air force chief of staff was sent by general john jumper who had only assumed command of the
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:47.600]  air force on september 6 2001 so five days before we have a new air force chief of staff and i think
[03:47:47.600 --> 03:47:55.440]  what this is telling me is that it seems like it's the air force because we know that in 2007
[03:47:55.440 --> 03:48:02.320]  again it was the chaney's all in a chain of command moved these uh nuclear tip cruise missiles out of
[03:48:02.320 --> 03:48:07.280]  mine on air force base to barstail air force base they said it was a big mistake but again here we
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:13.440]  have the air force the air force seems to come up time and time again and uh we have people in the
[03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:18.720]  air force i think who really represent uh the alternate chain of command as we saw it under
[03:48:18.720 --> 03:48:24.560]  the bush administration and of course 9 11 was an aerial attack so which service would they have
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:31.120]  uh have had to co-op it was in the u.s air force and who are experts in drone attacks and remote
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:35.520]  control uh look you don't like to speculate but from your years of deep research and working at
[03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:42.160]  the nsa and and and and literally living a cloak and dagger lifestyle in dc as best you can tell
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:48.800]  i mean clearly it's chaney running the attack but but how did this work that day well i apparently
[03:48:48.800 --> 03:48:55.120]  what happened was uh we remember there was this huge uh this huge amount of confusion about some
[03:48:55.120 --> 03:48:59.760]  drills that were being run nor had was running drills there were other drills being run and
[03:48:59.760 --> 03:49:05.360]  there was a lot of confusion among the uh the people at the radar scopes at the computer
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:09.520]  terminals and they said they were watching television they said wait a minute is this
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:14.400]  is this drill or is this real time and i think the purpose of this alternate command and control
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:22.560]  system was to confuse the situation uh uh it it it you know when you have people that didn't know
[03:49:22.560 --> 03:49:28.000]  whether what they were watching on t was part of a drill or not i think it was very successful
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:33.120]  so the knowledge of what was really happening only had to be amongst the very few people because
[03:49:33.120 --> 03:49:38.880]  even even the people who might have been on the p-day as terminals and getting this information
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:42.960]  wouldn't have had the big picture only a certain a certain number of people would have had the big
[03:49:42.960 --> 03:49:48.080]  picture and would have known what was going on that morning and of course there was a separate
[03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:53.600]  cia drill of the pentagon being attacked being run separately that way if they got caught by other
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:58.960]  branches of the government or other compartments they'd say oh it's just a drill absolutely absolutely
[03:49:58.960 --> 03:50:04.160]  so so you had that built in factor of confusion you had a certain number of people a very limited
[03:50:04.160 --> 03:50:09.600]  number of people who knew exactly what was going on and therefore that's how this multi trillion
[03:50:09.600 --> 03:50:15.600]  dollar uh command control communications and intelligence system that we had to you know
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:22.400]  ostensibly uh fight the soviet union uh during that uh warrior it collapsed in a matter of hours
[03:50:22.400 --> 03:50:28.000]  through on the morning of 9 11 and we know within 10 minutes as the associated press reported
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:33.360]  rumsfeld began broadcasting across the pentagon iraq did this because he knew it was important
[03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:38.320]  to get that first story out iraq because because they were already gearing up to go into iraq let's

[03:54:19.120 --> 03:54:24.000]  the afghans grow the opium and it's come out the contractors are shipping the heroin out i mean
[03:54:24.560 --> 03:54:27.520]  and i mean if they can get on the news and admit they're growing the opium
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:33.600]  but say it's to fight al-qaeda that they can take your pension funds everything else and they are
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:37.600]  going to they're announcing it wane madson we were talking during the break and i said what's most
[03:54:37.600 --> 03:54:41.840]  important the last few minutes to talk about and you said well they're trying to persecute journalists
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:47.440]  now especially uh... journalists that are getting nsa leaks about illegal spying because if they can
[03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:53.360]  pick off top journalist they can get anybody and i uh... and you talk about cast sunstein uh... talk
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:59.360]  more about that well i think what we see with this administration is uh... uh... it's in some
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:04.240]  ways it's worse than a bush administration when it comes to violation of first amendment rights
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:10.240]  we've uh... now know today that uh... that on monday uh... jim reisen of the new york times
[03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:17.040]  would serve the subpoena to go before grand jury uh... and and and and reveal who his sources were
[03:55:17.040 --> 03:55:22.320]  now he say this is about chapter nine in the book he wrote uh... which has to do with uh... the cia
[03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:28.480]  but uh... he also broke the story uh... helps to break the story on the warrantless wiretapping
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:36.000]  program at nsa and i do know that the indictment of tom drake the ex uh... a senior official nsa
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:42.560]  uh... a few weeks ago is part of a uh... justice department nsa uh... program to
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:47.600]  haul journalists before grand jury to get them to reveal who their sources are
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:53.360]  now even push that even think about going this well how could an nsa official who's obviously
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:57.920]  trying to be patriotic so he releases illegal activity because he didn't want to go to jail
[03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:03.840]  how does he get indicted and thrown in prison for doing for exposing illegal activity well
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:08.400]  i think you know it wasn't only that apparently there's been a lot of contract multi-billion
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:13.600]  dollar contract brought in nsa now because this gets into ketan cases i think what the
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:19.360]  government did with tom drake was it was preemptive let's invite him before he can bring a ketan case
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:24.320]  showing that the government uh... michael hayden when he was direct director nsa
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:30.160]  the present director general alexander Keith alexander both engaged in multi-billion dollar
[03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:35.040]  contract brought the line of pockets of their favorite contractors and they're all the usual
[03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:41.680]  suspects the f a i c the booze allen computer science corporation and arrest uh... and uh...
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:48.320]  this is this is hardball now the hardball is being played nixon style uh... i mean i i say this
[03:56:48.320 --> 03:56:54.160]  about obama he's not a moron like george bush but he's every bit of a liar is richard nixon
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:57:00.320]  and uh... i think we're seeing uh... more uh... barack millhouse obama here than uh... than anything
[03:57:00.320 --> 03:57:02.080]  else
[03:57:02.080 --> 03:57:08.640]  yeah i mean people thought bush was bad old bombing the clearly it's continuing
[03:57:09.840 --> 03:57:14.720]  clearly it's all coming to a head right now what about the tea parties these army documents
[03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:19.120]  we're getting where they are training to just mow tea parties down and take them to fema camps
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:24.720]  well you know i i look at the people i think a lot of anger i i see a lot of built-in energy
[03:57:24.720 --> 03:57:30.000]  and frustration unfortunately i was here uh... when dick army uh... was at the press club
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:35.840]  and he's ostensibly is like uh... marshaling the the tea party movement i think the tea party has
[03:57:35.840 --> 03:57:40.800]  to be very careful about being used to do by the republican party all that anger all that
[03:57:40.800 --> 03:57:47.200]  frustration i think should be channeled away from the republican party and and and to the
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:51.600]  the uh... mass protest sure but if they can't co-opt it i mean they're training the army that
[03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:57.120]  it's the enemy that's outrageous absolutely and we've seen this we've seen this happen before
[03:57:57.120 --> 03:58:03.040]  uh... we saw it happen in the eighties uh... when people you know uh... were opposed to u.s.
[03:58:03.040 --> 03:58:09.680]  intervention in central america we had uh... anti-intervention groups being uh... infiltrated
[03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:15.840]  by the by the uh... cia fb i and others and we're seeing a replay of that man but it's on
[03:58:15.840 --> 03:58:21.920]  such a huge scale i mean the government is just so rotten and evil and now announcing it's going to
[03:58:21.920 --> 03:58:26.800]  take your pension funds but that's the patriotic thing to do here goldman sacks here's all my money
