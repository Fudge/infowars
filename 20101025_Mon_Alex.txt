[00:31.600 --> 00:40.920]  welcome my friends welcome it is the 25th day of October 2010 we're gonna be
[00:40.920 --> 00:47.840]  live here for the next three hours and I am here in the studios of KSCO and KOMY
[00:47.840 --> 00:51.880]  and beautiful Santa Cruz and I've driven through here before but I know why
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.320]  Clint Eastwood and others like to live in this area I tell you this is as
[00:55.320 --> 01:01.080]  beautiful as Hawaii or something I just absolutely wonderful place to be and we
[01:01.080 --> 01:08.360]  had an amazing event last night where well they sold 750 tickets and they
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.360]  allowed them to have 50 more people come in it was totally jam-packed and to be
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.600]  with all these wonderful patriots who love liberty it was extremely extremely
[01:16.600 --> 01:23.040]  uplifting and we're have another event tonight at the coconut grove as well
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.920]  right here on the boardwalk on the side of the Pacific Ocean obviously we've
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.680]  got a lot of news and information to cover we're gonna do part two of a live
[01:31.680 --> 01:35.800]  interview with password Lindsay Williams with his inside source and the
[01:35.800 --> 01:39.600]  bombshell information that they laid on him but we'll just have Lindsay recap it
[01:39.600 --> 01:45.600]  in a segment or two and I promise we will open the phone lines up so that you
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.920]  can ask questions of Lindsay Williams coming up in the second hour today we
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.400]  also open phones in the third hour I also wanted to invite Michael Olson the
[01:58.400 --> 02:07.480]  general manager of ksco and ko my of course ksco is 18 is a 1080 am yeah I
[02:07.480 --> 02:12.800]  wish that the amdahl went to 1880 I didn't get much sleep last night ladies
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.520]  and gentlemen I was screaming for four hours so am 1080 and of course the am
[02:18.520 --> 02:24.160]  1340 is ko my and he was in here talking about the carbon taxes they're trying to
[02:24.160 --> 02:29.000]  put in over California and I had that the top of my stack so I heard him right
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.880]  before I went on air doing a news report in here talking about how they're
[02:33.880 --> 02:39.520]  about to put in a what is it 20% carbon tax on everything and how that will
[02:39.520 --> 02:42.560]  devastate the economy and I happen to have the 60 minutes report in front of
[02:42.560 --> 02:46.760]  me from prisonplanet.com we have it posted it's also up on info wars.com
[02:46.760 --> 02:54.520]  60 minutes shock report real unemployment rates 17.5% nationwide California 22%
[02:54.520 --> 03:01.040]  try California 29% the United States 2.6 2.7 according to all the top
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.920]  economists we interview and major firms that are mainstream news that have been
[03:06.920 --> 03:12.200]  analyzing this we've been above 20% for at least two years nationwide so 60
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.000]  minutes is ooh big shocker breaking this huge news but can you imagine what's
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.400]  going to happen once they enforce these carbon taxes now they're trying to do it
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.240]  at the state level because they can't get the Congress to pass it and the EPA is
[03:25.240 --> 03:29.240]  coming through and we're ramming it through extra judicially and extra
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.000]  legislatively through the EPA but they're also doing it at the state level
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.200]  and California is the model for states to do this under agenda 21 this UN
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.720]  takeover plan of neo feudalistic serfdom but then if you also look at what
[03:42.720 --> 03:49.200]  Schwarzenegger talked about back when he was at the Copenhagen summit that we
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.640]  of course exposed and showed for the fraud it was with the with the climate
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.160]  gate emails and documents he said I'm going to go back now to the cities and
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.240]  the states and we're going to do it whether you like it or not just as my
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.320]  friends in Iran we do what we like so we're going to be discussing that with
[04:10.320 --> 04:18.040]  Michael Olson the general manager from on the ground here in California because
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.400]  as California goes so goes the rest of the nation and they definitely have been
[04:22.400 --> 04:25.200]  taken over by the globalists here a hundred percent but the people of
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.360]  California are waking up to what's happening and speaking out against all
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.960]  of this so we'll be talking about all that after the quick break that's coming
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.680]  up in a ton of other economic military police state news you name it it is all
[04:37.680 --> 04:45.040]  coming up on the other side Alex Jones here with you live from California Santa
[04:45.040 --> 04:50.840]  Cruz in full wars dot com prison planet dot com stay with us
[04:50.840 --> 05:03.560]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.080]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:12.080 --> 05:16.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[05:20.400 --> 05:24.280]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.280 --> 05:28.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.760]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.480]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.680]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.680 --> 05:44.040]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[07:12.680 --> 07:18.240]  Americans at home turn in this influence on our president in Congress and they
[07:18.240 --> 07:22.440]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[07:22.440 --> 07:27.600]  American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[07:27.600 --> 07:32.680]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and

[08:02.960 --> 08:10.440]  proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.800]  it is the 25th day of October
[08:20.960 --> 08:28.000]  2010 on this Monday edition and coming up on about 25 minutes from now Michael
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.360]  Olson general manager of KSC OAM 1080 here in Santa Cruz and of course also the
[08:34.360 --> 08:40.920]  general manager of KO and why we're on both stations about 1080 and 1340 two
[08:40.920 --> 08:44.200]  great affiliates out here and I just want to spend a few minutes talking
[08:44.200 --> 08:47.280]  about what happened last night how amazing it was and I'm gonna get into
[08:47.280 --> 08:58.520]  all the news but I spoke from about 620 until 10 and we had Dr. Stan Montief an
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.120]  icon in the Liberty Movement there then Sheriff Richard Mack who just so happened
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.600]  to be in the area popped in spoke for about 20 minutes we also had Joe Banister
[09:09.600 --> 09:13.720]  the former arm treasury agent who found out that the IRS was basically a mafia
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.200]  collection agency and went public with that he spoke in fact I think I'm gonna
[09:18.200 --> 09:22.120]  have a back tonight to pop in because you know I got four hours to speak and I
[09:22.120 --> 09:28.160]  was surprised how I probably spoke for three hours of the overall four hours or
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.720]  close to four hours and folks didn't get too bored with it they were in fact at
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.360]  10 o'clock you know the venue we had said they you know that's when it's over
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.240]  you've got to open the doors up and people got to go and people like please
[09:42.240 --> 09:46.320]  don't go you know we've got more questions than one guy said don't be like
[09:46.320 --> 09:50.360]  the government and I'm like well okay I guess we can have a rebellion in here
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.660]  and go no we're not leaving you know but clearly folks do want to do a big
[09:54.660 --> 09:58.840]  question and answer so I'll probably just have Mack and Montief he wants to
[09:58.840 --> 10:02.720]  speak again talk for about 10 minutes and banister tonight and then I'll speak
[10:02.720 --> 10:06.880]  for two hours or an hour and a half like I'll ask the crowd and then we can do an
[10:06.880 --> 10:09.760]  hour and a half of questions if they want quite frankly that's what I liked it
[10:09.760 --> 10:12.600]  was taking me all these different directions but Aaron Dykes was there
[10:12.600 --> 10:17.280]  great writer for info wars comm and webmaster and camera guy and he's seen
[10:17.280 --> 10:22.280]  most of my live speeches and he thought this was the best the problem is my
[10:22.280 --> 10:28.520]  voice is pretty blown because I get riled up and of the almost three hours I
[10:28.520 --> 10:31.720]  spoke off and on I probably was screaming about a third of the time so
[10:31.720 --> 10:39.000]  we'll we'll see what we'll see what happens happens with that but we're gonna
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.840]  have a couple folks from the stations here with us and hopefully when the
[10:44.840 --> 10:50.160]  owner of the station a station Michael's whirling gets in because we were out at
[10:50.160 --> 10:53.280]  dinner until about two in the morning last night hopefully when he gets in I'll
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.200]  drag him in during the third hour what a character this guy is this station was
[10:58.200 --> 11:06.800]  built back in the 1940s what year was it 1947 and it's an RCA model station and
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.640]  it's in all the major trade publications even the days whirling was showing me
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.800]  just giant stacks of magazines and news articles your current ones this is the
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.480]  only station in the country that was built specifically with the whole
[11:21.480 --> 11:27.880]  building to be a radio station according to all those specs and it's an
[11:27.880 --> 11:32.120]  amazing place I mean it's like I've stepped into the 1940s and it turns out
[11:32.120 --> 11:38.040]  that Michael when he was in high school did news and stuff here and then he made
[11:38.040 --> 11:42.400]  a flatulence noise on the air once joking and they fired him they said you
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.880]  do not make those noises on K SEO and then years later he bought the station
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.080]  and now well now he he isn't a 16 years old he isn't gonna make one of those
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.000]  noises but hey maybe I can make it and then get thrown off the circle is now
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.600]  complete but what what an interesting person and all the great people out
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.000]  here in California this area California I mean I'll be quite honest I don't like
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.160]  Southern California very much kind of like I don't like Houston I mean Houston's
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.600]  a great town a lot of family down there but it's it's just I don't know it's
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.200]  like I get a bad vibe I mean I grew up in Dallas now I go back to Dallas I'm
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.480]  like I don't there's just a bad vibe but when you get into Central California and
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.160]  all the way up north it's just like Wonderland or something I expect to hear
[12:33.160 --> 12:42.440]  elves singing hi ho hi ho hi ho hi ho it's off to work we go la la la la la la
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.920]  and I expect to see snow white come running out you know any minute here and
[12:47.920 --> 12:51.680]  I tell you if I didn't love Texas so much and love Austin which is a great
[12:51.680 --> 12:54.720]  town and has a lot of beautiful things and this is the kind of place I'd live
[12:54.720 --> 12:57.720]  and I know what Clint Eastwood and all these other people want to live in this
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.840]  area because it has got to be one of the prettiest places I've ever been I mean I
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.160]  think this rivals places like Hawaii I mean it's just it's just so gorgeous I
[13:05.160 --> 13:10.520]  mean even when it was raining the last two days here a lot of stuff happened you
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.000]  know I told folks that I was also in California on a secret mission so we
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.560]  killed two birds with one stone the station owner was at us on for a year
[13:18.560 --> 13:21.640]  and a half was really been asking to come out and speak I said okay I'm already
[13:21.640 --> 13:25.960]  out there to do something with a television crew and you know when they
[13:25.960 --> 13:29.000]  do these TV shows it's not conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura I'm a
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.160]  consultant on that and I think I want them in five of the eight episodes that
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.600]  are airing it's not that it's it's it's history channel and they really don't
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.600]  want me to talk about it because it spoils the show but I did you know in
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.040]  the agreement I signed with them and have a little proviso in there that well
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.640]  if anybody you know I mean obviously I'll have to talk about this is if while
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.640]  we're here doing this it ends up in the news and I haven't searched the term yet
[13:57.640 --> 14:00.280]  to find out if it is in the news but if it is already in the news then I'm gonna
[14:00.280 --> 14:03.520]  talk about it but if it's not in the news I'm not gonna talk about it and you
[14:03.520 --> 14:06.280]  can just wait till it's on television but I'm gonna tell you the name of the
[14:06.280 --> 14:11.920]  TV show on on the history channel but it was insane and I'm just lucky to be here
[14:11.920 --> 14:17.400]  right now I'm gonna and they're great folks too very daring and just tell you
[14:17.400 --> 14:24.560]  right now I'm lucky to be here so that was wild and it's really hard to not
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.520]  talk about stuff it's it's it's very frustrating oh man but it's just good
[14:30.520 --> 14:35.200]  to be it's good to be back on the radio and I'll tell you what's really good we
[14:35.200 --> 14:41.880]  simulcast my entire radio show at prisonplanet.tv and the viewers love
[14:41.880 --> 14:45.000]  it the listeners love it it gets archived it goes up it gets grabbed and put
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.360]  all over the web and you know just the last year and a half or so just on our
[14:49.360 --> 14:57.760]  channel 70 million views just on YouTube of the show but it it is so much
[14:57.760 --> 15:04.400]  more intimate and relaxing and I think better when I'm not have you know with
[15:04.400 --> 15:10.440]  lights and cameras on me and I just this is what I like about radio and but
[15:10.440 --> 15:14.200]  prisonplanet.tv gets the word out and it funds our operation but I'm telling
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.240]  you I'm tempted to smash those cameras I want to take a ball peen hammer to those
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.320]  things man used to I could sit there while a guest was talking and eat a
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.280]  breakfast taco or something now now even when I go home for dinner I eat my
[15:27.280 --> 15:30.400]  food in three minutes because I got three minute breaks I've like been
[15:30.400 --> 15:35.760]  turned into this animal who can't even enjoy food anymore because I'm on the
[15:35.760 --> 15:38.960]  air three four five hours sometimes we do you know six seven eight hours I did
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.720]  26 hours just the last week or week and a half ago in a marathon broadcast and
[15:43.720 --> 15:50.120]  my fill-in host Paul Watson came in for the last hour but I am I am definitely
[15:50.120 --> 15:57.500]  babbling here it's almost like morning radio but looking at all this news we're
[15:57.500 --> 16:01.560]  gonna be getting into it today and we do have Lindsay Williams in part two of the
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.480]  interview we did last week he'll be with us live and we're gonna mainly take your
[16:05.480 --> 16:10.200]  phone calls for Lindsay Williams we'll have him recap what is inside former
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.560]  big three oil executive told him was gonna happen with the economy and most
[16:13.560 --> 16:19.440]  of what this executive has told him you know has turned out to come true
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.960]  whenever the executive has conjectured you know some of it has not come true
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.800]  but certainly Lindsay Williams and oil was $50 a barrel shed in the next three
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.560]  four months it's going up to 150 people said this guy's nuts and you know no
[16:33.560 --> 16:37.840]  way this is gonna happen and it happened and he's made a bunch of other big
[16:37.840 --> 16:40.760]  calls through this through this source and I know who the source is I
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.200]  understand my TV those are the sources as well so so I know Lindsay Williams is
[16:44.200 --> 16:47.640]  for real on that subject and we appreciate him joining us but but but
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.160]  we'll be able to get your feedback specifically for Lindsay Williams though
[16:52.160 --> 16:55.800]  we don't really screen your calls except when we have a guest on about a
[16:55.800 --> 16:59.920]  specific topic and I want to warn you now when we do take calls for Lindsay
[16:59.920 --> 17:05.440]  Williams if you call up and start asking me about space stations or Bigfoot or
[17:05.440 --> 17:10.680]  or the weather or the stock market if it doesn't pertain to what you know Lindsay
[17:10.680 --> 17:14.680]  specifically I'm gonna have to let you go because because you know he's gonna
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.560]  be on with us to specifically talk about those subjects and we've just got him
[17:18.560 --> 17:21.200]  for an hour maybe I'll keep a little bit longer but I want to get Michael's
[17:21.200 --> 17:27.960]  whirling the owner of these two fine radio stations AM 1080 K SEO and AM 1340
[17:27.960 --> 17:37.680]  K O M Y right here in a beautiful Santa Cruz, California which which I think if
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.960]  I ever move out of Austin Texas this is the kind of place I've moved right here
[17:40.960 --> 17:45.920]  I tell you this is just absolutely awesome now we're gonna go to break here
[17:45.920 --> 17:50.640]  in just a few minutes and I talk about this happening a lot I mean I look at
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.080]  the news this morning and I don't even want to cover this but knowing as GI Joe
[17:55.080 --> 17:59.040]  says his half the battle and that is a solution you know part of the solution
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.360]  is facing up to our problems facing up to who is engineering these problems by
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.000]  design I mean mankind doesn't need any help getting ourselves in trouble but
[18:07.000 --> 18:11.520]  when you've got these agents of chaos these globalist constantly you know
[18:11.520 --> 18:15.160]  trying to screw up the economy to consolidate control when you've got
[18:15.160 --> 18:19.560]  corruption just running rampant it's time for people to stop being so naive and
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.120]  really get conscious about what's happening and here's CNBC dollar at
[18:24.120 --> 18:29.400]  risk of becoming toxic waste and just being completely worthless like the
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.520]  Weimar Republic Deutsche Mark or the currency they use in Zimbabwe and it
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.840]  just goes over the fact that they are hyper inflating it right now but the
[18:39.840 --> 18:43.880]  banks are mainly hoarding it and only using it bank to bank which is bad
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.120]  enough because they're robbing us and by by deflating our currency devaluing it
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.800]  and we've got to pay this back in taxes I mean if they're going to devalue the
[18:52.800 --> 18:56.040]  currency might as well give it to us and let us have a little bit of value in it
[18:56.040 --> 19:00.360]  but no that's not happening so it's the worst of worst of both worlds we've
[19:00.360 --> 19:06.840]  also got Treasury Shields City Group as deletions undercut disclosure we'll tell
[19:06.840 --> 19:11.520]  you what that means from Bloomberg just more corruption we've got the New York
[19:11.520 --> 19:15.280]  Times headline falling into the chasm remember a couple years ago I was
[19:15.280 --> 19:19.280]  telling you we were already in the chasm I even use terms like that we're falling
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.440]  you know off the cliff right now people said oh you're fair mongering that's a ridiculous look
[19:23.440 --> 19:26.160]  when banks are stealing tens of trillions of dollars right in front of you
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.160]  and won't tell Congress where it where it is you've got a problem okay and it's
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.720]  time to stop living in denial we've got Obama ramping up CIA infiltration of
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.520]  Pakistan trying to destabilize that region we had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony
[19:38.520 --> 19:43.400]  Schaefer on agreeing with that last week we've got the head of Google saying
[19:43.400 --> 19:46.920]  you don't like Google Street View move we can't move anywhere with this clown
[19:46.920 --> 19:51.840]  yeah Google don't be evil how about be evil the devil comes as an angel of

[24:31.680 --> 24:37.160]  listen to me he's talking about Elvis like he's some kind of hippie before the
[24:37.160 --> 24:46.160]  Beatles and yesterday I'll take Elvis any day over Al Gore can you imagine what
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.640]  Merle Haggard sees as a problem now it's a great song and he sure sings it
[24:51.640 --> 24:58.760]  better than I did at midnight during that 27-hour transmission we did a few
[24:58.760 --> 25:13.560]  weeks ago stop rolling down hill well there's certainly no doubt that that is
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.840]  happening and it's engineered and we could stop it
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.120]  no the national symbol is not the flag on a liberty belt it's an ostrich with
[25:25.120 --> 25:28.880]  its head in the sand and a naked body scanner we should we could make a new
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.880]  crest like a royal crest the United States and it could be a surveillance
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.160]  camera in one corner a naked body scanner in the other a ostrich with its
[25:37.160 --> 25:43.960]  head in the sand and a cop beaten an old lady with a billy club and shooting her
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.520]  with a taser and and then a bunch of needles a bunch of injectors and then a
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.560]  couple cancer viruses because you know those family crests that can have a lot
[25:53.560 --> 25:57.400]  of stuff on it you just can't have one symbol and they could just be a whole
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.320]  bunch of stuff and then they pull back from the crest and it's it's a crest
[26:02.320 --> 26:08.360]  on it on a night shield that it's portly Al Gore with big big handfuls of cash
[26:08.360 --> 26:14.800]  and everybody's property how's that sound I got Bill Graff here with me and
[26:14.800 --> 26:18.440]  he's a he's the engineer around here and he ended he's riding shotgun with me
[26:18.440 --> 26:22.080]  we've got the general manager Michael Olson coming in here after the break
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.360]  and we'll go over all this news but you know maybe I am an extremist maybe me
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.520]  and maybe Merle Haggard's wrong too I mean maybe we're going uphill like a
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.160]  snowball headed for heaven maybe the devaluation of the dollar is a good
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.960]  thing maybe you know having our carbon taxes cut I mean I mean increase is a
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.320]  good thing what do you what do you think there Bill I think you're right I but
[26:46.320 --> 26:51.920]  then again you know I'm not a study of world politics like you are you know
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.320]  but but it seems to me either figure you and Michael were quoting earlier in the
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.360]  local morning show here about California's real unemployment rate being
[27:02.360 --> 27:07.880]  closer to 20 something percent mm-hmm that's scary when you see that many
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.080]  people out of work that that's that's a quarter of the population well that's
[27:11.080 --> 27:17.040]  a depressionary level yeah that's high really high and that's you know when you
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.600]  live in a place as nice as California but you see that unemployment rate you
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.920]  wonder if there's we have an engine of liberty and in manufacturing if they
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.880]  would just leave people alone it'd be a land of milk and honey again but they
[27:29.880 --> 27:33.720]  want to over tax to destroy the economy yeah and the thing about it is we when
[27:33.720 --> 27:38.800]  you see that kind of unemployment rate in a state where supposedly you know we're
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.520]  out we're broke at the state level I mean it's legendary if you everybody
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.680]  hears about California's budget woes in the news and you know the last budget
[27:46.680 --> 27:52.080]  they passed was a record it was it was so late when they passed it that it
[27:52.080 --> 27:58.840]  became a record and when you see that it and you you couple that with
[27:58.840 --> 28:04.560]  unemployment that high it's it's really scary but the government that does a
[28:04.560 --> 28:09.680]  good job for you well have you watched any of the campaign ads on who's was
[28:09.680 --> 28:13.840]  gonna replace them was you know basically one of two people yeah a little
[28:13.840 --> 28:21.960]  scary a little scary well as bad as this 60 minutes news is where they
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.400]  basically admit that the Sun comes up in the morning 17.5 nationally
[28:28.400 --> 28:36.160]  California 22% but all the economists we have on the average nationally is 22
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.960]  and some change and it's they say close to 30 or even higher in places like
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.400]  California and Michigan I mean you can even just search the term half of
[28:47.400 --> 28:55.320]  Detroit on welfare wow half the population of Detroit and I mean how
[28:55.320 --> 28:59.000]  how are we gonna compete when they're when they're bringing these carbon taxes
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.960]  into California and then right across the ocean from here China and South
[29:03.960 --> 29:08.200]  Korea and all those countries there they're not gonna put any carbon taxes
[29:08.200 --> 29:12.960]  on so the little bit of manufacturing California's got left where is it gonna
[29:12.960 --> 29:19.080]  go if there's another you know huge tax and I've seen different numbers like we
[29:19.080 --> 29:24.400]  will only phase it in at 10% the first year and by five years 20% I mean what
[29:24.400 --> 29:28.960]  is it what's the overall a carbon tax here in California they're trying to
[29:28.960 --> 29:32.760]  implement I'm not sure what the what the percentage is Michael will be able to
[29:32.760 --> 29:36.160]  tell you that yeah he's the expert Michael Olson general manager also does
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.680]  news here and he was covering this on the show before the local show with
[29:40.680 --> 29:45.880]  Rosie so I wanted to get him in studio with us and he'll be here with us next
[29:45.880 --> 29:50.080]  we'll talk about the unemployment numbers in the economy

[30:09.560 --> 30:13.840]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[30:13.840 --> 30:17.560]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the

[33:26.160 --> 33:31.840]  the surrounding area and then at night they rear me on ksco 1080 both just
[33:31.840 --> 33:37.080]  wonderful stations great affiliates and a very successful event this is some of
[33:37.080 --> 33:40.560]  the news coming up then I'm gonna talk to both these gentlemen who are riding
[33:40.560 --> 33:44.960]  shotgun with me here today a lot of interesting news Kurt Nemo's got a story
[33:44.960 --> 33:52.880]  out think soros leaked rhino neocon takeover document and people like what
[33:52.880 --> 33:57.000]  does that mean one faction of the globalist tools adding another faction
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.800]  of globalist tools that's how we play politics in America today think progress
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.440]  which should be called think soros because it is funded by George Soros has
[34:06.440 --> 34:11.680]  released a private correspondence sent by Charles Koch of Koch Industries the
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.480]  memo has the itinerary of private meeting to be held at the executive
[34:15.480 --> 34:20.800]  hotel in Aspen attached in the memo Koch says his group of neocons and rhinos
[34:20.800 --> 34:25.120]  plan to change the balance of power in Congress this November in other words
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.920]  give back power to the Republican dominated set of globalist and status
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.240]  who hope to come out winners in the perpetual game of musical chairs as the
[34:34.240 --> 34:39.640]  corrupt government continues its slow-motion titanic route to the bottom
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.680]  and see that's the issue here there's a major political realignment you've got a
[34:44.680 --> 34:49.320]  lot of really great Republican and and libertarian type candidates like Ron
[34:49.320 --> 34:55.400]  Ron Paul's son Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharon England perfect but you notice
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.880]  he's being demonized and a lot of other people if they're being demonized and if
[34:59.880 --> 35:03.240]  you see the Republicans running people against him in the primaries like they
[35:03.240 --> 35:07.720]  did against Rand Paul and many others you know they're good and so it's a battle
[35:07.720 --> 35:11.720]  between the establishment neocon Republicans who've helped you'll sell
[35:11.720 --> 35:14.920]  us down the river who were teamed up with the Democrats now they fight over
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.720]  the levers of power but still they're part of the overall same team you know
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.040]  it's basically them against us the general population so we're gonna be
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.360]  talking about that also a cyber warfare US seeks to shut down enemy power grids
[35:28.360 --> 35:31.840]  but it's our own government in Israel that basically admitted that they teamed
[35:31.840 --> 35:35.920]  up to create the Stuxnet worm and then launch it against Iran and now they're
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.240]  saying we've got to give up all of our internet freedom here because of the worm
[35:40.240 --> 35:44.800]  but then it's hidden in plain view that Western governments released this thing
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.040]  Israel the United States and collusion together creating it's just amazing and
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.520]  of course we've been talking about this 60 minutes shock report to reveal
[35:52.520 --> 35:59.160]  unemployment rate at 17.5% nationally California at 22% and that's a big
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.320]  admission by the mainstream media and more and more we're hearing them yeah
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.360]  unemployment's more like 15 oh it's more like 17 oh it's more like 20 when we
[36:07.360 --> 36:13.840]  know it's been over 22% for the last two years nationwide also the French are
[36:13.840 --> 36:19.040]  continuing now into their second week it's been more than what 11 12 days now a
[36:19.040 --> 36:25.800]  fresh blockades as a quarter of France's petrol stations stand dry and a
[36:25.800 --> 36:29.800]  time magazine and others are saying is revolution coming to the United States
[36:29.800 --> 36:33.640]  now that is just some of what's coming up and in dovetailing with that CNBC
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.920]  dollar at risk of becoming toxic waste the charts show that's exactly what
[36:38.920 --> 36:42.400]  Lindsey Williams source was talking about just last week he'll be joining us
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.980]  at eight after coming up in the next hour but right now Michael Olson the
[36:47.980 --> 36:55.640]  general manager here at this fine station KSCO AM 1080 and KOMY AM 1340 is
[36:55.640 --> 37:00.520]  here with us and of course we also have the engineer Bill graph run in the show
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.000]  so so I'm here with the great folks that make these two fine stations possible
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.320]  and I drug the general manager in here because I heard him eloquently covering
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.480]  what's happening here in California and I was correct they phase it in the first
[37:15.480 --> 37:21.800]  year at 5% and then by two years later it's above 10% they plan by 2020 now
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.760]  just about nine years and a few months away under the Copenhagen framework to
[37:27.760 --> 37:36.440]  have a 20% carbon reduction and then they plan to have a 50% by 2050 and a
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.920]  Schwarzenegger is trying to ram this through as his last gas before he runs
[37:40.920 --> 37:44.840]  off with the billions of dollars he's now got and so I've now set the table for
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.480]  that Michael Olson break it down for us what's happening here in California with
[37:50.480 --> 37:56.560]  even mainstream media saying 17 plus percent unemployment nationally 22% in
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.840]  California what will this do if they put these carbon taxes in well it'll make it
[38:01.840 --> 38:05.960]  very hard to compete in the world marketplace and one of the few
[38:05.960 --> 38:11.560]  remaining industries that California has that actually takes raw materials and
[38:11.560 --> 38:17.760]  manufactures a finished product that's sold for a profit is agriculture we are
[38:17.760 --> 38:24.300]  one of the shining lights of American industry and yet if you reduce our
[38:24.300 --> 38:30.800]  ability by what 20% for this industry this industry will do what most other
[38:30.800 --> 38:36.640]  industries have done which is leave town and thus remove even more jobs from
[38:36.640 --> 38:42.360]  California then so we're you know been a pretty tight fix California passed a
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.440]  proposition some time ago I think it was called the climate changer climate
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.440]  global warming initiative initiative or something like that and that is is going
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.880]  to force phased-in reductions this coming election day November 3 we're
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.280]  going to vote on whether we should delay that until unemployment goes down to 5%
[39:03.280 --> 39:08.880]  well unemployment's at 22% so to get it to 5% that means that you know
[39:08.880 --> 39:12.600]  essentially we're going to delay this global warming initiative until health
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.720]  freezes over it's not going to happen for a long long time so but interestingly
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.560]  enough there are a lot of forces aligned against proposition 23 or the effort to
[39:22.560 --> 39:27.720]  delay including Microsoft and Google and all of the less because they're all
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.720]  moving to China there you go there you go there go so that's the situation hey
[39:32.720 --> 39:36.720]  can I switch the tables on you would you mind having a little fun on behalf of
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.520]  your audience sure I would like to ask you a question that was once asked me
[39:40.520 --> 39:46.600]  after the federal building was bombed in Oklahoma City I was taken up to CBS
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.160]  headquarters in San Francisco when this big stretch limousine and four o'clock in
[39:51.160 --> 39:55.640]  the morning and he strapped me into a chair and at seven o'clock in the morning
[39:55.640 --> 39:58.680]  four o'clock in the morning our time seven o'clock east coast time
[39:58.680 --> 40:04.480]  Paula's on came on couldn't see her but I could hear and she said Michael also
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.720]  welcome to good morning America Michael I have a question for you and my
[40:08.720 --> 40:13.080]  question is this is it true that news talk radio is responsible for all the
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.560]  hate in America and Alex you're the one who are is really out there on the
[40:18.560 --> 40:26.440]  battle line of news talk radio nobody I know is more ballsy when it comes to
[40:26.440 --> 40:33.840]  putting your your your your your notion on the line is that hate well that's a
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.080]  really great question I've got the Southern Poverty Law Center I've got
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.440]  all the George Soros groups just constantly basically lying and claiming
[40:42.440 --> 40:46.040]  that I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite the truth is
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.840]  these big global mega corporations they come in they loot the Treasury they
[40:51.840 --> 40:57.360]  try to cut off our energy sources people start getting upset and then the system
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.160]  points at one of the only free mediums out there before we had the internet
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.760]  sure a couple big corporations four or five dominated most of the news most of
[41:06.760 --> 41:10.520]  the talk but even though those big names were on all those local stations there
[41:10.520 --> 41:16.040]  were still niches in the morning or in the evening or on the weekend for a lot
[41:16.040 --> 41:22.120]  of great local minds and diverse topics and talk radio is in a long form
[41:22.120 --> 41:27.120]  obviously people know that it's not sound bites and they've done major
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.760]  studies and you can even pull them up we've covered them where television
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.720]  puts you into a dream state when you go into suspended disbelief I mean you
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.800]  are your brain waves actually lower but talk radio does the same thing that
[41:42.800 --> 41:47.000]  reading does they for sixty something year strap people in pick up their
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.080]  brain waves when they're reading and the brain waves go way up because when
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.680]  you read about the Red Bicycle going down the road towards the beach and he
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.440]  had a bottle of champagne and you know bread he was meeting his yeah his
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.360]  girlfriend I mean you image and you think about the Red Bicycle you think
[42:06.360 --> 42:09.000]  about the champagne you think about the bread you think about girlfriends you
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.080]  had you think about times you were at the beach all of that is flooding through
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.600]  your mind you're having to image it you're having to pull it up you're
[42:14.600 --> 42:18.320]  making neuron connections and I'm going the long way around to answer this
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.480]  question yeah but but but with talk radio it's the same thing it's like
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.360]  reading because your mind has to bring the images up and has to bring up the
[42:27.360 --> 42:32.600]  connections television and cinema and I love cinema but there's a reason you
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.560]  want to suspend a disbelief it's all being given to you and it lowers your
[42:36.560 --> 42:40.320]  brain waves and that's why you can just search Alzheimer's television viewing
[42:40.320 --> 42:44.080]  and they've got British studies US studies government studies the more TV
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.320]  you watch the more neurons your brain doesn't you know connect and literally
[42:48.320 --> 42:53.560]  that's the process of dying and so they don't like talk radio because it's
[42:53.560 --> 42:58.360]  polluted with neocon fake right wing stuff liberal mainstream garbage
[42:58.360 --> 43:04.320]  whatever but it is also filled from coast to coast with a lot of diverse
[43:04.320 --> 43:10.160]  minds and ideas and complex ideas I mean I could never get on CNN and have a
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.480]  long complex talk like this to describe you know a simple question of are you
[43:15.480 --> 43:22.880]  causing hate no this is the 20th century and our 21st century version of the
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.880]  soapbox down at the corner and the establishment the system doesn't like
[43:27.880 --> 43:32.360]  the fact that you have a voice I mean is it hate that when C-span any time you
[43:32.360 --> 43:36.400]  watch Washington Journal in the morning any time I watch it and they have a
[43:36.400 --> 43:41.360]  politician on there or somebody dealing with security almost every caller comes
[43:41.360 --> 43:44.840]  in and says 9-11's an inside job you blew those towers up building seven was on
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.240]  television is it hate that the people have now been woken up and are able when
[43:49.240 --> 43:52.760]  they get a chance to call in or when they get a chance to actually interface
[43:52.760 --> 43:55.600]  with the media they're saying we don't like what you're doing Congress has an
[43:55.600 --> 43:59.320]  11% approval rating the mainstream media has the lowest approval rating ever and
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.080]  so the the proto internet was talk radio and now you see talk radio being one of
[44:05.080 --> 44:10.080]  the few areas to do okay or in some cases you're doing well compared to the
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.720]  rest of the media the newspapers the TV all of it going basically belly up it's
[44:14.720 --> 44:18.680]  not just the technology shift it's that people are completely sick of it and I
[44:18.680 --> 44:23.120]  know I'm ranting here but the answer is no the system is trying to demonize the
[44:23.120 --> 44:26.960]  First Amendment it's trying to say if you expose corruption you're bad and
[44:26.960 --> 44:31.000]  and they you know it's like a woman who gets raped and they say well you
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.600]  shouldn't have been wearing a short skirt walking down the boardwalk okay
[44:34.600 --> 44:41.240]  no no the system is involved in all this corruption and all this evil and and
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.840]  we're here talking about it and and we're here having complex discussions and
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.960]  we're here exposing the proof of this corruption and we're here over you know
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.640]  long periods of time making predictions on record you're having guests on going
[44:55.640 --> 45:00.680]  over every facet go ahead I'm sorry well the fairness doctrine in light of what
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.520]  you just said Michael but what he said though the proof of what he is saying
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.880]  we saw last night look at how many people wanted to come out and have that
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.240]  dialogue sure in person mm-hmm and it with respect to to that notion that the
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.640]  government is afraid of people who have blood throwing flowing through their
[45:19.640 --> 45:24.880]  brains people who have brain I worked for David Brinkley's NBC magazine once
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.960]  did and we did magazine pieces but no matter how much work we put into those
[45:29.960 --> 45:33.840]  I always got the feeling like when we put the the piece on the air there was
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.200]  somebody in Topeka Kansas on a couch with a beer bleary eyed kind of staring
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.440]  at this screen drinking your beer and go well that's interesting and it's gone
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.320]  both news talk radio Alex Jones put something on the table and people call
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.360]  you up and say hey what do you mean bud and after enough people you know have
[45:51.360 --> 45:56.520]  that dialogue the truth comes out and the truth is what sets us free that
[45:56.520 --> 46:01.800]  constant talking and asking and questioning and yeah I mean it sparks
[46:01.800 --> 46:06.280]  bushfires in the minds of men and women yes brush fire and so if the government
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.840]  is afraid of that of people thinking then what is the fairness doctrine well
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.280]  the fairness doctrine is making it bland and keeping it in that narrow left
[46:15.280 --> 46:20.800]  right discussion and you know having a bunch of bland soundbite politicians
[46:20.800 --> 46:24.400]  and political hacks I mean have you ever listened to a show like Beyond the Belt
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.080]  Way and I'm not bashing it but it's literally just this narrowly confined
[46:29.080 --> 46:34.280]  and the only time it's any good is when callers call in and it and it's all
[46:34.280 --> 46:39.960]  these political hacks who who were they're just regurgitating the script
[46:39.960 --> 46:44.680]  but but freedom is a messy thing and the fact that people are waking up to
[46:44.680 --> 46:50.760]  tyranny is a messy thing and 1776 was messy but the alternative is total
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.160]  bondage and enslavement but I believe in the info war because I remember going
[46:55.160 --> 47:00.520]  back 15 16 years ago reading about the Pentagon saying 90% of their operations
[47:00.520 --> 47:04.960]  was info war but but you know they were using deception manipulation propaganda
[47:04.960 --> 47:09.400]  I said what about info war with the truth and so I want to try to reach out to
[47:09.400 --> 47:12.560]  everybody in the system whose compartmentalized and say do we really
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.720]  want to go in this direction I mean there's only a few thousand globalist
[47:15.720 --> 47:21.000]  who have a stake in this corruption the rest of us need to understand that life
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.600]  is is slowly degenerating and degrading and the good things are being pulled
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.520]  down and the bad things are being built up we need to change course earlier
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.040]  today we were talking about the impact of the carbon dioxide the effort to
[47:35.040 --> 47:42.080]  reduce carbon dioxide and you made an incredibly interesting statement and you
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.400]  said that this has been not being done to reduce global warming this is being
[47:47.400 --> 47:53.080]  done as an effort to reduce our effort to take care of ourselves to make us
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.080]  serves on our own land yes they want to make us dependent and they state that
[47:57.080 --> 48:04.000]  that's what's sick you go back to club of Rome 1966 1963 as a separate document
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.960]  and Dr. Stan Montee here just locally as a giant library at his house he has
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.480]  all these I mean I've been to the library and gotten them myself but I mean
[48:11.480 --> 48:14.120]  it's actually to actually see him and they said we've got to have something to
[48:14.120 --> 48:21.800]  unify people and in the future we're gonna have terrorism to unify people and
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.080]  we'll get the right wing to go along with that and then on the left we'll
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.200]  take over the ecological movement because people are legitimately concerned
[48:30.200 --> 48:34.640]  and we will use crises the threat of global cooling the threat of global
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.440]  warming it doesn't matter we need a shock doctrine of scaring them that way
[48:39.440 --> 48:43.120]  we can go back to a feudalistic system I mean they actually use the term
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.520]  feudalistic in the 1996 you and biological diversity assessment it
[48:47.520 --> 48:53.760]  actually says that they want to shut us down to the point where where we
[48:53.760 --> 48:56.280]  literally can't even take care of ourselves and then the government comes
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.200]  in and says that's okay we're gonna give you welfare money but you've got to be
[49:00.200 --> 49:05.720]  sterilized Rahm Emanuel never let a serious crisis go to waste we've had a
[49:05.720 --> 49:11.400]  number of serious crisis with respect to our food chain poison this and poison
[49:11.400 --> 49:14.960]  that and poison this and poison that and now the government appears to be using
[49:14.960 --> 49:24.560]  that crisis to do what to consolidate power and they openly tell the different
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.680]  federal agencies openly tell the farmers get big or get out and they want to
[49:30.680 --> 49:35.680]  transfer everything over to these big giant mega farms which statistically
[49:35.680 --> 49:38.440]  if you look at it that's where almost all the problems are coming all the
[49:38.440 --> 49:42.960]  problems are coming from and yet the SWAT teams are going after the little
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.520]  guys the people who Percy Smeiser yes Percy Smeiser the people who grow and
[49:47.520 --> 49:53.760]  sell food for their neighbors one lady in in Connecticut has one cow out in the
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.400]  country three people share the milk from that cow the government came to her
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.320]  with cease and desist orders well see the the globalist claim they're these
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.600]  communists and and and oh it's all lived together but when people actually create
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.160]  a little commune that it's free and democratic and and you know a
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.080]  neighborhood has four cows and they pay somebody to take care of them they all
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.720]  get fresh milk and great cheese the government does send in SWAT teams you
[50:17.720 --> 50:22.440]  see it every week in the news because because that's hate it's hateful for

[54:15.520 --> 54:19.600]  our grandparents their grandparents their grandparents before them they
[54:19.600 --> 54:22.920]  couldn't have cows they could grow strawberries and sell them wherever they
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.640]  wanted to but things change we became domesticated and now we don't know how
[54:27.640 --> 54:31.960]  to fix our cars we don't know how to fix our roofs somebody's kind of a weirdo if
[54:31.960 --> 54:35.080]  they know how to tinker in the garage I see reports all the time where neighbors
[54:35.080 --> 54:39.720]  will see it's almost always an old man working on machinery in their garage or
[54:39.720 --> 54:44.400]  workshop and people will call the police on them or or even in Texas somebody
[54:44.400 --> 54:46.840]  tries to take their deer rifle out and put it in the back of their pickup even
[54:46.840 --> 54:50.520]  in rural areas people call the police on them it's like this person's working on
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.600]  their car this I saw some oil dripping I this person's growing food this this
[54:54.600 --> 54:57.960]  person this I mean pretty soon it'll be this person knows how to tie their shoe
[54:57.960 --> 55:03.760]  laces and and they just want you totally mindless like a little drone only able
[55:03.760 --> 55:08.600]  to do little special functions for the system while the system races to get
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.560]  rid of all of our jobs Michael Olson where do you see all this going where do
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.840]  you see this going Bill graph I'll jump in really quickly on this Michael Olson
[55:16.840 --> 55:21.320]  here I saw a piece in the paper or someplace maybe it was on info wars
[55:21.320 --> 55:28.360]  dot com where in Chicago where school children are growing food in in school
[55:28.360 --> 55:33.520]  garden I saw that piece they are the food is prohibited in the school you they
[55:33.520 --> 55:38.560]  can grow it but they can't eat it they have to you take get rid of it because
[55:38.560 --> 55:44.080]  it's not does not confine confirms all the government guidelines I saw that so
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.040]  so you got good teachers and I've seen this rebelling everywhere trying to
[55:48.040 --> 55:52.440]  teach them basic human skills I mean we're designed to dig in the dirt as
[55:52.440 --> 55:55.680]  humans I mean that's why it feels so good it's so relaxing it's what's like
[55:55.680 --> 55:59.080]  you know it's like taking four or five valium's just to go dig in the dirt you
[55:59.080 --> 56:01.560]  know people describe it that way because you're designed to do it and they're
[56:01.560 --> 56:04.880]  saying that well going back over a decade firstly said you can't play dodge
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.400]  ball then you can't play tag and now coast to coast in almost every school
[56:09.400 --> 56:15.760]  they're not allowed to run or touch in the playground and now they have to walk
[56:15.760 --> 56:20.760]  in many schools are removing playgrounds all together I mean prisoners are
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.680]  allowed to go out on a playground I mean it's worse than prisoners and it's it
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.280]  all relates back to what you're talking about about the blood flowing through
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.400]  the brain and and firing the synapses and and making people think we're also
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.800]  nice in the slugs yes and I think what you were saying is that so much of this
[56:38.800 --> 56:45.040]  the end result is that it reduces our ability to think like like rational
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.440]  human beings and it really does turn us into it like Billy says slugs so we sit
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.040]  on our couch and we watch TV and we drink our beer bleary-eyed and and we see
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.800]  the images flash past us but our brain waves are so small or so the waves are
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.400]  just so so weak and insipid that we're just not thinking exactly what we have
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.320]  been put into an artificial environment and you know it's one thing if we're in
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.400]  this technological system part of the time but it feels so good to get out of
[57:14.400 --> 57:18.200]  it but they're doing everything they can don't know don't don't don't start
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.800]  growing your own food don't stop keep watch that television just more in
[57:21.800 --> 57:27.160]  cities than that don't play dodgeball don't get exercise don't make your body
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.840]  strong so you can work yeah I mean don't come a slug exactly well scary stuff so
[57:33.840 --> 57:38.760]  wait a minute how do we fight back well we understand I mean on the issue of
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.480]  dodgeball is this whole cult of bullying you see the ad stop bullying and no
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.160]  bodies for bullies but you know the issue is the school goes after the
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.480]  bullies they stop them they get in trouble but they don't even do that now
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.560]  it's just oh my gosh you know if something hurts someone's feelings we
[57:52.560 --> 57:57.040]  can't have dodgeball cuz somebody might lose oh we can't have somebody you know
[57:57.040 --> 58:01.320]  win the game but I remember being a child you know if I won or lost it was
[58:01.320 --> 58:05.320]  just fun it was sportsmanship but they make everything real sick and oh it's
[58:05.320 --> 58:09.320]  an ism and they have all these new psychological designations that there's
[58:09.320 --> 58:13.160]  dozens of them if you don't trust the government all these different mental
[58:13.160 --> 58:16.880]  illnesses or oh you don't trust authority I mean that was all common sense to our
[58:16.880 --> 58:20.760]  founders common sense to anybody and so it's just this attempt to create an
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.600]  artificial system but do it from a fake moral high ground this fake liberalism
[58:25.600 --> 58:29.320]  but they're not liberals they are scientific technocrats at the top they
[58:29.320 --> 58:34.560]  are cold-blooded dominators but they put on the camouflage of a little little
[58:34.560 --> 58:39.240]  you know loving hippie oh stop dodgeball really they're just eugenicists that want
[58:39.240 --> 58:46.960]  to take control we'll be right back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live

[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.760]  but they they set the precedent we'll say how big your toilet is how much
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.040]  water it can have we'll say what type of light bulb oh now it's a federal mandate

[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:16.800]  stations ksco am 1080 and ko my am 1340 I wanted to you know just get both of
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.600]  you to comment on anything else we discussed here because we've got the
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.000]  general manager here and we've also got bill graph the engineer I have something
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.760]  it I want to ask you what what can we do as people I mean faced with all of this
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.160]  that were faced with what can we do to survive for not only for ourselves but
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:41.360]  for our children and our children's children what can we do out well we can
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.000]  take the states back we there's a lot of different strategies but I I go with
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.520]  the nullification 10th amendment moves is one of the key political things but
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.640]  the biggest issue is people are now ready to hear the truth they weren't 10
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.760]  years ago 20 years ago now people are ready I mean America's awake they just
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.840]  that they don't know what they woken up to but they're awake and we need while
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.280]  the establishment gives them all these false twisted messages we need to go
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.080]  hey you know over here do you know what I think happened I think we were all
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.440]  ready for change so we put the current administration in for a change and then
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.840]  we found out they didn't change yeah that's what woke me up no exactly I
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.160]  think it's snap people out of a trance and I think you're right also I think
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.560]  of this in terms of food we used to be satisfied with the food that they gave
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.760]  us then we discovered the joys of local food real food there's a total rebellion
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.960]  all over Austin all over the other towns you know and I mean everybody I meet
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.000]  through my children who have friends is doctors lawyers scientists and they
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.720]  know all about the New World Order some of them don't even know who I am they
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.760]  know all about everything and they've got all these co-ops and it's a whole
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.760]  culture and the food's great I mean it's amazing this is a rebellion and
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.240]  that's what's frightening of it and that's why they're all of these laws
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.840]  designed to make food safe but really that the laws are designed not to make
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.840]  food safe just like this global warming thing it's not designed to make food
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.520]  safe it's designed to make it safe for them and not for us it consolidates it
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.520]  yes consolidates so it makes their food safe and it gets rid of our food and
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.680]  that's right I'm from it yeah I'll tell folks when they can tune in anywhere in
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.880]  the world to ksco.com and hear your weekly reports on this well I'm on

[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:31.160]  the the it's a studio design built in 1947 and the and the walls it's kind of
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.200]  hard to describe but the walls are actually round and the rounded because
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.200]  sound so it doesn't bounce around the corner that's right I know I'm gonna
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.120]  take photos of this in my new studio maybe copy this because because this is
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.640]  like this the walls in here look like Princess Leah's ambassador ship yeah
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.880]  when Darth Vader's chasing exactly exactly I mean I feel like Darth Vader's
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.160]  about to come around the corner we'll be right back folks this is Santa Cruz it
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.600]  could happen we'll be right yeah William prowess we'll be back with Lindsey
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.200]  Williams stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.640]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.560]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.600]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.920]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:52.320]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:03.400]  1-877-327-0365 Alex told you the government announced recently that the
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.480]  recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.560]  find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.840]  government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.200]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected

[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:15.520]  network we're going to open the phones up for Lindsay Williams we're gonna start
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.520]  taking your phone calls at the bottom of the hour for questions for him this is
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.580]  part two of the live interview we did last week with him on what was it
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.620]  Thursday and he's with us for the rest of this hour maybe a little bit in the
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:31.840]  next hour and Lindsay was saying I wanted to talk about solutions but
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.760]  Pastor Lindsay Williams for those that don't know who he is or just joined us
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:41.440]  or driving along wondering what we're talking about he knows a retired CEO of
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.200]  one of the big three oil companies we know who it is we've confirmed it and
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.560]  he's told Lindsay a lot of things beforehand predictions about what the
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.520]  elite are going to do that turn out to be very accurate frighteningly accurate
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.480]  similar to leaks we get from Bilderberg group year after year back in 2006
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.640]  Esteline as well as Tucker with their sources when I was with them in Canada
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.440]  and Ottawa they're at the Capitol covering Bilderberg said they're going to pop
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.920]  the bubble in real estate and then they're going to start a basic global
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.640]  depression and then they're going to try to kill the dollar that's what was
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.560]  discussed there and boom it happened so this is very similar to that but but
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.520]  Lindsay I will get a little bit into you know basic solutions or your ideas but
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.920]  specifically for those that joined us briefly recap the six or seven points
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:31.840]  that he made to you about the dollar what he said about oil going up to 150 to
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.920]  200 and the next six to eight months what this top globalist told you who's
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:42.000]  now terminally ill with cancer so as we put it last week has now spilt his guts
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.160]  and that of course integrates him with 60-minute shock report real unemployment
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.640]  nationwide 17.5 California 22% and that's a whitewash even in in and of
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.160]  itself here's CNBC dollar at risk of becoming toxic waste of the charts show
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.720]  and we're going to be discussing all of that here's a New York Times article
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:06.000]  falling into the chasm Paul Krugman his answers give the Federal Reserve more
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.600]  power and he goes on to say what this is what happens when you need to leap over
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.040]  an economic chasm but either can't or won't jump far enough so that you only
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.800]  get part of the way across and his answer is pump more money to the banks so
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.560]  they create the crisis offer the solution Lindsay Williams good to have you
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.680]  here with us Alex I think everybody in America was listening to your show
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:33.200]  Thursday of last week I had Carl have to call after Carl and on Friday morning
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.800]  an individual called me up and he said Lindsay you are over the internet now
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.600]  so what do you mean you're enough I think nearly every major patriot internet
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.680]  site in the country had re-employed your program on Thursday Alex people say to
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.920]  be hungry for the truth so over the weekend I contacted her with the two
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.960]  Mr. X's of my book energy non-crisis now the one German gentleman who has
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.360]  cancer is terminally ill is only expected to live for about another two
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.840]  weeks and I don't know I'm gonna come out with some various dawdling things
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.760]  after he passes away the what I found out over the weekend Alex is the people
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.200]  out in the listening audience even a fraction of what I've been told you
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:25.920]  would be utterly startled you must not I beg of you everybody in Alex Jones
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.840]  listening already you cannot allow Congress to bail out the marriage back
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.960]  securities you can't let him do it you must stop them you realize that they
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.120]  are giving to the elitist of the world between two and seven trillion dollars
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.360]  of your taxpayers money you can't let them bail out the mortgage back
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:52.520]  securities they're gonna try it after the election what my words I mean what
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:58.160]  I'm getting is so startling Alex I would challenge every move with every group
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.800]  in America to clamp down put that they stop these this bad bad Congress that
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.840]  we've got up there stop them don't let them bail out the mortgage back
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.200]  securities and well Lindsay business today I want to talk about I want to talk
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.120]  with you about what that means overall and how that ties into you know your
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.040]  main mr. rex and one of the other sources you've got a plus the lady who
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.200]  we've confirmed was having a meeting with Napolitano and she was saying get
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.840]  ready for total implosion and get your six months of food and water and that
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.120]  really scared people I had a big event last night and people were asking that
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.720]  question over over and over again but I don't think we can wait two weeks until
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.640]  mr. X dies and and hopefully when he won't die but if he does I hope you
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.440]  come on here first to reveal what it is so startling that you're saying you
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.080]  can't say it now but can you give us some type of some type of hint or some
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.280]  type of you know idea of of the information that's so big that he
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.400]  doesn't want it out well Alex it goes all the way back to why we were in Iraq
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.720]  I mean this thing is so in depth with information that they've given me over
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.760]  the years many of the things I have not said out of respect for this gentleman
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.960]  and fear that I might get both he and I and further now over the weekend seven
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.520]  banks will close here in the United States of America that means that from
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:25.080]  the first of this year until right now 139 banks have been closed in 2010 do
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.840]  you realize how drastic this is when Janet Apolitano just came out last week
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.080]  and said to a very close friend of hers who lives here in Phoenix Arizona who
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.760]  was in Washington at a private dinner meeting that she had with her and she
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.320]  said I want you to go back to Arizona I want you to immediately for the
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.600]  soak appeal family I'm saying this Janet Apolitano said to her I'm saying
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.800]  there's only to a few of my very close friends yet six months of food and
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.800]  water in your house immediately I mean doesn't tell us something why are we
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:05.200]  in Afghanistan even told us why we're there the real reason why we were in
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.120]  Iraq I'll be coming out with this after this man dies but but out of respect for
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.200]  him I can't do it until then but hold on hold on hold on hold on Lindsey we're on
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.200]  the verge of something you got to tell us the real reason we were in Iraq come
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.920]  on this is too important well tell us as much as you can basically the book
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:32.120]  family I mean this goes back to the time when Saddam Hussein threatened George
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:38.380]  Bruce senior he of course had to take revenge when it goes back to at the
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:44.200]  death ridge who took the message to Saddam to go ahead and and go into Q
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:51.800]  wait I mean all of this adds up to we have been so we've been laid down the
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:56.720]  primrose path we have been done in by our politicians in Washington DC the past
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.800]  few presidents have been nothing but it palms in the hands of the new world
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.720]  order and now we go into Afghanistan for the sake of protecting the opium
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:11.800]  tunnels and remember 87% of the world's opium comes out of Afghanistan well it's
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.920]  now 90% protecting the opium fields and the bankers I mean this thing is so in
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.160]  depth when you hear these elites talk about it Alex it would enraged the
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.320]  American people if they knew the whole story of what's on but right now our
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:31.920]  biggest crisis is the marriage back security issue you're going to hear the
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.520]  word MBS more and more that they will earn if you were dealing with the elitist
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:44.400]  two to seven trillion dollars for the purpose of taking your residential and
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.360]  commercial mortgages and they will give it our free of charge I mean I can hardly
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.560]  be brought this morning with what I've heard here lately it's so stabbling folks
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.840]  you cannot let this come back Congress between election and January you cannot
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.840]  let them do what they've got on the docket to do they know they're on their way
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.520]  out and they're going to pull every trick of the trade before January and the new
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.720]  Congress takes over hope you can't let them do it well Lindsay you talked to him
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.400]  then again just in the last few days I talked to him on Sunday okay you talked
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:27.880]  to him on Sunday what what more is it on crisis what more can you tell us that he
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.760]  told you that you can tell us and I mean of all the years I've interviewed you
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.600]  and I've been interviewing you for 14 years 15 years I've never heard you so
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.480]  hectic I've never calling you people's you know scumbags I've never heard this
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.000]  much earnestness in your voice I mean what is it that's got you so freaked
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.200]  out I mean are they did he tell you they're about to pull the trigger on a
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:52.040]  total implosion they are definitely on the verge of doing what they want to
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.720]  let me put it this way he said to me two years ago within two years you're not
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.840]  recognized America he said again by 2012 that I will be dead he said again within
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.600]  two years now everybody in America will be working for the government we are
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.920]  right now on the verge of them doing what he told me two years ago that they
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.560]  were going to do they feel that they have it in the bag they feel that

[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.240]  about four hours to another great sold-out crowd of wonderful patriots
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:31.000]  going back to Lindsay Williams Lindsay to quantify all of this specifically you
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.680]  sound shaken up more than I ever have heard you know this concerned and you're
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.400]  saying that he I mean did he tell you I'm gonna die in two weeks they tell me
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:45.360]  and you can't talk about this till I'm dead or I mean what did he say I was
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:52.800]  nervous matter of respect Alex but this man is terminal he was very weak when I
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.280]  talked to him on the phone over the weekend his relatives said that he has
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.240]  approximately two weeks to live the things that he was given me over the
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.280]  years and now to bring all this to a culmination it's kind of like a funnel
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.280]  you pull the funnel forward to talk when it's big you go down to this about and
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.800]  it's coming out strong we are at that's about point right now the elitist the
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.760]  name of the game is control they do not want revolution let me take this
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.920]  emphatically I know most of all patriot people out there in fringe are looking
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.480]  for a revolution they don't want revolution that's the last thing in the
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.080]  world they won't they do not want you to wake up enough to become so concerned
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.560]  that you will revolt the name of the game is total control they want your
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.400]  house mortgage they want the commercial real estate of America and they want to
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.040]  get every bit of it free of charge and they will if they have to use the
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:48.080]  cyber attack they will if they have to use the bank I mean the mortgage
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.120]  institutions being bailed out to the tune of two to seven trillion dollars
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:56.760]  which they're predicting they will and you American taxpayers are going to pay
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.480]  it don't let him do it I mean I don't have to say this enough after my
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.040]  conversations this weekend I just want to shout over your broadcast if I could
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.440]  everybody out there in the listening audience every group in America don't let
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.720]  Congress bail out the mortgage back security you will literally be giving
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.440]  the elitist the world between two and seven trillion dollars of money from the
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.720]  Treasury of the United States of America through the Federal Reserve and that
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.080]  won't fix the problem that won't fix the problem they've created I mean you
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:32.200]  notice the more power we give them the more bailouts they need now specifically
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.800]  now you talked about a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a barrel that
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.000]  translates to five to six to seven dollars a gallon depending on where you
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.560]  live in the country what's the time frame on that a and did he say anything else
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.080]  about it yes you remember two years ago he told me was going for a hundred and
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.600]  forty seven to fifty it did it exactly as he said two months later this time
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.000]  it's going in the opposite direction it is going back up to a hundred and fifty
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.880]  to two hundred dollars a barrel you're looking somewhere and they're gonna do
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.040]  this so that you won't jump out of the saddle they don't want the crowd to jump
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.000]  out of the pot they are not going to take it there overnight like they brought it
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.240]  down overnight instead they're going to take it back up gradually and it'll take
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.040]  place somewhere between six months in a year these will fuel it's already up to
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.360]  ten cents a gallon here in our local area and you're going to see it go back up
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.760]  to four and five dollars a gallon at the gas pump and you'll see it done
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:31.520]  gradually if they see you jumping out of the saddle and getting too angry
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.200]  produce millions for that program down a little bit don't turn attention to that
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.600]  don't let him do you don't you know what that plan is I have told you this man
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:46.200]  has told me what the plan is there's three things we this man has told me over
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.840]  the past 35 years has taken place exactly as he said it you can depend on this
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.880]  also and it is a drawing of the string of these people so yes well let's see to
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.440]  be specific though pop within the next six months to a year it going back up
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:05.000]  gradually to the point you'll be paying that at the gas pump if they need to use
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.600]  a Middle East crisis they will and the trade of Harmoos all it takes is one
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.440]  tanker 30% of the oil of the world passes through there in any given day
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.160]  they can do any of these things they want to in order to bring about what they
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:23.640]  want to bring to come to pass Alex okay now Lindsey he he's giving you amazing
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.720]  predictions and almost all of them have come true but I guess he was
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.640]  speculating because even the establishment didn't know exactly what
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.560]  was going to happen with the oil spill I mean he did say that was going to be a
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.000]  little bit worse than it's turned out to be right I mean he wasn't completely
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.880]  right about that well that positively was an accident that was not planned and
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.680]  they finally had to fill that entire pipe with with really much and close it
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.960]  off so that's kind of a issue of the past and people around the Gulf will have
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.920]  to live with the correct and we don't really know the truth because come now
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.440]  we come down to the other things that are most important and of course we're
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.000]  going to face crude oil prices going up we're going to face this mortgage back
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.280]  security crisis and the thing I'm trying to I listed over the weekend in the
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.040]  life of what these people have told me what you need to do
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.480]  general public animals right go do it immediately stock market folks you've

[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:43.160]  the Babylon system
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.120]  yeah people like to make fun of third-world countries because they can
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:54.000]  never get themselves together but now it's happening here it's always been
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.720]  going on but now there's so many vampires so many parasites and they're
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:05.960]  collapsing the civilization and society by design that's why my films the
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.360]  Obama deception and fall the republic are so important they're really not films
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.760]  about Obama but it's meant to get liberals and conservatives to watch the
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.680]  film and to see how he's nothing but a puppet and how the banks have
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.720]  engineered these crises and I released the Obama deception now more than a year
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.200]  and a half ago fall the republic what eight nine months ago and those are the
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.120]  key films to show you currently what's happening I hope you'll get them at
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.960]  infowars.com I hope you'll make copies of the DVDs I hope you'll send the
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.920]  videos out to everyone you know because it in a in a complex but but but
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:42.800]  riveting way lays it all out because if we don't politically as a society
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.680]  stand up and shadow the left-right paradigm and point out how they control
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.200]  us and how they divide and conquer us and what this global banking agenda is
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:55.920]  we're going to lose this society Lindsay Williams before he leaves will give you
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.440]  the number and website if you want to get some of the books and films and and
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.320]  DVDs and audio CDs that break down all of his research and intel and his

[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:13.600]  before he leaves us at five after next hour maybe even keep them a little bit

[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.560]  not doing that today because I'm here in Santa Cruz California but there can be
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.880]  no doubt now that we're going into a depression there could be no doubt it
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.480]  was engineered that's admitted and there can be no doubt that the people that
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:45.280]  engineered it are in control and it's a very very simple and people need to
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.160]  understand this is the fruit of globalism it is poverty it is bankruptcy
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:57.160]  it is war it is pain I want to go to Steve, Matt, Ronnie, Diane, Nailani and
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.640]  others that are patiently holding as you hear those callers disconnect when
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:09.400]  we're done you can call in 800-259-9231 Lindsey they're openly now
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.200]  announcing I saw them changing the rules five years ago now they're saying
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.600]  yeah we're gonna take your private pension funds and tax them to keep them
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.880]  safe for you oh because they invested in mortgage-backed securities the
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.040]  government's got to take it over you know that's how they sell it and oh yes
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:27.360]  we are you know blocking COLA increases on cost of living expenses for seniors
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.640]  on social security I mean it goes on and on but don't worry they've got tax
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:36.080]  increases on top of it all to further stall the economy and carbon taxes for
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.760]  you and if that doesn't you know break your wallet well we've got all these
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.120]  cops out there writing tickets as fast as they can one of the guys at the
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.160]  station just ran to the store to get some breakfast for us and and didn't
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:51.360]  completely stop at the stop sign and just got a ticket the police right out
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.600]  here are like piranhas you know feeding but if you're an illegal alien though
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.880]  they fall down their knees and worship you and say you can go because again they
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.000]  want to keep those borders wide open to further drive down wages until we're all
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.080]  third-worlds of serfs soon as we're third-worlds serfs though you better
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.120]  believe they're gonna be throwing the illegals in the in the who's cow in the
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:16.120]  little prison cells immediately Lindsey I want to go to phone calls but but
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:22.960]  anything else that that that he told you in this last discussion you had just
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.760]  yesterday anything else that you can tell us you see out of respect I mean
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.480]  obviously he's telling you this information so that you can talk about it
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.800]  as long as you don't give up his identity the systems listening to your phones
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.600]  they know who it is I know who it is I know who the lady in Phoenix is you
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:47.000]  separately and confirmed it so I mean why not just go ahead and tell us
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.080]  because you know God forbid you could I mean I think it's dangerous for you to
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.920]  know this information and to not tell us all of it now I mean if it's really that
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.840]  powerful that's the only danger you're in is is is not telling us what he told
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:06.920]  you well I think if I could I sum it all up in just a few expressions after what
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.960]  I've heard this weekend every person out then you're listening all this needs to
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.600]  somehow someway I don't know how you're gonna do it you need to get a paid
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:20.480]  full roof over your head when it's mortgage-backed security thing comes
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.640]  down they will own your mortgage and they will tell you what to do with your
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.280]  house the rest of your days you'll not be able to leave it to your children you
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.080]  need a paid full roof over your head even if it's a shanty it's better than
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.280]  have an imagine and letting the elitist tell you everything to do government
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.120]  intervention in your life you've never seen the life of what it's going to be
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.840]  because the elitist controls the president they tell Congress what to do
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:49.120]  who do you think wrote the health care bill you remember that this gentleman
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:54.000]  said to me months ago before the health care bill was ever passed he said
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.040]  chaplain that's not a health care bill he said that he's total control well now
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.640]  we've realized that everything that's in the health care bill it's exactly no
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.040]  it's got the death panels it was written by the banks and on the insurance
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:10.440]  companies it makes you buy it then they can cut the actual care you get it
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.080]  doesn't cover pre-existing conditions it is another giant tax it has provisions
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.840]  in there for real estate taxes federal property taxes I mean it's all in there
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.160]  increased taxes on the social security money they take out of your check it is
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.480]  a total nightmare their season control they're building threat fusion centers
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:35.640]  openly federalizing all of our police I mean this is a criminal takeover what
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.680]  else can you tell us that he told you I mean I mean what is shaking you up so
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.960]  bad tell us Lindsay well he has warned me over and over and over and he keeps on
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.160]  warning me he said definitely the only place you can secure any of your assets
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.800]  is in gold and silver he said real estate you can't depend on it he said
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.360]  nothing else you can he said golden silver and don't let somebody else hold
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.520]  it in paper form for you you need to purchase more even at $1350
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:11.200]  allows you've got to do it folks get out of your 401ks and your IRAs and transfer
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.160]  them over to silver accounts retirement accounts anything you can and again I'll
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.400]  stress please get cash in your home because the elite are on the verge of
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.040]  drawing the string and whatever they do they will control you because if you
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.160]  don't have cash you can't buy a gasoline at the pump even if you can get it I
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.880]  mean if you can get it and you won't be able to tell you about restore every
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.640]  preparation that you possibly can make but again Lindsay Lindsay we can please
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.520]  get a paid for roof over your head Lindsay did he talk to you about bank
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.360]  runs or bank holidays when they shut it down and then announced dollars and
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.720]  many valued afterwards because you know that's even what the New York Times is
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:57.120]  now talking about yes he positively has said that we are going to have a
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.920]  disruption of the currency how they will choose to do it there's many different
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:07.320]  ways and of course the thing that he said so plainly is the dollar is going to
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:13.360]  go down and down and down and down in value I beg of you get it right now if
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:17.120]  there's anything in the world that you need to buy and you have the cash to buy
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.120]  it buy it right now because the dollar is going to become more worthless by the
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.040]  day he has stressed this over and over and over that the dollar is going to be
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.400]  dead and they will probably go to a another currency they will go to a
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.920]  currency of some kind it's under my impression from listening to these
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.640]  people that they'll probably go directly to a world currency and not just the
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:40.440]  North American Union currency I think did bypass that but let some cash in the
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:45.440]  house and be prepared for whatever may take place he wants me about that over
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.280]  and over well notice how the government is lying to everybody we've known for
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:55.600]  more than two years national unemployment is above 22% 22.2 22.6 22.8 it
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.960]  varies according to these actuaries they're put out by you know big mainline
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.240]  financial analyst firms anybody can just search the term real unemployment
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:09.480]  above 22% but here's 60 minutes shock report we've got the full report up at
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:15.280]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com the video 15-minute segment from 60
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.400]  minutes 60-minute shock report real unemployment nationwide 17.5
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.880]  California 22 and then here's CNBC today dollar at risk of becoming toxic waste
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.960]  chart show the dollar slump could get far worse if the dollar index takes out
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:38.840]  last year's low Robin Griffin's technical analyst at Cuz of Nova capital
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.800]  told CNBC today if the dollar index takes out the low that was made roughly a
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.840]  year ago I really think that there will not only encourage more sales it will
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.040]  cause a little bit of a minor panic he went on to say a year ago it was deemed
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.360]  too cheap if it goes any lower than it actually becomes toxic waste the dollar
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:02.520]  resumed its recent downturn Monday so gold went back up today in the wake of a
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:06.480]  meeting of finance ministers from the group of G20 nations that that's the
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.240]  folks coordinating the concerted global devaluation of all currencies they call
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:18.840]  it oh what's the exact term they use for a coordinated devaluation the meeting
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.560]  failed to yield a definitive agreement on currencies putting selling pressure on
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.120]  the greenback the dollar is being trashed we've actually had effective
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.600]  devaluation of about 14% in the last two months Griffin said his view is contrary
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.520]  to the HSBC foreign exchange strategist David Bloom who told CNBC that the
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.640]  continuation of currency war after the G20 might put pressure on risky assets
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.800]  causing a flight to safety for the dollar well that's adult dr. Paul Craig
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.240]  Roberts has said on this show many times former head of policy at the Treasury
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.680]  under Reagan but he says that only happens for a short time so that's why
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.960]  the dollar goes down then other currencies go down then people flood back
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.160]  into bonds and the dollar goes back up but if you look at the chart it's
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.600]  steadily going down so yes it you know it'll go down by a few points and then
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.160]  go back up by a point then go down a couple more points then go back up by a
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.040]  point or two but overall in the aggregate it's going straight down
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.200]  Lindsay did he specifically give you time a time frame on when the dollar would
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:23.840]  go belly up or yes he positively did in fact I think I've given this on your show before he
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:29.240]  said the dollar will be dead by 2012 and of course it's very easy to see that this
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:34.520]  year in 2011 they could begin to do a lot of things to cause the dollar to be
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:40.000]  completely worthless you must prepare for all of this now the United States has
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.880]  lost 42,400 factory jobs since 2001 75% of those
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.000]  factories employed more than 500 people. Do you realize that the elitist is
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  every bit of this? They have moved everything abroad. Well we've lost
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.200]  millions of factory jobs it's a lot more absolutely it's all been done by
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.720]  design let's go to some phone calls Lindsay amazing information let's talk
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.800]  to Steve in New Mexico Steve thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:12.840]  Lindsay and Alex listen not to belabor the point but as I understand it do what
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.760]  we have here is an elite cartel of international bankers and they're
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:23.800]  subjecting us to a kind of financial and economic rape and my question is this
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:29.840]  isn't it high time that we hit these financial terrorists where they live
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:35.640]  and withdraw all our money from the banks in other words a concerted
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:42.000]  coordinated nationwide effort to pull the plug on the banksters by withdrawing
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:49.360]  their lifeblood yes there must be massive action on the part of the American
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:53.160]  people and it's a thing that I guess the reason I'm so disturbed this morning and
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.520]  the reason Alex and everybody else can hear it in my voice is because of what
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.680]  I've heard in the past few days the folks you don't have much longer that
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:06.200]  these people feel that they have it in the bag and every group in America every
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.960]  person listening to Alex Jones show you're right we've got to have a
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:16.480]  concerted effort to stop the scumbag Congress between election and January
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.520]  there's no telling what they go they're gonna try to ram through by the
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:22.640]  elitist they know they own their way out yeah we've got to have a concerted
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.720]  effort against these elitist well they're gonna try to ram through the
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.680]  carbon tax they're gonna try to ram through the cyber security act they're
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.040]  gonna try to ram through the bill they already passed let the banks take any
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.240]  houses they want without the deeds but Obama pocket vetoed it two weeks ago and
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.440]  just set it aside so we can sign it later and they've signaled that they will
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.800]  but but nothing you're not just getting out of the big six megabanks that's
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.440]  important but you know people will go down to their credit union and pull
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:52.240]  their money out like it's their fault no they head of the Texas Banking
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.680]  Association just in what in February of this year wrote a big article and said
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.960]  look the big megabanks have engineered this this banking
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.680]  re-regulation act that they're about to pass and they did pass it a few months
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:07.120]  later is only going to give them more power to take us over and that's what
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.800]  they're doing is snapping up local banks that actually are helping our economy
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.960]  so we need to differentiate between the mega globalist money changers and your
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.800]  local banks but as important as getting your money out of the big six megabanks
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.440]  is politically having the will and pointing out they are the criminals we
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:28.080]  need to be pointing our fingers and screaming and saying there's the bad
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.360]  man at a fifth grade level that's the bad man he did it you know police fee feel
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.400]  purse snatcher there he is we need to point out that that these people are
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.840]  doing this out in the open anything else Steve no and I thank you too thank
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.720]  you Steve let's talk to Matt in Massachusetts you're on the air with
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:50.480]  Lindsay Williams hi guys thanks so much for taking my call I'm just wondering
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.840]  Lindsay last week you mentioned that your source had explained to you that we
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.920]  should be watching Russia and China and I'm wondering do you expect the United
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.360]  States to be at war with Russia or China anytime soon and if so who wins the
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.320]  war and what happens after the war well naturally we're not going to win the war
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:15.320]  we have moved all of our industry abroad China makes over 80% of the components
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.120]  China makes most the components for the weapons
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:25.400]  we are totally at their mercy if the further our move returns even our own
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.200]  military could not operate our tanks could run our own government gave them
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.080]  a Panama Canal and our own government gave them the Panama Canal this is a
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:37.920]  long-term CFR trilateral Commission stated plan to move everything to China
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.240]  and then shut us down and just leave us with a bunch of paramilitary parasites
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.240]  feeding off of us I mean it's a nightmare situation and you notice the last two
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.040]  weeks China announced they were going to cut off all rare earth minerals needed
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.360]  for all the weapons components all the cell phones everything because China has
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:01.040]  gotten over to 90% oligopoly or a semi monopoly over all rare earth minerals
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.680]  but the globalists aren't stupid they allowed China to strategically do that
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.000]  and then and then basically blocked any US companies from doing it this is a
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.120]  master plan ladies and gentlemen and now China backed off a bit and said well
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.800]  we're just going to reduce most of those rare earth minerals so even if
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:23.280]  companies wanted to build semiconductors here wanted to build smart bombs
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.000]  here wanted to build high-tech you know iPhones here which are already built in
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.520]  China to even if they wanted to do that you couldn't build it here because we
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.080]  can't get the rare earth minerals that are needed to do it remember the elitist
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.520]  control China and Russia just like they control the United States of America they
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:45.240]  just do a little different methodology of billion and yes I have been warned to
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.160]  watch China can you imagine a war mark without a single product on the shelf
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:54.480]  made in China but you may very well see this because of the curtsy wars and the
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.560]  trade wars and now a stupid Congress of all things want to go and then flap on
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.960]  certain wars about China and then they go over then metal and all of their
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.760]  business just like they meddled in Iran and then Iran is I mean Iraq I'm sorry
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.440]  and now Iraq is turning around saying we don't want your democracy we have
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.760]  just pulled so many borders and every single one of them to the advantage of
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.440]  the elite and now they think they can turn around and get the American tax
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.800]  payer to just lay very up and bail out the mortgage-backed securities and
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.960]  give them two to seven trillion dollars or for this it is so dangerous we've
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:40.120]  got a stand to step up and take action immediately or how great great grandchildren
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.360]  are going to be slaves in the hands of the elite all right well said Lindsay

[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.600]  about and whatever it takes for them to be able to bring about total control of

[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:09.040]  one thing now they're using Afghanistan to accomplish something else they're
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.320]  bringing the drugs from Mexico they leave the borders wide open so that all

[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.840]  of Kevin Trudeau yeah yeah the infomercial guy what about him yeah
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.720]  last month which is September the middle of September he said on his radio show
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:02.080]  that Goldman Sachs Citibank and the IMF was on their way into Iran to take over
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:08.080]  the entire financial system and one week later I like you mentioned that the
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:15.280]  computer over there got worms yes so they are so they are in high run they
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:22.720]  went in through back door yes yeah the elite through world now this is very
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.640]  positive the elite already I've been telling you for two years no no no we're
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.720]  not gonna have a Middle East crisis and everybody laughs at me and I said no the
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:36.040]  elite is telling me they're not going to I'm telling you now they're ready though
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.560]  well a Middle East crisis of some time within the next three to four much

[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.520]  segment nay Lonnie I've been pronouncing that right in Tennessee you're on the
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:09.400]  year thanks for holding hey it's actually in a lot of but I'll forgive you lay down
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:14.000]  okay go ahead okay it might seem like I'm changing the subject because I want
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.280]  to talk about the s5 10 but I think you agree it ties right into the dollar
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.600]  dying it I'm an unemployed single mother to I've been living on 185 dollars in
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.960]  months for three years now and I've done it by eating homegrown food and living
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:29.880]  it simply as possible and embracing the fact that food and shelter are my only
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.120]  real necessities in light of my own economic crisis I made plans to care
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.200]  for my kids by farming and 30 days from now I was moving to a country location
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.320]  to begin growing my own food have chickens and cows but now with the s10
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.200]  or s5 10 bill is there any point and with your insight Lindsey into what's
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.400]  about to go down is this bill going to pass and seriously would I be better to
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.600]  just get myself well listen I want to comment that have Lindsey do it if
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.520]  everybody starts farming and ranching or even doing a garden they can't stop us
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.440]  all and no s5 10 is probably not going to pass the lame duck can do anything but
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.520]  it but let them try to implement that you know these criminals want us to be
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.120]  their domesticated slaves it's time to say I'm not al-qaeda for growing tomatoes
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.160]  I'm not al-qaeda for growing plums I'm not al-qaeda for not taking your
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:22.560]  mercury filled shots I'm not al-qaeda for worshiping your depression okay I'm
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.560]  not going along with it anymore and the only thing you can do is try to get
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.440]  self-sufficient Lindsey Williams your comments yes you are a year ahead of
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.800]  probably most everyone else out there in the listening audience congratulations
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.120]  I'm so glad I wish everybody would you immediately take some action to do
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:42.400]  exactly what you're doing because there's one thing they can't control they
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:46.640]  can't control every single money little garden out there in the country but
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.240]  they're sure can control the banking system they can control Washington DC
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.480]  they already have that news round it's next they're going to control every
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.800]  lending institution they're going to control the currency they can't take
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:59.800]  care of every little garden in every well out there in the country folks I
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:05.320]  found out I investigated a really good start I did this about a year ago there's
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:09.280]  not a single one I'm living in a city every single one I've met moved to the
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:15.440]  middle of nowhere it's already going to happen and it moved out absolutely they
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.520]  have and most of the really wealthy people in Austin Texas are getting
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.400]  strange variances that hardly anybody else can get and there's drilling rigs
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:28.200]  everywhere in the middle of the richest areas in town they're all putting up big
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.000]  fences and have drilling rigs putting in water wells and you could drive around
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.640]  anywhere in Austin a wealthy area and they're drilling wells I mean Lindsey
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.520]  this is crazy oh yeah this is the people are waking up but you better wake up
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.840]  more and please don't let them pass any mortgage back security bill I keep
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:50.000]  stressing this please forgive me Alex for saying this so many times in one
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.520]  program I sound like a broken record over the weekend what I have found out
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.720]  from these people please please please please don't let them bail out the
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.720]  elitist and give them two to twelve trillion dollars of your money between
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:08.920]  November and January anything else from Tennessee no I just wanted your input
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.120]  as to if you thought it was a bad financial decision to start farming at
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:16.800]  this point well ma'am I don't know your financial I don't know your financial
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.080]  situation but it sounds like an investment to have cows and all that if
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.640]  you don't have any money but you can certainly you know just get back to the
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:31.080]  land and you'll live in a meager way and they and look 90% of the public in the
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:36.200]  Great Depression or about 89% lived in rural areas and were somewhat
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:41.600]  self-sufficient now 90% right at 90 are urban are not self-sufficient if 7
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.520]  million people starve to death one way or the other according to major university
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:48.760]  studies during the 10-year Great Depression with 90% being self-sufficient
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.520]  or quasi-self-sufficient what's gonna happen now this is their plan for

[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.120]  hours sleep I'm not complaining I'm just kind of worried about tonight but I'm
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:04.720]  sure I'll pull it through and speak for four hours but Sheriff Richard Max gonna
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.640]  pop by who's in town Joe Bannister former Treasury agent we had Dr. Stan
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.160]  Montee for there last night here in beautiful Santa Cruz but going back to
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:20.320]  Lindsay Williams you know it as I say every day it's one thing to
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:28.960]  intellectually know that all of this is real but then it's another thing to
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:34.280]  actually see it unfold and I wanted to briefly get Bill Graff who works here at
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:38.760]  K SEO as the engineer just before I go back to Lindsay Williams you've been
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:42.640]  sitting here for about an hour listening to Lindsay do you have any questions or
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:47.440]  comments for Lindsay Williams well I live on a family farm I my father grows
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:55.400]  apples and sells them to a big company in locally based company Martinelli
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.040]  sparkling cider so our apples are actually sent out in you know and
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:04.120]  consumed by the world that's my favorite apple just yeah and and so you know when
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:09.040]  I hear that they're gonna tell us that we can't grow our own food that kind of
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:15.800]  scares me and it brings up something that I wonder about you know my dad's
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:20.040]  almost 80 years old now and somebody tells him he can't grow his own food
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.880]  he's well I don't know what his reaction is gonna be but I know what my
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.360]  reaction would be I tend to tell him to get the hell off my property or I'll
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:31.560]  shoot him well well if you read the bill it's well we're gonna come to
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:36.200]  inspections and there's gonna be fees and you've got to put in all this process
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:41.920]  and pay all these new taxes or we'll shut you down and so in effect the way it
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.720]  stated I've had lawyers on and in Congress people to go over the bill on
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:50.200]  air if that's what it says in effect that it's a felony if you don't do
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:54.840]  everything the way we say and the law is written to give the Food and Drug
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  Administration just unlimited power to make up whatever they want well what do
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:02.120]  you tell the people though let me it let me just add by ants trying to answer
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:06.760]  your question let me ask a question what are you gonna tell all the small
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:10.800]  growers who grow apples and I'm just using this as an example because is
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.200]  what I know about who grow apples for Martinelli Martinelli buys apples from
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.680]  all the local growers are very proud of the fact that they don't buy apples from
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:21.200]  anywhere else they've been there for a hundred plus years yeah and and they're
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.160]  all organic and they're you know that they just do a great job of mixing
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:29.080]  and this is designed to destroy that for the few good companies that actually do
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:33.320]  buy from the locals well but what do you tell this company who's a worldwide
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:38.260]  company now they grow apples okay they're not now a thing Google Martinelli
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:43.600]  fluoride they just had a big fight begging the town not the Florida day and
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:46.060]  the government came and said we'll give you a million bucks to put in a
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:49.040]  filtration system because they were lobbying to not have the water Florida
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:51.480]  and the government's trying to make them Florida day the apples you should
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.680]  hear about that yeah and there I think Martinelli's also exploring
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:58.680]  possibilities of growing of drilling your own well and everything so you know
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.160]  that's the way to go your take on that Lindsay Williams
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:07.240]  the leaders are going to do everything they do very slowly very gradually they
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:11.880]  don't want you to jump out of the saddle you give you this rule today and that
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.280]  rule tomorrow something else next day something has got to make the American
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:20.680]  people so mad that literally they won't jump out of the saddle before these
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:24.760]  people have time to pull the string folks you have heard an urgency in my
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.680]  voice today that you've never heard before because of what I've been told
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.000]  this weekend you have got to take action and don't let them put in one little
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.040]  bitty rule after the other until you may total show you I want to go back to
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:42.160]  calls with Lindsay Williams we're running out of time here but briefly
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.440]  Lindsay anything else he told you in yesterday's discussion when he asked
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.280]  you reportedly two weeks to live but you know that they could be wrong about
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.640]  that it could be a month it could be a year it could be tomorrow anything else
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.880]  that he told you that you can talk about that people need to hear I converted one
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:05.200]  one expression very easily get ready get prepared do what's necessary you need
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.160]  to know what to do most people don't know what to do and how to go about it
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:13.360]  well that's the very reason that for the first time in all my years I have
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.840]  finally told you what to do 15 things that I would you presentation but I tell
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:22.600]  you what you can do in relation to what the leadership told me they're going to
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.560]  do you've got to take the responsibility for yourself get out of this
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:33.640]  dollar crisis have a loophole be ahead all these things and basically what he
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:40.080]  has said is be prepared and you've got to know how to do this preparation and
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:44.080]  that's the same thing the Palatano same thing the Palatano saying let's talk
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:50.600]  to Kyle in Iowa you're on the air with Lindsay Williams hello Alex hello Lindsay
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.920]  I kind of want to just make a general comment and then get Lindsay's take on
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:58.440]  it I've called in and made this point before in your show Alex it's been a
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:03.600]  while since I have called in but throughout history anytime there's a
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:09.840]  consolidation of power they always turn around and hang a group of themselves
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.600]  essentially to point the finger like all these are the bad guys we got them they
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:19.040]  caused this crisis so that way they could pose as you know the saviors oh we
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:23.760]  just got the bad guys who caused all this but now we have all this power have
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:28.560]  they stated and maybe you can't talk about this but do they already have
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:35.040]  plans to say hang the neocons or hang the Neolibs or because they're gonna
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:42.040]  they're gonna murk 50 to 70% of the people who help them get here to this
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.680]  point they don't have a choice because heads are gonna have to roll and if
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:49.000]  they want to keep power they're gonna have to do that in order to placate the
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.680]  people or have they just not thought about that and they'll figure it out
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:58.360]  after afterwards well there is one thing they have said and this is so
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:03.360]  relates to the Alex Jones show they have said to me we must have our national
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.480]  media in order to be able to carry out what we want in the new world order and
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:12.000]  this will be very encouraging to you Alex especially the last thing that they
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.600]  are going to bring total control on is radio talk shows now this has been
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:20.800]  positively stated and they know that they can't control if they control you
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:24.520]  they're gonna have control the nation some control factors who they put in on
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:29.480]  the national media so you'll be out there as long as anybody Alex so we're the
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:33.760]  last in line you're the last in line they will get you be assured of that
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.240]  but you'll be the last in line and you'll be there as long as anybody else
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.080]  because they can't control the liberal media they know control factors will be
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:46.720]  put on them if they put any on you therefore you're gonna be out there as
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:51.160]  long as anybody and I'll make you promise I promise you that in the next two
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.440]  three weeks time anytime I mean you listen to the Alex Jones show every
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.400]  single day please everybody out there you're listening audience listen every
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.440]  single day to the Alex Jones show don't miss it and I promise you in the next
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.760]  two to three weeks anything that it's passed on to me before before the
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:14.080]  expiration I will call it Alex producer and say I've got something startling I
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:19.520]  want to say it all right I hope that answers your question Kyle in Iowa does
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.760]  that answer your question well yes and no because they you know I mean and maybe
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:28.400]  he doesn't have the answer but I didn't know if they already have their guns
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.040]  pointed at some of their own people because whoever is foolish enough to
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.640]  help bring this in and if I can actually make this statement too that the people
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:39.360]  who are running this country right now are at least who appear to be to the
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.080]  military industrial complex that have the semblance of actually having power not
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.840]  that they really do if they would just take control of that and actually save
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:50.720]  this country they can actually save themselves but I know they well no
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.680]  that's a key point in fact that was the end of my speech last night and I
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.880]  appreciate the call Kyle at the end of my speech I made the point that a lot of
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.920]  elitist who are very high level do not like this and they're figuring out how
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.040]  dangerous it is how destructive it is and that that very you know avarice
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.000]  filled spirit that that empowers and animates the globalist it isn't going
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.040]  to stop ever I mean there's no end it's kind of like Stalin no one opposing him
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.040]  and he kills tens of millions of Russians and Ukrainians it's like
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:22.040]  Hitler they just want more more more it's what they do they enjoy it their
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:26.400]  psychopaths let's talk to Weston in Missouri Weston you're on the air with
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:33.000]  Lindsay Williams go ahead hey Alex I'd just like to say thank you to yourself
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.440]  as well as Alan Watt for waking me up man thank you personally we got about a
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:41.920]  minute and a half you got a question okay I got I got one question here okay
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.800]  mr. Williams that the dollar is dead in 2012 how can a lower middle class person
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:52.040]  prepare for this Gordon Silver I've already been told that they
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:57.640]  positively must get it and at that point then whatever a new exchange medium is
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.880]  you can exchange it for that because by that time Golden Silver the girls going
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:08.680]  to be up to two and three thousand dollars an ounce okay but the poor man's
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:12.840]  gold is silver you know five bucks announced ten years ago twenty four
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:17.920]  dollars an ounce today and it's not that the gold is is appreciating or the
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.080]  silver is it's at the dollar's been devalued and so as the dollars devalued
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:26.000]  you can later cash Golden Silver in for whatever the currency is or whatever
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.560]  value it has it's not a lot of people get goals and investment oh look it's up
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:32.880]  four times what it was the last ten years that's not the reason I hold
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:36.520]  Golden Silver it's an emergency backup for food and water it's an emergency
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:43.320]  backup for my radio show and not much of it we couldn't run long you know so the
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.640]  point is we're going into a design depression if we get the word out and
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:50.120]  expose these bankers they may slow down and back off but if we don't have the
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:54.360]  political will to say hey stop what you're doing now they're going all the
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:57.640]  way look how bold they are Lindsey Williams do one more segment with us

[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.800]  very pleasant as a result I do not have a whip yeah that's why we've got to move
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:44.720]  materials from time to time that's why we got to move quick but I mean to be
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:49.840]  clear you do one thing Alex and is our list no appreciate this during the
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.200]  commercial break I just decided I need to get one more thing yeah there's a lot
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:58.760]  that I could say I'll agree with you Alex oh please listen to this carefully
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:05.000]  everybody out there I had to contemplate what I want to say this or not both of
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.960]  the mr. X's of my book energy and on crisis have came down with horrible
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:16.760]  types of cancer malignancy I don't know whether this has happened so they have
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:22.120]  given me information over the years both of them nearly died what I don't want to
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.680]  they always are toast treatment in Mexico and was cured the other one has a
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:31.320]  son who's a doctor and they convinced him to go the conventional method in
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:35.160]  America and now he's expected to die within the next two weeks I will do
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:41.040]  this for those of you who know anyone who has a malignancy I will car my 800
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:44.840]  service after this program and give them the phone number where you
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:51.520]  positively can be cured of malignancy and whether this was by chance but both of
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:55.080]  the mr. X's of my book energy and on crisis came down with some of the worst
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:00.480]  forms of cancer one of them's cured now because of the Alice Arcos treatment in
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.440]  Mexico which was given a refill I think in Spain and now of course the other one
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.360]  that is dying we got to move quick here let's do a couple more calls that we
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:15.120]  have time let's talk to Ryan and Arizona you're on the air Ryan hey how you
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:21.840]  doing Alex good nice to speak with you Lindsay again I really appreciate you as
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:29.360]  a beacon of truth I think that your start you know as a public access TV
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.560]  where you're at today is a you know a testament to how powerful the truth can
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:39.760]  be if you work hard and put in the time and effort and I'd like to ask Lindsay
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:46.840]  I'm a me and my wife are both educators here in Arizona and we've been trying to
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:51.560]  prepare as best we can it's you know it's pretty hard you know when you're
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:56.960]  making like low 30s paying for rent and all the other utilities trying to
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:03.640]  actually save up some money and my wife currently has a trust one that her
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:07.760]  parents have set up but she's not able to touch it for a few more years and I
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:12.240]  tried to convince her parents to get into gold silver and other you know
[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:16.640]  precious metals that are actually tangible that they can own and actually
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:20.520]  possess and not have to worry about you know being invested in the stock market
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:25.880]  and all of a sudden the dollar crashes in your portfolios worth nothing you
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:30.920]  know depend on is the golden silver they have all of these other funds they
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.680]  may or may not be there and even if they are what are they going to be worth
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:38.680]  whenever our present currency collapses and then how would you change them over
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:47.360]  to the value of the new currency exactly so your insider friend mention
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:51.960]  where or what kind of a is it going to be a global currency maybe at North
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:57.920]  American currency we already have a global currency it's called the SDR and
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.080]  it's above the other currencies it will just control all your regional currencies
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:05.680]  when you read about the G20 with coordinated evaluation that is the
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.320]  global government it's a digital cashless currency amongst themselves but
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.760]  over time they're just going to go to a global cashless thumbprint face scan
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.720]  system that's their plan they'll bypass it all and then finally just get rid of
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.040]  your regional currencies all together but the world government is all ready
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:32.760]  here and I appreciate your call there Ryan Ramon Al Lori Bill will get to you
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:36.200]  but Lindsay Williams has got to go Lindsay I appreciate you coming on with

[02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:03.720]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:08.160]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:12.160]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:16.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:20.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:24.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:28.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:32.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:40.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:43.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:19.840]  what do I say I will never surrender who are you yeah I'm that voice inside
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:24.960]  your head I'm the enemy
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.840]  yeah
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:10.580]  pretend what have I said
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:17.580]  You're the pretender! What am I saying? I'll never surrender!
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:25.580]  That's the key. We can try to get farms and hide out and get ready. That's only one part of the equation.
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:30.580]  The other part is getting out there and saying, that's the criminals. They're the tyranny.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:36.580]  Those are the bad guys. That's the problem. Right there. That's how we stop this globalist takeover.
[02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:43.580]  We've got our fight and spirit back. The globalists have tried to sell us that it's some type of attribute to be cynical and not involved.
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:50.580]  But that's only so they can isolate you in a whole nation of people that don't care about each other, so we can all be isolated and controlled.
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:57.580]  Now, I've got Michael Swirling in here who worked here when he was in high school and now is the owner for many years of K.S.C.O.
[02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:07.580]  AM1080 here in Santa Cruz blasting out all over the state and of course they also have K.O.M.Y. AM1340 and we're on both those stations.
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:13.580]  We're on K.O.M.Y. during the day and at night on K.S.C.O., some of our great affiliates here.
[02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:18.580]  But I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson in because I'm always talking up at the Minnesota studios.
[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:26.580]  I'm in the Texas studios but Ted came down here to hang out with me this weekend and Ted, I'm glad we got to hook up here.
[02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:30.580]  Oh, it's great and it's really awesome to be just sitting right next to you, Alex.
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:35.580]  It's been so long since we've seen each other and what a great day to do it.
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:38.580]  Gold is running up like crazy. The G20, you're talking about the...
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:41.580]  When was the last time I saw you in person? Was it with a Ventura, Willie Nelson time?
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:43.580]  Yeah, we came down for that concert.
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:44.580]  Time flies.
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:49.580]  It sure does. I mean, that's when you had a little tiny baby and it was just you could hold them in the arms one arm easily.
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:53.580]  And now that little girl's running around, you can talk to her and she's just raising Kane at home, isn't she?
[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:54.580]  Time flies.
[02:35:54.580 --> 02:35:56.580]  Yeah, it sure does.
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:59.580]  You know, you're talking about the globalists and what's going on.
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:03.580]  The G20 right now is really messing with the US dollar.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.580]  I mean, like the other countries are teaming up to drive the United States dollar down.
[02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:10.580]  And that's the reason why we're having the flop right now.
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:13.580]  The dollar is falling and we're seeing gold rise back up again.
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:15.580]  Everybody was backing away from gold.
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:16.580]  It was all over.
[02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:22.580]  The country had solved all of its economic problems and gold was going to go down back to that $400 an ounce.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.580]  Well, this happens every two weeks.
[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:26.580]  It sure does. And now it's going back up again.
[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:32.580]  Of course, today, gold is at a high of $13.4790 already, almost $13.50 an ounce.
[02:36:32.580 --> 02:36:35.580]  I mean, we were sitting at $13.20 something.
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:38.580]  And that's because they announced more dollar devaluation.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.580]  Exactly. And that's coming right out of the G20.
[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:42.580]  And of course, Bloomberg, I mean, here's a headline right here.
[02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:48.580]  Gold gains as dollar drops, palladium sores to highest level since 2001.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:53.580]  You don't look at a weekly graph, not even a monthly graph, you look at a yearly graph.
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:55.580]  And if you look at a graph, it's going straight up.
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:57.580]  Yeah, it sure is.
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:06.580]  And if people want to take advantage of it, I tell you, we dropped the franc down to $296 an ounce.
[02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:12.580]  You get the full year of the International Forecaster, which is $159 value so you can see.
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:14.580]  That's a great deal on that coin, even without the newsletter.
[02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:16.580]  It is without the newsletter.
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:18.580]  But the thing about it is, I mean, people need to own gold.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:21.580]  They need to start considering gold instead of paper.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:23.580]  What about folks that want to get into silver?
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:24.580]  A lot of experts say that's the sleeper.
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.580]  What's your deal on those silver half dollars?
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:27.580]  Well, that's the thing, Alex.
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:31.580]  The walking Liberty halves are at $13 and some odd cents.
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:33.580]  I can't remember what the change number is.
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:39.580]  But right now, I'm 1333 and I'm trading them right now at $11.77.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:41.580]  So that is just spectacular.
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:45.580]  And I know there's a lot of new listeners with the KCSO audience here.
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:51.580]  We're looking at $26.45 for the creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:54.580]  That's the best book on the Fed out there, bar none.
[02:37:54.580 --> 02:38:01.580]  And when we put the full silver dollar in there, the coin that was used back at the turn of the century is money.
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:05.580]  Yeah, those are going for about $25 a piece and then a $19.95 book.
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:09.580]  And so you're selling this for $19.95, six bucks shipping.
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:11.580]  So you're basically losing 20, 30 bucks on this.
[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:13.580]  Yeah, that's what's going on with that.
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:17.580]  But I mean, what a great way to get involved in the precious metals market.
[02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:21.580]  It's a great way for us to introduce you to Maitis resources.
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:24.580]  And you'll have a book.
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:29.580]  By the time you get done reading this book and if you have any hair left on your head,
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:32.580]  then you might be considering buying gold and silver.
[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:34.580]  It's just one of those things.
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.580]  Merlin's in her shooting a YouTube video.
[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:37.580]  Yeah, here he is.
[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:38.580]  We're going to be on that.
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:40.580]  I guess we'll be posted up on the internet.
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:45.580]  But anyways, Alex, all I can say is that it's just one of those times where, you know,
[02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:49.580]  we've had the market drop, people get the opportunity to buy for some reason.
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.580]  And I wish people would stop doing this.
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:54.580]  It would make it more difficult for me to offer great deals.
[02:38:54.580 --> 02:38:56.580]  But people quit buying when the market goes down.
[02:38:56.580 --> 02:38:57.580]  And I don't know why that is.
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:38:59.580]  I step in and I buy.
[02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:03.580]  I've got, of course, I talk to you, it's between you and me,
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:08.580]  but there will be some new coins coming out that support the campaign for Liberty very soon.
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:10.580]  As soon as I get that stop.
[02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:12.580]  Bottom line, though, people can buy when it's high,
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.580]  but buy at the old low price because you don't go up,
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:17.580]  even though the market goes up until you sell out of the coins.
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:23.580]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:25.580]  Call Midas Resources today.
[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:27.580]  A great sponsor of the show, but quite frankly,
[02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:29.580]  they're in much sponsorship at these prices.
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:31.580]  This is a loss of leader, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:36.580]  800-686-2237 or MidasResources.com.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:41.580]  And they've got all the gold news and information up there also at GCNLive.com.
[02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:48.580]  Ted, on a side issue, the FreedomWorks Tea Party website got hacked and taken down last week.
[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:52.580]  And I didn't even know about that on Friday until they brought it in late in the show.
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:54.580]  I had known you'd called me that morning.
[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:56.580]  You were already in California.
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:59.580]  And I talked to your engineer and your web people.
[02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:01.580]  They got somehow the code.
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:02.580]  They broke the code.
[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:03.580]  They got into the server.
[02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:04.580]  They destroyed the server.
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:07.580]  And you guys have got the site almost completely back up right now.
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:10.580]  You're just trying to get the WordPress reloaded and things at GCNLive.com.
[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:13.580]  And then we had a bunch of our streams go down that night.
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:15.580]  And we're not the types of folks.
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:17.580]  Every time we have an internet problem, say we were hacked.
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:19.580]  I mean, I have web experts.
[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:22.580]  I have people, engineers on this.
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:27.580]  We've had people hack in years ago and post a naked lady on a motorcycle.
[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:29.580]  I mean, these are actual hack attacks.
[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.580]  And we've built up systems to try to block that.
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:35.580]  But it's interesting that we got attacked at the same time they did.
[02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:39.580]  And it just shows that this whole crowd of globalists are really getting concerned.
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:42.580]  So what ended up happening without attack on the servers?
[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:44.580]  Well, it was definitely a cyber attack.
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:45.580]  There's no question about it.
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:47.580]  And I think it was a government thing too.
[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:54.580]  I think it's an ops thing, Alex, because they attacked the Liberty-minded type people.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:58.580]  I mean, that's why I called you just to warn you that there's something going on with me.
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.580]  They may be hitting infowars.com.
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:04.580]  Of course, none of us want to ever see that go down.
[02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:05.580]  But they did.
[02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:07.580]  They came in and they hit the first server.
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:12.580]  They put in some code that would harvest the passwords.
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:14.580]  And then they passed the passwords back.
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:18.580]  And after that, it was just a matter of installing some malicious software.
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:22.580]  And it started to attack our servers.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:24.580]  We've had our YouTube channels hacked.
[02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:28.580]  So it's a shame that that stuff happens, but it does.
[02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:33.580]  It gives us a lesson on how security works and how much more secure we need to be.
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:36.580]  The point is a lot of people don't want this information getting out.
[02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:41.580]  Folks, if you want to take advantage of those golden silver deals, 800-686-2237.
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:42.580]  I'd get involved today.
[02:41:42.580 --> 02:41:45.580]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:47.580]  In closing, Ted, what did you think of the event last night?
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:48.580]  Oh, the event was awesome.
[02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:49.580]  And the people loved you, Alex.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.580]  And of course, we really loved the people.
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:56.580]  I was just so grateful to see that group come up and to have the support that we have.
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:57.580]  It's humbling.
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:00.580]  And it's exciting at the same time.
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:05.580]  It kind of freaks me out, though, to have people looking at me like a mother Teresa or something.
[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:07.580]  I don't like it, quite frankly.
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:14.580]  I mean, I like great folks coming out that people are like, oh, please, we're hoping you're our only hope.
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:17.580]  And I'm like, if I'm our only hope, we're in deep trouble.
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:19.580]  And I'm not Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:23.580]  Those nice women were like, Obi-Wan Kenobi, literally, save us.
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:28.580]  I was just like, I mean, four hours of me, I was like, these people must be sick of this.
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:30.580]  They're like, no, Maura, don't leave.
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:33.580]  Yeah, there was definitely innovation, and they wanted Maura, yeah.
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:36.580]  I'm really looking forward to tonight.
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.580]  Sold out crowd both nights.
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:40.580]  We probably could do a third night and sell it out again.
[02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:43.580]  You know, that's how big this has become.
[02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:45.580]  That's how important liberty is.
[02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:49.580]  Well, we were having events with 1,200, 1,400 people five, six years ago.
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:53.580]  So I just don't do these events because I'm so tied down on the films, the news websites, what we're doing.
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:57.580]  Ted Anderson, look forward to talking to you again, hanging out with you tonight.
[02:42:57.580 --> 02:42:58.580]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:42:58.580 --> 02:42:59.580]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:00.580]  You bet. That's Ted Anderson.
[02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:02.580]  Now, I could spend five hours with this guy.
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:07.580]  Unfortunately, we only have about 12 minutes left in total broadcast time with Michael Swirling.
[02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:12.580]  Michael, why don't you get up on that microphone there?
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:17.580]  MZ, MZ, briefly tell folks about your history in radio and KSCO,
[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:20.580]  and how the towers are built out over the ocean.
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:25.580]  I mean, this is a really neat place, and how this is the only RCA modeled, you know,
[02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:30.580]  building built just for a radio station in the country, and the event,
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:34.580]  and then you take politically on what's happening in the world.
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:38.580]  Nice to be on your show, Obi-Wan Kejones.
[02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:43.580]  And Swirling's got his iPhone over here videotaping this while he's on air,
[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:48.580]  and he's got Target, what do they call that in the military?
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:53.580]  Target psychosis, because fighter pilots in World War II would be flying in,
[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:58.580]  shooting up a train or a troop column, and they would just keep flying
[02:43:58.580 --> 02:44:02.580]  and then just run right into the target, because they were so focused on shooting at the target.
[02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:05.580]  And Swirling has handed over the video camera. Go ahead.
[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:08.580]  Okay, so where do we start? The history of KSCO?
[02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:09.580]  Yes.
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:17.580]  Okay, it was built in 1947 to RCA specifications to be a radio station.
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:22.580]  I don't know if there are any other buildings left like this that are operating radio stations in the United States.
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:23.580]  The answer is no.
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:24.580]  Bill says no, and he would say no.
[02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:27.580]  You guys got the traffic news guy in here. You said he's been here 40 years.
[02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:29.580]  Don Hising's running the board in the main control room.
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:31.580]  He's been here. He's in his 45th year.
[02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:36.580]  Yeah, Don was here when I was a high school guy running Santa Cruz High School.
[02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:43.580]  I don't know what Don's eating and drinking. That guy looks like he's injecting growth hormone with a turkey baster.
[02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:46.580]  I mean, he looks like he's in good shape.
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:49.580]  And the lady on the lower right behind the window.
[02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:50.580]  Oh, that's your mother.
[02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:52.580]  Yeah, there's Kay of Kayis Commentary.
[02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:55.580]  She's the reason behind my love of talk radio.
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:45:03.580]  She used to wake us kids up with a house intercom to talk radio, and I became addicted to it.
[02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:08.580]  And I always thought that this radio station, which was sort of an old, foggy music station, right?
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:09.580]  Watch it now.
[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:10.580]  Okay, all right.
[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:11.580]  Kayis, right.
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:13.580]  Montavani music and so forth.
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:14.580]  Nothing very exciting.
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:18.580]  We had a program when I came to work here as the last hire of the original owner.
[02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:19.580]  That's how long I've been here.
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:23.580]  We had a program called Music for Dining.
[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:25.580]  Music in a quiet mood.
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:27.580]  It was like a French rock.
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:32.580]  We would announce it like this, you know.
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.580]  I'm serious.
[02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:34.580]  It was wild.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:35.580]  Yeah.
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:37.580]  The old, the guy who built the radio station.
[02:45:37.580 --> 02:45:39.580]  I saw some Pavarotti records back there too.
[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:40.580]  No.
[02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:46.580]  We carried the New York Metropolitan Opera live.
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:53.580]  That was a 45-minute process to hook it up on balanced pair lines all the way from New York.
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:55.580]  It's Target Narcosis, excuse me.
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:56.580]  It was wild.
[02:45:56.580 --> 02:46:04.580]  And Michael, of course, tells the great story of being on the Santa Cruz High School radio
[02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:08.580]  program that the original owner, Vernon, provided to the high school.
[02:46:08.580 --> 02:46:10.580]  They had her own show.
[02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:14.580]  For kids who are interested in future careers in broadcasting, when there actually were
[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:15.580]  some careers in broadcasting.
[02:46:15.580 --> 02:46:16.580]  Yeah.
[02:46:16.580 --> 02:46:17.580]  And Michael got on.
[02:46:17.580 --> 02:46:21.580]  And actually, it's a widely known misquote.
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:24.580]  He didn't actually make a flatulence noise.
[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:29.580]  He actually made what was a raspberry, but the boss thought it was a flatulent noise.
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:30.580]  Would you like to hear the noise?
[02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:31.580]  I could do it again.
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:32.580]  Sure.
[02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:33.580]  40-something years later.
[02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:34.580]  Now we're coming out.
[02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:35.580]  I'm going to turn it down while you do it.
[02:46:35.580 --> 02:46:36.580]  Go ahead.
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:38.580]  That's all it was.
[02:46:38.580 --> 02:46:39.580]  That's all.
[02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:40.580]  I thought we'd done the best show ever.
[02:46:40.580 --> 02:46:41.580]  But you showed them.
[02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:42.580]  You now on the stations.
[02:46:42.580 --> 02:46:45.580]  I told the guy right when he came in and said, Swirling, you're through.
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:47.580]  You don't make a fart noise on KSCO.
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:49.580]  I said, hey, I'm sounding like you a little bit here.
[02:46:49.580 --> 02:46:52.580]  But you don't make a fart noise on KSCO.
[02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:54.580]  And you're finished.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:57.580]  And I said, oh, I never liked Mr. Berlin very much.
[02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:00.580]  And I figure I had nothing to lose, so I told him off.
[02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:06.580]  And everybody else who was on the staff resigned in protest.
[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:07.580]  The high school staff.
[02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:08.580]  So I felt good.
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:09.580]  The high school staff.
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:10.580]  It was really good.
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:12.580]  I'm going to own this place.
[02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:14.580]  So it took about 26 years after that.
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:19.580]  But then that was 1991 when I had the opportunity to purchase the radio station here.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:20.580]  And check this out.
[02:47:20.580 --> 02:47:22.580]  Here's the other fact that's just mind blowing.
[02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:26.580]  The station went on the air on September 21, 1947.
[02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:29.580]  And it's in the entire existence.
[02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:35.580]  It's only had three owners, two of which are families, local families.
[02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:36.580]  A wild.
[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:37.580]  It's a wild history.
[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:39.580]  No, this is classic radio.
[02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:41.580]  It looks like the studio you've got the old signs out front.
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:42.580]  Yeah.
[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:47.580]  The studio you're sitting in has hosted Woody Herman and the Thundering Heard, the Glenn
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:53.580]  Miller Orchestra, Hilo Hattie, a really bunch of famous, famous people have played in this
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:54.580]  studio, played music.
[02:47:54.580 --> 02:48:01.580]  And also, you've got a lot of locals here who are very well known like Clint Eastwood
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:02.580]  that are listeners.
[02:48:02.580 --> 02:48:06.580]  I don't know how much Clint listens, but he certainly can if he wants to.
[02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:07.580]  Well, you said you've talked to him.
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:08.580]  I talked with him once.
[02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:09.580]  I wanted to get it.
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:10.580]  Twice.
[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:11.580]  We've done.
[02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:12.580]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:13.580]  Twice.
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:14.580]  He said Ronald Reagan was his favorite president.
[02:48:14.580 --> 02:48:15.580]  That's right.
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:19.580]  We've done events with the SPCA and another listener on the other side of the bay.
[02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:20.580]  MZ is just...
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:21.580]  Doris Day.
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:23.580]  Doris Day is just not bragging now.
[02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:24.580]  No, no, no.
[02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:25.580]  This is the coolest thing.
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:30.980]  I've tried for years to get Doris Day on the radio, and we found a way to do it.
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.340]  We had to go because she's an Aminal lover, I say.
[02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:34.580]  She's a fan of your mom, isn't she?
[02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:35.580]  Yeah.
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:36.580]  Big time.
[02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:37.580]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:44.580]  We finally got her on for about 10 minutes, and I thought we were going to talk about Aminals.
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:46.580]  All Doris Day wanted to talk about was my mom.
[02:48:46.580 --> 02:48:47.580]  Tell your mother I love her.
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:49.580]  Give her a big hug for me.
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:51.580]  She likes my mom's commentaries.
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:53.580]  I felt great.
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:49:02.580]  So anyhow, I always wanted KSCO to be a voice for everyone, and I think it's become a voice for everyone.
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:07.580]  Well, also, you know, a lot of stations are picking up the show. It's accelerated, especially in the last year.
[02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:11.580]  But I remember you going back two years ago thinking about putting me on, and you got a lot of heat doing it,
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:14.580]  but it's turned out to be really good, and last night was an amazing spectacle.
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:15.580]  Yeah.
[02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:16.580]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:17.580]  So it's great, Alex.
[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:20.580]  Yeah, there's nothing but good stuff ahead, I think.
[02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:24.580]  Except we just talked about the whole world going to Hades in a handbasket.
[02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:29.580]  Well, but I think there's nothing but good stuff ahead because what I saw last night,
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:33.580]  and these are people from all walks of life. They're not in any particular group.
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:34.580]  It's a very wide strata.
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:35.580]  A total.
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:38.580]  And that was very gratifying to me.
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:46.580]  I think the more people that get the word and get the idea that it's a planned meltdown,
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:49.580]  I think that part is important.
[02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:50.580]  I think it's key.
[02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:51.580]  Yeah.
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:52.580]  And it is planned.
[02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:54.580]  I mean, that came out in the Goldman Sachs Timberwolfe emails.
[02:49:54.580 --> 02:49:59.580]  Well, you just listened to your last guest for 45 minutes, and to tell you the truth,
[02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:03.580]  Alex, I'd never heard him before. I guess I've missed all the shows where he's been
[02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:06.580]  on, but that dude is scary.
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:13.580]  I mean, he's got the inside track from some people who know and you listen to him, and
[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:14.580]  he's scary.
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:17.580]  You know, that stuff he's talking about is, you know, that's not fun.
[02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:20.580]  Well, but it's right here in the headlines as well, unfortunately.
[02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:24.580]  And it's funny, though, how you don't pick it up. I mean, even though you read the separate
[02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:28.580]  stories that you don't put it all together until you hear somebody like him put it together
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:30.580]  and need to go, whoa.
[02:50:30.580 --> 02:50:31.580]  That's.
[02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:32.580]  Wow.
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:35.580]  I guess that's what the event last night and tonight are all about.
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:37.580]  Well, the good news is there is a huge awakening.
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:40.580]  America and the world is awakened as a bigger presence.
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:43.580]  He said a few months ago, but it's like you just woke up from a sleep.
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:44.580]  You're still getting your bearings.
[02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:47.580]  Your energy has an awful lot to do with that.
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:50.580]  Now, I know you think the world of Dr. Stan Monteith as do I.
[02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:51.580]  We've got to go to break, sir.
[02:50:51.580 --> 02:50:52.580]  Okay.
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:53.580]  We'll come right back, sir.
[02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:54.580]  We'll go there.
[02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:55.580]  Okay.
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:51:00.580]  With M.Z., the owner of 1080K S.C.O., and of course, K.O.M.Y.A.M.1340.
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:01.580]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:06.580]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:07.580]  What have we got?
[02:51:07.580 --> 02:51:09.580]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:13.580]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:51:13.580 --> 02:51:17.580]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:19.580]  So they think they own our land.
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:23.580]  They think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:27.580]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:31.580]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:32.580]  You're being warned.
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:33.580]  We have the facts.
[02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:34.580]  We have the constitution.
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:35.580]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:36.580]  We have common law.
[02:51:36.580 --> 02:51:40.580]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:41.580]  Don't tread on me.
[02:51:41.580 --> 02:51:42.580]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:47.580]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:49.580]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:51:49.580 --> 02:51:50.580]  Don't tread on me.

[02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:18.580]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:24.580]  So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:27.580]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.

[02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:42.580]  This was the only one in 2010 so far.
[02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:47.580]  We've been lucky to keep our prices the same since 2008, but who knows what the future will bring.

[02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:11.580]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:13.580 --> 02:54:16.580]  Carrashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:22.580]  I just want to say great job to the crew of the Minnesota and the crew in Austin, Texas and the great crew down here at KSCO.
[02:54:22.580 --> 02:54:24.580]  We're almost out of time.
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:27.580]  I'm always speaking tonight and then back to Austin tomorrow.
[02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:30.580]  And these are times that try men's souls.
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:32.580]  It was the best of times, the worst of times.
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:35.580]  We don't know how good liberty is until we start to lose it.
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:41.580]  So we have talked about some depressing issues, but facing these will let us have a fighting chance against it.
[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:44.580]  Michael Zwirling, you got interrupted by the break.
[02:54:44.580 --> 02:54:46.580]  You were talking about Dr. Stan Montief.
[02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:48.580]  And this was in very good times, Alex.
[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:53.580]  I've known Dr. Stan for about 42 years in high school.
[02:54:53.580 --> 02:54:57.580]  When I was a senior in high school, he had to take high school government, which I wasn't happy about.
[02:54:57.580 --> 02:55:01.580]  But my teacher, Mr. Bob Listener, was great.
[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:02.580]  He was fantastic.
[02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:03.580]  He made it so interesting.
[02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:06.580]  He would expose us to every position.
[02:55:06.580 --> 02:55:09.580]  He would send us to an ACLU meeting one night for homework.
[02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:13.580]  And then the next day, he would have Dr. Stan Montief come and talk to our class.
[02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:20.580]  And we always believed that Dr. Stan was an amazing orator and speaker.
[02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:29.580]  But we would sort of roll our eyes and look at each other about the stuff that he was saying and predicting 40 plus years ago.
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:32.580]  And man, was he right on.
[02:55:32.580 --> 02:55:33.580]  Was he right on.
[02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:35.580]  And he was there 81 last night.
[02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:36.580]  Yeah, he showed up.
[02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:37.580]  Very distinguished gentlemen.
[02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:39.580]  And we hope he'll show up tonight.
[02:55:39.580 --> 02:55:41.580]  I've talked with him on the telephone today.
[02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:46.580]  And there's a chance he'll show up tonight, although he does have to get on the radio to do his own radio.
[02:55:46.580 --> 02:55:50.580]  One of his own several hours that he does daily.
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:51.580]  And I think he's on.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:52.580]  He's on Genesis.
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:53.580]  Yeah.
[02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:58.580]  So anyhow, yeah, Dr. Stan is right here in Santa Cruz and KSEO land.
[02:55:58.580 --> 02:56:00.580]  And it's pretty amazing.
[02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:06.580]  But what you're doing, because of you, you understand the power of new media.
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:13.580]  That that's so many people that the broadcast industry and Ted does too, by the way, that the broadcast industry does not understand.
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:14.580]  They're clueless.
[02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:15.580]  They have no idea.
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:18.580]  They have no idea what the power of new media is.
[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:19.580]  Although they say they do.
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:29.580]  They all have fancy websites that they've hired some corporate company that just stamps them out, you know, and it's just like there's there's nothing there.
[02:56:29.580 --> 02:56:32.580]  There's there's no heart and soul, you know, in any gallery.
[02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:34.580]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:39.580]  So we're very proud of being local and original.
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:42.580]  And yeah, I mean, it'd be nice.
[02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:56.580]  I mean, we may well be doing some programming with Genesis, but we want to do our best to keep the programming, the live and local, you know, connect with the audience type programming that you've been able to do very efficiently.
[02:56:56.580 --> 02:57:00.580]  I have to say KSEO is what talk radio really should be.
[02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:01.580]  Yeah.
[02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:08.580]  And because being in the last few days, you'd be able to hear all the incredibly diverse people you have one, especially your weekend lineup.
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:14.580]  And of course, not just KSEO, but KOMY 1340 and the websites KSEO.com.
[02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:15.580]  Yeah.
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:21.580]  So and the other thing at this first time, first time we've ever used our website to sell all the tickets.
[02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:23.580]  I said, that's the only way you can get tickets.
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:25.580]  Just go to KSEO.com and click on the banner.
[02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:27.580]  And everybody did that.
[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:38.580]  And we were able to get an electronic list just like the airlines, you know, I can't remember the last time I got a paper ticket from the airlines.
[02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:39.580]  Everything's electronic now.
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:45.580]  I get into the system and when you get there and you check in, you just show your ID and they say, yep, yep, you're on the list.
[02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:46.580]  You get to go in.
[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:50.580]  So that's what we did yesterday at the Coconut Grove and we'll do it tonight again.
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:52.580]  Well, I didn't really understand the alternative media.
[02:57:52.580 --> 02:57:56.580]  I was going back 15 years ago, I was just trying to reach people any way I could.
[02:57:56.580 --> 02:58:08.580]  So whether it was access TV or the internet or local radio or, you know, whatever it was said, you know, having a newsletter sort of making films in in 2000 and in 1996 and 1997.
[02:58:08.580 --> 02:58:13.580]  And then that whole way of reaching people, we've reached hundreds and hundreds of millions.
[02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:17.580]  I mean, think about that just in the last few years with these films for free online.
[02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:25.580]  We couldn't do any of it without you, the supporters going to info wars.com and present planet.com and GCM live.com and supporting us and spreading the word.
[02:58:25.580 --> 02:58:26.580]  It's amazing what we're doing.
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:27.580]  I'm sorry to other callers.
[02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:28.580]  We're out of time.
[02:58:28.580 --> 02:58:34.580]  A great job to build graph the engineer and everybody here in the program director of general manager, Michael Olson.
[02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:35.580]  It came with us earlier.
[02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:37.580]  In fact, you'll be able to hear him right now.
[02:58:37.580 --> 02:59:06.580]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:07.580 --> 02:59:08.580]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:50.580]  We'll be right back.
