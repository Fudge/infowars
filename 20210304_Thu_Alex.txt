[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.000]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about slowing up the White House.
[00:24.000 --> 00:32.000]  A huge nationwide protest erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.000]  From the bloodlines of the info wheels, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please almost stop.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  The Alex Jones show, there is a war on for your mind.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite,
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family,
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  everything that's in the other documents.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  God tells all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  So many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  so fast that you could never read them all.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  I know why, because it's scary.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  to yourself, it will take over your life. It should take over your life.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  at both home and abroad.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  When losers draw, you need to choose a side.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  Info Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[04:30.000 --> 04:38.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  All right, I saw a story last night that hit me like a ton of bricks.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  I mean, I get very mad at myself. I already knew all this,
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  but I had just not been conscious of it.
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.000]  You know that Fauci was connected to the very beginnings of HIV showing up in New York and San Francisco,
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  and the government got caught adding it to hepatitis shots.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  We're shooting this on the evening of Monday, March 1st, 2021,
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000]  and in just six days this Saturday, the biggest sale ever on storeable food is going to end.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  Because of the ice storms and the problems around the country,
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  our big supplier, highest quality storeable food at the lowest price,
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  is giving us the best deal ever.
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  Free shipping on all of their storeable food,
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  and that's a big cost of storeable food is the shipping because it weighs a lot,
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  and 10% off on top of it.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  You won't see this deal come along for a long, long time.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  You've got until this Saturday, the 6th of March, 2021,
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  and then contractually they have to end the sale because they have hundreds of distributors
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  and they're getting mad that we're undercutting the price,
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  and they decided to do this,
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  so it's exclusively available for just a few days left at infowarstore.com
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  All their food, all their packages, one month, six month a year,
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  it's all at infowarstore.com.
[05:51.000 --> 06:16.000]  Take advantage of it now, and I'll see you forward.
[06:16.000 --> 06:34.000]  It's Thursday, March 4th, 2021.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  A lot of times I look at the news, the information,
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  and it's overwhelming to even attempt to get it all out to you.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  I've become extremely frustrated and enraged with myself
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  because we can save the world.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  We can turn things around if people actually look into this and find out how real it is.
[06:57.000 --> 07:04.000]  Now, I have forgotten more about the HIV AIDS crisis
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  than most people will have ever researched.
[07:09.000 --> 07:21.000]  And I knew that Dr. Anthony Fauci was instrumental in the launch of that bio-weapon
[07:21.000 --> 07:28.000]  in 1979, Evidence is Overwhelming, in New York and San Francisco,
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  where he went in and ran a public health program that, quote,
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  gave bath houses to tell them,
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  hey, you're giving each other hepatitis, you need to take a vaccine.
[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  And that in those vaccines was the HIV.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Now, viruses generally mutate and become less deadly.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  That's why they always had to apply it to the Africans of the vaccines
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  and apply it through a perfect vector, the homosexual bath houses,
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  to get the spread going.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  But that's why later you hear about Magic Johnson and Charlie Sheen,
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  all these people have HIV, but it's not killing them.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  That's because they have treatments for it and it's also a different variant.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  Now, I knew all this when I was a teenager,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  because my dad was a very smart person.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  He was a very smart person.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  And he was reading the literature.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  And so, I have a water gosh next.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  And so, I forgot to get one thing.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  And so, looking at that, I saw the story about the NPR report
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  with Fauci about how he went in at the very beginning
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  when no one even knew about HIV.
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  He magically studied it in New York and in San Francisco where it broke out.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  And that was the beta test in the controlled community
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  before they even took it to Africa.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  And so, in about a minute and a half earlier today,
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  before we went live, I just typed into the search engine and the crew did
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  and pulled up a bunch of mainstream news articles about secret biological weapons testing
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  on people in New York and other areas and articles about the connections of HIV,
[09:16.000 --> 09:27.000]  being purposely put in drugs and in vaccines to be given to homosexuals.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  Because it's a controlled community that you can watch very carefully.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  So, at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into all that.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  But the whole history of secret experimentation is on record.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  But I knew Fauci ran the HIV program in the 80s.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  I knew Fauci was involved studying it from day one.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  And then he suspect number one in all of this.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  But then he runs the Wuhan lab, 11 programs.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  They release this new plague that they control and use that as a pretext to take over society.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  And then he even profits from it and gets liability protection from it.
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Well, he does it.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  Fauci is a biological terrorist.
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  And he works for the globalists.
[10:10.000 --> 10:19.000]  And that's why Gates worships him is because Gates cut its teeth under his father and under Fauci
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  in all of this type of garbage.
[10:21.000 --> 10:36.000]  So, before we hit all of that, let me go ahead and just show you some of the headlines that came out today along these lines, okay?
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Look at these headlines.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  Going viral in Africa.
[10:40.000 --> 10:52.000]  This is what they do.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  They give you two different vaccines.
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.000]  That's not coming out.
[10:55.000 --> 11:02.000]  Experimental vaccine death rate for Israel is elderly 40 times higher than COVID-19 deaths.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  Researchers report in mainline studies.
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  It's just today, Hong Kong authorities probe death of man who received COVID-19 vaccine.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  Johnson's and Johnson's to test COVID vaccine on infants.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  Great apes at San Diego Zoo become first nonhumans to receive COVID-19 vaccine.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  That's all to act like it's some sought after thing you've got to have.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  Oh, it's so precious to get it.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Now, let's get into the real meat potatoes of just the headlines.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  Guardian promotes global lockdown every two years to combat climate change.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  Steve Watson.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  And it's an important headline, but it's not even hardcore enough.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  The UN is promoting it through a paper.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  I'll show you.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  Swab is promoting it.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's all on record.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  It's in his damn book that COVID is not the real threat.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  We are using it to get total control.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's more of a Russian accent on a German one.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  There it is.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  And oh, guess who else is doing it?
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  Forbes.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  It's in hundreds of publications.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Guardian promotes global lockdown every two years to combat climate change.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  That's all this was was a drill for a lockdown in their own words.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  I told you that a year ago, but now they're romanticizing and they have fake polls out.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  Well, the majority of you cares.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  They love lockdown.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  They don't want it to end.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  It's true.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  At first, you get a bunch of texts in the mail.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  Don't have to work anymore, watch Netflix all day, but see the economy then dies forever
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  and you're under the globalist control.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  The world needs the equivalent of pandemic lockdown every two years to meet Paris.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  Carbon emissions go, yes, the post industrial world.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  And they didn't sign trees to create a post industrial world for nothing.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  They mean business.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  And here is the Forbes article.
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  And here's the actual paper pushed by the UN.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  Nature, climate change, fossil CO2 emissions in the post COVID-19 era.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  Remember, remember what what what what what he wrote almost a year ago in his book, COVID-19?
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  Claude Schwab is one of the head guys running all this with Gates said the former head of the UN
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  biological diversity sustainability project.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  The guy that wrote this whole plan, one of the top authors.
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  He said, we will now be after COVID, like after death of Christ, after birth of Christ, after COVID.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  Oh, but oh, Biden, who can hardly talk.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  He said, Texas and Mississippi are neanderthals.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Yeah, that's that's why we've got NASA down here.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  We don't know how to tie our shoelaces.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  We ride horses to school and to work.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  And we all have hay seeds in our mouth.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  We're not like the big fancy pants Delaware lawyer.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  We're not like the fancy pants.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Where am I? I'm not bashing folks at Delaware.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  But you and I mean, how would you like me to call you a bunch of dumb lobster fishermen?
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  We know we were not but you're smart.
[13:59.000 --> 14:06.000]  But here's that trope of, oh, those idiots sit down in the south, you know, they're morons ending their lockdown.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  But don't worry, you run all the cities down there anyways.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  So it's never going to end until we make it in.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  We're going to play that clip coming up and so much more.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Biden didn't know what planet he was on again last night.
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  We've got the clip of them cutting off and ending the fee because he was so embarrassing floundering.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  But when we come back, we'll we'll lay all of this out into Fauci and more.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  But separately, we got some good news.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  They sold out last week.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Another shipment back in stock.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  And I'm telling you, we could find our whole operation selling these and it's something everybody needs.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  I know they've got the Wall Street Journal doing a report on how bad we are to be selling these privacy pouches that are high quality Faraday cages.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  So big tech contact tracers, the globalist can't track you when you've got your phone inside this pouch.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  And it's essential.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  We all start living like this.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  This is the highest rated pouch out there for droids and for iPhones and it sells everywhere for $29.95.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  It's $19.95 in stock at infowarstore.com.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  And they are so mad.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  He's a scammer.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  He sells horrible food.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  He's a scammer.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  He sells little Faraday cages claiming you're being tracked.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  He's a scammer.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  He sells supplements.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  Oh, but when Jeff Bezos does it, it's good though, right?
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  Supplements are a huge market because they work.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And they're all free shipping right now.
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.000]  Store-wide on the food, on the privacy pouches, on the supplements, on the t-shirts, on the books, on the films, on the water filters.
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  Oh, they sure hope you don't get a Alexa Pure Pro gravity-fed filter highest rated and cut up most of the poison or almost all the poison in the water.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  No, no, no.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  Just drink it up.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  The New York Times says, the Washington Post says, Wall Street Journal says, there's nothing in that water to hurt you.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  Drink that glyphosate, too.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  And Ramon Tando said, drink a whole glass of it.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  Drink a whole glass of it.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's wonderful.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  It'll kill you if you do it, though.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  So these little pockets are back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  We'll be right back at infowarstore.com.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  It's very bittersweet.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through to the end.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.000]  They're great products.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  Do they fund freedom?
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  No, a lot of them don't.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  Why do you do that?
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  Boom, we did it.
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  It's popular.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  It's X3.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  Is it better than X2?
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  You decide.
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And that is down and out.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knocked out, but they don't compete with each other.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at mforestore.com and free shipping.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  Secure your down and out today.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[17:50.000 --> 18:13.000]  Down and out exclusively available at mforestore.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.000]  Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools.
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool.
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.000]  It's beautiful, how the sleep, the melodies, the sun over me.
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  Controllers of this planet see themselves as the guardians of it and they believe they are removing.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  They are culling the overpopulation.
[18:44.000 --> 18:51.000]  And there is a giant documented history of criminal elements based on eugenics in the German government,
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  the Russian government, the French government, the British government,
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  the Australian government, the New Zealand government, the Canadian government,
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  killing foster children, black, white, old, young, Native American,
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  putting them in radiation chambers.
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  The Israelis got U.N. money and U.S. money to take dark-skinned Jews.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  That's how it always starts because it's like, oh, we're only doing it to this group.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And radiating them, they were called the ringworm children.
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000]  And they hit them at different levels of radiation as well.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  The Department of Energy classified in the 80s tens of thousands of foster children in the U.S.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  put in radiation chambers. Hundreds of them were put in rates so high
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.000]  that they fried like an egg inside the chamber.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  So that's who runs your government behind the scenes.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Presidents come and go, but that's who's in charge.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  And that's who wants you to take these inoculations.
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  And Bill Gates' dad worked for a secret government project in the U.S. Army under Cold Springs Harbor,
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  and part of that's been declassified.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  His dad ran the whole show.
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  And his mother was the leader of IBM's board,
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  whose entire trust, when Thomas Watson died,
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.000]  received the highest award ever in Nazi Germany, above Hitler,
[20:17.000 --> 20:27.000]  that entire fortune was then basically given to Bill Gates.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  So you can sit here and play games, everybody, but they're practicing locking you down,
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.000]  creating internal passports, and rolling out these deadly gene editing systems against you.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  I don't care if you're black, whether you're white, whether you're old, whether you're young,
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  whether you're an FBI agent, whether you're an auto mechanic,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  whether you're a Democrat or Republican, you're all being hit by this.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  So you can pretend it's not going on all day long.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  But did you hear the headline I read?
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  The Lifesight News that links directly to medical reports and mainline news in Israel.
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  Experimental vaccine death rate for Israel's elderly 40 times higher than COVID-19 deaths.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.000]  In the U.K. and all these other countries, including France,
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  they said nobody above 65 or 75 in the country should take these vaccines,
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  because it's been killing people.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  But Israel doesn't care.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  It's designed to kill old people.
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  Pfizer's vaccine killed about 40 times more elderly people and 260 times more than young
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  than what the COVID-19 virus would have claimed in a given timeframe.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  This is massive news.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  And we're just supposed to sit here and calmly take this,
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  and oh, be thankful that the governor of Texas said after a year,
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  okay, you don't have to wear a mask and open business 100% when he knows all the blue cities are controlled,
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.000]  and they're all pleasing to keep it locked down as a symbol of our dirtiness and our evil.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  Now at the football games and the baseball games and the basketball games,
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  well, in fact, show this now.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  We've got the footage of it for TV viewers, radio listeners,
[22:04.000 --> 22:05.000]  that's on informers.com.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  Instead of the kiss cam where they show a husband and wife or boyfriend and girlfriend
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  together with their arms around each other,
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  oh, it tells you don't touch each other, even if you don't know,
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  and then they show a big bottle of alcohol spraying on them,
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  because you're dirty, you're bad, you have to do this.
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.000]  And so now it's a hand sanitizer cam, which, by the way, sterilizes you long term,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  lowers fertility immediately.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  So it's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't kiss anymore.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  We don't have kiss cams.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  We have an image of a chemical shooting on you like you're a cockroach or you're a rat.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  And that's how the Nazis ran film reels before they started rounding everybody up.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  And the 30s was showing images of Jews and then it would cut to roaches
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  and them being sprayed with poison.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  So the entire system is telling you, you're dirty, you're bad, wear your mask,
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  and now we're going to squirt hand sanitizer on you.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  You're good, you're keeping everyone safe.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  When all the studies show more interaction makes us more immune to everything
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  and that these hand sanitizers hurt our fertility and lower our immunity.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  Because they're wood alcohol.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Wood alcohol makes you go blind.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  You drink a cup of wood alcohol.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  You'll go blind probably for a week or two.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  Keep doing it forever.
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  They say, wood alcohol on your skin all day long, baby.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  You know what we used to do in high school?
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  Back when I still chewed tobacco some, I'd stick a little packet of snuff
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  between my toes and get hired in a kite sitting there in class for nicotine.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  Yep, I've had an alcohol nicotine problem my whole life.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  That's it.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Nothing else.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  Nothing else.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  I like those two things.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Stay away from nicotine now.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  Last time I had a nicotine last three or four years was with Bob Barnes
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  and then with, with, uh, Crowder, Stephen Crowder on his show.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  And man, I was like, as soon as I left, I want another cigar.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  But the point is, is that ladies and gentlemen, you're being targeted.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  People are like, why don't I snuff between your toes?
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  It goes through your skin, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  All of it goes through your skin, whether it's nicotine or whether it's wood alcohol.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  It's poisonous and it's abusive to do it to children.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  And it's abusive to make people wear masks.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's a symbol of slavery.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  Talk about sexual harassment because Cuomo will grab women and hug them.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  What about making you wear a muzzle over your face and breathe the bacteria
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  into the cloth that creates a petri dish for bacteria?
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  I know you already know all this, but look at these headlines.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  In fact, let's play the clip.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  Oh my God, look at that, a baby with a full face mask on smothering it,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  giving it way higher levels of carbon dioxide.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  So abusive.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  These people are so sick.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  And you've got families being kicked off planes, being arrested
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  because six month old babies aren't wearing masks.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  It's nothing but a cult of subservience.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  And we have to be leaders and start saying no.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Here's Joe Biden claiming that Texas is knuckle dragging
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  and Mississippi is knuckle dragging.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  I guess Florida is too.
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  Way lower death rates in New York and every other Democrat area
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  where you grab people and innovate them and kill them with your ventilators,
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  not with the virus.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  And then you make money off of it.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  You murderers.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  Here he is calling Texas Neanderthals because we know he's a hoax.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  We know Fauzi's a fraud.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  And we need more people like Governor Noem of South Dakota
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  and DeSantis to call Biden out.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  Don't just ease off the restrictions because they're going to bring them right back.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  And they're never going to end them in places like California.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  Here is the puppet president.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  I think it's a big mistake.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  Look, I hope everybody's realized by now these masks make a difference.
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.000]  We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  because of the way in which we're able to get vaccines in people's arms.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  We've been able to move that all the way up to the end of May
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  to have enough for every American to get every adult American to get a shot.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  And the last thing, the last thing we need is the Neanderthal thinking that
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  in the meantime, everything's fine.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  Take off your mask.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  Forget it.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  It still matters.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  We're on the cusp of ending it.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  We're at the cusp.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  You're going to get your tracker chip.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  You're going to get your tracker phone.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  You're going to get your QR code.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  You're on the cusp.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  Oh, but you can't still leave or take the mask off after you had the vaccine.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  It's all rope a dope.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  Sucker you along.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  I mean, better than Neanderthal that a slave or dead with your deadly vaccine.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  No, you're the one that's anti-science.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  You old shriveled demonic lawyer.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  You disgusting puppet that's emblematic of the rotting political system.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  So desperate they pulled off this giant medical tyranny hoax.
[26:50.000 --> 26:59.000]  Come back, we'll look at Fauci, Dr. HIV.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold,
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  being totally enslaved.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the blood
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.000]  are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  March is here, and we're running a special for only one week.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  Store ride-free shipping up to 50% off on our best-selling items.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  Free shipping on storeable food till this next Saturday and 10% off.

[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  Only till this Saturday. Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.

[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Take it out of the tongue, it's incredible. 50% off. All of it, free shipping.
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  Huge deals on gravity-fed water filters. Amazing deals on all of our products.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  I'll be frank with you. Stuff's so bad, fingers so out of control.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  I'm trying to sell everything, so we actually have funds inside our coffers to keep operating if they shut our shopping carts down.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  We're under a major globalist attack, not because we're the enemy, but because we're standing between you and the globalist.
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  The globalists want to bankrupt you. They want to enslave you. They want to depopulate you.
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  They want to force inoculate you. Fund info wars, and we'll take action against them in the fight.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.000]  The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment.
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially,
[29:13.000 --> 29:21.000]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[29:25.000 --> 29:32.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  In their own words, they admit it. So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's other business.
[29:54.000 --> 30:05.000]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[30:24.000 --> 30:36.000]  A predatory planetary consolidation is taking place, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:36.000 --> 30:42.000]  In a moment we're going to play some of Dr. Fauci on NPR clip 12.
[30:42.000 --> 30:49.000]  Just this week admitting that, oh, he was haunting the bathhouses when no one even knew about HIV
[30:49.000 --> 30:56.000]  because he was so concerned about this new threat. So, he's been one of their top globalist operatives in biolepinary
[30:56.000 --> 31:02.000]  and secret testing for a long time. That's why he ran the Luan lab operations.
[31:02.000 --> 31:13.000]  Now, let's go to this article. Fauci frequented gay bathhouses and bars to study AIDS in the 1980s, starting in 1980.
[31:13.000 --> 31:24.000]  Here's another one. Bayer division sold hemophilia drug with HIV risk to Asia, Latin America and covered it up.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  And they also purposely in the 90s took blood from prisoners in Arkansas, certified as good and then put it purposely into the blood supply.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  Look it up. America's pandemic war games don't end well foreign policy.
[31:36.000 --> 31:45.000]  That's the CFR subdivision of the Washington Post admitting to do all the secret testing on our troops and on us.
[31:45.000 --> 31:52.000]  1978-81, is HIV AIDS linked to the CDC's hepatitis V vaccine experiment?
[31:52.000 --> 32:00.000]  AHRP.org, powerful breakdown and information of these programs in the gay bathhouses saying,
[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  you need a vaccine, you need a hepatitis shot so that you don't get hepatitis and then you have to autoimmune disease.
[32:09.000 --> 32:15.000]  They admit a lot of problems with cats getting vaccines, then end up feline familiar.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  And then dying of an HIV like AIDS disease.
[32:19.000 --> 32:25.000]  Here's another one. Army report details germ war exercise in New York subway 1966,
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  sprayed people with a dangerous bacteria they told Congress it wasn't, it was.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  Then they had Army doctors posing as regular civilian doctors embedded to track the bio weapon.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  That's the Washington Post, 1980.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  Back then we had a little bit of truth in the news.
[32:43.000 --> 32:52.000]  The Army tested germ warfare in New York City subway by smashing white bulbs full of bacteria, business insider.
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  Bayer admits it paid millions in HIV infection cases, just not in English.
[32:57.000 --> 33:05.000]  Now, that's just some of it. Let's go ahead and play some of Fauci.
[33:05.000 --> 33:15.000]  Let's go ahead and roll some audio of Fauci putting it out there that, oh, I was so concerned.
[33:15.000 --> 33:21.000]  Before anybody even knew about this, he was going into these bathhouses to understand what's happening.
[33:21.000 --> 33:30.000]  And you link it back to a CDC NIH program to convince, quote, gay men that you're at risk of hepatitis, get your vaccine.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  And so they rolled up their sleeves just like the Africans did.
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.000]  And I've got a whole stack of news on that front. Here's Fauci.
[33:39.000 --> 33:49.000]  I was invited to go down and I went with just one of my staff at the time to go down essentially alone to the Gay and Lesbian Community Center
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.000]  in the middle of Greenwich Village to meet with what must have been anywhere from 50 to 100 activists in this meeting room,
[33:59.000 --> 34:09.000]  just me and one of my staff. And they were angry with the federal government because they felt the federal government was not listening to them.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  And they were right. I mean, I think they had a really good point.
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  Not for a second did I feel physically threatened to go down there, not even close.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  Oh, he's such a hero.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  That's not the nature of what the protest was.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  Everything with him is an inversion. He didn't feel threatened going down there.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  He was so loving. Oh, he was coming, though, with something very special continuing.
[34:31.000 --> 34:41.000]  Things about it was that not only were they not threatening at all in a violent way, but ultimately they were on the right side of history.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  Was there a turning point for you or activists convinced you to change your mind?
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  What was it? What was the turning point?
[34:51.000 --> 35:01.000]  Well, the turning point was, you know, I can't get into my own head and psychoanalyze myself, but it was very clear when they were protesting in a way
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  and really being very confrontational with me. You know, Larry Kramer's famous article on the front page of the San Francisco.
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.000]  So he's a hero saving people with HIV. He tried to leave everything open.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  He didn't try to contain it because he was a good guy, but really he was involved.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  We now know in these secret projects at Wuhan and so many others end up working with Bill Gates the entire time.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  But put that image of him back at the time up on screen. What a creepy looking dude, man.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  I mean, that is shit. Would you buy a used car from that guy? Would you let him babysit your children?
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  Would you roll your sleeve up and take something in your body he wants you to take?
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  Well, that's what you're doing. The whole world's doing it. In fact, CNN, MSNBC, they're the gatekeepers along with Big Tech.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  You're not allowed to criticize him and say he's wrong. You can't question him.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  You can't get a second opinion from him or Bill Gates or anybody because he's the boss.
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  Now, let's go back and look at some more of these articles that are coming out.
[36:01.000 --> 36:08.000]  Biden blasts Texas, Mississippi, lifting mass mandates. Big mistake in the Anderthal thinking from a guy that can hardly talk.
[36:08.000 --> 36:15.000]  We got this video. White House absurdly cuts off live feed. Get that ready.
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  Biden says he wants to take audience questions for the first time. He's done no real press conference.
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.000]  It's never before happened in modern history. And as soon as he says, I'll take questions, he goes,
[36:26.000 --> 36:33.000]  is it all right? Any questions? Let me ask Nancy. Is that all right?
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.000]  I'll talk to the great grandkids here and just cut. Well, don't hear it from me. Here it is.
[36:39.000 --> 36:52.000]  Thank you. And I'm happy to take questions if that's what I'm supposed to do, Nancy, whatever you want me to do.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  I mean, he said when he was president-elect, all fraudulently president-elect, he said,
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  I just, if they don't like you, Kamala, they don't like what I'm doing. I'll just fainted illness and just go away.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  You got about rolled over to the Chinese and the globalist. He'll do whatever he's told. Let's continue.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  Majority of Brits say they will miss some or many aspects of lockdown. You believe that crap. Yep. Stockholm syndrome.
[37:18.000 --> 37:26.000]  Awkward NBA team swaps out kiss cam for hand sanitizer to welcome fans back to the arena. Fans respond.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  This kissing is bad. Anytime they see a man and woman hugging or kissing, well, we just spray sanitizer on you.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  Because if it's not gay sex, it's bad. See, the gay sex is good because you don't have kids.
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  Heterosexual bad. More people bad. It's all depopulation.
[37:42.000 --> 37:49.000]  Sorry, gay folks. It's not that you're so cool. Everybody obsesses on you and they put Caitlyn Jenner all over the TV and we're supposed to worship you.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  It's because you don't have children and the system likes that. I don't hate you.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  I'm just saying the globalist promoted all this and put the chemicals in the water to cause the collapse of civilization.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  And don't worry, it will collapse. You're going to get what you want.
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.000]  Oh, look at this. Family fine. Kicked off their own land for living in an RV.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Isn't that just special? It's out in the country. You name it. They lost their house because of the lockdown.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  So they pulled the resources, got an RV, moved out there. You can't run out there and get goats and chickens and live.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  We're going to arrest you. We're going to find you. We're going to take your property.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  I'll play that next segment, but just look at that creepy. There's your doctor.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  There's your doctor, folks. He runs your life now.
[38:33.000 --> 38:41.000]  Dr. Fauci. Meanwhile, super spreaders over 100 COVID positive illegals released in the U.S.
[38:41.000 --> 38:48.000]  We should stop the illegals being let in because they're illegal. We shouldn't go all COVID and then, you know, buy into it.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[38:51.000 --> 39:01.000]  We've also got video in Jersey, not New Jersey, Jersey Shore over in England dancing at the beach partying, but nobody else is allowed to.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  That's all coming up as well here today on the broadcast.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  And I've scrubbed the deck of guests so that we can take a lot of calls.
[39:12.000 --> 39:18.000]  So starting at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to take calls for the balance of the transmission.
[39:18.000 --> 39:26.000]  But we've got a lot of other news. I've not hit yet on the economy, on censorship, on Dr. Seuss.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  Just a week ago, a leftist group said ban it. The media made jokes and said nobody's going to ban Dr. Seuss.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  It's being banned at Amazon, many of the titles, and banned at eBay.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  And they're now saying, if you have one, they're coming after you.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, an academic group that's God said they see secret code of racism.
[39:45.000 --> 39:57.000]  And so they are God and you are banned because if they can ban leftist academic Dr. Seuss, they can ban anybody.
[39:57.000 --> 40:05.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you're having trouble sleeping.
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  It is down and out. We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge. We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin. It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[40:16.000 --> 40:25.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate. It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula. I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[40:31.000 --> 40:38.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast. If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep? It's incredible.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest. It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  Down and out, M4WareStore.com.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  Let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  So please pray to keep M4Ware on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.

[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[41:30.000 --> 41:37.000]  I need your help more than ever now. I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at M4WareStore.com.

[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  The globalists want you dependent. They want you alone. They want you bankrupt. They want you starving in the dark.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  That is what their entire spirit is driving for because they want total submission.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  When you get high quality, storeable food that lasts more than a decade, you are buying food insurance that you and your family

[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  There is only a few days left at M4WareStore.com.

[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  And with food, a big part of the cost is the shipping.

[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  You know, it is crazy to get to this point. It is very bittersweet.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Everything we have talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  And it is because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they are doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  I can't tell you what is going on, but let's just say this.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  We are going to see this through to the end. We are going to stay on air as long as we can.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  So, please pray for us and please buy the products at M4WareStore.com.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  They are great products, plus they fund the operation.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  So, you know, unlike other products you can buy, they are still great.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't.
[43:36.000 --> 43:43.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world is waking up and looking for truth.
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  That is why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  So, while you are at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  Download everything we have done you can find and save it.
[43:54.000 --> 44:09.000]  Because who knows how long we are going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  Who is the true master of your land?
[44:28.000 --> 44:34.000]  Channel 2 Sophia Choi started investigating and learned the answer may come from a judge.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  We spent weeks looking into this after hearing from this Polk County man.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  His plan, buy land and live off of it after losing his job to COVID.
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  Now, he bought the land but the county says he can't live there, leading to a property right predicament.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  Chickens and goats and plenty of space to roam around in the fresh air.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  We planned on building a forever home here and growing old and giving it to our kids.
[45:01.000 --> 45:10.000]  A place where Tim Leslie, his wife Amy and their two kids, nine-year-old Knox and 18-month-old Daisy could thrive even during a pandemic.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  Almost every penny he had went to buying and clearing this land.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  I had my pension and 401k money.
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  But instead of living here, his kids are now playing on asphalt and living in an RV park.
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  Leslie says that's because the county forced them to move after slapping them with this ticket for living in an RV.
[45:28.000 --> 45:34.000]  Before I could go to court, they showed up at my property, the building inspector and the code enforcement officer,
[45:34.000 --> 45:42.000]  and told me that I had to be off my land Friday at noon or they were going to seize my vehicles and my assets.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Attorney Ari Bargill with the Institute for Justice.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  This is a question about property rights.
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  Mr. Leslie owns the property on which he situated his camper.
[45:53.000 --> 45:58.000]  And as a result, he has the right to live there as long as he's not harming anybody.
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.000]  Mr. Leslie says he checked the codes before buying this land.
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.000]  It says in black and white under the ag-land ordinance that single-family dwellings are allowed.
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  Oh, single-family dwellings are allowed.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  That's agenda 21 and agenda 2030 in the global UNESCO rules.
[46:21.000 --> 46:28.000]  They're going to use local code enforcers to shut down single-family dwellings even in Tennessee.
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  In Austin, they penalize you and try to block you with code enforcers if you try to build single-family homes.
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  This is the control. See the full report up on infowars.com.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  These are predators. They are coming from everyone.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  Oh, the illegal aliens can come in and get everything free.
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  Oh, the homeless can squat in your front yard and take fentanyl all day.
[46:48.000 --> 46:56.000]  But if you go out and buy a little farm and want to live with your kids in a trailer with electricity and toilet, oh, you're not allowed to.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  We're going to run you to ground. We're going to bankrupt you.
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.000]  It's why they want to get rid of the family so that when they bankrupt people, they can take their children away.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  Makes me so incredibly angry. They're trying to run info wars to ground.
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  I'm going to cover this now because yesterday I didn't cover it long enough and it's really illustrative.
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.000]  It's bigger than info wars. Here's an overhead shot. Doc McCam shot, please.
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  Does Alex Jones regret meeting Donald Trump?
[47:24.000 --> 47:31.000]  Now, why is this so important? Because it shows us the enemy's tactics and it shows us their mindset.
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.000]  They want to drive a wedge between you and President Trump. They want to drive a wedge between you and I.
[47:37.000 --> 47:44.000]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, even more evil than the ADL, heavily involved the Oklahoma City bombing with Tim McVeigh and more.
[47:44.000 --> 47:55.000]  Took a film I was in a year and a half ago with edited video out of context and then said it was secretly filmed and leaked.
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.000]  Secretly filmed and leaked. We bought 20,000 of the film.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  And it's got bad reviews because it was negatively made. It wasn't what they said the film was going to be.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  It was all the depressing stuff we've gone through to demoralize people and has low ratings at infowarstore.com because our ratings are real.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  When you see something with 98% rating, those are real ratings. When you see something with a 60% rating, it sucks.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  And here is, ladies and gentlemen, the leaked video. Look at it. Look at it. Look at it right here.
[48:25.000 --> 48:32.000]  Look at this. It's leaked, ladies and gentlemen. Look at this. Think about that.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  It's a big secret. The very video that they put out, there's 20,000 copies of them. You can buy it.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  Hell, I don't sell them for $1. It's a worthless film because they edited everything into total oblivion.
[48:44.000 --> 48:50.000]  But there it is. It's called, let me get it. It's called You Can't Watch This.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  And so it was Tommy Robinson's producers and camera people that acted like they were nice.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  We later learned that they work for Hope Not Hate. That's basically the ADL of the UK.
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.000]  And then they came and did this interview and edited it off where I said, if I was a selfish person,
[49:06.000 --> 49:11.000]  if I only cared about myself, I would hate Donald Trump and I would never want to be around him or Roger Stone
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  because I've been persecuted. It's been horrible. You're like, wait a minute. I've heard you say that 50 times on your show.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  I said that on Joe Rogan the last two times. But I said, because Trump did the right thing, I support him.
[49:20.000 --> 49:25.000]  Trump has said, if I was a selfish person, I wouldn't have run. I lost $2 million. They tried to destroy me.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  But I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for you. This country's given me a lot.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  So they take my long-winded statements, edit off the fronts in the film. They didn't edit that out.
[49:36.000 --> 49:44.000]  But when they put it out in every publication in the country, basically, it's everywhere, that Jones secretly disavows Trump.
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  Yes, secretly in a film we sell. I had agreed to buy $20,000 of these things when they made it.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  I got hoodwinked in my view. I got it. It's still okay, but it's designed to depress people.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  Joe Rogan McGinnis called me. He said, have you seen this? I said, yeah, I'm buying $20,000. He goes, it's horrible.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  He goes, it's totally depressing. He said, my God, they totally edited it out of context.
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  I said, I'm sorry. I didn't know. They got me to say I'd buy $20,000. I thought they were Tommy Robinson.
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.000]  They were good. Tommy called me later and said, no, they're terrible people. But it isn't about those guys.
[50:16.000 --> 50:21.000]  It's about the perfect way to infiltrate somebody saying you're a filmmaker and then they can do whatever they want.
[50:21.000 --> 50:30.000]  But imagine the lies of the Southern Primary Law Center putting this out and saying it's secretly recorded
[50:30.000 --> 50:36.000]  when the whole thing and more, the parts they didn't edit, is in this film.
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.000]  I'm selling, let's go back and show B-roll the footage and then play the bleep clip we played yesterday.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  The only thing added is the bleeps. We'll play the yesterday's clip in a minute and a half long.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  And then it's in a studio with all these lights. They had a smoke machine.
[50:53.000 --> 50:58.000]  I'm looking right at the camera and I'm giving a real interview and they say,
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  and by the way, the Southern Primary Law Center contacted us and I said, that's in the film.
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  And I told the so-called reporter that they didn't care, folks, because they murder the truth.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  That's what they do. Guys, roll the B-roll again, please. There it is.
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.000]  Oh my God, that's secret footage all lit up like it's HBO in a warehouse with a smoke machine.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  And again, it's in this film.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, this just shows the level of deception.
[51:24.000 --> 51:31.000]  But notice what's not on the video, that I hate my listeners and that I sell, quote, dick pills.
[51:31.000 --> 51:36.000]  That's what the media calls some of the supplements we sell. That's what Colbert calls them.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  So it's even their words. Of course I love our audience.
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.000]  Of course I didn't tell filmmakers that I hate my audience and they'll buy my Dick Cheney pills.
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  But again, that's the lie upon the lie.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  So they put one lie in there, cut off the context of what I'm saying, and then they attach more lies.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  And I know you know that. This isn't hurting us, actually.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  We're getting more support because of all the media attacks.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  It's just that that's who these people are. I mean, overhead shot, please.
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  Look at this. Alex Jones says he's so epic, sick of Donald Trump in 2019 leaked video.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Yes, so leaked, we've sold 10,000 copies of it.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  Alex Jones mocks his own fans and boasts that he can get them to buy anything.
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  Where's the video of that? You don't have that. You attach one lie to another.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Jones says he's sick of Donald Trump and wishes he never met him.
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  I said if I was the selfish person and didn't care about humanity, this has been rough and I said that.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  I wish I never knew Trump on and on. They'll probably edit this right now and say I said it again.
[52:34.000 --> 52:40.000]  But that's who they are. Every New York Times, Washington Post, you know, just everything.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  Because that's who these liars are and that's why they want to shut us down and silence all of you so we can't speak.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  You know, again, we got 20,000 of these when we sold like 10,000.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  I was about to just put them free in things, but it's such a depressing film.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  I almost just throw them away, but I don't like to throw away books and films like the left that likes to burn things.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  So I guess if you want to get, you can't watch this and see it for yourself.
[53:01.000 --> 53:10.000]  It's at infoworkstore.com. But let's go out to break here with what I actually said in the film. Here it is.
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.000]  Part of me, the selfish part, wishes I'd never met Donald Trump.
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  Fantastic business. I don't know if you can see that thing right up here.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  We can.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  But it's doing great business. I hope your audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  And I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing.
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[53:36.000 --> 53:45.000]  Being sucked into that whole vortex as it was like selling your soul.
[53:45.000 --> 53:53.000]  Everything I did, everything I was and everything I was trying to do at that point didn't matter how diverse it was.
[53:53.000 --> 53:59.000]  It didn't matter how it was multifaceted. It all became that at that point.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  So Trump came to get my populist audience and then he did that.
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  The Democrats thought it was a threat. They attacked it and said that I was on Trump thinking it would hurt him.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  It made Trump stronger. It made him win the election.
[54:10.000 --> 54:18.000]  And so they understand that Donald Trump is info wars and that I'm Donald Trump now.
[54:18.000 --> 54:25.000]  And it's like a ring of doom. We've been merged together into this thing and they're obsessed with it.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  And again, I was explaining the media created this false thing.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  So even that's edited down from what I really said.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  So I'm done talking about it. It only makes us more successful.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  Other lies, people know what they are, but this is sick.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  But if you want to get the secret leaked video that's been out for a year and a half on DVD,
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  the secret leaked video we've been selling for over a year, it's at infowarstore.com.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  The secret leaked video. The Southern Prophecy Law Center said so.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  All the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  Why do you do that? Because different strokes for different folks.
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.000]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  Boom. We did it. It's popular. It's X3. Is it better than X2? You decide. It's different strokes, different folks.
[55:14.000 --> 55:21.000]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping, and that is down and out.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.

[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the info at the same time.
[55:37.000 --> 55:48.000]  Down and out exclusively available at infowarstore.com or 40% off and free shipping.
[55:48.000 --> 55:56.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[56:02.000 --> 56:11.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[56:11.000 --> 56:21.000]  And it really does come down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[56:21.000 --> 56:31.000]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[56:31.000 --> 56:41.000]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[56:41.000 --> 57:02.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[57:11.000 --> 57:21.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide and we have the gentlemen that went in through the customs of Canada and said, I'm not doing this.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  I'm not complying with your fraud.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  Same things that happened in the UK, so they're trying to talk about jail time, but the courts are ending up throwing this out.
[57:28.000 --> 57:42.000]  So it's all color law. Chris Sky joins us next segment with Steve Cuell, then John Rappaport. But the big takeaway, my friends, is that populism is rising across the world.
[57:42.000 --> 57:49.000]  I don't care if it comes in the form of Bolsonaro or it comes in the form of Trump, both of which were the real deal and have done the best job they can.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  Boris Johnson, a trader posing as a populist.
[57:52.000 --> 58:00.000]  But then you've got somebody like the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and he says, I love Communist China and dictatorship.
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  And then people go, wow, this is like a dictatorship.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  I saw a headline one of the crew did putting out that Naomi Wolf interview yesterday.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  And it's like, oh, Naomi Wolf warrants tyranny around the corner.
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  No, it's sitting in your lap. So I changed the headline.
[58:14.000 --> 58:24.000]  It's sitting in your lap. And it's a corrupt ruling class that is totally authoritarian, that is willing to do anything at any time to anybody to maintain that power.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  And so many people play along with it and go along with the structure, thinking that, oh, they'll they'll protect themselves doing it.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  No, you're destroying your protection.
[58:32.000 --> 58:39.000]  And it's like, it's like, if you ever watch the dam collapse, usually it springs a small leak, and then that undermines the dam.
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  And then the dam will be able to say, hey, we've got a leak, we've got a problem, they'll try to fix it.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  And they'll say, hey, we think the dam might fail in the next few weeks.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  We were unable to fix it because the integrity was breached.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  And then you see a larger area break open.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  And a couple of days later, this whole thing suddenly collapses.
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.000]  So at first it just leaks down in the foundation and they try to fix it.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  Then it starts seeing some water coming through down at the bottom.
[59:00.000 --> 59:07.000]  And then as soon as holes start blowing through it and the water starts moving quick, it may have taken a month for it to get to that point.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  Then the whole dam goes in five minutes.
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  And that's the point we've reached with tyranny.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  With all these people pretending, hey, let's have a civil war and put 80 million Trump supporters in camps.
[59:19.000 --> 59:25.000]  Hey, you know, let's arrest Mark Zuckerberg, says Cohen, Sasha Barakowan.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  He won't do what I say.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  Hey, who would want to live in a world like that where they just arrest whoever Sasha Barakowan wants?
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  There's an old funny meme.
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  They got millions of views on Twitter by five years old to get the gay chemicals, the frogs.
[59:40.000 --> 59:45.000]  And all I was doing was reading a study out of Berkeley about the frogs becoming sterile and being attracted to their male frogs.
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  And funny enough, that was in the New York Times.
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  What's happening to sperm this weekend?
[59:49.000 --> 59:53.000]  Was there a cover story of, oh, it's not just us becoming infertile.
[59:53.000 --> 59:54.000]  It's other animals.
[59:54.000 --> 59:55.000]  Could it be?
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  Could it be Satan?
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  No, it's atrazine.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  So it's all coming up. Maybe we should play the old Geronimo Frost frog piece for you.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Because the only place you find our videos, the only place you're allowed to see them now is Band on Video.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  And yeah, people are like, wow, this is one of the only independent video sites where you get, you know, a lot of videos get a million views.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  A ton of videos get 200, 300,000.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Most videos get about 30,000 views.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Well, I don't care about the views because we only have our own advertising on there.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  I have to pay with the bandwidth.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  I care about fighting back and waking people up.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  So all I care about is how many people we reach.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  And so I've got to act stupid and dress up as a gay frog because the leftful let me make fun of myself.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  So when I did that, that was allowed to go on Twitter.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  You got millions of views, but it educated people.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  They're like, hey, I'm actually going to filter my water.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  So if I dress up in a tutu and to hop around as a gay frog, I will do that.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  I will do a lot of things to fight these people because I am legitimately concerned.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  Welcome to Lily Pad Lane.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Here I come.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  So there you go.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  And if I do silly stuff, they let it get on the Internet.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  They decide.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  They are the overlords.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  They decide.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  You know, they don't want me showing you this new Lancet study that came out two days ago from the Journal of Lancet.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  This is not like someone publish it.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  This is Lancet, but the South saying PCR tests are totally fake and do not work and are a fraud.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  I mean, the whole basis, but all these world leaders are saying, hey, you don't get on a train, a plane without the PCR tested.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  We're going to lock you up for 14 days of your positive, you know, in a FEMA camp hotel.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  But even if you're negative, you got to stay in your house.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  The police are coming by.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  You got to pass thousands of dollars.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  So we're going to talk to a man who's fighting back against this Chris Sky on the other side of this 60 second break.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Please tell everybody, you know, to tune in now.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I sell supplements for two reasons because they work.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  They're real.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  They're powerful.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And because it's a giant market.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  But again, why is there a giant market because it works?
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  So whether it's sawpaw meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade organic bottom of the B12 and over 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force or the pure deep breath crystal iodine next to these are all the very best supplements.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  You're going to find an already great market of high quality products after.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  And it funds the info war.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the info wars.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  You can't lose info wars delivers in space.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get the products today.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com, you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Coming to you live from the info wars dot com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Yeah, we cut that problem a few years ago.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  I thought we turned the tide, but I'm going to have to say that we have been the statism contention about to be under global is controlled yet again because they've got the governor on their side.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Thank you for joining us in our number two.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Chris sky made international headlines last few days as a video went viral of him challenging the COVID PCR fraud police at the Canadian border and trying to violate his rights.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  We'll be talking to him here in just a moment, but let's take some time now to look at these headlines.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  You're just pouring in France considers slowing vaccine rollout for hospital staff with many unable to work following the jab, some dying, many getting very, very set.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  And live site news links to a bunch of mainstream reports out of France, breaking that down, but here's the issue.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  They skipped animal trials. Experts that looked at it said it really hurt you down the road, and they're having the worst adverse reactions of any vaccine ever.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  And Bill Gates told you last year it's going to really hurt you bad.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  They'd actually done secret tests on animals under the guise of other quote, you know, COVID vaccines for animals.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  You got all these old people dying taking it.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  It's just amazing.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  UK group launches trial to test experimental COVID-19 vaccine on children.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Remember, they were going to give it to everybody, but so many old folks died a month and a half ago.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  The British government said, OK, back off.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  But now they're just going to do it with the parents signed forms, letting them test on their children, even though almost no children have died from COVID.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  And they're continuing report Georgia mother of two dead after receiving COVID vaccine. That's up on info wars dot com coronavirus Merkel warns a third virus wave as Germany weighs ending the lockdown.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Oh, see, it's always another lockdown for non essential businesses as the big businesses take over the economy.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  This is siege.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  And we told you this was coming.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  I saw this article on info wars.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  And I like Michael Snyder, but I almost took it down because, you know, Michael has these articles a year ago and then now that this deadly and it's a horrible virus.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  And well, they always say it in Europe and all over.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Oh, we got to lock down again a new strain, a new super deadly one.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  Oh, this doctor saw it.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  This doctor thinks so.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  It's the same system telling his PCR test work when they don't the same system saying 4% of the public would die.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  It's the same system that lied to us about what's happening in the nursing homes.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  It pays to ship actual COVID patients in to actually kill old people so they get some death numbers.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  So a new highly resistant COVID variant has emerged in California and it could make the black far worse.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Just when it seemed like COVID pandemic may be subsiding a new COVID strain has emerged in California that has the potential to change everything.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  You see very similar articles all over the press.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  CNN is very breathless as well.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  According to tests conducted by Dr. Charles Chewy and his team, this new strain appears to result in more severe illness.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  And it also appears to result in more people dying from the virus.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Now, this could be true.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  The move could be made of cheese as well, but to be serious, I said a year ago, they would use this as a simulant for the lockdown.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  And if we went along with it, they released out of Wuhan, they have more deadly viruses in the same family they could release to really keep us under their control.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  So who knows?
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  You never know.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  But the last so-called super deadly strains and all this were BS.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  Most people don't have enough vitamin D3, but so nothing against Snyder saying that.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  I just don't agree with him.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  And I just think these people cried wolf so much that I don't buy into it.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  The devil's already here.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  California's coronavirus strain looks increasingly dangerous. Yeah, who knows?
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Kathy Pacific allowing certain passengers to go mass free on flights.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  Oh, that's right.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  New York Post.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  You want to pay more money?
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  You don't have to.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  That's how it always works.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Russia shows off new COVID-19 vaccine factory even as people hesitate to get it.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  The Russians don't trust it.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Well, we've heard the black people are able to.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  They don't trust it.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  COVID bill could give federal employees nearly four months off paid leave to homeschool kids
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  while teachers do nothing.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  And then you've got all the nursing home desk and Cuomo covering it up and all these other
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  governors that did it as well.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  So see that's a way to burn him, get those other governors totally under their control.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  I'm going to play the exchange, go to break and come back with our guests.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  But let's go to the exchange right now.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Here he is.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  He'll give us the details on the other side.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Chris Sky.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  So freedom fighter had a feeling he was creator of a nonprofit organization back to work.biz
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and mad mothers against distancing.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Get mad.online.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I love it.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  He's like Alfie Oaks, but I guess even more progressive fighting back.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  I love it.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Helping small businesses and children due to the COVID crisis.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  He is a worldwide anti-lockdown advocate and speaker.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And the whole future is going to be this because under operation lockstep it never ends.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Oh, Biden came out and said this is operation lockstep.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  He pledged himself to it.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  That's coming up too.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Next segment.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  So let's go ahead and show what happened to the border.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Oh, got my bag.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And we're going to go outside.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  We're going to refuse the stupid test and tell everybody to refuse the stupid test.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  So, yeah.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Hi.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Yes, because I have a medical condition.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  So I don't need to wear one.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  And I'm also a Canadian citizen.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  And this is a violation of our charter rights section six and a violation of the emergency
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  act 14.1.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  So I'm going to be declining your test today.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  No problem.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  I'll happily do that.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Everybody in here, if you are a Canadian citizen, simply deny the test, deny their
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  quarantine, and there's nothing you can do.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  They cannot stop you.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  They cannot force you.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  You are a citizen.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  You have rights.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  If you want to win the life for two hours, let them put up your nose, go right ahead.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  But if you have a brain and you have balls, just say no.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  That's fine.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  I have a body.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  I have a camera on as well.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  So, yes, everybody, this is what you do.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  You say no to their test, no to their quarantine.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And if you're a citizen or a permanent resident, there's absolutely nothing they can do but
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  acknowledge that you have rights and they have to respect that.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  Is that not true?
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Say it's true for the camera, everybody.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  Say it's true.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I do, of course.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  That's not a problem.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I refuse to take your test a million percent.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  And everybody in here, Canadian citizens, you can refuse the test.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Just say no.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Don't wait in line.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  And there's nothing they can do.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Okay, I will not yell.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  That's true.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  I just want you guys to acknowledge for 91,000 people watching that anybody can refuse the
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  test.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Perfect.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Thank you.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  You guys hear that?
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Straight from the horse's nose, straight from the police, refuse the test.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Oh, I'm getting a ticket.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Oh, not another one of those tickets.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  You know, tell everybody how many people have been convicted of those tickets in Canada.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Answer, zero.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  How many people have been charged?
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Thousands.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  How many people convicted?
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Zero.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Why?
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  It's a violation of our charter rights.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  So when that ticket goes to court, they throw it the f**k out.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  It's that simple.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  So I'm waiting for my little five.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Thanks, guys.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  I just want everybody to acknowledge that this is perfectly legal, perfectly acceptable.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Thank you.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Well, that is the future of the resistance.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Bill Gates admits it's a permanent lockdown.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Klaus Schwab, no jobs.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  You're allowed to even meet people, talk to people.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  You have to be locked in your house.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  You got to have a vaccine every time you travel.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  A new one, whatever they want your body untested.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I mean, this is just a complete takeover.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  We're going to go to break.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Come back with Chris Sky.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And I tell you, he's on Instagram for now.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Instagram forward slash telegram at real Chris Sky.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  You got to go to his websites too.

[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  We've got to start organizing.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  We've got to start saying no.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  And by the way, you got to fund the resistance.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  We've got a big sale, store-wide free shipping on storeable food.

[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.

[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well.

[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, world governments out in the open
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  with the World ID force inoculations run by Bill Gates and the United Nations.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  And Canada's Prime Minister says Communist China is the model for dictatorship.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Close quote.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  There's no longer any doubt.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  You're either with the enemy or you're with freedom.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Well, Chris Sky isn't trying to live in a free country for free.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  He's putting it on the line.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  And just like Alfie Oaks down in Naples saying,
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  we're Masked in the Score and everybody loves it.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Well, he's out there fighting as well.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  I'm going to tell you, the Canadian police are very subservient to the tyranny.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  They've been violating people's rights.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  They're here to lay it out for us, the model of the future.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Because what's happening in Canada is coming here, folks.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  It's already here.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Chris Sky, we salute you back to work.biz.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  You guys are still under lockdown.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Thank you for having me, man.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Been watching you for a very, very long time.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Well, brother, you're doing more than I'm doing when it comes to getting on the front lines.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  Tell us why you did it, when you did it, the aftermath, and just you've got the floor.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Okay.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Well, everybody knows that I've been probably one of the main lockdown speakers,
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  not just in Canada, but all around the world.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  I've been speaking about it since last March.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  I've been all over, like I said, I was in Ireland in September.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  When I came back from Ireland, I did a speech September 26th.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  I went to Ireland and I warned everybody that instead of opening them on September 20th,
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  they were going to lock them down.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  They were going to introduce the five tier level lockdown.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  And I tried to warn the Irish population and I even stayed there till the 20th of September
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  when they got locked down and then I came back home.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  When I came back home, I was on quarantine.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  I don't believe in quarantine if you're not sick.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  Quarantines for sick people, not healthy people.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  So I was planning on going to the protest.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  Oh, here's the clip right here.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  This is made on September 26th.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  Six days after I got back from Ireland, I was on quarantine.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  And we're going to play that next segment, but tell folks how you knew.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  You got the document through the Canadian government of the UN that later was confirmed.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Yes, it wasn't even just a Canadian document.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  It was basically a worldwide document.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  And they gave a little bit of leeway to all the different countries on how to implement
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  and then how to sell it to the people.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  But one thing was clear.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  There's five levels of lockdown.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Level five was basically the Australia style where you're not allowed to go 500 meters from your house
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  and they have total complete control over you, checkpoints, all the rest of it.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Level one, you're still on a lockdown.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  You're still forced to wear a mask.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  The idea that we're going to be getting the masks off anytime soon is ridiculous.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  They plan on keeping the masks on people for years because that's how they're going to perpetuate the compliance,
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  perpetuate the idea that there's something to be afraid of, et cetera.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  So it was easy to say.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  And I told the people in Ireland that was going to happen and it happened.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  And I came back to Canada.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  And on September 26th, I went to the protest and I did my speech there knowing that I was violating quarantine,
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  knowing I was going to at least get ticketed and I didn't get ticketed, but it wasn't a big deal.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  And I told everybody exactly what was going to happen then.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  I said they're going to bring us on a lockdown.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  By the end of the year, we're going to be completely locked down.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  They're going to try to cancel Christmas on us.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  They're going to try to cancel the Santa Claus parade, which is the biggest event we have in all of Canada.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  And I said after Christmas, once they got you locked down, once we're in the Canadian winter and it's really cold,
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  then they're really going to put the screws to you.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  They're going to start tightening travel restrictions, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  But the most important thing that everybody has to realize is in Canada and the United States, we have something called rights.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Rights are like a secret superpower that every citizen has.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  But you have to exercise them or they go away.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  And I want you to spend a whole segment on that.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  But let's get back to this document that first broke in Canada, I guess, about six, eight months ago.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And then we later, I searched it to see if it was real and we found the UN original document that was just changed a little bit for each country.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  They denied it at the time, but now it's all admitted.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And it's not like you go into level one, level two, level three, you go into level one, level two, back to level one, then level four, then back to level two,
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  then level five, then you're never out of total martial law, locked in your house, contact tracers, forced inoculations, anywhere you go, total permanent tyranny.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  So this is literally the frog in the pot as they raise the temperature.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  Yes.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  It starts with the mass, the mass of the foundation of all the other restrictions.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  That's why when you hear people say, oh, it's just a mask or any other propaganda that they repeat from the TV, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Because without the mask, there would be no contact tracing.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Without the contact tracing, there'd be no force testing.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Without the force testing, there'd be no force quarantine.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Without the force quarantine, there'd be no travel restrictions or any other restrictions.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  Then we have the businesses.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Part of this whole framework is, like you said, this is all about globalization.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  This is all about consolidating the governments of the world into one type of superpower, if you will.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  And the number one thing they got to get rid of is small business, because small business is independence.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  So that's why I created Back to Work, the nonprofit.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Because at the beginning of this, it was quite clear that the target of this is small business.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  They're going broke while Amazon had a big business and making record profits.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  So the idea that you have to comply to get out of this is the complete absurdity.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  The more you comply, the more restrictions they put on you, the longer they keep extending everything.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  It was two weeks, almost 52 weeks ago, and people are still complying,
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  still saying they'll do whatever it takes, whatever the government tells them.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  I don't know how many times people need to be lied to or how many times people need to be told.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  The government is not your friend. They're here to control you.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  And by the time they hit level five, they're going to say it's the few dissenters that don't go along with this.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  We've got to put them in jail permanently, then you'll actually get out.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  But then nobody ever gets out, mission complete, planetary dictatorship.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Well, they already got me on conditions because they've arrested me so many times this year.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  I was arrested going to the East Coast just to go speak.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  I got arrested on an airplane by the RCMP, which is the equivalent of the Canadian FBI.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  They made up some completely false charges just so they could basically kidnap me off the airplane
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  and prevent me from speaking in New Brunswick and Halifax, two separate cities on two separate days.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  Thankfully, I got out and they were forced to let me go back to Toronto, which I did.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  And then when I was in Toronto, January 23rd, they issued an emergency order,
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  a new emergency order that prohibited our right to assembly.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  So now anybody that was at a protest that we had been doing for months and months and months
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  with the complete support of the Toronto Police, anybody that spoke at a protest got arrested.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  People like Talia and Wolf have been arrested three times.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Lamont Dago has been arrested a couple of times.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  So I told everybody, don't do a protest.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  If you go to the protest, you're going to get a grab, you're going to get arrested.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  I go, you know what you can do? Everybody can go for a walk because we're downtown Toronto
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  and the nicest places. So we had thousands and thousands of people walking.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  We're in the heart of downtown Toronto, high class area. None of us are wearing masks.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  I told everybody, let's go shopping. Everybody go in the stores, masks free, which is your right.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  You can claim your medical exemption. Everybody has the right to an exemption.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  They're not allowed to ask you what your condition is.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  They're not allowed to ask you for a doctor's note.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  They're not allowed to ask you to approve your condition.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  And above all, they're not allowed to deny you service.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  So we went into multiple stores. We started with, I believe, Shoppers Drug Mart.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  They didn't give us a problem at all. We had about 30, 40 people in there, masks free.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  We didn't want to go crazy over capacity or anything like that to scare people.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Everyone went in there shocked. So we weren't trespassing. We weren't breaking any laws.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  And we just marched down Young Street and Bloor area and went into a whole bunch of different stores.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  Every store we went to, they called a whole bunch of police there.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  You saw patty wagons, you saw police trying to intimidate people, trying to tell people to leave the store.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  You know what you didn't see? Not one bylaw officer.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And the whole thing with masks is a bylaw. And why didn't they have a bylaw officer there?
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Because if a bylaw officer was there, we had the law printed out.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  I would have read it out loud to them. The bylaw officer would have agreed that everything we were doing is perfectly legal
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  and no store can deny anybody without wearing a mask.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  And that is the key. That is the key because this is all done color of law.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  There's just steamrolling us until it all gets accepted.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  And what you're seeing right there on the screen that you just saw, the people walking down that steps,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  that was the day they made masks mandatory in Toronto.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And that was me taking a whole bunch of men, women and children, about 100 of us, to the TTC, which is the subway,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  where masks were supposedly mandatory. And we brought all those people on there, masks free. Everybody claimed an exemption.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Chris Sky, you give me faith in humanity. Stay there. We're going to play the clip of you going to Ireland,
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  giving you the exact day, months before they'd be locked down, showing that the UN is in global control.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Incredible. We'll be right back.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  Even before I had access to this show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought,
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  man, that looks fun. In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  What do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  We're not worthy. We're not worthy.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  That, for me, is really set down and disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  that we will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  America is about to have its energy cut off. Its borders destroyed.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Its dollar brought down to nothing.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  We sit here as good people get upset about that, and we try to stop it, and we should.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us, and raping us, and attacking us,
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  we just have to point out we try to stop it.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  So prepare yourselves, America. You're going under a judge but just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  This is the truth. This is the InfoWars.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at infowarsstore.com and Dr. Jones Naturals.com

[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  I tell you, Chris Sky gives me hope. He's smart. He's dynamic. He's on target. He's a leader.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  That's what we need more of.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  I'm very honored to have him, very honored to learn he's a listener. I've seen his work quite a bit,
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  but I didn't know that he was a listener and I'm very thankful that our producers were able to get him on quickly.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  But boy, this is just crazy. People don't understand. This is premeditated.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  And that's how he could go to Ireland and say on this exact date, months from now, they'll intensify the lockdown,
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  not remove it as they promised to do because he had the UN document. He had the formulae.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Next segment, listeners pointed this out, we found a document from 11 years ago when lockstep came out, 2010,
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  where I say they're going to lock down the borders, make you wear masks, have checkpoints, force inoculations to travel.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Now, no one cares when I read lockstep 11 years later. It's like, oh, so what? But to see the younger Alex Jones,
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  and see people think it's like magic, like how does Chris Sky know the exact date because the Irish now listen to him.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  I've seen the articles are like, because it's like superstition.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Don't care if you're American, Irish, we're all the same. You can be African, whatever.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  It's like, it's like people think you're magic. They're like, whoa, how do you know that?
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Because it's a damn premeditated operation. And so everything he's saying is absolutely on target.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  So Chris, I interrupted you earlier because I wanted you to get into what currently happened before we got into your rights.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  People knowing their rights and we would have more rights here, but rights are really what we demand.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  So you've got as much rights as I've got, even if the Canadian Constitution doesn't say it.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  But even according to your constitution or your charter, you've got amazing rights that should be defended.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  It's only pointing out rights that already exist.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  But what I wanted to hit first was you mentioned the Ireland clip.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Set this up. We'll tell folks the date. Cover some more of those areas. Then we'll get into rights.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  Okay. Well, really quick, I just want to finish what happened on the day when I did the massless shopping.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  So we went to all the stores of massless shopping. They wouldn't bring the bylaw. Police came everywhere.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  Right. They intimidate. I'm talking really fast because I know time is limited.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  We'll keep it long. We need to affect. I'm excited to people ask me. They go, Jones, are you on cocaine or meth?
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  No, I had one cup of coffee this morning. I start talking about global government with Klaus Schwab,
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  saying I'll be locked in my house and won't ever get meat again. And I can't have a car.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  They're going to force will be a knock. Evacuate me and my kids. I'm going to have to fight back. I'm pissed.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  This is cold. It's like when you go to football. They get excited. Sorry. Go ahead.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  It's a survival. So anyway, after everybody dispersed, after we were successful going into all the stores,
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  the last store we went into was Whole Foods because it's partially owned by Amazon.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  I walked back to my car alone. I had one bodyguard who was a senior citizen from the Ukraine.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  And she saw as soon as I got to my car, I got sworn by the police. I got arrested.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  They charged me with four counts of public mischief and a count of public nuisance.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  They ended up letting me out that day. They gave me all these ridiculous conditions.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  I was supposedly banned from the city of Toronto. They wanted me to hand over all my legally owned firearms.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  And then I had a condition that states that I have to abide by the emergency order.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  So right now, I'm on quarantine at home. Normally, if I left my house right now,
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  all they could do is charge me under the quarantine act and give me one of those stupid ticket violations,
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  which I would fight in court and it would get thrown out. Now, if I leave my house,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  they can charge me with a breach of my conditions, which is a serious criminal charge.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  And because they've already arrested me so many times this year, they can make a case not even to give me bail.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  So with all this lockdown stuff, the way they manipulated the law,
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  so if I leave my house right now, I could basically get locked up without bail for six months.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  Well, that's what I was going to say next. In Germany, it's the same.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  Where they bust in on people, medical doctors doing online seminars about how this is a fraud.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  Where they swat team people in Canada that are online, live, criticizing what's going on.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  It's clearly the cover with contact tracers to arrest their political opposition in the future.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  And they're already doing it. I mean, it will take Australia where they arrest all these people
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  because they're online criticizing the lockdown.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Yeah, that's what they're trying to do in Canada next. They're trying to do an online speech law.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  They're already really censoring social media, as you know, but they're trying to take it a step further.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  But with regards to what you were just, what we were just getting at.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  No, that's what I do on the show too. There's so many damn things. They have you locked up in your house now.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  You're going straight to the house.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  I wanted to let everybody know that when you come home from another country, they're trying to stop everybody from traveling.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  The reason they want everybody not to travel is because when you go to these other countries,
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  you're seeing that you're not locked down in these places, places like Mexico, they're partying.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  All these other countries are open for business, having good time.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  They want you to think everybody's living like Canada, masked up, terrified and afraid.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Exactly. The more locked down, they never want you to leave because they want to keep you in that bubble
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  and take full control to finish the final takeover.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  Exactly. They want to control your perception 100%.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  They don't want any outside influences breaking their brainwashing over you.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  So they came up with all these crazy rules.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  Oh, when you come home, we're going to forcibly test you so you're going to stand in line for two or three hours.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  And then we're going to make you go to a hotel and we're going to keep you there locked up like an animal
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  or a criminal in solitary confinement.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  So you definitely don't want to travel.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  It's absolute hogwash, just like I showed on the video.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  We have rights. Canadians have rights.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Section six of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is freedom of movement.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  That means Canadians can come and go from Canada as they please.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  They can move around Canada as they please without any type of confinement, without any type of harassment.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  Then we have section 14.1 of the Quarantine Act.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  And it very explicitly states what the government is allowed to do when they're trying to see if you have a communicable disease.
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  And they're allowed to do things like ask you health questions, observe for symptoms, take a temperature check,
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  but they are not allowed any invasive type of medical procedure.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  And that obviously includes something something up your nose, in your mouth, in your butt now they even have.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  So all of that is completely illegal and they're only using the threat of these stupid fines to try to coerce people into going.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  And the fines are toilet paper.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  There's been thousands and thousands of people charged with these fines.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  And all that happens is you bring it to court.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  You could say the same thing.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Violation of section six.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  Violation of 14.1.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  They have state laws that you don't have to wear a mask if you have anxiety, but then they try to ignore it all the facilities.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  Exactly. On top of that.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  But as soon as it goes to court, it gets thrown out.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  So when you come home from a vacation, if you're a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, you have the same rights.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  You simply say, I'm a citizen or a permanent resident.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  Here's the key.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Here's the key.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  You say that beautifully in your video to their faces with 90,000 people watching at the time on your own stream.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Beautiful.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  People understand, like you said, complying only makes the lockdown longer and worse and it never ends.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Only not complying.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  So that they broke the social contract.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  We think comply for a reasonable problem.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  No, we're not complying for a reasonable problem.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  This is an authoritarian UN, world government, big pharma, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab takeover on record.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  And that's what I talked about September 26.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  I did a video.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  I want you guys to play it.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  Andrew says from Rebel filmed it.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  It was like a prediction video and it said everything that was going to happen.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  And I've seen this video translated into so many different languages.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  I lost count.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  I was just in Istanbul two weeks ago and I just ran into somebody on the street and they might know my numbers public.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  So this person, what's at me, the video of me with Turkish subtitles.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  And this video got, I think, close to a million views in one copy.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  And the way the accuracy is laid out is unparalleled.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  And it's like you said, it's not because I'm psychic.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  It's because this stuff is planned so far in advance that they have to have it written down.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  They have to have documents.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  There are whistleblowers in the government and the police department that are trying to get this stuff out there because they don't want to get fired.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  All the prestigious doctors and scientists, including the Lancet, is saying the PCR tests are fraud and the COVID is killing most of these people.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  PCR tests were already invalidated in the Portuguese court because everybody knows that the false positives outweigh the actual positives,
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  especially when they up the cycle count.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  In Canada right now, they up the cycle count to something like 30, 35, even up to 40 in some cases.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  What that means for the layman's terms is they're increasing the sensitivity of the test.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  So basically anything that you have in your system, it could have been a flu shot.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  It could have been a COVID vaccine.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  It could have been you had COVID months ago.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  It could have been that you had a cold.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  It could have been that you had the flu.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Any little thing will come up as COVID.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  And then they call you a COVID case.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  And then they pretend that they have to have us locked down.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  And by the way, that's another key point you just dropped.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  That's why people that have had even their second round are showing COVID positive.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  So now Fauci said, even if you had the vaccine, you can't go out in public.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  You can't wear a mask.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Who made this guy God?
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  He's a little fraud.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  He said you can't.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  You can't not wear a mask.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  And that's what I say in the video September 26.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  They already tell everybody way back then, they're going to tell you to take the vaccine.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  That's going to get you back to normal.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  Then in reality, once you take the vaccine, they're going to tell you the vaccine is not as effective as we thought.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  We don't know if you're not contagious or you're still going to have to wear your mask,
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  but you're still going to have to get vaccinated.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  By the way, that's really bad for your spinus to jam it all the way up in your head like that.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  There's so many contaminants in the air.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  There's a lot of evidence showing they're actually infecting people with other viruses and bacteria.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  These facilities.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Stay there.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  We'll come right back.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  I know the Chinese government got caught tainting them.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And I know it's all planned.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century,
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  you have to understand that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  And it really does come down to that.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  God is the author of us having free will.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them,
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  They play God and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level,
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  I have the Holy Spirit, I'm the connection with God.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  And I know that God does not like to expect you to not join the enemy.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power along with it.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  That's a fact.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  It's all being announced.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  And big corporations downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Do you understand?
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  And now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting next year it will begin.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  Did you hear me?
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Employee wars continue to spread the word and fight back.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  And I tell a lot of our guests you're on fire because we have guests on there on fire.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  They can call this broadcast on fire.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Chris Guy during that break, man, he was telling me all this amazing stuff.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Will you please?
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Because it makes me very proud of the listeners for supporting us over the years.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  There's so many activists I get on like you, you know, ended up waking up because of the show.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  You're saying you've been listening to this broadcast since you were a child.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Brother, tell folks about that.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Oh my gosh, we the first video I saw of you must have been in like 2002, just after 9 11 happened.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And I've been a fan since then.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  So I was probably around 14 or 15 years old then we're talking over 20 years ago.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  So to be on the show is a complete honor.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  And just like you, I live and breathe this.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  I sleep like maybe three hours every 24 hours.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  Everybody that knows me know this.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  That's the spirit though because when you know you're under attack and you're not hateful,
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  you're not bitter, you're winning, you're laughing, you're dominating, you're crushing them.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Yeah.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  So I have a lot of energy.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  I just eat a lot.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  I don't sleep, but I eat a lot.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  That's for sure.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  Well, brother, you're kicking ass.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Let's play that clip that probably has 100 million views.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  I mean, in fact, when you made that clip, I've forgotten.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  I saw this months ago and have like 5 million views.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  And as fast as they take it down, it goes back up in like every language out there.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  So here is probably the 50th ripped generation of you laying out the battle plan.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  And folks now are like, oh, this guy's a prophet.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  No, you have their battle plan.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Here it is.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Don't need a math.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  The math is about compliance, because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  So they tell you, you have to wear a mask.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Next, they're going to tell you, you have to contact trace.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Then they're going to tell you, you have to take the vaccine.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  And then guess what, kids?
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was going to be.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  So now you still got to wear your mask, still got to get contact trace,
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  still have all the restrictions and social distancing, and still take your vaccine.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel, your business was closed,
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  they took your rights and freedoms, they forced the vaccine on you.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  And what happened?
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  The same amount of people died, everything is the exact same.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  And now they're going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  so they can do the same thing again.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  Bring you from July, August, and September getting you off lockdown.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  It's nice to bring you back on lockdown again.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  If you haven't figured it out yet, it's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take your wealth.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  Why? So you become dependent on government.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Why? If you're independent, the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck to feed your family every month
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  because they closed your business on you, now the government doesn't work for you,
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  the government rules you.
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Instead of a middle class, we have the government, upper class,
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  In other words, we have a slave class.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  And that's what they're trying to do. It's that simple.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  All right, thanks a lot, Chris.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  And you were telling me days before they came to your house and threatened to arrest you
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  if you spoke in public again. I mean, that's not a free country.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  Actually, the day before that, because they knew I came back on the 20th of September.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  On the 25th of September, they came to my house knowing that the 26th I'd be at the protest
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  and the police openly said, if you go to the protest,
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  we're going to charge you under the Quarantine Act criminally.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  And I said, go for it. I'm going to the protest. I went to the protest.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  I made that video. They charged me. They gave me a ticket.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  The mainstream media came up just to film them giving me the ticket.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  I looked at the ticket. They spelled my first and last name wrong on the ticket.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  I went back on the podium, got on the mic.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  I publicly challenged them to give me a proper ticket so I could challenge it in court.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  They didn't. The next week while I was still on quarantine,
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  I went back to the protest again. This time, Maxime Bernier,
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  the leader of the PPC was there and Rob Carbone,
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  leader of the Republican Party of Canada was there.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  And we all took pictures together. Nobody told them to quarantine.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  Nobody told them to stay away from me, anything like that.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  The next day, I got charged criminally under the Quarantine Act.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  I'm the only person in the history of Canada to get charged criminally.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  I took it to court. I've been trying to go ahead at the court and get a trial
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  because I know I could file multiple charter challenges and win.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  Guess what they've done? They postponed on me four times so far.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  And I have another court date coming up and I guess what they're going to do again.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  I'm going to ask them for a disclosure. I'm going to ask them for a trial
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  and they're not going to give it to me.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Listen, brother, you're on the war room tomorrow, Chris.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  I want to invite you back to take calls for a full two hours, Friday or Sunday,
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  whatever day you want because...
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Any day. I'm proud to hear. If I leave, I'm screwed.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  If I leave my house, if I go one step off my property, they're watching from both sides,
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  they're going to grab me, they're going to arrest me, they're going to make a case
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  that I don't get bail because they've already arrested me three times.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  But I'll tell you what's beautiful about this in a sick way.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  All these cops that follow illegal orders, they're losing their future too.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  Are they idiots? This has meant to permanently collapse the world economy
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  and bring in total tyranny. Don't these idiots get it?
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  That a lot of them do. I want to make this very, very, very clear.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  First of all, the cops in the video you saw at the airport, the police officer is my bad.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  As soon as the cameras stopped rolling, they were so nice to me
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  and not just professionally nice, genuinely nice.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  If you saw the Rebel interview that was made the same day immediately after that...
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  No, I agree. Right here in Austin, the whole time, the cops have been the most awake about the mask.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  They all know me. They know statistics. Cops know statistics.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  And they know statistically we had the same number of deaths globally last year than the year before.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  There's the police officer shaking my head. That's right after the airport.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  As soon as we stopped filming, they escorted me towards the exit.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  David Menzies from Rebel News was waiting for me.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  He saw the police officers escort me out gently.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  They all shook my hand. They walked away.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  I did my interview with Rebel and I went home. No problems, no accidents.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Let's talk about rights and solutions and organizing tomorrow.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Come on for at least an hour tomorrow. We're going to schedule you right now. Go in the war room as well.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  I'm going to end this segment with a two and a half minute video
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  for myself in 2010, reading from Operation Lockstep and predicting what would happen
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  in the coming years under the Rockefeller World Government takeover.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Thanks, Guy. Back to work.biz. We salute you. We appreciate you.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  You're on Twitter still at Chris. S-A-C-C-O-C-C-I-A-1.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  And of course, back to work.biz and gitmad.online.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  We salute you, brother. I look forward to speaking to you tomorrow.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  My pleasure. Thank you for having me. I look forward to being on your show some more.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  God bless you. Yeah, folks. I'm not on a power trip about having dinner with, you know, Brad Pitt or Charlie Sheen.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  I don't care about being in Richard Linkletter movies, you know, he's a nice guy.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  I don't care about any of this. I care about knowing people like Chris Sky and people like Alfie Oaks
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  and Tucker Carlson and all these folks. These are real human beings. You're real human beings.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  And I am just so honored to be here. I am so thankful that the listeners keep us on air.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  I am so thankful that you appreciate us and put up with me. I love you. We're in this together
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  and we're going to beat this together with God's help. But that's why the Southern Property Law Center sent me an email today going,
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  we have witnesses coming out that you told them you hate your audience. Why the hell would I do that?
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Even if it was true, I wouldn't. Pure bull. They're trying to separate us from each other.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  We're all under real attack. But it's not going to work. We stand behind Trump even though he's not perfect.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  You stand behind me even though I'm not perfect. I stand behind you even though you're not perfect.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Because we've all, we've got is us together. And man, this damn thing's a plan.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  You think I'm happy about this? You think I'm happy I've been proven right? No, I'm not.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  But you know what? We're going to beat this thing together. And let me tell you,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and all the criminals that launched this. They're a big organized crime.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  These big corporations. Hitler thought he was too big to fail.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  The Southern Union thought they were too big to fail. GZ Pink thinks he's too big to fail. They will fail.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I'm going to play this report where we predicted it all 10 years ago, 11 years ago, and then Steve Quill's coming up next hour.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  Here's the report.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful. And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  Because I've had chills since last night. This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family,
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  everything that's in the other documents. But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And the hell we're already living in. This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com. The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I pray to God. I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this harm.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  And to give me the strength to carry on. Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  I know why. Because it's scary.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends. You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life. It should take over your life.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  Like about 18 and 25, I left Tennessee very much alive. I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud if I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Coming up next segment for the Battle of the Hour, the great Steve Quail is going to be our guest to talk about the open announcements of FEMA camps and mass arrests of patriots
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  and a war on terror and general idea racing. He'll get our guns. I mean, this is crazier than anything he ever said or I ever said, even though we were dead on.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  That's coming up. You saw me play part of that broadcast from 2010 where I read Operation Lockstep and told you how they'd roll it out.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  I told you the rest of the story. We're going to play a little bit more of that clip coming up as well.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to get down to brass tacks with everybody right here.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  I appreciate the viewers and the listeners. And I want to stay on air and fight the globalists.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  It takes a lot of money to prosecute this war. It takes a lot of money to have your own network, your own servers, your own systems, your own satellite, uplink, your own facilities, your own legal, your own janitors, your own warehouse.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  We had to do it all because we were the most banned first. So I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for underwriting us.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  And I want to thank you for your support and your will and your strength and your prayers.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  It is your will that is powering in force. I can feel your will. I can feel your strength.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  And just as I get mad at myself when I'm weak or I don't understand everything, I get mad at my friends and family sometimes as well, but I love you all.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  And I am just extremely thankful to be in this position and to be going through all of this together because we're going to win in the end.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Christ is king and we know the devil's real, but that means God's real as well.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  I had talked to my Patriots supply, the number one storeable food company in the United States of the world really, only 14 years old, because they've got such servers and such quality and such fast delivery, they become the biggest company.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  And they said, listen, we can't do the discounts anymore and we can't do the free shipping because there isn't enough markup.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  We're not making money. You're not making money. We got to keep the lights on, Jones. We're already the lowest price for high quality.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  And I called him up during the ice storm and I said, look, we've habituated everybody to sales.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  And they said, you're right. We don't care. We'll sell it basically at cost. You'll get your percentage to pay for your operation.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  How about free shipping to Alex? And I said, are you being sarcastic? And the owner doesn't want his name mentioned, said, no, free shipping and 10% off.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  That's such an insane deal. It makes my head spin. But he said, you can only run it for seven days.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  And so that's that seven days starting today, 10% off and free shipping already great, high quality, trouble food.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  You cannot beat that deal, but it's part of the four to five year supplies special. And I'll be honest with listeners, I never used to talk like this.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  You see off the air at any time. You see hundreds of publications saying FBI is put right up in jail.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  You see all the headlines arrest Alex Jones, trending on Twitter, kill Alex Jones, and I'm not a wimp. I'm not whining. I'm not bitching.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  I just know this is very serious. So get your t-shirts, get your books, get your films. We've got all those preparedness books, preparedness films massively discounted,
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  up to 50% off X to turbo force for mobility. The privacy policies are discounted, knockout, sleep support, ultimate grill oil back in stock discounted, ultra 12 winter sun.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  They're all 25 to 50% off with free shipping, which is massive. So I got to sell a lot of product.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  And one reason I decided to do this, even though we've learned to run lean, we don't keep a lot of stuff in the warehouse when you order something, we've got it ready to ship.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  But I basically don't have a lot of stuff in the warehouse anymore because I just sell what we've got and that's it.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  I don't keep a stop pile because I don't have the money and they could arrest me at any time.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And then we've got people to keep stay on air and try to keep operating as long as we can after that.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  But they've tried to silence us. It's not working. So now I'm not going to tell you the stuff they're doing.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  It doesn't intimidate me at all. It actually gives me energy, but they've got a lot of stuff going on.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  So they think intimidates us. It doesn't intimidate us. It only makes us know we're definitely over the target.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  So it could be your last chance to get products at infowarstore.com.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  It could be your last chance to get storeable food. I mean, they can start a major war, turn the lights out any day.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  I mean, we're under globalist takeover. We're under God's judgment. This is only going to get crazier from here on out.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I told you that when they stole the election from Trump, I said, don't go to sleep because the start's just begun with this.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  So we may go on for years. We may turn things around.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  All I know is if you want to support us now's the time, we've been proven right.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  All hell's breaking loose. We've got the best deals ever.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  And we're not globalists. Take your money and use it against you. We're patriots that fight against tyranny.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Infowarstore.com, fortify your supply, mega sale, free shipping.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  It's going to have to end soon, so please take advantage of it right now.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  All right, we're going to go to break and come back with Steve Quayle.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  You know, I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's going on.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  The global government in the New World Order. Now that people woke up in fact that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  Well, Trump sure has held pride. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple,
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  depending on the drug once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed,
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  Humanity was doing a great job trying to struggle free from the grips of world government,
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  but it wasn't enough of a spiritual Christian movement to break the chains of Satan.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  God has to do that in the end. It's not up to us to win this. It's up to us to persevere to the end,
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  to meet with our Creator through this test. Everything in life is a test. Everything is a dance.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Everything is already choreographed by God by giving us consciousness and free will, but God still knows the outcome,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  but still his children had to go through the test.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  Steve Quayle is the best-selling author, filmmaker, researcher, survivalist.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  One of the first big survivalists. He's been on air over 30 years.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  I'd hear him on air 30 years ago and thought, he sounds legitimate. Doesn't sound like he's lying, but he's going too far.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  It turned out he was just too far ahead. And so he joins us to get into the announcements of reeducation camps,
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  of martial law, of all Trump supporters must be reeducated, of cutting off our pipelines,
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  opening our borders. Biden, coming up and play the video, pledged allegiance to the great reset.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  That's the technical name of this whole operation.
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  That's really the public name of it. The scientific name is the operation lockstep.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  So that's all coming up here, ladies and gentlemen. Steve Quayle joins us, and I really appreciate him coming on.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  Steve, it's so surreal. People overuse that word, but to know this was all coming, to see him setting it up,
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  to see the beta testing, and then you always warning that once they launch, though, it won't be beta anymore,
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  it'll all accelerate. And now we've accelerated like it warped speed, and it's just getting more nightmarish by the moment.
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  And so there's this paradox of huge awakenings, but also those that are under deception are accepting now more and more.
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  And in downtown Austin, a large part of the public, when we go videotape them, actually behave like hunchback demons or something.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  So just a lot of weirdness is going on. Thank you for joining us, my friend.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Well, Alex, I think you've nailed it. And the bottom line is the entire nation has turned largely against the living God and embraced Satanism,
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  the Luciferians, and ladies and gentlemen, for all these years, we've been called every name you can call us, but quote,
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  conspiracy theorists. And first of all, every single conspiracy we've named has now come into play.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  We told you the globalists were going to try and steal the government. We told you there are FEMA camps.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  We told you, ladies and gentlemen, about all the military plans.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  And even now, Fortress America simply means that the politicians who have sold us out and sold us to foreign interests,
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  and you'd be surprised at how much Chinese money went into back the leading politicians.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're at the time.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  Now, Texas is a microcosm of the war that's going to be absolutely in place and exerted against the entire United States of America.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Somebody called it Tex again. And Alex, we've been talking about everything from weather war affairs.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  We've been talking about foreign troops. We've been talking about, by the way, some people don't get it, but there's 256,000.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  That's a real number of guillotines dispersed throughout the FEMA camps, military bases and different places around the world.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  I couldn't know that unless somebody, excuse me, who had access to that.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  And didn't they put it in the last Defense Authorization Act to use guillotines again?
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  Yes, they did. And it's now an official acceptable form of absolute capital punishment.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  And I heard you 30 years ago saying, and when they're about to make their move, they'll legalize guillotines and I'm like, this guy's a whack job.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  They just did it last year.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Yep. And here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is really critical.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  Again, the weather modification against Texas was for basically four different reasons.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  Number one, succession. Number two, the lawsuits against the stolen election.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  Number three, Texas's oil and livestock industry.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  Number four, I just made a quick note of myself, you know, the ability of Texas to actually with their economy and the amount of people that have distilled the patriotic fervor.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  Now, when I see Austin, Alex, you know, I wonder about that.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  But here's the thing.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  Sure. But the Texas idea of being our own country and self sufficient what we were, they had to discredit that.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  As Chuck E. Schumer said, now maybe we've learned our lesson, but we now know it was ERCOT and the globalist order to stand down. We have the document.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  Absolutely. So here's the deal.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  The entire United States is going into a forced famine.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  There's nothing in the pipelines that I tell people this next to food.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Alex has told you about, you know, the food supply, you've got to get it.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  But all of the supplements, Alex, every supplement you have, I said years ago, the food will go and then they'll.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  They, the globalist Luciferians.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  Oh, we already can't get most of the supplements. A lot of this is our last runs.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  We've already gotten rid of some products. We just can't get it.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  Right. And that's the thing they want to starve us.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  And I tell you what, when the richest guy in the world, the Gates of Hell makes a statement that you and I should eat artificial meat.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  Hello, everybody. That's why Texas was chosen.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  I've been talking about weather modification and weather warfare for 25 years.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  And the thing that people got to understand, every defense secretary has talked about it.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  There's the United Nations Treaty against it.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  The most sophisticated weapons are 72 ionospheric heaters.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  So this is to starve you into compliance.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And by the way, Alex, you made the statement. It's true.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  125 million people have to die according to the globalists.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  All of the statements have all made from all the political left.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  They're going to get rid of Trump supporters. They're going to get rid of gun owners.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  And I want to share this. Every gun owner, you've got to understand that the battlefield is coming to your front door.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  And in essence, you watch the country get stolen. Supreme Court, they are no longer supreme.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  We've watched our Congress sell us out. We've watched the election stolen.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  We've watched the technocrats build the ultimate surveillance system in China.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  And I said all along, and so did you, Alex, that they're just going to bring it to the United States.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, by the way, Facebook is Tracebook.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Cellophones, I call them Halophones, and we've heard all of the things.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, Alex and I, you remember this, Alex, 20 years ago, we talked about Marcus Wolf of the Stasi.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  You have Demi Primicop, the former head of...
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  Let me stop here. I had you on like 20 years ago.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  It was 20 years ago. It was right from 9-11. You go, they hired Marcus Wolf and a million dollar program in the congressional budget.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  I thought you were wrong. I went and looked it up and it was in the budget.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Years later, they admitted it. They admitted Google and Facebook hired all of his adjuncts to actually run their operations.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  That's mainstream news.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  And it is. And so what was Facebook? What is Twitter? What is all of social media?
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Look at all of us who are warning about it. We've all been de-platformed. I just found out I'm banned in more countries yesterday.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  But what's fascinating is simply this.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  They have created self-erecting or basically self-building intelligence dossiers on our video.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  How many people don't get jobs because they're bragging on Facebook, going out and getting hammered or whatever.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  But it's worse than that. Every single contact of the Facebook ease.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  And by the way, I came up with the term, I believe it's accurate, Faces of Death Book.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  Obviously all of the different tracking, facial tracking parameters, everything.
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  And the bottom line is, is that ladies and gentlemen, all of these were funded.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  Funded by the Central Intelligence Agency or different intelligence agencies.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  And that's why all of the guys who submitted to it are all billionaires and some of the richest people in the world.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  So here's the thing. Texas, please understand this.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  You had full scale weather war against you, economic warfare against you.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  You heard what Schumer, that piece of, you know, mouthpiece.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  I can't say it, but the bottom line is those people hate you.
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  And so in order to insulate themselves, they brought in the National Guard.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Notice this, even Nancy Palozovic, okay, decided Palozovic, decided to ask for armored personnel carriers with machine guns.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  The most anti-gun spokesman for the demon-cratic party and the Republican whores, Republican whores, absolutely wanted a machine gun.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  And notice he went out and reviewed the armored vehicles like Red Dawn, and they said they're staying until,
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  I meant to play the Leahy clip from yesterday, you guys, get it?
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  Senator Leahy said they stay until we're routed out.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  And so we have permanent martial law in D.C. Let's come back and talk about what they're going to do next.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  Because you're great at telling us what's happening now, but you're really great at telling us what's coming next,
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  the different scenarios and how we decide what those will be and what we can do with Steve Quayle.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  And I'll give you his latest websites as well when we come back. Just absolutely incredible. Stay with us.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  Never. The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee. The crew here loves it. We drink it every day.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support Infowars here.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support Infowars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patria Blend?
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Of course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it 5 stars, except maybe one or two people.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  Patria Blend, 100% organic coffee, only available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  They turned away after hours of freezing in the cold. We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king. And food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storeable foods right now, massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  That's $10 off on our best stainless steel gravity fed filter and 10% off all storeable food in all packages at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  That's InfowarsStore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com. Big discounts probably a few more days.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  Steve Quill.com is the main site. Gen6Giants.com is another big site.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  There are a lot of big films there on TV, you name it. But Steve Quill is definitely the visionary. His books, and I've read them all just decades before, predicted everything.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  And it's just incredible. The last word, Alex Jones, get it all. I got it from the globalist admitting a lot of stuff.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  And then Steve Quill's analysis and my own analysis. But I mean, Steve Quill's been right up there with David Eich and others predicting what was coming.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  And he just deserves the credit, folks, because he was put through a lot of hell for telling the truth.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  And yes, we do carry some of his books at InfowarsStore.com. But the one you need to read is available at SteveQuill.com.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  His weather wars and unnatural disasters. We'll talk about this coming up next segment.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  But let's spend the shorter segment, Steve, getting into... I can't be alarmist enough.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  When you've got Leahy saying, we're not going to leave the troops until the Trump supporters are routed out. And every other pundit saying, we want war, we want death, we want to kill people.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  All of it. I mean, they say they want us in FEMA camps. They have bills that say, reeducation camp centers.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  I mean, this is what Obama wanted to do. You know, Biden is what the third term of Obama? Really, Obyden. Is that accurate? And what do you think's coming next?
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  Well, first of all, what's coming next, by the way, Biden's just the hand puppet. Just substitute the New World Order. Just substitute the death of 90% of the world's population.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  That's what's real. But what's coming first and foremost is basically, Alex, we're going to see border lockdowns.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  And what really infuriated me was when Leahy said, we're not going to take away our, if you will, protective barbed wire, our fortress, Washington, D.C.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  And he said this until the first and second amendment are gone. Ladies and gentlemen, that's treason. That's treason.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  In essence, they, I'll make it simple, Alex. They want everybody dead. They're not coming for the gun owners or coming to murder.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  They, you know, not to arrest them. They'll arrest you.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  I totally agree. So why are they being so honest? Why did Biden last Monday endorse the invasion of Hong Kong and death camps in China?
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  I mean, the whole world was just like, what the hell is this?
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Well, the ties between the current administration and China are off the charts. The amount of money paid to bribe, you know, I mean, come on.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  You can see all of the different compromised, compromised, even Mick McConnell and others compromised, compromised by the Chinese interest.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  So here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen, the two most important rights, in my opinion, the bill of rights is free speech.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  They're killing our ability to speak freely. Second is the second amendment with without it, everybody dies.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  And what makes me furious, Alex, is even the D.E.G.L. report. You and I nailed that years ago stating they're going to take the population of America down to 100 million.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  And for those that don't know, major insurance actuaries have this magic disappearance of large parts of the population coming up soon.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Right. And you can expect, first of all, again, I want to tell people what's headed genocide of the elderly and of the infirm.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  OK, you're going to watch state after state, everything from allowing, you know, merciful death, euthanasia, everything, they're going to basically make total war on the American people.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  They're going to starve us out. And by the way, Alex, when you see all of these empty coolers at whatever market store, whatever supermarket store, what makes people think there will ever be food on the shelves again?
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  I'm telling you, everyone, the plan was with the COVID-19 lockdown.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  It's the cover for the collapse. They can blame it on COVID when the plan was always the great reset to bring us to our knees in their own words.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  Yeah, and absolutely. And then the other thing that false charges, listen, right now, there is no appeal to the courts. There is no appeal.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  A false arrest are happening all over the country. And Biden just released, he just signed a proclamation, I guess you should say, amnesty against all of the Antifa and BLM people.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  Meanwhile, Trump supporters rot in prison.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  That's right. People that shot cops, burned down buildings, they're released, literally. But meanwhile, people that walked between the velvet robes because they didn't know what was happening, a few hundred broke in, a few hundred followed, they're being charged with terrorism.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  Absolutely. And here's what's coming next. You're already seeing it in the headlines of the day, California, the new mutant variation of CV-19, all of the bull manure that was associated with the first lockdown.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you create the problem, CV-19, you provide the solution, oh, our test, and you provide the ultimate thing, vaccination.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  This is the statement, and I made this first on Alex's show years ago, shot in the arm, shot in the head, either way, end up dead, vaccine or a bullet to your head.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  People thought that was so extreme, and I want to share this, the word extremist, the word, they call us everything fear mongers, conspiracy theories.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  And I love the race thing because now anyone pro-human, anyone pro-life is called a racist. We are for the human race. It's actually true. They are anti-carbon, meaning they're anti-human. Why are they so anti-carbon?
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Well, first of all, because they intend, that's a great question, they intend to get rid of humanity or humankind, and I am a human racist too, I believe in the right of the human race to exist, and insert a siliconized life form.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  A good example, sex robots.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  Yeah, but how did you know that 20 years ago when you wrote best selling books on it? Because no one had said that until you did. How did you know their secret plan? Because now they've unveiled it.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Well, here's the deal. Knowing they want to destroy fertility and human fertility, knowing all of the science fiction movies, we're telegraphing it way back into the 50s, actually even back into the 30s and 40s, but the thing is, is that human sexuality will give way.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  That's the same thing with the LGBTQXYZ movement. Obviously, we're seeing the denigration of the human race. We're seeing the depopulation of the human race. I tell people, we've got the dumbest sperm in the world because, and I'm saying in America, because they can't count.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Our sperm counts.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  And it doesn't matter if you're black or white or Hispanic or whatever, all of our sperm is dying. Our future is dying. We're under attack. We should stop killing each other.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  Absolutely. You are an American. You're not an Afro-American. You're not a...
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  I am a human racist. I am pro-human. I am a human racist.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  I think we're pointing the term today here, brother.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Yep. And here's the deal. The deal is, is that all of these life forms, and by the way, I'm on record, and what you're going to see ladies and gentlemen, is all the demons, all the middle-aged, you know, myths and legends come into your literal vision, and you're going to see demon-possessed machines, and all that the technocrats are doing is based on silicon.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  They were talking about eradicating... Yeah, they say the spirit's going to come into the silicon just like they told us in Maximum Overdrive.
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  Absolutely. So everything Hollywood, by the way, every Hollywood movie in science fiction has to get cleared through the intelligence agency.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  You've got to say that. I was talking to a top scientist from MIT at dinner. I'm going to leave it at that.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  And I've another very famous person, and he told me, I said, what's the end game? He said, what Elon Musk said a month ago about endless orgasms from a computer, he said, he said, a sex robot is our main goal.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  And it just seems dumb to me, because I don't want to have sex with a sex doll, but to them, they can become the woman. If they can replace that, they believe they want to stay there.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  Steve Quell is on fire, as always. Gen6Giants.com, Gen6Giants.com, Steve Quell.com, and his book, Weather Wars, An Unnatural Disaster, is amazing.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  We carry some of his books. We should be carrying them all in a polar store. I don't care where you get it. Just be sure and get this book, because it's excellent.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  And by the way, they're admitting weather wars are going on in that polar vortex. You can see China push it with their electromagnetic system.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  That system, they admit they have all the way over to us. We'll be right back.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  We consider to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava-kava, but other herbs, including but not limited to.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  German chamomile, organic skullcap, and valerian root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads saying, everybody, take your vitamin D3, take your zinc, and take your C.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  It's essential for your body cells to maintain your health. Essential means you must have it. It's been sold out for months.

[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  My enemies are your enemies. They're the globalists. They're the extremists. They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda,
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  The bottom line is they want to play God. They are playing God. And the news is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  So many other people want to be positive. They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with new world order.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  At the end of the day, it's all about the population. It's all about world government. It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  And on its ashes, a nightmare being built. Only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  Wow. There is a war on for your mind and my mind.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  Steve Quayle is going to have to join us again next week if he'll do it. He just laid an incredible idea on me and I knew about some of this.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  I was being told about this. Maybe when I mentioned Elon Musk is why he brought this up.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  But a real chink in the enemy's armor is all this technology is advancing.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  But they're mainly targeting the general public and mainline technology or older technology.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  But they're not targeting some of these other areas. And it's a real gap in the globalist defenses.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  And so we're going to talk about that maybe at the end of the show or maybe he comes back and joins us next week.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  But very, very exciting. And we're definitely on the same page. But as usual, a few steps ahead of me.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  So Steve Quayle, we're here. We're talking about all this. You mentioned Senator Leahy.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  Here he is yesterday on TV. And as you mentioned, the full Timon interview, he says,
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  not until we've rotted out the extremist speech and gotten the guns that Schumer's introduced a bill that Biden supports to ban all semi-autos and everything.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  And register everybody else and then have no due process where the Justice Department says you can't have a gun.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  You can't have a gun. You can't have a gun making them imperial. This is so dangerous.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  He said that basically we won't have the troops leave DC until that happens.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  So they're planning on stuff so bad they're worried about a march on DC with pissed off Americans. Here's Senator Leahy.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  I would suggest everybody get together and look at the future because if you have something that goes on for months,
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  the President calling them, everybody else calling them, I worry that there's not more there.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  I think until we've ruled out the hate and throw the raptures through the door that day,
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  no fence or tank or barrier is going to provide the safety we need.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  Come on, safety, but also talk about Franklin says give up. Those who give up a sense of liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  But I know a vote is on and before I close, I do want to commend Chief Haunting for your swift response.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  You don't have an easy job to protect a city as large as Washington DC and balance the delicate balance with other dozens of other law enforcement.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  So Senator Leahy can barely talk. He twists Benjamin Franklin's quote about those that give up essential liberty will have and deserve neither.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  But then he says, oh, no tanks or bar bar fences will protect us, but they got to stay till we've routed out the hate.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  Wow, they burned down half the country this this last summer. So again, this is really a declaration of war sequel.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  And here's the thing. It's more than a declaration of war. The American people, especially the Trump, obviously the Second Amendment gun owners, the Christians really high up on the list.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Look at the identification, the vilification of Christians, the nullification of more better off about them and the destruction.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  By the way, the cutting off the heads relating the guillotines. I'd encourage everybody to go to Revelation chapter 20 and and and verse four.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  And it talks about the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and for they who didn't worship the beast.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  We've heard again, we've heard from Bill Gates, his own mouth, you won't be able to buy, you won't be able to sell, you won't be able to trade and you won't be able to travel.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  That's right. It's not the Bible telling us now. It's Bill Gates, it's Klaus Schwab. And you know, it's interesting, the Jacobins use guillotines when they had other ways to kill in France.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  They were Satanists on record. That's mainline history. People don't know that. It goes back to the Bible, the beheading.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  I mean, why is the Satan system obsessed with beheading? There it is. And I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  And I saw the souls of them were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, for the word of God, for which had not worshiped the beast.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  Neither his image, neither received his mark upon their foreheads or their hands and they had lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  I mean, they are literally setting this up.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  They're setting us up and it's prophetic because again, the war that's between the children, God's children and Satan's offspring was set up in Genesis 3.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  I agree. Why do they love to chop our, why is Satan's favorite way to chop the head off?
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  Great answer because we were created in the image and likeness of God and he hates God so much.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  That's why they want us to wear a mask and hate ourselves and they want to chop the head off.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  Absolutely. And the mask is the first thing. That's why I said the mask of the beast equals a mark of the beast and equals the murder by the beast.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  Alex, here's the thing. Maybe people can understand. They used to talk about someone who's headed to their execution of prison, dead man walking.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  We are all dead people walking unless we stand up, we speak up, we speak out and we do peaceful resistance until it's no longer peaceful.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  I agree. Is it not the mark, though, that we're wearing a mask of shame to our image that we're evil? This is so satanic.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Absolutely. Because again, it's art. Look at it. What's in a smile? What's in anger? Your face is the expression. Your mouth is what you see.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  It's true. They don't want us registering the face because at a spiritual level, we know that's a good person or a bad person.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  Absolutely. And they want to cut off communication. By the way, the six foot bull sheet, S-H-E-E-T, okay? Here's the thing.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Bulls alive, the sheet, and I'm spelling it, S-H-E-E-T, is what covers up the lie or what covers up our face.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  And now, they know how stupid, and I'm saying this, how stupid, with no science, modern science and hundreds of years of science has been thrown out the door.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  Well, I have a new landed study saying the PCR test is totally fake, unreliable, and a fraud. So the basis of the whole thing is a fraud.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  Absolutely. But again, it's how many people became complacent, apathetic, and indifferent. And the point is, is that by conceding to evil, conceding to evil, we end up being subject to evil.
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Well, let me ask you this on the timeline. Obviously, God is God's plan, but God lets us choose our destiny to a certain extent.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  What do you expect to happen next? Because things are moving so quickly.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  I expect, in March, things will change dramatically. For the worse, I suspect, and here's my sources, check it out with your sources, they want a second lockdown, that will be total.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  Okay, we are...
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  And they're going to claim this California version as the reason.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  Absolutely. And nothing good comes out of California. Nothing good. I mean, think about it. Well, I like the movies. I like this.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  Gavin Newsom now has close to 1.25 million people trying to recall him. It's going to be too late for the damage he's already done.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Look at the left coast. Look at what happened in Portland. Look at what happened in Washington, Seattle, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  Now, it's just turned into a, you know, basically shanty town.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Oh, I was in Seattle 20 years ago. Most beautiful city I ever saw. I wanted to move there. I was there two years ago, a hellhole.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  Absolutely. You can't even walk down the street. And, you know, like you said, the bottom line is this. The bottom line is this. I got to keep hitting this.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  They're coming to kill us. They've already sentenced us. This goes back to weather underground. In those days, the population...
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  Oh, they admitted salty population. All the massive deaths from COVID are trying to cover up. Why are they trying to burn Cuomo to scare the other governors and also follow the orders?
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  Well, I think Cuomo is going to be the, quote, throw away governor to make people think, see, there's still justice.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  But it wasn't just Cuomo. And I'm telling you this, the place people want to be is where the states are going to have a Second Amendment sanctuary.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  And I see war. You asked me what I see in the future. I see war against individual states, against the globalists.
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  And by the way, the word white helmets, I'm just, I'm asking, I'm praying, and I'm believing I'm going to get a document that I'll share with you, so you can share it with...
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  You know, we always were worried about the blue helmets. How many times do you hear the white helmets of good guys are coming to your aid?
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  That was total misdirection or misdirection. They are bringing in the foreign troops to take away the guns.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, that's why the Second Amendment stands. But Alex, there is no rule of law. There is no justice. There is no liberty.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  And the next, here's the thing, forget the second lockdown. I call it the kill-down. That's when they come. They take us away. They blow us away.
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  And I'm sorry, but that's what's happening. No food. When you're in that secondary lockdown, I don't know if it's six months. I don't know if it's seven months.
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  But I'm telling you this, too, the other thing that's going to happen, and I know people are seeing, why is the government talking about aliens, aliens, aliens?
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  Stay there. Let's talk about Project Bluebeam and all that with Steve Quayle, who is kicking butt. We'll be right back on the other side. I'm Alex Jones from infowars.com.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  Now is the time to get prepared. Now is the time to get high-quality, storeable food that's ready to be shipped to you within days. Infowarsstore.com has the highest quality, storeable food,

[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test. This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:10.000]  And it really does come down to that. So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will. And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  I sell supplements for two reasons. Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works. That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula,
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  Prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade or Anic Bottom B12 and Ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force, or the pure Deep Earth Crystal Eye down next to, these are all the very best supplements you're going to find
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  in already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the M4. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the M4s, you can't lose.

[2:35:49.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  The same thing I said to the guest we had on last hour is finding the lockdowns and the fake PCR tests coming into Canada. He's all excited. I'm all excited. I had one cup of coffee this morning.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  People say, what are you on? What am I on? World government's here. It's all being announced. We can't be in our comfort zone. We can't just go along with this. We had the former head of the CIA six years ago when he was the director of it.
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  John Brennan say, oh, we control the weather, but we don't want the public or other governments to know about it on C-SPAN.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  So there's this tactic where they talk about this and then we try to have it debate the legislature or at the congressional level, they go, I never heard of that kiddie boy. What are you talking about?
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  Because most of the senators and congressmen aren't even involved in it.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  That's why they're able to do so many incredible things is the scientific elite are playing God.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  We have this book. It's excellent weather wars, big old coffee table book on unnatural disasters by Stephen Quayle available at infowarstore.com. Just read it.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  And as other books, it's amazing.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  And separately, we have a lot of specials running right now. We have this big fortifier supply free shipping store wide of 50% off the products because who knows we'll be here in the future.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  We're just trying to get money in to operate a few more months. I'm not trying to be desperate. I'm not trying to sound alarmist.
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  You can see how crazy things are. They're all in the news thing. Arrest me. FBI investigations made up crap.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  So just pray for us is number one thing we need folks and I appreciate your support. Please support the local affiliates because they can't have us on air is everything we talked about came through.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  Let's talk about that, Steve Quayle. This paradox again of everything we said is coming true.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  People are really waking up and then the enemy just accelerates and CNN Tucker Carlson played it last night and said why 80 million Americans have to be arrested?
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  I mean, they're all who knew America was terrorist. I mean, we're rejecting the beast system.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  So the beast starts trying to persecute the Bible says then starts killing people.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  Well, absolutely. Alex, here's the thing.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  It's again, ladies and gentlemen, forget the word arrest. There will be a rest, but they want 125 million people murdered.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  Now, my death is to hate would say how come the Democrats are always saying, you know, we want to nuke us, meaning literally drop atom bombs on us, cut our heads off, basically shoot us.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Everything they said make war on us. And yesterday, even Nancy Pelosi was recorded. She wants civil war.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  I think that's the thing that people got to understand the Russian Revolution. Every revolution has to come into essence by armed conflicts conflict.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  And so here's what people need to get. This is no longer rhetoric. Your apathy and your indifference will kill you.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  How many people Alex took for granted that Texas would never have a snowstorm? Excuse me, never have a snowstorm.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  Meanwhile, all the volcanoes in the world, the biggest ones in the world are absolutely going off ejecting particles, silicon particles and other particles into the stratosphere.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  It stays and we're already suffering from a lack of sunlight, chemtrails, residue in the upper atmosphere.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  And then you've got the gates of hell saying that, well, gee, we're going to block the sun.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  I think Mike Adams gave the best statement I've ever heard. They want to kill photosynthesis.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, your diet for those of you who get to live will be basically 1,500 calories a day of insect based protein.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  If that and Alex, one of the things I said 25 years ago, and this is something that's really tough for a lot of people to take.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  I know that's what's crazy is you were the first one ever heard you're going to eat bugs, you're going to get a bad beef. They're doing it all right now.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  And again, two things, ladies and gentlemen, 25 years ago, this is critical.
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  I said, when the volcanoes of the world erupts, simultaneous major volcanoes and cannibalism fills the headlines of the day, I said, no, that tribulations are beginning.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  Tribulations and in this life, Jesus said, we're going to have tribulation.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  And so what's happening, the church has been neutralized by wolves in the pulpit. The church has been, and I'm talking about believers, forgive me.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  The word church is not accurate. There's no standing up, very little, forgive me.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  The majority of people in the pulpit are not standing up and speaking about the biblical revelations.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  They're not accepting that Jesus told us about this by the raid. The book of Revelation is the revelation that God gave to a servant, John, the Apostle John, who was in exile on the island of Patmos.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  It's a revelation of Jesus. So that leads into the alien situation, people.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  If the Defense Department is releasing all the ways that the different craft, especially the triangle, the TR3Ps, are those are the triangular shapes you see with three lights.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  And they're talking about the alien reverse engineered, which they just released.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  They're talking about the aliens, that actual aliens are on Earth, and they're going to do that in six months. Why are they doing that?
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  I'll tell you why they're doing that. They're prepping you for the fact is they're going to claim Catholic Church is already there that the absolute creators of the universe are the aliens, Prometheus on steroids.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  Oh, I know the Hollywood people. I know the globalists. None of them are atheists. They believe aliens made us.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  They believe they're in contact with them, which is really the devil, and they believe that they have to do all this evil. Then the devil empowered them.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  Imagine the angels just see it as a guy in the sky, he comes down from the sky, but really, no, he's a fallen one marooned here.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  Explain that biblically for folks that don't understand it.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Well, first of all, the Bible says that there was war in heaven, the devil and his angels fought against God and his angels, and their place was not found in heaven.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  So they were kicked out of heaven, one-third of the angels, and they lived in the heavens until they're cast out.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  So basically, Earth is their prison?
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  Yep. And basically, they have three and a half years, not seven years, 42 months to basically make war on the saints.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  And unfortunately, the saints are going to be slaughtered because they don't believe.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  See, this is one of the reasons people don't want to deal with Bible prophecy.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  Even when it's playing out, the four horsemen, the apocalypse, you know, we've seen famine, we see war, we see absolute...
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  But given the good news, because people do wake up at the end, though.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  Yeah, they do wake up, and here's the deal. We're trying to wake up the people that will listen to the fact that this is all in motion.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  And, you know, in the South, they say this is fixing to get ready. This is already happening. You can't tell the people of Texas.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  God bless each and every one of you in Texas.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  I mean that seriously, that they had your best interests in mind. They don't have your best interests in mind.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  One of the things that people have got to understand is all these people that are talking about metals, I've been talking about it too,
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  that you saw with absolutely GameStop and the whole panic into silver.
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  And right now, Alex, at being in that business for 35 years, the silver market is so difficult to get.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  Product, the premium is huge, but I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  You will see the price of silver and gold go really high, but it will be a point of this.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  There will be none to buy. None to buy.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:41.000]  Look at how FedEx, the center in Memphis, shut down. People couldn't get that.
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  And then the U.S. mail, good night with the exception of overnight.
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  You're totally right. My instinct, I've said for years, is the time of waiting's over.
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  Get to the country, get dug in, get ready, and don't worry about the things of the earth,
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  because the globalists are about to wage war, and they're all slaves.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  These are Satan's slaves. They're not their own people.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  They are driven by this force. When they get to that level of Satanism, what happens to them?
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  Well, when it happens to them, they totally get demon-possessed. They're given over.
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  And by the way, they don't call them Satan. They call them Lord Lucifer.
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  And they literally believe that he's God, yet he demands the sacrifice of 100 million babies.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  He demands even the sacrifices that we've heard have taken place in the White House, not under Donald Trump.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  But even now, funny business is going on. Funny business. Let me define funny business.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  The whole world, Jesus said this, the whole world lies in the evil one.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  And people, you're looking to your government to bail you out. No one's coming to your aid.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  And people ask, why does Satan want to hurt children? He wants to steal their essence, hurt them,
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  but also get his minions to do such horrible things.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  God, it's the ultimate sin, cuts them off so Satan knows he's really got these people.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Just like in episode three of Revenge of the Sith, written by George Lucas, cheesy movie,
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  but very accurate, he says to Darth Vader, newly minted, he said, you're not Darth Vader yet.
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  They'll kill a couple hundred kids, then you'll be on the dark side.
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Well, first of all, they want the life is in the blood of the innocents.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  Whether you call it a dino-prome or anything, but Satan demands a blood sacrifice
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  because he feasts literally as well as the demons and I call spiritual vampires.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  They feast on innocence.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  The horror of a child being tortured in the black mass over a whole day,
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  their blood being drunk while they beg for mommy, that is beautiful ambrosia of the Satanist.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  Absolutely. And again, ladies and gentlemen, it just goes back to the original religion of Nimrod,
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  the Tower of Babel. It goes back to the Canaanites. It goes back to the Philistines.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  There's always been the sacrifice. You know, since Alex, he's killing off the next generation.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  We talked about population reduction. We talked about basically even the infertility of the American male.
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  We're talking about excreted pharmaceuticals.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  When I first started talking about that, that all the estrogen, the water from birth control pills
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  was going to emasculate the American male. People said, what are you talking about?
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  And now they're talking about excreted pharmaceuticals.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  But more than that, even the xenoestrogens in plastic is basically been a chemical castrant of the absolute...
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  All right, stay there. We'll be right back. Five more minutes with Steve Quayle.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  Then we've got no more fake news coming up.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy, food, and medicine.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist control,
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open,
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king, and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well.
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  They're both available the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storeable foods right now,

[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  They are playing God. They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  to carry out this transformation. I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on record.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  You have been warned. You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  All right. Steve Quayle is our guest. One more segment and a very special report on our next segment.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  And then John Rapport, no more fake news next over.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  All I know is we are vindicated. And as negative as things are, as sad as they are, we are seeing revelation beginning to be fulfilled.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  And we have experienced spiritual things. You have experienced them. We know it's real.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  For some people that haven't experienced that, I don't know if they are blessed or cursed, but this is all extremely real.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  You're as serious as an art attack. I'm as serious as an art attack. For God strike me down. This is all real.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  In four or five minutes we have left. What else would Steve Quayle like to impart to folks?
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  Well, first of all, you need community. You need people that you can interface with.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  And even if it's two or three people, the problem with prepping is it's a pretty isolated thing.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  And I want to share this with anybody who's got groups.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  Anybody comes in about wanting to kill this person, kill that person, blow this up, blow that up.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  Those are always the plants. Those are always law enforcement trying to get you to even say something that's on record.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  When it gets really bad, ditch the helipads, okay? Ditch the tracking mix.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  And by the way, Alex, I didn't know this, but one of those famous scientists, I won't tell you his name, he's famous all over the world,
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  said, you realize when you have a cell phone on in your bedroom or wherever you keep it, if you keep it on at night, put it in a separate room.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  He says they have smart weapons now that basically the heliphone, you talked, your ad talked about, you know, even when it's off the batteries off,
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  can act, if you will, as almost a homing signal for them to figure out where you're at.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  It actually can measure where you're at. They have all sorts of weird algorithms and electromagnetic attacks the phones can launch.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  Absolutely. So here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, the first and most important thing, in my opinion, is get right with the living God.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  I trust, I trust, and I do the word of God because that's the only thing that told us at the beginning what the end would be like.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  And he who can tell you at the end, who created all the beginning.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  Remember, every time you see a mass person, they are destroying the image and likeness of God.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  How many of you are being told if you have sex with whoever, your wives, you're supposed to wear a mask.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  Oh, take this new man that says he's a woman that heads up the federal Department of Health.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  He says, let's sterilize and cut boys, genitals off. Let's have orgies, but men and women having sex should wear masks.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  Cousins and wives are bad. It's just all weird perverts.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  Well, they're weird perverts, but who hates mankind?
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  The purpose of abortion, 100, and this is a real number, 25 million innocent little children who would have been grown up.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  That's population reduction. That's population reduction. I've been telling the black community for 25 years,
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  Margaret Sanger, Hillary Clinton, that's Hillary Clinton.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  And look how mad they are that the Hasidic Jews won't take it, the Russians won't take it, the blacks won't take it.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  All over the news, they're making fun of those Russians and those black people.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  Absolutely. And I want to share this. I am a human racist. The devil hates humanity.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  He's destroying it. He's grinding the face.
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  By the way, what was it? The Jack Booted Thugs? That was a slogan 10 years ago.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  By the way, didn't you say that a long time ago? I said we were coining that today.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  How long have you been saying human racism? Or we just say that today?
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  Well, I've been saying that for a couple of years.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  Okay. That's how the brain works. I just came up with this.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  At least to make fun of Islam. Now men and women are under Sharia law.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  Absolutely. And the mask is the next step for women.
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  The next thing that's coming is the Sharia burqa.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  And also, ladies and gentlemen, the veiling, the veiling of God's image.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  And that's how much the devil hates it. He doesn't want to see it.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  And by the way, I'm told the people who some of the biggest politicians in the world have literally gone into the presence of Satan's throne on earth
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  and worship fallen at his feet and declared their allegiance.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  And just like an eyes wide shut, they wear masks.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  Absolutely. And why is that, ladies and gentlemen?
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  Because God made us and the enemy sees it and literally hates this face.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  God hates our faces.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  It's like a woman breaks up with a man, Alex. They can't get to the man necessarily.
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  So they tear up his photographs or vice versa.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  Satan is tearing up the image and likeness of the living God.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  Only, only by faith can we overcome any of this.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  We all know it's through Steve Quayle. Amazing.
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  Join me again next week. I want to give him the satellite phones with you next week.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Set him up. Thank you, Steve Quayle.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself.
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it. We should.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us,
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  You're going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  This is the truth. This is the info war.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  John Rapp aboard of No More Fake News is set to take over here in just a few minutes.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  But I looked at my sheet of paper wrong earlier a few hours ago and premiered this video
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  where I predicted what was going to currently happen in 2010 that our archive is found.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  And so we will play this piece of important information coming up here in just a few minutes.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  But I do just want to thank the listeners. I want to thank the crew.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  I want to thank everybody because as negative as things are,
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  this is the animating contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  And I am just as happy as a pig in manure, as they say, to know John Rapp aboard,
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  to know Steve Quill, to know David I and to know Tucker Carlson and to know you
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  and to know so many other countless people, the good souls.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Some got brown skin, some got black skin, some got pink skin, white skin, polka dotted freckle skin.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  It doesn't matter. They got red blood and they love God. And this is really the human race.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  As Steve Quill said, I am a human racist. I am pro-human.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Doesn't mean I don't know groups have been turned against me and some people are idiots.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I can differentiate that. Just like black folks who differentiate a racist white person versus a nice person.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  But you've got to differentiate, discriminate on whether somebody's got a connection to God or not.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  What we'll talk about, don't discriminate, is because the globalists don't want you to discriminate.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  In your car, you see the road turns. If you don't discriminate in turn, you're going to run off a cliff.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  So discrimination is good when it comes to saying no to evil.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  It's not good if you just judge a book by its cover.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  But that's all up to you and what path you want to follow, folks.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  All I know is things are getting down to the wire.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  Look at these headlines on the whole vaccination harassment. It's not a vaccination.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  It's government and corrupt corporations with liability protection able to put in your body what they want.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  And they knew it would kill a bunch of people. Bill Gates said it would.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  So now he just wants to normalize. We die when we do this.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  They can't hide this anymore so they're instead flaunting it.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  Look at this headline. Y'all know this.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  Israel adopts law allowing names of a vaccinating to be shared.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  Whatever happened to your medical records being private? Oh, we're going to share it.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  Wow. Talk about bullying.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  And again, this big new lens of study came out a few days ago confirming what all the other studies show.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  British Journal of Medicine and others that it's all fake. 90% fake test PCR.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  France considers slowing vaccine rollout for hospital staff as many get so sick they're unable to work or die.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  And it just goes on from there.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  And then you see this empty thug, Governor Cuomo, who followed orders.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  He could get out of this anytime saying Fauci told me who's you in control.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Try to spin it and say it's Trump's fault. Trump wasn't in control of Fauci.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  Trump's Gates' boy. He's the UN's boy.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  He could get out of this, but he's too demonic and too stupid.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  Now it's over 16,000 old people. Like Rappaport said last year, it was three times what they said.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  He was dead on. Wasn't 5,000. It's 16, 17. Some numbers are 18, 20,000 dead.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  They covered up. That's a crime alone. And they knew the only people they could kill was old people.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  And most of them didn't quote die in ammonia or even the flu. They were killing them in there to get the money.
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  Only certain nursing homes and hospitals has happened at almost all the deaths.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  Just like conversely, there's the good hospitals and nursing homes where, like, oh, there's clusters all over.
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  It's always like Southern Baptist and Christian or Black nursing homes.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  People actually go, hey, we lost 5% of our people when we gave them a shot. They died.
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  So it's only certain nursing homes that will report what's going on. The others don't do it.
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:58.000]  So this is all a big evil test. And it's super destructive.
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  But here's a video, and when we play it, we'll show the data up front here in a moment.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  Let me pause it there for a second so you can see the data. It kind of moves quickly.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  Back in 2010, when I was reading Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation, July 16, 2010,
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  and then I was extrapolating what that would look like and what that would be like, and it's exactly what happened.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  Just like I made Endgame, it's hard to believe, three years before that, 14 years ago.
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  How do I make it? I'm not John the Baptist. I'm not John the Revelator. No, it's there.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  You've just got to have the will to admit it to yourself. So here is the report.
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  We're going to post it to Band-Aut Video. I don't know what the headline is yet, but watch Alex Jones predict the COVID-19 lockdowns.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  I mean, I don't know what you... I wasn't predicting, and it was right there. Here it is.
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  The Alex Jones Show. There is a war on for your mind.
[2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  Because I've had chills since last night. This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines,
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  This story is up on prisonplanet.com. The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on,
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  I know why, because it's scary.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  It should take over your life.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  You've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  When losers draw, you need to choose a side.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  They're not writing up these plans for no reason. They're not playing games for no reason.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  So I'm going to ask every man, woman and child listening to me right now to exercise your will and to take the live link of this show or the local radio station you're listening to or TV station you're watching and tell people right now.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  Send the link to your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  Stop your car.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  Tell people to an info wars dot com or slash show make up business cards, hand them out. We can do this. We can beat them.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  We know their plan, but it only gets worse. You don't go along with this. The plan goes away.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  You stand up to it and the plan stops.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  This is the greatest challenge we've ever faced.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  And all of it is posted at Bandai video, but John report a great brain, a smart guy, a great patriot, investigative journalist.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  He is going to be coming back and laying out the latest on the COVID attack. We've got so much other interesting news, but that's all a side issue.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  The COVID lockdown, the new fake strains, the fear mongering, that's what it's all about.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  They never let you out of the trap until you realize it's a trap and say no.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  And the good news is in North Dakota and Florida and all over the place, people are saying no.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  Governments are saying no. Courts are saying no. And that's the beginning of the end of the globalist.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  And also financial support keeps us on air. We need that.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  We've got great products, durable foods ready to ship to you anywhere.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  And it's 10% off and free shipping unprecedented.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  That's the new big special fortify your supplies, free shipping store.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  Why don't everything infowarstore.com without you will not be here to have this infrastructure to have our own systems, our own websites, our own video feeds, our own uplinks.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  It's very expensive, but we make it easy by getting great products at the same time with fortify your preparedness, your supplies at infowarstore.com.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  Can't run this free shipping only food for more than a week.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  All right, John Rabibort, no more fake news. Take some.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:21.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can't defeat them.
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  So the new URL that links right to ban.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  Share the link.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  The resistance.video.
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  The resistance.video.
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Info Wars War Room.
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  And I have had a major wake up call living in Texas this last week about how important storable food is.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  Now I have plenty of storable food in my house, but my notion has always been this is last case scenario, worst case scenario, like end of America, apocalyptic type of scenario.
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  But I'm realizing now that's not the case. Folks, they can shut off the power.
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  They can shut off the water at any given moment.
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  Now I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have to dig into my storeable food.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  But many people in Texas did it.
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  Don't be in that situation.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  Don't have that major wake up call.
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  People shut down your power and they shut down the stores in the food supply, have the backup, have the insurance and be ready to feed yourself, your family, your friends and your neighbors with the storable food, best quality, best price, 10% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  One, two, three, four, absolutely nothing.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  And now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  What is it good for? Absolutely nothing to me.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  Okay folks, here we are.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  Our weekly chat.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  I'm going to go back to what I was talking about last week.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  And indicate that it's a weak point of the enemy.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  What do I mean by that?
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  They're presenting a wall of lies to the public about COVID-19, about the virus, about the tests, about this, about that.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  All is justification for basically imprisoning the population, what they call the lockdowns.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  We close anything we want to close.
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  When we want to close it, we open it up, we shut it down.
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  We tell you to stay indoors.
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  You can't travel. You can't go to a restaurant.
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  Yes, you can. No, you can't.
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  Putting the population completely under the gun.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  The weak point, which you can do something about, it's not just be talking to you.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  But you can share this information and lawyers who are listening can specifically do something about it.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  The weak point is the test, the PCR test.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  This is what I started to talk about last week.
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  I got a little ways into it.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  I'm going to review that quickly and move on so that you really grasp this.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  Because everything is writing for them on people believing in this test for the so-called virus.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  That's how they get their case numbers, their death numbers.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  That's how they justify their lockdowns, their closure of businesses, their wreckage of economies.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  All planned, nothing to do with the virus.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  But it's a test.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  So first of all, this is called the PCR test.
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  It takes a very tiny, tiny, tiny sample out of the swab taken from the patient.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  And it amplifies it or blows it up millions of times in what's called cycles.
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  Each cycle is a quantum leap in blowing up the test.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  But one of the open secrets in the testing community for decades now is that different labs come up with different results.
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  But just two.
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  You can go to one lab and the test will say positive, meaning you're infected.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  You can go to another lab and the results of the same test would be negative.
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  You're not infected.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  So here's the strategy.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  Suppose 50 people out of the entire population.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  In one day went to three or four different states and got tested three or four different times.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  And the results came back negative, positive, negative, positive.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  You sue the labs with a good lawyer.
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  You sue the labs because they are fronting and admittedly false medical procedure.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  They're trying to destroy a person's life.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  Quarantine, isolation, cut off from friends and family, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, inducing fear, terror, all of the above and more.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  That's a direct strategy.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  Go to three or four different states right around the borders where they connect.
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  Get tested where you know the tests are going to go to three or four different labs on the same day, very close in time.
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  Results come back positive, negative, positive, negative, sue the labs.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  If you had 50 people with their clients out of a whole country doing that, some amazing things would happen.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  Believe me, the public would suddenly be shocked into a realization.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  Second point, if the test is run at 35 cycles or higher,
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  even Anthony Fauci readily admits and we have him on videotape saying it, the test is useless and meaningless.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  35 cycles, what does that mean?
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  That means that from the test sample taken from the patient, the test blows it up and quantum leaps 35 times and then assesses the result, either positive or negative.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  So Fauci and others have admitted at 35 cycles or higher, the test is meaningless, useless.
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  But the FDA and the CDC and other public health bodies have been recommending that the test be run at up to 40 cycles to look for the virus.
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  That's a crime, understand? That's a crime because you're going to get a torrent, a waterfall, a Niagara of false positives when you go above 35 cycles.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  And there's a strategy for that.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  Let's say somebody's been told to take the test or ordered to take the test, they find a good lawyer and they say, we want a sworn affidavit from the lab as to how many cycles they're utilizing in the test.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  If the lab refuses to give out that information, sue them.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  If the lab says they're running it at more than 35 cycles, sue them.
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:49.000]  If you had 50 lawyers and clients doing that, the whole scene would collapse.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  The whole program would collapse.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  The whole COVID-19 hoax would collapse.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  These are real time strategies.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  They're not just fantasies.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  So in the rest of the time today, what I'm going to do is go over some of the other fatal flaws in the PCR test so that you can understand them.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  For example, we have from the New York Times, August 29, 2020, an article that says,
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  your corona test is positive, maybe it shouldn't be. And in that article, it clearly stated that based on a large study, up to 90% of all PCR tests for COVID were false positives that indicated the person was infected when the person was not infected.
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  Up to 90% of all the people who had been tested, understand?
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  Now, the article went on to say the remedy for this is more testing. Well, that's completely insane, obviously.
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  But that was what they said.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  However, the takeaway is that up to 90% of all people tested up to the time of that article could have been false positives.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even before out of access to the show in the mid-90s, I wouldn't call that movie and thought, man, that looks fun.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:16:01.000]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:11.000]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[3:16:11.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  That, for me, is really such a disgusting.
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:58.000]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists they play God, and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me. They try to get me to join them. But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection to God.
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power over them.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:33.000]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  And that's a fact.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it.
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's what fills my soul. Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at Infowarsstore.com, years. Never raised the price. Never.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee. The crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And of course that's just one of the great ways you can support Infowars here.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support Infowars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  Of course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gets a 5 star.
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a 5 star except maybe one or two people.
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  New analysis reports. It's the Alex Jones show. And now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Okay, we're back here. And before the break, I was talking about this article in New York Times.
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  August 29, 2020, your corona test is positive. Maybe it shouldn't be.
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:35.000]  Up to 90% of all people who had been tested up to that time who registered positive would be false positives.
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:41.000]  Therefore, you could just take 10% and say, well, maybe those are actual positives.
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  And if you did that, you wouldn't have a pandemic. You wouldn't have an epidemic. You wouldn't have anything except an ordinary flu season and the whole show with the over.
[3:19:50.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  This is in the New York Times. The freaking New York Times.
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  There is more evidence. I'm putting before you that the test is a fraud is a hoax is completely insane.
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  And those of you watching can now see on the screen this announcement from the state of Florida.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:18.000]  Governor Ron DeSantis and his public health department.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  Who stated in December that they were now requiring all labs in the state of Florida to report every test they do.
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  How many cycles they ran the test at because above 35 cycles is meaningless.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  Why did they do that because they know the governor and his public health department know the fraud that is going on and they want to expose it.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:57.000]  They don't want to allow the enemy to suddenly be able to jack up these fake case numbers in the state of Florida and say, whoa, we just had 100,000 new cases.
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  And so we're going to have to lock down everybody. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  It's the test stupid. It's the cycles stupid.
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  That's what's going on here. This is such a major weak point in the enemy's position that if you attack it.
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  With this video, this program with articles that have been written articles I've written reports that you've seen on infowars about the test.
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  The fakery of the test.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  And this gets out far enough into the public and enough people wake up. The show is going to collapse.
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  It's like everybody's been in the movie theater watching the fraud pandemic and all of a sudden the screen goes white and the movie stops and everybody looks around and says what the hell was that all about.
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:00.000]  End of story.
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  Okay, so let me continue here with more reasons why the test is a fraud.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  Because no large study has ever been done of the PCR test and its ability to say if it can, whether any person is sick or is going to get sick.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  In the usual meaning of the word sick, you know, symptoms.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  No large scale.
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  Well formed study has ever been done.
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  With say 500 or 1000 volunteers.
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  I don't care how you want to define it.
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  As long as it's well done to prove that the test can say that anybody is sick or is going to get sick and there are ways of running such a test and I've described.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  It's pretty straightforward and simple.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  And in the end what you get is you unblind the test and you reveal all the volunteers after the test has been done.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  And you see who's sick and who's running marathons and you know, based on how their tests came out, whether the tests mean anything or they don't mean anything.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  And I would bet the farm that the results would be so bad for the test that it would be thrown out of court thrown out of labs thrown out of medical societies as being a complete fraud.
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  If they ever really did such a large scale study of the test, test the test that the test never been done.
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  Never will be done.
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  Why?
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  Because it's an open secret and these criminals understand that if they expose themselves in that way by running a fair test of the test.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  That they're going to be shown to be criminals, predators, hoaxers, frauds.
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  No large scale study has ever been done furthermore to show that even in a single lab, if you took one sample from one patient.
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  When you ran that sample multiple times, in other words, did multiple tests on that single sample.
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  Whether the results would be uniform and the same every time.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  So let's say no swab whatever, take it down to this certified lab.
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  They don't know what's going on.
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  All they know is they've been ordered to run this sample and they do.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  And then they're given the same sample again, run the test again.
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  They don't know that again and again and again, maybe a hundred times.
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  And then we take another patient and we do the same thing, run the test, run it again, a hundred times.
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  Is it going to come out the same each time for a given patient?
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  Big study like that.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  Never been well done.
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  Never been vetted.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  How can you do that?
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  You can't except if you're a criminal.
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  Except if you want to foist this test on the public as they did with COVID-19.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  Because they knew that it would be spitting out false positives like a fire hose.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  And that's exactly what they needed in order to rig and fake case numbers.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  And say we must lock down because of the case numbers.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  That's the way it's worked.
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  That's the way it is working.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  And that's the way it will keep on working until we expose the fraudsters and the predators and the criminals.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  And lots of people in the scientific community know this.
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  This is not news.
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  We had a decision in the Supreme Court, appeals court case in Portugal in November of 2020.
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  In what had to be the best COVID educated court in the world.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  That declared that lockdowns of plaintiffs in the case were illegal because the PCR test was a fraud.
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  The way it was being done.
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  Meaning it was being done at too many cycles.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  They knew that the court and they exposed it in their judgment which was published and ignored by major media all over the world.
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  Including in Portugal.
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  And the court said that it was absurd to assume that the result of the PCR test or any test alone could determine what a case of a disease was.
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  Without somebody qualified actually looking at the patient and seeing what symptoms the patient had.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  That any test alone was not enough to say this is a case of COVID.
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  That's exactly though what's being done every day and every way in every country in the world.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  And the court ruled against it and said this was absolutely preposterous and nonsense.
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  They read the studies that they needed to read and they read them correctly.
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  Even though they were criticized on that basis for it.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  But they made the right decision.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  And it was a landmark historical decision in Portugal. I've written an article about it.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  It's up today at No More Fake News.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  There's more.
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  The weakness of the enemy is in the test.
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  We'll be back.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  Infowars has been banned. Arrested.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  Attacked and threatened.
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  Because we are effective.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  The great awakening is here.
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:06.000]  Go to banned.video.
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  Download the videos and share.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  And never give up the fight.
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  Infowars.com
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  A different mix of the two.
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:43.000]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  This is its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  And ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave masters.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  It is already causing millions and millions of starved to death.
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  When they are done, billions will starve to death.
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:37.000]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[3:30:46.000 --> 3:30:50.000]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[3:30:50.000 --> 3:30:54.000]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scaring what's going on.
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:30:56.000]  The global government, the new world order.
[3:30:56.000 --> 3:30:59.000]  Now that people hold up the facts that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:01.000]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:03.000]  My gosh, look it out.
[3:31:03.000 --> 3:31:08.000]  The description drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug, once you signed that executive order.
[3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:10.000]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[3:31:10.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:18.000]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else.
[3:31:18.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:29.000]  and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  Because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep.
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:34.000]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[3:31:34.000 --> 3:31:36.000]  The people are awakening.
[3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:41.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[3:31:41.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially,
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:57.000]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:08.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:14.000]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:19.000]  They're Faraday cages. They just look like a cloth envelope.
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  They work absolutely great.
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:26.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:30.000]  when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:33.000]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[3:32:37.000 --> 3:32:41.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:48.000]  Okay, we're back here for the last segment in this hour.
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  John Rappaport here at InfoWars.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:32:57.000]  I've been going over the fraudulent PCR tests, COVID.
[3:32:57.000 --> 3:33:01.000]  And there's one more element that I want to cover today.
[3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  People have been saying for some time, we're asking the question, well, is it possible that they've just re-labeled the flu, COVID?
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  And people have cited numbers and with charts and graphs and stuff.
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  Well, look here, the number of flu cases went way down.
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  And the number of COVID cases went way up.
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  And so this, the answer is, of course, that's what they've been doing.
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  Of course, and you don't need charts to explain it.
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  You just need to understand the definition of a COVID case and a definition of a flu case.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  They overlap.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  In fact, a mild, what's called a mild case of COVID-19 is flu symptoms, cough, chills and fever.
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  There you have it.
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  You can be diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive PCR test.
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  And I've shown how easy that is to obtain a false positive and a cough or chills and fever, which are obviously symptoms of flu or flu like illness or the common cold.
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  So what's the problem?
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  There isn't any for them.
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  They just switch.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  They say, okay, let's call the flu COVID-19.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  Oh, we wouldn't do that in a million years.
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  Of course, they're doing it all the time because they've got the definition in front of them.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  I'm just paraphrasing the CDC definition of a mild case of COVID, cough or chills and fever, accompanied by a positive PCR test.
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  If you happen to be living in an area where there are people who have tested positive, which everybody is, you're living in such an area now.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  That's all you need.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  There's the fraud.
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  What else do you need to know?
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  It's by definition.
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  Okay, it's not some.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  Oh, very sophisticated trick.
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  Here's how we're going to do it with the algorithm and the thing and the computer program that goes inside out and upside down.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  And before you know it, your brain just turned.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  No, it's just a simple.
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  We take this over here and we switch it over there.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  Switch, switch by definition.
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  Always look at the definitions of these so-called diseases.
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  I started out doing that 1987 with the CDC definition of AIDS, and I found it was like 15 pages long.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  It was almost nothing that couldn't be shoved into a diagnosis of a case of AIDS.
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  It's the same now.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  Rearranged the same exact deal now.
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  So that's another yet fraudulent use of the PCR test.
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:47.000]  And we know we can get false positive here, so boom, you're positive, Mr. Jones, and you have a cough, COVID-19.
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  You're positive, Mr. Smith, you have chills and fever, and a positive PCR test, your case of COVID-19.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  There you go.
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  There you go.
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  So the question always is, are people who are learning this information, all this information, doing popcorn entertainment?
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  Wow, this is interesting.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  Yeah, and it moves the adrenaline a little bit as you're sitting there listening or watching.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  Yeah, okay.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  Or is it also motivating you to take action?
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  That's to make breakpoint, folks.
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  That's what information is all about.
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  There is a thing, an actual thing, called critical mass of information.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  If it's real, I've seen it operate in many different venues over the years.
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  If enough people are aware of the facts and the truth about something, a point is reached where unpredictable things begin to happen and those unpredictable things are good.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  They are on the side of liberty and freedom and individual power.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  They're on the side of what good people want.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  So are you going to share this information in the form of, say, this video, which will be common in a few minutes on band.video at InfoWars?
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  I'm going to look at some of the articles that I posted and written at No More Fake News about the test and share those.
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Are you going to become a transfer of the truth, your own media outlet, so to speak, an email list, a bigger list you compile, you send it out?
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  Sure, you're going to get no answers from some people, rejections from other people.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  So what? Who cares? You just keep doing it anyway.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  If enough people had already been doing this over the last year on a number of issues and insanities and crimes being committed in the name of pandemic regulations,
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  we wouldn't be where we are now.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  So it's up to you what you decide to do. It's up to you.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Liberty and freedom are never gone.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  They're always there because they're part of you.
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  They're part of every individual.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  That impulse can never be destroyed, which is why the enemy has to take such sustained and heavy action over a period of time, long, long time,
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  in order to try to wipe liberty and freedom out and they can't do it.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  But they're not going to stop trying.
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  They can sit on it. They can put an iron boot on a face, on many faces.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  They can poison people with injections, depopulate. They can do all kinds of things, but they can never destroy liberty and freedom in you, in you.
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  And in every individual, but this is about you.
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  So in a very real sense, it doesn't matter what you think or what I think in terms of will liberty and freedom go away.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  They don't ever go away.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  You see, that's the problem because if they could be wiped out, then people could just go around with a complete amnesia and say, what difference does it make?
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  What happens? We're just animals living in a corral.
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  We're just biological machines that have no existence beyond the physical.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  It doesn't matter how much repression is brought down in our heads because freedom, I don't even know what that means.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  So what? Who cares?
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  We just live and then we die and that's it. That's all there is.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  But that isn't so.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  The knowledge that it isn't so is alive in you.
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  And it's not the only way.
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  That's the rub, my friends. That is the rub.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  That's what causes a person to feel what he feels when he knows the truth but does nothing about it.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  That's what causes the sensation of, wait a minute now.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  I don't know. I'm not feeling right here because liberty and freedom do not go away.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  They're always there in you.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  So if you do nothing, you know you're doing nothing.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  And that's the rub.
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  So the question is always, are you going to purvey and spread the truth or not?
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  We're ready here for permanent lockdown as far as the enemy goes but we're not going to do that.
