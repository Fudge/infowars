[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:41.040]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.040 --> 00:46.880]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you it is Thursday the fifth
[00:46.880 --> 00:59.360]  day of March 2009 we're gonna be here live for the next four hours and I you
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.600]  know this happens every few months I run across a story that's so big it's so
[01:03.600 --> 01:08.680]  important to everybody on this planet that I don't just want to come on the
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.240]  air and even start covering it because that doesn't give the story enough
[01:13.240 --> 01:19.480]  respect so it isn't for hype purposes that when I have a story this important
[01:19.480 --> 01:29.800]  this big this out of control that usually every five six months or so I will
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.400]  say prepare yourselves for this information it is that important I don't
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.960]  want this information I'm covering to be lost in the overall chatter of my
[01:40.960 --> 01:49.680]  coverage of the panoptagon or the pantheon or the panacea the cornucopia of
[01:49.680 --> 01:58.840]  things happening in the world it's that important
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.920]  normally it is every six months to a year that I come across something this
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.800]  big this important this insane this out of control but because things are
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.080]  accelerating like birth pains they're getting closer and closer together the
[02:16.080 --> 02:23.000]  last time we did this was January 27th of this year well just a month and eight
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.040]  nine days ago a little over a month ago new legislation authorizes FEMA camps
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.200]  in the US why was this story so important with all the other news we had
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.160]  about FEMA camps and civilian inmate labor camp program in Congress being
[02:37.160 --> 02:42.440]  threatened with martial law because it confirmed our analysis of the
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.320]  architecture of the camps how they're going to roll them out how they're
[02:46.320 --> 02:50.720]  going to operate how the local police will be merged under them how they'll
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.320]  have the clergy response teams preparing the population to go into them for PR
[02:55.320 --> 03:01.400]  purposes for brainwashing purposes and it confirmed all of that it confirmed our
[03:01.400 --> 03:06.320]  analysis and all the big pieces of the puzzle that we had you know much of it
[03:06.320 --> 03:09.960]  admitted but it connected the dots of how they're going to roll it out how
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.920]  they're going to push it and indeed that's now happening now that said this
[03:14.920 --> 03:21.520]  story that I said was a red alert a month ago is nothing this story is
[03:21.520 --> 03:29.960]  nothing nothing nothing I must say that again nothing compared to what we're
[03:29.960 --> 03:38.400]  going to cover this is nothing when I saw this story last night and then spent
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.560]  hours researching it and confirmed it was accurate I had trouble sleeping I
[03:43.560 --> 03:50.760]  basically became upset at my stomach so much acid was produced my I'm somebody
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.120]  you can have you know maybe because I'm stupid it's not as I'm tough you're not
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.720]  going to have some MP threatening me putting a 45 to my chest and I don't get
[03:59.720 --> 04:07.520]  upset it's almost like I'm numb to things like that but but my hands started
[04:07.520 --> 04:12.440]  sweating I started sweating last night my my palms were sweating I had sweat in
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.520]  my house was cold the air conditioner on it's already gotten warm here and I was
[04:16.520 --> 04:29.000]  sweating over this okay because it's not just the report I've got that's coming up
[04:29.000 --> 04:36.680]  this group of reports it's that it connects in to hundreds of other key
[04:36.680 --> 04:44.320]  pieces of information we've had I'll give you a hint what it is you know from all
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.800]  little pieces of info I've got and knowing the enemy operation I was able

[08:57.000 --> 09:00.040]  wants to prepare for it and be at home when he does it so that's should be
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.960]  coming up in the next few weeks that's how we got in contact with marcus
[09:02.960 --> 09:10.680]  williams and professor griff one of the founders of public enemy in order the
[09:10.680 --> 09:18.160]  iconic hip-hop rap groups will wrap into hip-hop and so i've got marcus williams
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.280]  coming on he owns one of the uh... biggest the most successful uh... predominantly
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.880]  focusing on uh... black issues african-american issues
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.640]  the newbie in bookstore uh... in the land of georgia and just a really
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.080]  informative guy and i want to get his perspective
[09:36.080 --> 09:38.360]  uh... on uh...
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.000]  folks in the african-american community that are concerned about barack obama
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.400]  and he also gave us the footage for the interview he did with professor griff
[09:47.400 --> 09:49.680]  about obama
[09:49.680 --> 09:54.320]  and this is when obama
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.800]  had just been elected
[09:57.800 --> 10:00.960]  and he's saying you look he's gonna sell everybody out
[10:00.960 --> 10:02.400]  on the troops
[10:02.400 --> 10:04.440]  on the warrantless wiretapping
[10:04.440 --> 10:07.720]  i mean he just lays it down the devastating fashion that is in the
[10:07.720 --> 10:10.120]  obama deception by the way
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.320]  and so is the interview with carousel one
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.680]  really effective information
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.860]  webster tarpley
[10:18.860 --> 10:21.200]  george humphrey
[10:21.200 --> 10:23.460]  jesse vintera
[10:23.460 --> 10:25.640]  jerald salante
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.720]  they'll give you an idea of what's in this film
[10:29.720 --> 10:36.360]  of course myself
[10:36.360 --> 10:39.560]  so that's uh...
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.000]  really important information coming up also talk with marcus williams
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.120]  about bioweapon attacks and how they've been carrying out uh... soft kill
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.680]  operations against africans and this has come out in mainstream news with the
[10:51.680 --> 10:54.800]  hiv in the vaccines
[10:54.800 --> 10:57.360]  mainstream french british
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.320]  african indian news
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.640]  it's been confirmed that you never will hear it
[11:01.640 --> 11:05.360]  in our news it'll be all just reverend right said that and you know
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.720]  he's he's crazy
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.200]  and then it gets overshadowed all the gd america stuff
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.360]  but it's real
[11:16.360 --> 11:18.560]  and it's happening to everybody
[11:18.560 --> 11:21.680]  not just africans just africa there's a poor on average
[11:21.680 --> 11:24.480]  it's isolated from the media in many areas
[11:24.480 --> 11:27.800]  the u n is a complete control of that continent
[11:27.800 --> 11:30.600]  and so they can get away with all of this
[11:30.600 --> 11:33.680]  so we'll talk uh... with marcus williams about that as well
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.080]  uh... coming up also have open phones
[11:37.080 --> 11:40.320]  in the next hour and in the uh... third and fourth hour we're not going to have
[11:40.320 --> 11:43.080]  any open phones in this hour
[11:43.080 --> 11:46.560]  but frankly i can hardly even think about all the news i've got jim says
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.760]  they may just go under
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.040]  eight plus million people are upside down in their homes on the verge of fore
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.760]  closure
[11:54.760 --> 11:58.400]  eight plus million homes
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.160]  i guess there's an average more than two people living in a home so that'd be
[12:02.160 --> 12:04.600]  sixteen million plus people
[12:04.600 --> 12:07.280]  that's on top of everything that's already happened
[12:07.280 --> 12:10.200]  uh... economic numbers coming out in the last three days as most of you i'm
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.120]  sure aware is just devastating
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.680]  i watched gordon browns speech before the congress for the house yesterday
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.120]  i've got some clips of that i watched
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.360]  late into the night clips of urnaki's testimony saying he was angry at a i g
[12:27.360 --> 12:29.200]  and angry at the bankers
[12:29.200 --> 12:32.480]  but then he wouldn't say where the money when we got some amazing clips of that
[12:32.480 --> 12:34.760]  he says it's a secret i won't tell you
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.040]  uh... so that's coming up
[12:38.040 --> 12:40.640]  geithner giving testimony just
[12:40.640 --> 12:42.480]  unbelievable stuff they're engaged in
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.640]  a bunch of mainstream news about state reps all over the country not paying
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.240]  income taxes just like sixty five plus percent of the
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.420]  u.s congress doesn't pay taxes
[12:52.420 --> 12:54.320]  geithner doesn't pay him
[12:54.320 --> 12:57.760]  rama manual doesn't pay him they just do whatever they want
[12:57.760 --> 13:00.680]  to pack of criminals
[13:00.680 --> 13:07.680]  and i don't even follow their own stinking laws
[13:08.200 --> 13:11.800]  but i'll tell you right now that the news i've got in front of me i should
[13:11.800 --> 13:15.680]  probably just spend all the guests today and i didn't get into the economy
[13:15.680 --> 13:23.240]  and because he doesn't respect information of this magnitude
[13:23.240 --> 13:25.440]  to just
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.040]  mention it and then move on
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.040]  you know what what we do that when we
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.160]  focus on something like this but then
[13:34.160 --> 13:36.200]  just move on
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.800]  we become acclimated to accept it
[13:40.800 --> 13:42.700]  they're acclimating us right now with
[13:42.700 --> 13:46.440]  over a hundred mainstream news articles a day you can go to google news and
[13:46.440 --> 13:49.960]  type new order and they'll be over a hundred new ones a day
[13:49.960 --> 13:52.900]  it's in the thousands and thousands now last few months
[13:52.900 --> 13:55.880]  world government's good role government will save you new global currency in
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.960]  new america north american unions the answer wall street journal news week
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.960]  time magazine
[14:01.960 --> 14:05.640]  new york times everything i mean just everything everything they are in a
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.320]  full court press you want the economy to get better a world government run by
[14:09.320 --> 14:10.760]  the bankers
[14:10.760 --> 14:13.720]  just the asinine over the topness of it all
[14:13.720 --> 14:15.200]  and we're all becoming conditioned
[14:15.200 --> 14:16.920]  you know now i see
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.040]  a hundred articles plus a day
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.360]  the Rothschilds and Rockefeller saying the world government is now here we're
[14:22.360 --> 14:26.200]  gonna carbon tax everything you do and i'm so conditioned to it now and i've
[14:26.200 --> 14:28.720]  known about it so long and i've covered it so long that now that we're being
[14:28.720 --> 14:32.480]  completely i've been proving completely right and it's all right out in the open
[14:32.480 --> 14:39.480]  uh... i'm just sitting here more all just sitting here going okay there it is
[14:42.960 --> 14:45.120]  and meanwhile our detractors
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.120]  on radio and tv and on the websites and on the blogs and
[14:50.120 --> 14:53.960]  they just keep calling us tinfoil hat heads and saying there's no global bank
[14:53.960 --> 14:57.840]  there's no new world order none of this is happening everything's fine
[14:57.840 --> 15:00.880]  and of course a lot of more paid bloggers that's been admitted but many
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.440]  more aren't it's just a mentally ill
[15:03.440 --> 15:06.240]  very very sick society
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.560]  large sectors of our economy and society and
[15:09.560 --> 15:11.680]  socio-economic development everything
[15:11.680 --> 15:13.080]  spiritually
[15:13.080 --> 15:15.960]  are just really sick evil people
[15:15.960 --> 15:17.320]  the majority aren't
[15:17.320 --> 15:20.160]  but the majority that is half decent people
[15:20.160 --> 15:23.200]  aren't engaged aren't informed aren't involved
[15:23.200 --> 15:25.760]  and they're lazy and they don't want to know
[15:25.760 --> 15:28.720]  and because they don't want to know because they don't want to say no to
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.000]  any of the steering
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.520]  because they're too self-centered selfish you're going to get everything you
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.440]  got taken
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.440]  and you know when this happens and it and it's about a ninety eight percent
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.600]  chance it will happen
[15:42.600 --> 15:44.640]  in the next decade
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.480]  and we could change that if we got really involved in
[15:47.480 --> 15:49.760]  started having mass sit-ins and
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.280]  you know making it the main issue no matter what anybody said or did
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.320]  we could probably stop them
[15:56.320 --> 15:59.880]  maybe they may go ahead and just do it anyways
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.840]  but then we may have people catch them trying it just like that we call them
[16:02.840 --> 16:04.640]  trying to ship the six cruise missiles
[16:04.640 --> 16:06.640]  out of the country to claim iran had them and
[16:06.640 --> 16:09.880]  and they killed what was it last time i checked close to twenty
[16:09.880 --> 16:11.920]  of the military men that were witnesses
[16:11.920 --> 16:14.600]  to what really happened with the mine on
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.680]  dakota situation
[16:16.680 --> 16:18.360]  member that
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.880]  but nukes are nothing compared to this i mean you drop a nuke on a city of two
[16:21.880 --> 16:23.920]  million people depending on the megaton
[16:23.920 --> 16:27.040]  and you know it'll kill half of them and radiate the rest in
[16:27.040 --> 16:28.640]  but we can survive that
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.440]  that's an isolated incident
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.280]  most of you listening right now to the show if we don't turn this around are
[16:37.280 --> 16:38.520]  dead
[16:38.520 --> 16:39.440]  understand
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.740]  i'm dead
[16:40.740 --> 16:42.000]  you're dead
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.280]  our children are probably gonna die
[16:44.280 --> 16:47.600]  or not have parents
[16:47.600 --> 16:50.440]  and when it comes and when it happens
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.160]  many of you that were laughing and giggling you're finally gonna freak out
[16:54.160 --> 16:57.280]  you're gonna run off and beg for the vaccine or whatever they've got for you
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.600]  and the first bio weapon they release in this is the big news story
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.600]  the first bio weapon they release
[17:05.600 --> 17:09.640]  in the next phase will be isolated you know it'll kill
[17:09.640 --> 17:11.200]  a hundred thousand or so
[17:11.200 --> 17:12.400]  and then they'll teach you
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.000]  how to go under bio hazard control and how to lock down cities that they're the
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.560]  boss and they know best we've all got a thumb scan to buy and sell to stop it
[17:19.560 --> 17:23.000]  from happening and then the next one
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.940]  as they beta tested will kill a couple million
[17:25.940 --> 17:29.400]  and then it'll lock things down even more and then the next will kill two
[17:29.400 --> 17:30.840]  billion people
[17:30.840 --> 17:34.240]  and they'll totally lock down society to a level unimaginable you won't care
[17:34.240 --> 17:35.880]  every day was being drug off and arrested
[17:35.880 --> 17:39.160]  all you care about is that you know you get these proper vaccines to protect you
[17:39.160 --> 17:40.800]  from the progeny and
[17:40.800 --> 17:42.720]  zyclone twelve
[17:42.720 --> 17:48.360]  the super virus or whatever they engineer
[17:48.360 --> 17:51.240]  and of course they'll finally kill you too
[17:51.240 --> 17:53.560]  that's their stated plan
[17:53.560 --> 17:57.080]  and well when i saw the reports i'm about to cover when we come back from
[17:57.080 --> 17:58.400]  break
[17:58.400 --> 18:00.160]  and i read them
[18:00.160 --> 18:04.000]  it was stunning
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.760]  the room almost wheeled around me
[18:08.760 --> 18:12.360]  and dots that were already connected a clear picture that was already there
[18:12.360 --> 18:13.920]  all documented
[18:13.920 --> 18:19.640]  it just went three-dimensional so much more detail so much more understanding
[18:19.640 --> 18:22.900]  and i know their plan i understand an operation but to
[18:22.900 --> 18:25.120]  realize that they're really
[18:25.120 --> 18:26.960]  going to do it
[18:26.960 --> 18:28.080]  to know that
[18:28.080 --> 18:30.600]  we were right about everything else because we were just reading what the
[18:30.600 --> 18:34.240]  globalist said they would do and that they mean everything they promise and they
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.600]  mean everything they
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.480]  said they're going to do in their
[18:37.480 --> 18:40.800]  white papers in their directives in their councils
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.440]  in their world governmental system
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.000]  it's a scholarly research but it's there for those that wish to look it's
[18:47.000 --> 18:47.680]  public
[18:47.680 --> 18:50.480]  open source
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.600]  now it's nothing but lies with their public phase in the general public
[18:54.600 --> 18:56.960]  how they want to help you and they love you and they care about you and it's the
[18:56.960 --> 18:59.040]  children all this
[18:59.040 --> 19:02.420]  they keep all their promises
[19:02.420 --> 19:05.400]  when it comes to the trilateral commission cfr
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.280]  club of rome united nations
[19:09.280 --> 19:12.320]  the big central banks
[19:12.320 --> 19:14.880]  so when we come back
[19:14.880 --> 19:17.040]  for the balance of this hour
[19:17.040 --> 19:20.560]  i'm gonna break down
[19:20.560 --> 19:23.160]  the most important
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.760]  story
[19:24.760 --> 19:26.000]  i have ever
[19:26.000 --> 19:26.760]  covered
[19:26.760 --> 19:28.400]  on this radio show
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.320]  it is more important than when i went on air and said they're gonna blow up the
[19:31.320 --> 19:33.880]  world trade centers and probably blame on their asset bin laden
[19:33.880 --> 19:36.440]  they're gonna do it the next two months call the white house tell them don't do it
[19:36.440 --> 19:39.400]  July twenty-fifth and did it for two months straight till the enemy carried
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.920]  out the operation
[19:43.920 --> 19:46.960]  this dwarfs that
[19:46.960 --> 19:50.280]  you see nine eleven was only carried out to set the stage
[19:50.280 --> 19:51.560]  for the police state
[19:51.560 --> 19:55.800]  to suppress the general population what as they financially bankrupt you
[19:55.800 --> 19:57.560]  in preparation
[19:57.560 --> 20:01.000]  to use the bio weapons
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  you worry you see the sides and worry about the future
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.520]  you worry about economic turmoil and food shortages how to be prepared while
[20:07.520 --> 20:08.760]  preserving your sanity
[20:08.760 --> 20:12.680]  your answer may be at hand author linda runyon lived off the land isolated
[20:12.680 --> 20:13.920]  from civilization
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.840]  she knows that as long as the sun shines there will be plenty of free food all
[20:17.840 --> 20:21.880]  over god's green earth perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild
[20:21.880 --> 20:23.200]  edible plants
[20:23.200 --> 20:27.040]  the cost of learning is minimal wild food grows everywhere and you will see it
[20:27.040 --> 20:27.720]  everywhere
[20:27.720 --> 20:31.200]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets

[21:01.360 --> 21:04.760]  hello this is peter crunch novel from mitis resources and i'd like to share
[21:04.760 --> 21:05.960]  some thoughts with you
[21:05.960 --> 21:09.200]  in today's economy with the government spending on wild
[21:09.200 --> 21:11.680]  the banking system on the verge of collapse
[21:11.680 --> 21:13.960]  and wall street and continuous freefall
[21:13.960 --> 21:17.120]  we both know that it's critical that you protect your savings and retirement
[21:17.120 --> 21:18.280]  programs now
[21:18.280 --> 21:21.680]  macroeconomics can be very confusing but the solution to securing your
[21:21.680 --> 21:23.880]  personal assets is very simple
[21:23.880 --> 21:25.920]  it's purchase of gold and silver
[21:25.920 --> 21:29.440]  these precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries
[21:29.440 --> 21:32.560]  and they've never been more important in our country's history
[21:32.560 --> 21:34.960]  it's up to you to design your survival plan
[21:34.960 --> 21:36.880]  one based on gold and silver

[21:57.360 --> 22:00.800]  where you can still purchase gold with paper
[22:00.800 --> 22:05.440]  today unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of
[22:05.440 --> 22:07.560]  war against this country
[22:07.560 --> 22:10.200]  the enemy struck america on september eleventh
[22:10.200 --> 22:11.720]  but who is the enemy
[22:11.720 --> 22:12.520]  bin laden
[22:12.520 --> 22:13.640]  this is his m-o's
[22:13.640 --> 22:16.880]  we have to look to the middle east, we have to look to the south of bin laden
[22:16.880 --> 22:20.600]  fabled enemies is the first nine eleven film to take a close look at the terrorist
[22:20.600 --> 22:23.960]  ties to intelligence networks inside the united states
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.440]  some u.s. investigators believe that there are israelis again very much
[22:27.440 --> 22:30.800]  engaged in spying in and on the u.s.
[22:30.800 --> 22:34.600]  i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.480]  bin laden's connections to the cia
[22:36.480 --> 22:38.440]  the hijackers ties to the fb i

[24:44.800 --> 24:47.840]  then i'm gonna come back and go through all the points
[24:47.840 --> 24:52.400]  and why this is so serious
[24:52.400 --> 24:55.840]  and connected to other background information
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.400]  to make a crystal clear
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.280]  this is by paul watson he wrote this morning
[25:00.280 --> 25:05.520]  the great job i contacted him in court last night they got all this posted
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.640]  this morning accidental contamination of vaccines live avian flu virus virtually
[25:10.640 --> 25:12.840]  impossible
[25:12.840 --> 25:15.880]  that's what government officials and top
[25:15.880 --> 25:20.720]  vaccine scientists are saying
[25:20.720 --> 25:22.800]  now this is a
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.880]  strain of bird flu that kills sixty to ninety percent
[25:27.880 --> 25:30.080]  of humans it comes in contact with
[25:30.080 --> 25:32.640]  they gave it to ferrets
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.040]  and it killed all of them that are in the hammer
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.820]  this thing is
[25:38.820 --> 25:42.400]  so wide spectrum that it attacks she normally
[25:42.400 --> 25:44.080]  a flu
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.120]  or a separate cold bug for that matter
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.440]  you'll have zoological organisms and you'll have
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.120]  organisms that affect humans there's very few diseases except things like
[25:54.120 --> 25:56.800]  very few pathogens very few
[25:56.800 --> 25:58.920]  microbes to use the old term
[25:58.920 --> 26:04.040]  that attack humans and different types of animals
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.280]  you get leprosy from a few animals
[26:08.280 --> 26:09.840]  like an armadillo
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.440]  you can get uh...
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.480]  rabies you're bitten by a bat or a dog that has it
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.400]  but those are not airborne
[26:23.400 --> 26:25.120]  they're not airborne
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.680]  some rare cases rabies can stay alive a few seconds so people have been
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.720]  in caves with millions of bats and
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.600]  been studying them and
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.240]  my grandfather going to ut had one of his favorite professors
[26:36.240 --> 26:37.960]  an archaeologist
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.600]  in caves
[26:39.600 --> 26:41.480]  while he was in college
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.120]  went out uh... looking for indian artifacts in a cave and got rabies
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.120]  from bats but
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.200]  i'm already digressing i said i'd cover the article
[26:49.200 --> 26:52.640]  the point is i've studied bird flu intently because i've seen the
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.320]  establishment hyping it preparing everybody saying billions will probably
[26:56.320 --> 26:59.240]  die from bird flu you know we've seen those headlines
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.400]  we've seen that hype that fear mongering
[27:04.400 --> 27:08.080]  we've seen them talk about how it's going to spread all these top scientists
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.160]  and virologist and epidemiologist and
[27:11.160 --> 27:13.360]  microbiologist have been killed
[27:13.360 --> 27:16.360]  in association with researching
[27:16.360 --> 27:18.600]  the avian flu
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.440]  they'll walk out front their house and be machine gun they'll be tortured to
[27:21.440 --> 27:22.400]  death they'll be
[27:22.400 --> 27:23.400]  drowned
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.680]  in houston you know they'll be run over and back back over at the college in
[27:26.680 --> 27:27.680]  front of people
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.960]  they're murdering
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.160]  bio weapons scientist in england australia russia germany the united
[27:33.160 --> 27:34.520]  states canada everywhere
[27:34.520 --> 27:37.200]  it's in the hundreds and hundreds
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.440]  and it's always an association with bird flu research either the treatment
[27:41.440 --> 27:43.300]  or identifying it or
[27:43.300 --> 27:45.400]  in weapons production
[27:45.400 --> 27:47.220]  now remember they dug up
[27:47.220 --> 27:51.320]  the nineteen eighteen spanish flu itself clearly
[27:51.320 --> 27:55.240]  german bio weapon a lot of evidence shows that
[27:55.240 --> 27:56.760]  they dug that up from
[27:56.760 --> 27:58.960]  wailers near the arctic
[27:58.960 --> 28:00.800]  we've been frozen in the permafrost
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.280]  pentagon did that what eight years ago then suddenly they announced the news
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.880]  all
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.200]  suddenly that the old strain is shown back up
[28:14.200 --> 28:19.960]  but that's separate from this
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.160]  bear farmer's suitacle that's tied in
[28:25.160 --> 28:27.840]  to baxter pharmaceutical
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.240]  are the ones remember that shipped out the aids tainted
[28:31.240 --> 28:33.160]  blood millions of people

[28:41.680 --> 28:42.360]  people
[28:42.360 --> 28:43.560]  became in contact with it
[28:43.560 --> 28:44.720]  knowing
[28:44.720 --> 28:47.840]  that that he will fill yet blood product drug
[28:47.840 --> 28:50.920]  was filled with it
[28:50.920 --> 28:52.040]  and shipping and out
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.920]  so this is a very nasty group of companies
[28:57.920 --> 28:59.960]  now
[28:59.960 --> 29:01.720]  this is
[29:01.720 --> 29:04.400]  this is so serious we're about to go to break i'm just going to come back and
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.640]  read the article i started getting in the background on it
[29:06.640 --> 29:09.400]  there's hundreds of pieces of info that go into

[29:29.360 --> 29:32.320]  bird flu the type that kills humans
[29:32.320 --> 29:34.160]  was shipped there
[29:34.160 --> 29:36.440]  and then mixed in
[29:36.440 --> 29:37.440]  with the
[29:37.440 --> 29:39.640]  the exact

[33:41.520 --> 33:46.560]  all right we're back live let's get straight into the most important
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.800]  article and I've never said this before this is the most important article with
[33:52.800 --> 33:59.880]  pieces of the puzzle the tumblers falling in place that I've ever covered
[33:59.960 --> 34:06.120]  this story itself I'm gonna cover many articles headline accidental
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.520]  contamination of vaccine with live avian flu virus virtually impossible this is
[34:11.520 --> 34:15.960]  in Canadian papers like the Toronto Sun it's in British it's in German it's in
[34:15.960 --> 34:23.280]  Czech it's in Russian it's in Japanese it's in Chinese English papers as well
[34:23.280 --> 34:27.600]  this story has been out for more than 24 hours I learned of it last night and
[34:27.600 --> 34:35.120]  nothing in the United States accidental contamination of vaccine with live avian
[34:35.120 --> 34:43.800]  flu virus virtually impossible and they were shipping this out but a subcontractor
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.720]  did do diligence because so many times they don't irradiate the regular flu
[34:48.720 --> 34:54.200]  vaccine right and it hurts people that they tested it on ferrets as they're
[34:54.200 --> 34:57.960]  supposed to do and if they haven't radiated it right it makes the ferrets
[34:57.960 --> 35:03.400]  sick and they send it back well guess what it killed the ferrets and so they
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.800]  tested the vaccine and it had bio weapon in it this was about to be shipped out
[35:08.800 --> 35:12.960]  and in fact they're not even clear it may have been shipped out do you
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.360]  understand do you understand people say oh this is scary fair mongering Alex
[35:18.360 --> 35:23.880]  this is the real world ladies and gentlemen governments killed hundreds of
[35:23.880 --> 35:28.920]  millions of people last century Zabigny Brzezinski who runs the White House
[35:28.920 --> 35:33.360]  foreign policy brags in two of his books that the US funded poll pot and he's
[35:33.360 --> 35:40.480]  proud of what they did that guy killed 30% of his country's population three
[35:40.480 --> 35:48.800]  million check papers question whether contaminated Baxter vaccine was attempt
[35:48.800 --> 35:53.800]  to provoke pandemic mainstream national papers in the Czech Republic you want to
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.920]  go read these stories they're all linked here up on info wars dot com prison
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.200]  planet dot com it sounds like I wrote them they're saying there's no way this
[36:02.200 --> 36:07.440]  is on purpose what on earth is going on and they've got all these scientists who
[36:07.440 --> 36:15.360]  are experts on vaccine production going this is on purpose what's it gonna take
[36:15.360 --> 36:20.560]  for some of you to wake up dying watching whole cities dying what is it
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.400]  gonna take for you to get it through your head that's a new world order once
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.440]  you dead what is the back cover of my film in game blueprint for global
[36:29.440 --> 36:38.840]  enslavement say they want you dead check newspapers are questioning if the
[36:38.840 --> 36:41.760]  shocking discovery of vaccines contaminated with the deadly avian
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.840]  flu virus which were distributed to 18 countries by the American company
[36:46.840 --> 36:52.360]  Baxter were part of a conspiracy to provoke a pandemic this was through its
[36:52.360 --> 36:56.200]  Austrian subsidiary the claim holds white because according to the very
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.560]  laboratory protocols that are routine for vaccine makers mixing alive virus
[37:00.560 --> 37:05.480]  biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible
[37:05.480 --> 37:10.040]  see this this avian flu had nothing to do with the facility nothing to do with
[37:10.040 --> 37:13.240]  the human vaccine for what they're guessing you know next year's flu is
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.120]  going to be nothing to do with it and it's in level three bio weapon lab they
[37:18.120 --> 37:23.320]  admit that where the people don't even touch it you know they're using robotic
[37:23.320 --> 37:29.280]  arms it's in chambers they load the live virus in they breed it up in deadly
[37:29.280 --> 37:36.440]  cultures then they radiate it and ship it out they damage the DNA so you just
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.440]  have a autoimmune response supposedly you don't have the full viral spread and
[37:42.440 --> 37:45.920]  they put accelerants into it to accelerate an autoimmune response and
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.800]  that's associated with the brain inflammation retardation and children
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.120]  not just the mercury mercury does bring damage to children but it itself is a
[37:55.120 --> 37:57.840]  red herring compared to the inflammation according to the brain
[37:57.840 --> 38:05.000]  surgeons and scientists we've had on here countless ones the company that
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.880]  released contaminated flu virus material from a plant in Austria confirmed
[38:08.880 --> 38:17.480]  Friday the experimental product contained live live h5n1 avian flu
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.840]  viruses reports the canadian press toronto son on and on on baxter flu
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.480]  vaccines contaminated with h5n1 otherwise known as the human form of avian
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.120]  flu one of the most deadly biological weapons on earth with a at least 60%
[38:33.120 --> 38:39.760]  kill rate were received by labs in the Czech Republic Germany and Slovenia
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.560]  initially baxter attempted to stonewall questions by invoking trade secrets and
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.240]  refused to reveal how the vaccines were contaminated with h5n1 after increased
[38:49.240 --> 38:55.040]  pressure then they claim that pure h5n1 bird flu batches were sent by accident
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.960]  this was seemingly an attempt to quickly change the story and hide the fact that
[38:59.960 --> 39:03.880]  the accidental contamination of a vaccine with a deadly bio agent like avian flu is
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.520]  virtually impossible and the only way it could have happened was by willful
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.160]  gross criminal negligence and mainstream news is saying that not just me go read
[39:13.160 --> 39:17.040]  the toronto son and others who read the checks they're going this is insane now
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.960]  stop right there that isn't even the evidence as damning as that is that is
[39:21.960 --> 39:27.400]  secondary that is tertiary that is corollary that is on the side of the
[39:27.400 --> 39:34.080]  road what is in the middle of the road the instructions they gave the companies
[39:34.080 --> 39:41.600]  for the mixture of the falsely labeled vaccine was the exact complex
[39:41.600 --> 39:51.160]  preparation to create a mutagen that's what gave you the 1918 Spanish flu that
[39:51.160 --> 39:59.440]  killed at least 50 million people it was combined to mutate between the normal
[39:59.440 --> 40:08.760]  extremely airborne extremely contagious strain of flu with the bird flu to
[40:08.760 --> 40:13.880]  make it highly airborne and highly contagious are you starting to hear what
[40:13.880 --> 40:23.280]  I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen according to see see if this would have
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.640]  gotten out and may have we don't know see instead of your child is throwing up
[40:26.640 --> 40:34.360]  for two days they die they die they die you die I die we die then they take those
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.040]  femoplastic coffins they've got stored all over the country and they come in and
[40:38.040 --> 40:42.640]  mild suits and they stick you in them I'm gonna stop right there remember in my
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.160]  film in game remember Dr. Eric Pionka UT saying he wants 90% of the American
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.080]  people people the world to die he can't wait till Ebola becomes airborne and
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.240]  kills 90% of the world population and then he's ready for him and his family
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.800]  to die but that isn't the issue it's that he went to the Texas Academy of
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.320]  Scientist this was in the news and when he said all this and projected with a
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.120]  PowerPoint huge skulls on the wall he got a standing ovation after standing
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.520]  ovation because if you go to the biology departments of any major
[41:15.520 --> 41:21.520]  university more than half of the top scientists at these facilities and doing
[41:21.520 --> 41:25.200]  the research labs will tell you there's too many people and humans are a disease
[41:25.200 --> 41:29.920]  anybody who's been in biology knows this you anybody who's bad fellow students
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.240]  writing their PhD thesis papers it's all about how humans are a disease and
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.160]  have to be gotten rid of when my dad was at UT in high school he was sent there
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.760]  as part of an advanced curriculum for gifted students they tested the smartest
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.480]  kids in Texas and took the top six and pulled him aside and said we want you
[41:50.480 --> 41:55.040]  to be part of a eugenics program we're gonna reduce the world's population my
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.440]  dad never told me that till he was at my office watching in game before it came
[41:59.440 --> 42:02.480]  out we were having an argument in the car with my mother and he said no it's
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.920]  all true honey they told me all this in college you see it's everywhere this is
[42:06.920 --> 42:13.040]  who they are they're in the positions of power the FBI did go question piyanka
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.720]  because there he is with access to these laboratories UT's got a level 3 bio
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.880]  weapons lab they've got a nuclear reactor every time I mention that people
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.760]  laugh yes there's there's two nuclear reactors in Austin and down in Galveston
[42:26.760 --> 42:34.360]  there's a level 3 bio weapons lab that's messing with level 4 bio weapons and
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.320]  it isn't just him it's Prince Charles Prince Philip Jacuzzo Ted Turner you
[42:38.320 --> 42:45.400]  know Peter Singer all these top people that's all they talk about just like in
[42:45.400 --> 42:54.080]  the movie 13 monkeys with Bruce Willis where the crazy laboratory assistant of
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.680]  the scientist releases the airborne superflu and it kills 99% of the
[42:59.680 --> 43:08.520]  population that's who's in these laboratories you know remember it just
[43:08.520 --> 43:14.920]  came out on Monday what we already told you samples and anthrax cases don't
[43:14.920 --> 43:21.800]  match strands from mailbox and Princeton are not from Ivan's investigators say and
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.040]  clearly they grabbed him put him in government custody killed him you had
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.560]  to go to the local news to find that out try to blame it on Bruce Ivan's for the
[43:28.560 --> 43:32.000]  anthrax when it was a US government weaponized version and that later came
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.760]  out and has been confirmed remember the foot and mouth release in 2000 in
[43:37.760 --> 43:45.560]  England weaponized it shows up from Scotland to Cornwall from the south to
[43:45.560 --> 43:54.200]  the north on the island it shows up in a two-day period all over the country it
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.800]  scores of locations it's the most weaponized version ever seen it's
[43:57.800 --> 44:01.880]  kills all the cows and sheep that come in contact with it we go on air and say
[44:01.880 --> 44:05.360]  that is weaponized clearly because we know farming and studied it and had
[44:05.360 --> 44:15.320]  scientists on about regular foot and mouth some call it hoof and mouth and
[44:15.320 --> 44:19.960]  then it came out in the BBC oh the level four bio weapons lab at port and down
[44:19.960 --> 44:23.320]  dr. David Kelly spoke out and of course they killed him witnesses saw five men
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.400]  in black uniforms run around run away from his dead body in the woods his wrist
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.080]  were slit with no blood there there were pills inside of them that hadn't
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.680]  dissolved didn't matter I mean you can have the killers on top of the body that
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.400]  run away and they say it's a suicide and it turned out that they've been oh
[44:39.400 --> 44:43.640]  somebody snuck it out of the level four bio weapons lab that had mine fields
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.800]  around it underground facilities pressure sealed rooms people with robotic
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.080]  arms messing with it somebody snuck it out and then somebody spread it
[44:53.080 --> 44:59.880]  nationwide in a two-day period yeah right somebody was able to go out and do
[44:59.880 --> 45:02.760]  that I'm just giving you more and more of the dots see because I have this
[45:02.760 --> 45:08.440]  knowledge from studying it just like many of you do and you know over the
[45:08.440 --> 45:14.360]  years that's why when we see this we understand what it is but on the face of
[45:14.360 --> 45:22.160]  it they ship weapons grade bird flu that kills 60% of humans that get it
[45:22.160 --> 45:31.680]  conservatively they ship it to labs all over Europe and to the subsidiary in
[45:31.680 --> 45:39.920]  Austria and then what do they tell their subsidiary labs to do what's what's
[45:39.920 --> 45:51.680]  the recipe what's the ingredients list what is the ingredients list they tell
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.440]  them you know this is a one in a million accident well another one in a million
[45:57.440 --> 46:04.000]  accidents they tell me exact recipe with the exact this has been fingered by
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.520]  scientists as what it will probably mutate with the exact strain of flu
[46:08.520 --> 46:13.080]  that's the most airborne the most vicious and that has the best chance it
[46:13.080 --> 46:22.880]  is most closely related to to be able to combine DNA and they mix it up and then
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.920]  it gets worse then it gets worse so it's a million to one conservatively that
[46:27.920 --> 46:29.800]  they would ship it to all these facilities now that happened it's a
[46:29.800 --> 46:33.120]  million and one that would be the exact right way to mutate it and then it's a
[46:33.120 --> 46:41.160]  million and one get ready for this that they wouldn't radiate it when this
[46:41.160 --> 46:46.520]  vaccine called to be radiated they kill it they breed up the flu virus then they
[46:46.520 --> 46:53.440]  radiate it they ship it out they didn't radiate it it was live because it had to
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.960]  continue its mutation and they say that it could even mutate inside the human
[46:57.960 --> 47:02.680]  body and that they gave it to thousands of people that's guaranteed now now I
[47:02.680 --> 47:05.440]  mean let's say it's not a million to one let's say it's a thousand to one that
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.920]  they ship it out to all these facilities and tell them to mix it at the exact you
[47:09.920 --> 47:15.760]  know same combination but it takes this and then they don't radiate it but by
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.760]  the grace of God are probably some good guys in intelligence agency the stuff
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.680]  doesn't happen by accident now there's good guys in government everywhere they
[47:24.680 --> 47:30.480]  do test it on ferrets at a subcontractor and then for weeks they've been
[47:30.480 --> 47:35.240]  trying to get the story out and warning people and it finally broke we're gonna
[47:35.240 --> 47:40.240]  be all over this story ladies and gentlemen do you understand what I just
[47:40.240 --> 47:47.560]  covered according to a compiled translation from check newspaper stories
[47:47.560 --> 47:50.920]  the media over there is asking tough questions about whether the contamination
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.200]  was part of a deliberate attempt to start a pandemic mainstream news is
[47:54.200 --> 48:01.560]  saying this but not our media it's too controlled was it just a criminal
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.120]  negligence or wasn't an attempt to provoke pan demics using vaccination
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.920]  against flu to spread the disease has happened with the anti B hepatitis
[48:11.920 --> 48:16.040]  vaccination with vaccines containing HIV virus in the US remember when that
[48:16.040 --> 48:19.760]  happened well that was an accident too though with the gay men in New York with
[48:19.760 --> 48:24.040]  the just so happened that HIV was contaminated in the in the in the in
[48:24.040 --> 48:27.400]  the hepatitis B shot and they use gay men because their vectors having hundreds
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.000]  of sexual partners it was just an accident the perfect vector was injected
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.600]  and then this is from the major Czechoslovakian paper and then cash for
[48:38.600 --> 48:46.320]  vaccines against H5N1 which Baxter develops how could on earth a virus as
[48:46.320 --> 48:51.920]  H5N1 come to the ordinary flu vaccines don't they follow even basic
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.040]  precautions in the American pharma companies the fact that Baxter mix the
[48:57.040 --> 49:03.760]  deadly H5N1 virus with a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses it was a whole
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.320]  cocktail to see what would mutate with is the smoking gun the H5N1 virus on
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.600]  its own has killed hundreds of people but it's less airborne and more
[49:13.600 --> 49:21.320]  restricted in cases with which it is spread however when combined with
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.720]  seasonal flu viruses which as anyone knows are super airborne and easily
[49:25.720 --> 49:34.040]  spread the effect is a potent super airborne super deadly bio weapon they
[49:34.040 --> 49:40.960]  say that again the effect is a potent super airborne super deadly biological
[49:40.960 --> 49:47.040]  weapon your family gets this at least if there's six of you four of you're a
[49:47.040 --> 49:54.560]  dead you're dead that you go in the ground you understand in the ground you
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.280]  understand that you understand that police that want to laugh about this
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.080]  show or military people or government people there's no more time to laugh you
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.920]  understand if you don't want the globalist to kill you and kill me and
[50:06.920 --> 50:10.760]  kill all of us better than a hammer you better start waking up to who's running
[50:10.760 --> 50:19.520]  things jack as the Canadian press article explains while H5N1 doesn't
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.880]  easily infect people H3N2 viruses do if someone exposed to a mixture of the
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.320]  two have been simultaneously infected with both strains he or she may have
[50:27.320 --> 50:31.680]  served as an incubator for a hybrid virus able to transmit easily to and
[50:31.680 --> 50:38.360]  among people there can be little doubt therefore that this was a deliberate
[50:38.360 --> 50:43.800]  attempt to weaponize H5N1 viruses to its most potent extreme and distributed
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.800]  via conventional flu vaccines to the population who would then infect others
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.400]  who a devastating degree as the disease when airborne and that's how the
[50:52.400 --> 50:55.040]  globalist love it they love compartmentalized operations where they
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.360]  use regular distribution systems like the water of the air to hit you and hit
[50:59.360 --> 51:05.920]  you hard the new world order beast is genetically modifying your food

[54:07.720 --> 54:13.040]  dr. Paul Greg Roberts on the collapsing economy and you know he said that he was
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.040]  gonna vote for Obama because Obama had to be repudiated because Bush had to be
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.440]  repudiated but now he's written articles saying it looks like Obama is gonna be
[54:21.440 --> 54:28.920]  worse than Bush former head of policy department of the Treasury he is coming
[54:28.920 --> 54:34.560]  up at the eight after next hour but then I'm gonna in the hour after that with a
[54:34.560 --> 54:40.440]  guest and into the fourth hour take your calls on this weaponized bird flu being
[54:40.440 --> 54:45.760]  mixed with vaccines to be shipped out across the world and reading literally
[54:45.760 --> 54:50.960]  I probably read I don't know scans through 20 30 articles all mainstream news
[54:50.960 --> 54:55.920]  last night and they're saying you know with scientists and others saying this
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.280]  is impossible this is incredible I mean they ship it out when it's not involved
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.960]  with you know a human flu vaccine to these places to be mixed with a whole
[55:05.960 --> 55:14.240]  different variety of human flues it's mixed the it's a specific way that they
[55:14.240 --> 55:19.280]  design it so that it will mix with those and then they kept it live and didn't
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.840]  radiate it after that I mean come on that's like hitting a bullet with a
[55:23.840 --> 55:25.960]  bullet and then hitting a bullet with another bullet and hitting another
[55:25.960 --> 55:36.920]  bullet with another bullet all with the same bullet it is absolute fraud this
[55:36.920 --> 55:44.640]  is just amazing and we've got Mike Adams the health ranger coming up next
[55:44.640 --> 55:47.640]  Monday to talk about this on the show I'm gonna be covering this tomorrow and
[55:47.640 --> 55:52.800]  Sunday Mike Adams of the story vaccines as biological weapons live avian flu
[55:52.800 --> 55:57.080]  virus placed in Baxter vaccine materials said to 18 countries and he says
[55:57.080 --> 56:00.560]  here in the article at the end of he said previously he didn't really believe
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.440]  that was really population control the poisons and the food and water and
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.600]  vaccines but now he basically agrees with us this is on purpose and you know
[56:08.600 --> 56:12.560]  it's hard to come to that realization believe me I've gone through that same
[56:12.560 --> 56:24.200]  process myself remember four years ago when through FedEx a company mailed out
[56:24.200 --> 56:29.640]  bird flu to a bunch of laboratories but then it got caught by researchers before
[56:29.640 --> 56:33.240]  they mixed it with the flu and I forgot to Google that last night I've got to
[56:33.240 --> 56:39.240]  remember the exact headline from four years ago it was no no the delivery truck
[56:39.240 --> 56:45.320]  was in a wreck that's why it came out delivery truck just say just say vaccine
[56:45.320 --> 56:57.040]  firm accidentally ships out avian flu or delivery truck accident avian flu see
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.400]  I mean it just goes on and on and on and then all these companies said why were
[57:01.400 --> 57:05.640]  you mailing us without us even asking weaponized bird flu and not labeling it
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.680]  they're just mailing it out everywhere then they go it's an accident it got
[57:09.680 --> 57:15.920]  out I mean it's just disgusting remember the White House Ari Fleischer the
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.120]  press secretary admitted you have the press conference Google White House
[57:20.120 --> 57:27.600]  admits White House press secretary admits White House on Cipro on September
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.000]  11th and then the anthrax shows up three and a half weeks later and then all
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.440]  these bush enemies get it then they say somebody made it in a bathtub it's not
[57:34.440 --> 57:38.520]  weaponized then it turns out it's the most weaponized ever a fort Dietrich
[57:38.520 --> 57:43.240]  aim strain super weaponized hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to put
[57:43.240 --> 57:51.400]  it together super deadly on and on and on and you just add all of this together
[57:51.400 --> 57:59.400]  and we're just sitting here waiting for him to release this on us yes they they
[57:59.400 --> 58:09.760]  accidentally shipped out the deadly bird flu that'll kill humans that are no
[58:09.760 --> 58:14.400]  hammer and it gets mixed with the regular a whole grouping of regular
[58:14.400 --> 58:25.160]  hyper airborne flu viruses and then they don't radiate it and start
[58:25.160 --> 58:31.160]  shivering and out and one research lab decided to test it and it killed the
[58:31.160 --> 58:37.440]  ferrets and they said what on earth and now we know ladies and gentlemen now we
[58:37.440 --> 58:50.160]  know thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.520]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[58:54.520 --> 58:57.800]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[58:57.800 --> 59:01.360]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[59:01.360 --> 59:04.600]  bread line you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[59:04.600 --> 59:08.480]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[59:08.480 --> 59:11.520]  simply prepare no one is going to take care of your family in the final

[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:27.080]  Alex Jones headline accidental contamination of vaccine live avian
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:33.000]  flu virus virtually impossible Baxter product contain live bird flu virus
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:39.840]  headline the Canadian press in the Toronto Sun we're gonna go over this more
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:45.040]  after Dr. Parker Roberts leaves us in about 30 minutes I want to get this
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:48.520]  clear a lot of people have criticized me for not getting more into bird flu here
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:53.240]  on the show because you'll see all these mainstream news articles with
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:58.000]  headlines like scientists says billions will die from bird flu you know we
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.200]  we've seen that headline from all these scientists and then you look at bird
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.400]  fluids very hard for humans to get it when humans do get it's normally around
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:12.680]  foul it's around geese that are in you know pinned in areas it is around
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:17.680]  chickens it's around ducks and it's killed hundreds and hundreds of people
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:23.000]  and the media kept hyping it why why why and then a lot of researchers began
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.480]  looking at the different mutations of it and appeared as if not just bird flu
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:34.720]  different variants of it but also SARS has been biologically manipulated
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:41.680]  artificially so yes bird flu itself in its current form has been hyped but
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:48.000]  mixing it with thousands and thousands of ampoules of vaccine with other live
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.680]  viruses other regular flu viruses is the perfect way I'm reading what
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:58.760]  scientists and doctors are saying in the mainstream news is the perfect way for
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:09.840]  it to mutate into a airborne stronger variety of the bird flu and look folks
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:12.960]  this is only one issue of many they keep all these genetic engineering
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:17.320]  facilities going where they're cross species splicing humans and cows and
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:22.320]  humans and pigs and humans and spiders and goats and spiders and jellyfish with
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:25.760]  monkeys you don't believe me just Google it it's main screen news and I've had
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:32.760]  top genetic engineers on top they say it gives rise to superviruses and mutations
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:37.840]  and mutations of bacteria and micro plasms and that it's already caused
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:42.160]  problems and genetically engineered crops that are cross species chimeras are
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:47.200]  already jumping into other varieties of plant life that they're related to in
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:50.880]  open air and there's been German studies and Chinese studies and British
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:54.560]  studies where they find the honey bees that are dying off at mass are eating
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:59.240]  the BT corn because the corn grows a natural pesticide inside of it they
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:03.440]  just boosted several thousand times with a fungus pesticide that is produced by
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:08.080]  the plant itself by genetic engineering so you're not just eating corn you're
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:13.480]  eating corn that's now part of the toxic fungus and so it's in the pollen and
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:18.280]  kills the bees it's meant so other animals can't eat it it's meant so other
[1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:24.680]  bugs I mean it just goes on and on Texas company protogen open-air plants
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:31.520]  hundreds of varieties of pharmacological corn amongst them that have the HIV virus
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:40.040]  shell where the plant grew the basic virus makeup so it can be extracted for
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:45.760]  research that was six years ago they had guys in spacesuits and the Dakotas in
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:52.880]  Texas literally helicopters and guys in spacesuits burning and destroying the
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:58.000]  fields what are these people doing what is going on this is not an ex files
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.160]  episode this is the real world and my whole point is is that the elites have
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:06.240]  set on record they want to get rid of 80% of us and there's no way this company
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:09.800]  I'm not saying the company itself may have done this maybe somebody inside the
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:14.200]  company and that's in the major mainstream news they're saying there's no
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:17.820]  way you could ship out the virus by accident have it put in these vaccines
[1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:23.360]  all these different plants have it mixed just right with other live regular
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:40.400]  variants of human flu and then send this out un-radiated and we're trying to
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:43.680]  track down where all it went whether it's been shipped out we're gonna
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:50.480]  continue to track this as it develops in fact guys keep googling for me during

[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:18.520]  I'm gonna get a medical doctor on the last 30 minutes of the show today to talk
[1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:23.120]  about the connections to all vaccines and massive outbreaks like a swine for
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:27.280]  epidemic where they admit the vaccine kill tens of thousands and how that ties
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:31.600]  in with accidental contamination of vaccine with live avian flu virus
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:36.920]  virtually impossible that's coming up in about 30 minutes of the dr. Paul Craig
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.600]  Roberts leaves us I wanted to get him on because you know he said that morally
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:47.520]  we had to vote against John McCain to repudiate George W. Bush and the secret
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:51.240]  police the secret arrest the secret camps the tripling the size of the
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:56.240]  government the lying about W.M.D.'s the million-plus dead iraqis John you
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.440]  saying they're above the law now more memos have come out where you wanted in
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:02.560]  the White House the Attorney General wanted to suspend free speech it's now
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:05.600]  mainstream news that they wanted to be dictators that they said they were
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:11.040]  dictators above Congress and Barack Obama hasn't rescinded PDD 51 he's
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.120]  expanding this announcing troops to be on the streets of America and so dr.
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:18.000]  Roberts I really respect him he's come out now I'm not I'm not saying we can
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.920]  vote for McCain either I just knew they were both evil he's come out and said
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:27.080]  looks like Obama is gonna be worse on the economy on liberties on everything
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:31.600]  but now if you go to the bookstore or in businesses around Austin it's like we
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:35.120]  live in Moussey Tongland there's pictures of him everywhere people like
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:39.320]  little shrines to Obama you go in bookstores or just books and I mean
[1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:43.240]  whole sections and people just worshiping I were getting death threats from
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.760]  Obama supporters and people coming on the message boards and attacking us and
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:50.560]  flipping out and saying we're racist or we're George Bush supporters and we want
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.760]  to hurt America and so what are they keeping the troops in iraq that's
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:58.240]  setting the table for this cult-like movement as Wall Street completely
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:01.400]  loots the daylights out of us dr. Paul Rick Roberts is the best-selling author
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.840]  former editor of the Wall Street Journal he also of course was the father
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:09.000]  Reaganomics had a policy at the Treasury during the biggest boom this
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.520]  country seen the last century we appreciate you coming on the show sir
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:17.800]  Alex okay a Barack Obama what do you think of him now and what's going on
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:24.440]  with the economy well the economy and nothing good is going on with the
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:29.400]  economy and they certainly you don't have their finger on what's wrong so
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:38.880]  whatever they're doing is not helping is hurting Obama I think and is out to
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.000]  lunch and that's predictable given the choice of advisors and given the
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  choice of advisors I suppose is predictable given the three powerful
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  interest groups that control the government the Israel lobby the financial
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:04.800]  sector and the military security complex so whatever we think of Obama we'll
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:10.160]  have to do where we can to hold them accountable like we did with the Bush
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:17.040]  and Janie and the Republicans so I don't really think the United States is
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:25.600]  going to get good leadership a voting doesn't produce it all all the voters
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:33.720]  can really do is repudiate each group that does them in and I think they'll
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:42.480]  just keep having to repudiate this cult of Obama I don't think it'll last long
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:50.120]  because the unemployment mounting it looks like the war just changes from
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:12:01.320]  Iraq to Afghanistan and it looks like the same vested interest prevailed so I
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:07.560]  think that cult will wear out I think people were very happy particularly
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:16.080]  those on the left side of the spectrum progressive that a partially black guy
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:23.640]  could get elected because I think it made him feel like racism and all that was
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:28.040]  over with but of course that's not the issue we face we face the issue of the
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:35.280]  police state the collapsing economy and endless war and and so the cult on
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:44.200]  Obama is a it's sort of based on the defeat of racism and that is worth
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:48.760]  something but it's not the problems that people are facing now so I think you
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.840]  won't last long yeah for the first few weeks of the Obama presidency white
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:58.240]  folks black folks that were just walking you can see it walking around so happy
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.720]  like the world was saved everything was going to be okay we're going to this
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:06.640]  crisis but he was going to fix it and it does show the reality that most
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:10.880]  Americans whether they be black or white don't harbor bad feelings towards the
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.040]  other race most people are a little paranoid thinking maybe that person
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:18.560]  doesn't like me but past that I really don't see a lot of racism or ever really
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:22.960]  hear it or you know deal with it in fact I found the opposite most folks kind of
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:25.600]  like people that look different talk different act ever because it's it's
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:30.840]  you know somewhat exotic is actually what I found in life but you know past
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:36.680]  that it is going to be such a sad thing as his minions black white it doesn't
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:43.080]  matter find out he's a betrayer and then in an article you wrote a title day
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:47.880]  banana republic by 2012 you said that Obama has presented the most
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:52.880]  irresponsible budget in US history I mean how he is he calling this change when
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:57.840]  Bush trip triples the size of the government and Obama in a month in is
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:02.480]  talking basically almost about doubling it so I guess that means in eight years
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:07.800]  he would increase it by eight times I mean how was that change in stopping
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:12.480]  the what's he call it special interest when he is the special interest
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:21.960]  president yeah well then it's not the real question that I keep bringing up
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:25.240]  over and over is how they're going to finance these deficits because they've
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:31.480]  reached the level that that are unprecedented Obama's budget first
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:39.800]  budget which is for the fiscal year 2010 which starts in October is 50%
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:51.440]  rating now that's World War two levels of deficit and of course we had quite
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:15:02.360]  different economy at that time stronger so how long can a government finance
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:12.800]  half of its current operating cost by bar particularly when the economy is in
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:17.400]  turmoil and unemployment's rising people's wealth being wiped out both
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:26.040]  real estate and equities it's probably not something that they're going to be
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:32.800]  able to do and so that that itself will be some kind of a massive shock to the
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:39.680]  system it's entirely possible I read somewhere not long ago a guy said well
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:44.640]  you know when Abraham Lincoln was fighting the Civil War he couldn't
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:49.280]  find a general he kept working his way through general general after general
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:56.000]  after general and those those relatively few poorly armed fully equipped
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.400]  Confederates were kicking his big army's butts over and over and he finally
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:06.720]  found a general so they say Obama will work through all his economic
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:10.120]  advisers till he finds out that he really doesn't have any and then they'll
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:16.080]  have to look for a different approach that could happen it could also if it
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:22.800]  does happen it could happen too late to be able to rescue things so I think
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:32.680]  that we're headed into a really serious situation that is not understood by the
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:39.680]  government or the economists and that can get out of control and it and right
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:46.480]  now they're trying to control it with massive spending and and with restoring
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:51.360]  credit they think if they give the banks enough money that the banks will start
[1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:55.760]  lending and that's the problem but of course the people are so indebted they
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:58.800]  can't afford to borrow so it doesn't really matter when the banks can lend a
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:04.320]  lot so I just don't think they've got their finger on what the real problems
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:08.680]  are and they don't have any solutions since they don't know what the problems
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:15.120]  are and what they're doing is just adding more debt and more money and to a
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:21.400]  system and you can't cure a debt problem by creating more debt so I think that
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:28.000]  they may be swept away I don't really know because the rest of the world is
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:32.200]  in a great deal of difficulty too and we don't get all that good of
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:38.840]  information and so it may just be relative if everybody is as bad off as we
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:44.400]  are we'll keep our relative position on the other hand if they're not as bad
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:52.560]  off we we could see quite a diminution and military and financial power well
[1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:56.600]  the economist magazine as I'm sure you saw so that we're in a depression many
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:00.240]  others have said we've entered a depression a do you think we're entering
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:05.920]  a depression and be as we see Eastern Europe collapsing Iceland collapsing
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:10.920]  Latin American countries collapsing Asian countries in trouble I mean it
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:16.920]  it looks like this party is just getting started that's right it does look it
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:22.520]  does look that way I think that we are in a depression you know the statistician
[1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:29.320]  John Williams measures the unemployment rate the way we measured it in 1980 before
[1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:36.800]  they fiddle with it so much and he says if we use the measures of 1980 the
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:41.120]  official government measures used in 1980 the current rate of unemployment is
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:54.040]  18% not the 7.8 or 7.6 or whatever it is they report but 18% and so even if
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:59.720]  that's an exaggeration it's not much of one so I think we are at the depression
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:06.680]  levels of unemployment and I do not think they've got any solutions the
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:13.440]  solutions that they're trying to use are our solutions to a misdiagnosed
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:19.440]  illness they haven't got the illness correctly diagnosed so they can't
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.240]  produce a cure for it well doctor their solutions are taking $250 million of
[1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:27.800]  the money to offshore came in bank accounts according to CBS News so I
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:36.160]  think the solution is going quite nicely for them well the sharp people
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:41.480]  will always take advantage of the crisis to benefit the felt and there's no doubt
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:45.600]  that is going on not stay there I want to hear about where you see this going
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:49.480]  sir and more on Obama because all these pundits and government people are
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:54.840]  saying now mainstream news are getting ready for military occupation for riots

[1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:22.320]  has been out a few months doing quite well the turning of good intentions
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:32.600]  okay doctor I mean how bad is this gonna get I mean you've been there you've
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:35.040]  been in government you've you've you know you've been in the media you've
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:40.960]  studied things have a lot of wisdom and knowledge why is the media hyping troops
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:45.680]  on the streets riots it's a it's like they're advertising that this is gonna
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:48.560]  happen why do you think they're doing that a and b do you think that will
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:53.840]  happen well well I think the reason they're doing it is because the news is
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.560]  entertainment you know for the for them what they call the mainstream media it's
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:03.680]  really entertainment particularly television so you know people will watch
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:06.840]  it if they're talking about things like that so I think that's why they're
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:15.600]  doing it and my own view is that there probably will be some some riots due to
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:21.440]  the build-up of the unemployment rate and and the continuing foreclosures
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:26.160]  because they still haven't addressed the mortgage problem that people have so I
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:30.480]  think yes there'll probably be some riots they've already been riots in some
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:37.480]  European countries as to whether or not thinking that they can use troops to
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:42.000]  prevent riots or try to occupy the United States I don't think they can the
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:50.480]  country's too big they couldn't occupy Iraq or for that matter Baghdad with the
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:58.120]  entire army so I don't think they can occupy the United States probably don't
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  need to because so many of the police departments have been militarized and
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:11.160]  they they are in effect equipped with military weapons so I do think that
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:19.800]  the police will become a public enemy if we have these types of of rods and
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:25.640]  there'll probably be cases where if we have the rods that they'll have to
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:31.600]  introduce troops I don't know exactly what the fact that has on troops I don't
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:38.520]  I don't know whether they whether that hurts their self-esteem or makes them
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.640]  feel that they're really not defending the country or I don't know what the
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.160]  fact will be and it'll be a certain risk to that's another question I have the
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:50.240]  police and military are really reaching out to me right now and then they're
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.000]  really starting to wake up and realize how they've been militarized and twisted
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.720]  and you know turned into what they are today what are they going to do when
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:00.680]  they're losing their houses and I'm reading articles about firemen police
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:04.080]  city workers losing their houses when grandma is losing it when their children
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.320]  are losing it I mean more and more I see the police and military and the final
[1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:12.320]  equation siding with the people we have 30 plus states moving towards sovereignty
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:17.440]  isn't that a direction towards solution we may just have to have the states take
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:20.480]  the federal government back over and arrest these robber barons and set us
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:26.120]  back on the right course well a revolt the revolution that's what Thomas
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:32.400]  Jefferson said would be necessary said it would be necessary periodically Alex I
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.440]  don't know you asking questions that I have no way of knowing but I think what
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:43.400]  we can say is the fact that there are some of these movements I don't think
[1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:47.520]  the states are going to declare their sovereignty but the fact that there are
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:54.840]  people pushing that and and the fact that police and troops are being abandoned
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:28:02.160]  by their masters these are a sign that the government's power may not be what
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:09.600]  the government thinks it is and and if there is any intelligence in Washington
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:15.480]  left they might realize that and have to come to some better accommodations of
[1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:24.160]  people some different solution and put some concern for the people's interest
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:33.880]  in what they do which they don't do now so in that sense these these are hopeful
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:39.520]  signs on the other hand the more the police lose their jobs and more
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:45.600]  threatening their livelihood becomes as possible they will will hold on tighter
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:51.600]  and tighter to their master skirts in order to have some resources you can't
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:59.920]  predict it but I do think that this type of turmoil is not generally conducive to
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:07.040]  to the power of government Dr. Roberts I know you're a busy man can I hold you
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:10.520]  for five minutes in the other side just to spend five minutes on what you would

[1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:19.000]  ran the financial policy for many years in Washington at least on the Treasury
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:22.640]  side can we hold you over and then just briefly give us a summation of what you
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:26.760]  would be doing right now right okay fine okay stay there sir we'll be right back

[1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:15.280]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty
[1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:19.440]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:23.720]  bloody British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:28.480]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:34.080]  they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:38.680]  we look down a river and we see the British come and they must have been a
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:42.840]  hundred of beating on the drums they stepped so high and they made the bugles
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:47.200]  ring we stood beside our cotton veils didn't say a thing all right we're back
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:51.120]  live I'm gonna open the phones up for callers with that first-hour news are
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:55.400]  reported on accidental contamination of vaccine live avian flu virus virtually
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:59.480]  impossible then they accidentally didn't radiate it when they shipped it out to
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:04.080]  so it'd be live thank God a subcontractor tested it on ferrets because if they
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:07.600]  ferrets get sick it means they didn't radiate it but instead the ferrets died
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:11.280]  and they said oh my gosh but it's it's all an accident the government loves you
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:15.280]  folks they're just gearing up for martial law and the excuse of bird flu again
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:20.880]  just be sure and take all your shots so that's coming up at 1-800-259-9231
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:28.240]  1-800-259-9231 dr. Paul Craig Roberts finishing up what would you be doing
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:32.840]  right now I mean some have said it's too late it's irreversible now to stop the
[1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:36.120]  total implosion but what would you be doing if you were Treasury Secretary
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:39.040]  right now and you had control the private Federal Reserve what would you be
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:45.040]  doing to try to reverse this okay I think that it could be done first thing
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:50.840]  I would do is to suspend the mark the market rule because the mark the market
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:55.720]  rule requires that financial institutions keep their assets on their
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:01.640]  books at current market value and because the current market value of these
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:07.400]  various derivatives and mortgage backed securities is not known nobody will
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:12.680]  touch them and therefore they have a price that's close to zero and that's
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:18.360]  a unrealistic price but if you have to mark your assets down so much you're
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:22.760]  insolvent because your liabilities exceed your assets so I would suspend that rule
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:29.760]  and let them keep their assets at book value until the values become known and
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:35.480]  then they could write them off over time I would imagine that no more than a
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:40.880]  quarter of them are bad and yet Merrill Lynch had to sell the bears at 22
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:47.400]  cents on the dollar and that was ridiculous because we don't have 78% of
[1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:52.080]  the mortgages bad so that's the first thing I would do the next thing I would
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:36:02.280]  do is I would restore the the uptick rule the uptick rule prevents speculators
[1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:07.480]  from ganging up on stocks and driving them down and making themselves rich by
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:12.760]  destroying a company's capitalization the uptick rule says you can't short a
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:17.560]  stock unless it previously moved up sir is one of the main mechanisms for that
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:26.560]  naked shorting that that that is also part of this terrible destruction of the
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:30.880]  equity position of companies so that they can't borrow because they don't have
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.760]  any equity left like General Motors act the other day went down below a billion
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:41.280]  dollars the absurdity so yes that's that that they suspended that rule only a
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:45.160]  few years ago they should never have done that so they have to bring back the
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:50.800]  uptick rule to stop short sellers from destroying the values of companies
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:56.720]  assets I think they should also then make it strictly illegal to speculate
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:01.760]  against national currencies because again that's what destroyed Iceland and
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:06.640]  which has some of the Eastern European countries now in grave trouble so they
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:11.000]  should just say that that's strictly illegal and you'll be immediately
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:19.120]  arrested those actions would put a lot of stability in to the market and with
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:26.200]  the money that they've appropriated I would address the refinancing of the
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:38.440]  individuals mortgages I would if you stop the the failures of the of the
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:45.200]  individual owners of the houses that stops the foreclosures that then would
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.440]  stop the threat to the mortgage-backed derivative assets so the money should be
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:57.560]  used to go in refinance the mortgages if you have to you write off some of them
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:04.400]  based on the new value of the houses and that way you can restore stability at the
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:11.480]  homeowner level unless of course everybody keeps losing their job but you
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:15.600]  can restore stability there without having to give these massive amounts of
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:21.160]  money to banks which doesn't do any good at all you have to give money to
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:28.680]  banks because you have this marked market rule and you let speculators
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:36.520]  drive down assets but just stop that and use what money you have to restore the
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:42.800]  homeowner to make them against the cure in their mortgages and that then
[1:38:42.800 --> 1:38:48.720]  solves that problem the greater problem of course is the unemployment
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:55.640]  the mounting unemployment and the real solution to that is to bring back all
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:03.640]  the offshore jobs that have moved offshore starting around 1990-1995 it's
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:08.880]  been going on for more than a decade and they moved so many high value added
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:15.840]  hyperactive job offshore and that this has affected the ability of the income
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:22.320]  consumer incomes to grow and there's been no real income gains for people
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.280]  because the good job has been moved out so what happened they tried to maintain
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:31.680]  consumption by going deeper and deeper into debt and their incomes didn't go up
[1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:36.000]  they kept their living standards so we need immediate tariffs the problem is
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.600]  the economy is already plunging we put those in they're gonna blame the
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:41.640]  plunging economy on the tariffs and remove them again it's it's incredible
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.520]  well you just don't have to pay attention to what they say you have to do
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.600]  what needs to be done I think the tariffs my help the better solution is
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:55.600]  that they abolish the corporate income tax and they tax corporations based on
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:00.840]  where they produce so if you if most of the value added it is in the United
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:05.080]  States you have a low tax rate if most of the value added is in China and the
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:10.880]  goods come back is imported then you have high tax rate and I think that would
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:14.560]  be acceptable with all of them yeah that's a great idea instead they've paid
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:19.040]  incentives to make a move offshore I mean that's lunacy it's lunacy see what
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:25.440]  it and much much of the trouble is due to hubris it's due to the Americans being
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:33.040]  used to being on top of the world for so long kind of like the Romans they they
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.960]  were on top for so long they got so full of hubris they weren't able to deal
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:42.840]  with the challenges when they showed up and I think that's the part of the
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.680]  problem that we have the the Americans are so used to being the macho hedge
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:53.880]  them on the assault of the earth the tough guy and having their way that
[1:40:53.880 --> 1:41:00.560]  they don't understand when problems come that they can be serious and can
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:06.080]  undo you they just used to surviving and and ruling and I think that that hubris
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:14.200]  is very much present in Washington and it'll be in it attracts people of that
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:21.240]  bit and that is that is part of the problems I agree with you I think I
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.760]  mean I think imperial hubris is the heart of it because they all get up
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:26.640]  there together and I watch the body language of the bush people and now the
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:31.440]  Obama people and Geithner and and you know arrogant Bernanke and all of them
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.280]  and they are just relishing this they're laughing they're giggling Barney
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.880]  Frank at one bill signing at a walk up and tell the car people hey there's
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:42.680]  supposed to be solemn and it's a big joke to them because like a giant you know
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.040]  hedge fund they're out running around really shorting the market itself by
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:51.240]  badmouthing everything driving it down buying it up I mean Citibank is down to
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:56.520]  a dollar right now with all of its assets I mean I mean isn't I mean that's a
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:03.560]  joke that's a that's a joke and it's so irresponsible for the government to let
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:09.640]  that happen and for the free market ideologues to claim that the speculation
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:15.440]  is good and that there shouldn't be any regulation and that will destroy forever
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:22.800]  the consequences will store forever the credibility of free market economics
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:26.160]  yeah they're blaming it on that and this is my last question you were at
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:30.880]  Treasury you know you ran policy and when I see Barack Obama and Geithner and
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.640]  Democratic congressman it's a talking point say and I'm not getting into
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:38.000]  partisanship Bush was just as much as involved as anybody but I know it was
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:44.080]  Lawrence Summers and Geithner and all these guys that changed the rules
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:48.440]  lobbied for them during the Clinton administration to do all this and then
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:54.040]  they go on TV 24-7 and say the free market did this now we need more
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:57.480]  regulation which is actually less regulation on them when they're the
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:02.800]  literal architects of it it's just too rich yes Hank Paulson was responsible
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:10.120]  for a lot of it yes it is it is rich and it's you know they're coming you know
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:14.640]  you could say they're covering for their bodies who are cleaning up speculating
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:19.480]  by destroying everything or you could say that they're just full of your
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:25.920]  Britain's stupid and I've known a few of them not all of them and I'm not
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:32.800]  impressed with their intelligence they they they think in very sort of
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:38.240]  prescribed and traditional ways and so that's why they think that this is
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:44.080]  simply a credit problem this is a problem that can be solved by the
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:51.240]  government spending enough money and by getting the banks to lend and of course
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:57.440]  the problems are entirely different and are not addressed by by what they're
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:02.960]  trying to do so it's going to get away from them I don't see I mean it can be
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:09.400]  some bottom-bouncing and it can look like recovery and stocks can can move up
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:14.800]  but since they have not diagnosed problems are not dealing with them and
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:21.400]  but because they're polluted aspects that polluted the rest of the world this
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:26.560]  is likely to get away from them and to be a very serious thing something much
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:34.920]  all right in closing worse than the Great Depression now in closing how bad
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:39.600]  will it get if it's what is worse than the Great Depression and what do you
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:43.680]  call what's here what's coming hyperstag inflation because you have a
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:48.240]  depression in the real economy but then more and more economists are saying it's
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.680]  going to overheat in the next year with just super you know high inflation so
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:58.600]  in closing we appreciate all your time sir dr. Paul Greek Roberts joining us how
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:07.000]  bad will it get and what is worse than the Great Depression and well in the
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.360]  Great Depression the industry was still there so once a in the Great Depression
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:18.160]  was caused by monetary contraction they let the money supply shrink and that's
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:23.880]  not the problem that we're having now so the Great Depression was easier to
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:27.160]  deal with and the factories were still there now the factories are offshore
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:33.440]  this is not caused by monetary contraction so it doesn't get it can't
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:38.840]  get cured that way and the real question is how they finance these massive
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:45.760]  deficits if they're able to finance them without earning money then we won't
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:51.400]  have to worry about the inflation but if they can't finance them without
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:56.720]  printing money then you'll have the possibility of people out of work and
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:03.560]  prices rising now that's worse than being out of work and prices falling like
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:07.840]  in a depression or staying the same she's doing the Great Depression people
[1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:13.480]  weren't faced simultaneously with inflation but they were in Germany if
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:18.120]  you're faced well I'm telling you I stay no no I understand why more Germany
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:22.920]  resulted from the printing of money sure for the government to pay all its
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.400]  bills under the Versailles Treaty and all the reparations that's what I was
[1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:31.440]  getting at so it's be more like Germany if they have to print money on the
[1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:38.880]  massive scales of these deficits you could see substantial inflation while
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:46.040]  people are out of work why then would really be that is a really in other
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:51.680]  words they're being hit both ends they got no no jobs no income and prices are
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:57.680]  going up so this this is a danger I don't know that it'll happen but if they
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:03.440]  cannot finance those deficits other than by printing money then I don't see how
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:11.080]  it can be avoided and Hillary's running around begging what that Hillary's
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:16.160]  running around begging countries to keep buying the Treasury bills yes well
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:20.560]  even if they even if they do they can't buy them in these quantities see what
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:26.680]  they they buy Treasury bills with their trade surfaces and so the trade
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:35.800]  purposes are not 1.75 trillion they can finance Bush's 2008 budget deficit of
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:44.920]  450 billion but they can't finance the 2010 deficit of two trillion so what's
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.800]  going to happen I'm going to be able to finance this year I don't know what the
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.320]  depth is gonna be they say it's gonna be 1.2 trillion it's probably gonna be
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:57.800]  1.5 so what happens if they can't finance it that's that's the question then
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:03.160]  the Treasury said when it tries to sell it's bond then the Fed has to buy them
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:08.280]  and then the Fed pays for them by giving the Treasury demand deposit so the
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:14.480]  Treasury it starts writing checks and that's like printing money and it on the
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.820]  other hand you see if the economic turmoil is destroying the value of
[1:48:19.820 --> 1:48:25.200]  assets then the printing of money doesn't cause inflation it just sort of
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:30.760]  it's just sort of Christians the fall in other words if the housing prices just
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:37.840]  keep falling and the Treasury is putting money then it's very hard to drive
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:44.600]  them up and if if consumer prices are falling because consumer incomes are
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:50.720]  falling and they're buying less than it so you could have a it depends on how
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:55.120]  long they have these massive deficits and how long they finance them by
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:02.520]  printing money if it becomes you know a multi-year thing the chances of the
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:08.760]  high inflation are greater than if it's a short-term thing happening while other
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:13.760]  prices are falling because the money that comes in would just be offsetting
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:19.920]  the falling values you see what I'm saying I understand it's amazing it's
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:26.320]  amazing but I don't know exactly what mix of this will prevail all I know Alex
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:29.400]  is that they're not thinking about it in Washington they're not addressing this
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:35.560]  issue because they think it's a credit problem and and just a question of
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:40.240]  government so either way you cut it it's wrong-headed leadership and it's
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:44.560]  several different goblets of poison that we're all having to drink from and the
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:48.200]  question is which you know which poison will it be one makes you really sick one
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:51.840]  kills you dr. Paul Craig Roberts thank you for spending so much time with us
[1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:56.080]  and have a great weekend is coming up well thank you Alex and thank you for
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:59.480]  sharing your audience oh thank you for spending time with us take care there
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:02.080]  goes dr. Paul Craig Roberts okay I'm gonna take your calls in this next
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:04.440]  segment the segment after that we got a guest coming on but we'll take calls
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:10.200]  throughout that very informative guest on his host of subjects and then I do
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:13.240]  have a medical doctor coming up the last 40 minutes of the show today to talk
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:17.760]  about this bird flu situation I'm sure listeners want to talk about that I I
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:22.240]  hope you do when we go to your calls here Derek and Mark and Tito and Rob and
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:26.720]  Maria and others accidental contamination of vaccines with live avian flu
[1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:30.920]  virus virtually impossible this is probably the most important story I've
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:37.000]  ever covered I mean it's just it's so incredible how they did this and how
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:41.320]  they shipped it which is unbelievable then how in a bio weapons lab they
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:45.400]  accidentally mix it in you know it was not a bio weapon lab it's a regular lab
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:50.200]  now doing this and then how they don't radiate it when they ship it out I mean
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:53.360]  this is just off the charts and saying your call straight ahead I'm gonna
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:56.120]  continue to cover this throughout the rest of the show and a lot of other
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:51:04.400]  economic news as well this year many of us will have to make the tough decision
[1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:08.960]  on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:12.800]  future in these troubled times one of the most important things your family can
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:16.000]  have is good health some of the contributors to poor health are
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:21.280]  parasites viruses toxins and heavy metals it's a documented fact 80% of
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.680]  all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal

[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:32.040]  shouldn't be a fear we should be afraid of not taking action and becoming
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:38.440]  powered so that this bastard doesn't happen exactly and with with no matter
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:44.520]  what the bogeyman is okay in our brief time here on earth it's a bird flu

[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:38.320]  process without a smidgen of fear realizing that we are eternal creatures
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:44.200]  and that we do our work and we go about our lives and we laugh because it's
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:47.720]  important to keep a sense of humor about this we laugh we play we struggle we

[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:06.240]  with a bunch of other strains of flu so it could possibly mutate and then they
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:10.040]  left it in there alive and it was injected into ferrets and a test by a
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:14.440]  subcontractor and they died you know I mean this is just off the charts insane
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:20.400]  and we're gonna be going over this today let's talk to mark in Oregon mark
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:26.680]  you're on the air welcome morning to you alex hi alex I've got a really
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:31.320]  important thing to say here about the antidote for the bird flu as well as the
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.600]  Ebola virus now I've been aware of this since about two months ago when hawk
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:41.160]  was doing one of Steve quail's last shows in fact it was the last show that
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:49.040]  hawk was on and what hawk reported was is that essential oil of oregano will
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:57.800]  kill the deadly strain the n1h5 I believe it is of the bird flu virus as
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:03.920]  well as the Ebola virus these are the two most talked about in recent years
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:08.320]  likely content listen I think Steve quail and honker great guys and I know
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:11.800]  the oil oregano boost immunity and if you can get it in contact I mean open
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:15.360]  air will kill a virus the issue is you breathe this stuff in it starts
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:19.640]  incubating it starts replicating you know programs your cells to bust open and
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:23.320]  you know producing you know millions per cell that's the issue but I know there
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:26.280]  are a lot of essential oils especially all oregano that have been prohibited
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:30.600]  medical studies to have a good effect so does elderberry and things as
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:35.160]  antivirals I just you know tell them and I'm not sure if you was he saying it's
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:39.720]  an all a cure all because I like he got this information from dr. Cass
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:42.640]  Ingraham have you heard of dr. Cass Ingraham who's a medical doctor
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:46.800]  naturalistic doctor dr. Cass Ingraham has read the book called the cures on
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:50.040]  the cupboard and that's the way that you could get him and touch with him or
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:54.560]  however to have him on to verify this to you but the information is is that
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:59.760]  dr. Cass Ingraham reported several months ago that the these two viruses in
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:05.000]  university studies have been proven to kill these viruses I've seen those and
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:11.080]  I appreciate your call I've seen that it's had some good effect yes so thank
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:17.120]  you I appreciate the call let's go ahead and talk to Tito in Canada go ahead
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:23.320]  hey Alex how you doing today good sir great I wanted to say thank you for all
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:26.520]  the information you've been providing us I've been listening for a few years and
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:30.760]  I just love it you know and I'm doing my part to spread the word to I'm calling
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:33.880]  today about a movie it's not an advertisement but I wanted to talk about
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:38.080]  watchmen and I haven't heard it discussed on your show yet yeah it's total
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:42.160]  Illuminati symbolism I think we're gonna go watch it Saturday to do a review of
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:45.120]  it because some people in the office want to see it it's a three-hour film go
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  ahead and tell folks about it okay well I've seen the movie already I was
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:52.920]  fortunate enough to watch it and I've read the comic book and all that kind of
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:59.880]  good stuff but the movie features a false flag attack on New York and 1985 an
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:03.400]  alternate sort of universe with superheroes and things like that but
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:08.000]  the writer Alan Moore he was very into the old cult and things like that there's
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.800]  a lot of new world order some of that people smell me the comic book it's all
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:17.800]  new world order all Illuminati and the differences in this in this film when
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:22.880]  they do the false flag attack it's to stop an impending war between Russia and
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:27.680]  the United States and in their version they can talk to a false flag attack
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:32.600]  that brings the world together in peace to avert a war but well yeah that's why
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:36.040]  the globalists do this they say they stage terror attacks for good reasons
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:39.480]  that's why the army carries these out it's in the army you know I got a guest
[2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:42.520]  coming up but I want to hear more from you Tito so let me get the guest on

[2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:16.680]  Ron Paul grills been Bernanke and Paul sitting out Geithner somewhat but he's
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:20.760]  so gentlemanly he doesn't really nail a mic some of us would like there's an
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:23.360]  independent congressman we're gonna play this clip coming up the start of the
[2:08:23.360 --> 2:08:27.600]  next hour who absolutely savages him and says where's the money why won't you
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:31.480]  say where the trillions went and Bernanke will not say that some of those
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:34.240]  clips coming up in the next hour then we've got a doctor coming on a medical
[2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:37.960]  doctor about how vaccines over and over again end up causing the plagues
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:42.840]  they're supposedly meant to treat this is on record is that dovetails with a
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:47.080]  story that Paul Watson wrote it's up on prisonplanet.com accidentally
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:53.240]  contamination of vaccine with live avian flu virus virtually impossible and it's
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:57.080]  all over the German it's all over the Czech news it's it's all over the
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:02.160]  Canadian news Canadian free press the Toronto Sun Baxter product contain live
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:08.080]  flu virus had nothing to do with the regular flu vaccine with a spectrum of
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:11.680]  different viruses being prepared at different labs in Europe from the flu
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:16.320]  virus stock sent by the US company we've got it up on screen right now we're live
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:23.840]  at prisonplanet.tv and so number number one it shouldn't have been mailed out
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:28.240]  to all these firms then they gave them instructions to mix it without telling
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:31.440]  them what it was with the other spectrum of regular flu viruses that are
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:34.920]  airborne highly contagious with the deadly but it's hard to catch but if you
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:39.000]  can catch it it only lives a few seconds in the air regular flu can live like
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:44.520]  30 minutes or longer if if if it recombines with this which is what it
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:50.200]  would normally do either in the live batch being made or once it got in the
[2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:55.480]  human body it would just be a devastating plague now what's so scary
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:59.240]  about this is is that they then radiate all of these and send them out to
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:03.880]  sub labs that are supposed to do tests and a lab in Czechoslovakia this one
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:08.000]  all over Europe they give ferrets an injection of it and if the ferret
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:11.800]  doesn't get sick they know that the flu was prepared and isn't live because they
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:14.560]  have a problem with it you know not being damaged enough by the radiation
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:19.120]  still be live flu just the regular flu but some of the ferrets not getting sick
[2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:23.000]  like they were supposed to or getting sick if it was regular flu vaccine and
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:26.680]  had been radiated right they died and so they tested what was in it and said my
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:34.560]  god this is the h5 in one the deadly bird flu get hard to catch but if you catch
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:40.560]  it it kills people more than 60% of the time just deadly deadly deadly so the
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:44.680]  incredible accident after incredible accident after incredible accident and a
[2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:48.880]  lot of scientists are quoted in the Czechoslovakian news Czech Republic
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:53.760]  news other papers saying you know we think this could be a setup by the
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:57.720]  company to to to cause some outbreak and then they are also developing
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:04.120]  separately an h in an h5 in one vaccine and this could be a money-making scam
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:10.880]  you know it's not Alex Jones saying that it's the news saying that and
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:16.160]  Baxter's been involved before we have links to that with Bayer that shipped
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:22.200]  out the live HIV and hepatitis in the factor 8 blood product millions I mean
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:25.640]  this is just off the charts insane and you know when I was talking to Marcus
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:29.160]  Williams about getting on the show he's a patriot carries my books and films at
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:32.680]  his newbie and bookstore one of the most successful private you know single
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:37.880]  standing black bookstores in the country and I got to know him because he sent
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:41.960]  us some a progressor griff interview from public enemy that he's done for many
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:45.360]  years they're good friends we're working on getting professor griff on the show
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:50.800]  as soon as the schedule allows I thought why not just have Marcus Williams on I
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:54.000]  said we'll talk about Marcus and he said well when I come on I want to talk
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.880]  some about Obama you know how we need a Niels told my producer this you know a
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:02.200]  black voice criticizing him so they can't claim it some race thing but he
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:04.920]  said really I want you to talk about and I want you know he recommended some
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:11.000]  guests I have on about how through the vaccines and other systems how they're
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  poisoning us how the UN's been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots in
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.440]  Africa other places to sterilize women that's on record mainstream news
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:23.400]  Nobel laureates have come out and said they're putting HIV in different
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:27.680]  hepatitis C vaccinations in Africa they were caught doing that in New York
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:31.440]  accidentally you know having it in the hepatitis shots for gay men's because
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:34.760]  they would have a lot of sexual partners be a perfect vector to spread it in the
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:39.960]  late 70s early 80s and so here he is today set up a week ago right when this
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:45.240]  avian flu being mixed in with the regular vaccine news is breaking and
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:49.040]  they're trying to find out where it was shipped what was done a week ago this
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:52.360]  internally broke as companies were demanding to find out why this happened
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:56.440]  the company was stonewalling we're still trying to find out the tales right now
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:00.960]  this is a very serious issue we need to address this is serious because we know
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:04.400]  what these globalists are all about in eugenics so Marcus Williams good to have
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:10.960]  you on with us sir good what do you think of this latest report this is
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:13.760]  exactly what you brought up that you want to discuss a week ago on the show
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:21.840]  was what you called medicine as in a sin just quite interesting timing to have
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:27.120]  you on today yeah that's actually a book read by Dr. Scott Whitaker yes hope
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:33.760]  that you have on your show real soon and he's been speaking out of the things
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:38.120]  as far as with the whole eugenics vaccines last but you cover your show all
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:42.320]  the time and I and I think it's going to be a real good interview to have on
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.920]  your show hopefully real soon to go for a detail with somebody who's a little more
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:50.640]  specialized into the whole vaccines the whole medical field versus myself yes
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:55.280]  we're setting up Dr. Scott Whitaker we're also setting up a professor griff
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:58.920]  thanks to you now specifically though I mean you know you have a bookstore you've
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:01.840]  read these books you've covered it you've seen it more and more it comes out
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:06.720]  this has been done in Africa some countries in Africa 40% have HIV they
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:11.440]  do medical tests these women have never even had sex in many cases even the BBC
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:17.600]  admits that somebody is basically giving them the HIV right and even though go
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:23.440]  back with the whole that the surface experiment I mean it's been throughout no
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:26.800]  long periods of times and years where we've seen though the government and
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:30.720]  certain pharmaceutical companies though doing experiments on the people through
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:34.760]  drugs experimentation stuff like that has been going on in Africa for a long
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:41.080]  period of time so we've been seeing all Obama know increase the funding for no
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:46.960]  Planned Parenthood and other you know HIV treatment condoms nursing in Africa
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:51.200]  has been boosted up underneath his administration so but the main reason I
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:54.960]  want to come on your show was that you called me because you saw my interview
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:58.600]  with our professor griff and I think that a lot of times the media a lot of
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:02.880]  people are under the impression like the vast majority of black people are just
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:08.400]  sold on Barack Obama which is very far from the truth there's a vast number of
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:13.560]  people in the African-American community who do not support Obama even during the
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:18.760]  primaries I knew myself I was a Ron Paul supporter I was disappointed that he
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:23.880]  didn't go on the independent ticker maybe go on the Constitution party ticket
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:30.080]  and so since he didn't run I voted for Cynthia McKinney yes but I think that a
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:34.160]  lot of people I think this like when I heard you interview with Paul Craig
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:39.360]  Roberts I think we said that voted supported Obama I think that that no
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:43.640]  Obama's voting record and who finances campaign was open to the public many
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:49.760]  many months before the before the election and I never within the black
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.200]  community to say just outside of Illinois in Chicago Barack Obama was a
[2:15:54.200 --> 2:16:00.320]  nobody I never heard of Barack Obama until the 2004 Democratic convention when
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:04.480]  he gave a speech and a lot of people you know talk about Obama giving this great
[2:16:04.480 --> 2:16:07.040]  speech and then when I watched it I really didn't see anything of substance
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.040]  I saw a good act but I didn't know hearing these sessions so and I checked
[2:16:12.040 --> 2:16:17.040]  the guy's voting record and looked at no who finances campaign and I'm thinking
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:22.880]  that this is not somebody I think that the people should be endorsing and so
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:27.680]  after no dig into his record on the Patriot Act of funding the war refusing
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:33.880]  to investigate Bush or any war crimes FISA NAFTA we saw during the primaries the
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:38.680]  Democratic primaries Barack Obama's economic advisor one of them Alan
[2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:43.880]  Gooseby who's a member of Scullin bones tell the I think was the Canadian
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:48.560]  Consulate that a lot of the rhetoric that Obama was saying about NAFTA during
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:52.960]  the Democratic Ohio primaries was just a bunch of talk and that he really did
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:58.160]  mean what he was saying so I just think that you know I think a lot of people
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:03.920]  that they really have to get over it get it off of the whole American Idol
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:08.080]  personality driven support of people really look at more the substance of
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:11.160]  people and I think that too many times especially within the African-American
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:15.840]  community I think it happens in all communities where they don't really
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:20.400]  want to dig deep into the issues they get on a bandwagon things were bad under
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:24.040]  Bush the economy's imploding we want to believe that this is really a good guy
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:28.080]  he's going to fix things but he's even gone on the show with Stephanophilus the
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:32.880]  Sunday show and now said yeah that was campaign rhetoric on NAFTA get in I mean
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:38.720]  it's just an incredible betrayal do you think that the folks in Atlanta that you
[2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:42.800]  talk to black or white are they starting to break the spell or are they still
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:46.240]  just as deep in that spell I think a large portion of us
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:50.480]  still deep in that spell but I think over time goes on that more and more of them are going to wake
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:54.160]  up and realize that Barack Obama was one of the biggest political frauds in
[2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:57.840]  recent memory because with him adding more true stuff
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:02.880]  Gannis said which was no secret prior to him being elected but we still saw a
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:06.800]  lot of people within the so-called anti-war movement like cold pink and
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.960]  others you know support Obama but I think over time once they see that Obama
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:16.680]  really has no agenda to really to fix the economy remove remove the troops from
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:20.800]  the war really bring jobs into this country I think a lot of the hype is
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:24.600]  going to I think it's going to be fade away before the end of the year easily
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:28.520]  that's right now he's going out to big black groups and others but
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:31.960]  specifically going speaking to big black conferences and saying hey you're going
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:35.480]  to lose your jobs particularly black folks it's going to be really tough now
[2:18:35.480 --> 2:18:39.960]  that's basically the change and they're saying what because he promised this
[2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:42.440]  milk and honey and hope and change everything was going to be all right
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:46.680]  and then he just switched right into the fear of the with Bush had done saying
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:50.840]  look do what we say with the banks or a crisis will turn into a catastrophe and
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:55.800]  he's now even cutting subsidies and I'm not for socialism because it makes you
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:59.080]  dependent but they're done making us dependent now he's cutting a bunch of
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:02.920]  subsidies actually to the people and it's all going to the banks I mean the
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:06.880]  bankers are just gorging everything right you're absolutely right with the
[2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:12.680]  baler of the bailout thing back in October of a large portion of the
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:16.360]  Congressional Black Caucus voted against the bailout during the first vote
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:20.120]  within the House of Representatives and it was Barack Obama who got on the phone
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:24.240]  lobbied a lot of the members of Congressional Black Caucus to switch their
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:28.080]  votes and after him lobbying the Congressional Black Caucus a large
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.920]  portion of which there's no vote yes knows from the second vote vote round and I
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.000]  think that alone right there just told the people that this guy is not for
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:42.120]  people here that's no calling how to fix the account well and and on top of it
[2:19:42.120 --> 2:19:45.640]  it doesn't matter what color he is whether he's from Africa or for China or
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:51.040]  from Russia but it is really a lie to say that he's the you know a black guy
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:55.080]  because his dad was mainly Arab and his mom was white and so there's a lot of
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:59.160]  fraud you know there as well as just the guy is a complete phony stay with us
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:04.800]  mr. Williams a day unlike any other in the long course of American history a
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:09.440]  terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:15.040]  September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his M.O. we have to look to
[2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:18.560]  the Middle East we have to look to this home of bin Laden fabled enemies is the
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:22.400]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence

[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:20.400]  want good relations between all human beings I'm sick and tired of the elite
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:24.720]  playing people off against each other through tribalism which is the modern
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:31.800]  term racism divide and conquer vulcanization but they plan once
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:36.120]  people learn that Obama's betrayed people they're already doing it when
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:40.480]  people criticize Obama they say it's racism to actually drive a wedge
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:44.920]  through all of this and now he is the face of imperialism like what Professor
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:48.680]  Griff said he and we put this in the Obama deception thanks to Marcus
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:54.600]  Williams that he is the new blackface of imperialism we have that on the back
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:25:00.040]  cover that tyranny gets a facelift it's just a front so that the people of the
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:02.440]  world feel like they're included in the new world order that's what Webster
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:04.600]  Tarpoli says in the film
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:09.760]  Keras one says something similar they said it here on the air that they put a
[2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:13.200]  blackface on the new world order and everybody was ready for revolution
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:16.080]  they were standing up they were angry they were waking up to the globalist and
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.560]  all suddenly put a black man up there and now everybody's sitting back now
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:26.920]  everybody's going okay I'll stand down can you comment on those thoughts Mr.
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:34.200]  Williams yeah I think that in reference to I mean really actually just really
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:39.520]  been really puzzling to me as far as no like back in 2000 Barack Obama ran for
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:44.320]  Congress and lost the Bobby Rush by I think over like 25 to 30 points and then
[2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:49.560]  to see this guy within an eight-year period raised just under a billion
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:54.960]  dollars in campaign finances and then when the presidency I mean it's a it's a
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:59.240]  movie script I mean it's just you know it's just funny there's no mess Nelson
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:03.040]  Mandela being locked up in jail for 27 years and soon as he gets out he becomes
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:07.400]  president I mean it's a script behind the scenes that's going on and I think
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:12.480]  that too many people especially those within the African-American community
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:16.800]  which I think are being brainwashed by a lot especially black media who wouldn't
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:20.760]  even get sent to McKinney absolutely no play in the media when you look at
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:25.080]  the McKinney's resume as far as calling for investigations on 9-11
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:31.040]  investigating Bush impeachment speaking out against the NAFTA and other things
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:36.360]  the Warren drug she spoke out against the white slavery kidnapping going on by
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:40.440]  Dinecore and Halliburton she spoke out on the trillions stolen by the Pentagon
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:45.320]  and they went after her because she is good right and just to see how the media
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:49.920]  I'm just from a different black media black talk radio commercial black talk
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:54.760]  radio it's like Steve Harvey Michael Bayes and others give her absolutely no
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:59.960]  media play but they give Barack Obama basically free commercials free play
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:04.280]  24-7 brainwashing the people into buying into somebody who has really
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:09.640]  absolutely no record no history really doing anything major within politics and
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:13.120]  within the black community I mean I always ask people all the time those who
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:19.360]  support Obama during their election name you one hot button topic or issue
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:22.200]  where Barack Obama was on the right side and a lot of people that looked at me
[2:27:22.200 --> 2:27:26.720]  they can't name that one issue where Barack Obama was standing on the right
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:30.360]  side of a hot button issue but we thought the bailout ties of the Patriot Act
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:36.280]  NAFTA and the listing go on now he's backing Bush and continuing to not give
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.160]  detainees even Geneva Convention rights he's keeping the secret camps open
[2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:44.440]  talking about closing Guantanamo I mean it's just absolute and I go down the
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:48.400]  street and talk to Obama supporters most people in Austin and they even know who
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:50.880]  I am and know about the New World War they go yeah but we just got to get
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:54.040]  behind him come on Alex we got to give him a chance he's not going to be
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:59.160]  perfect and I'm like look it's a setup he's a puppet just like Bush quit looking
[2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:02.720]  at the puppet look at the elites behind him things are only going to get worse
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:08.720]  why do you enjoy being suckers why do you love being suckers why do you love
[2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:11.800]  being conned why do you love being taken for a ride
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:15.520]  I think there's that same thing where you see I guess within the right to be
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:19.680]  out as far as those people know better but still for whatever reason choose to
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:23.880]  go with the southern of the two lesser know the lesser two evils same thing
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:27.120]  within the black community whereas a lot of people who know about the
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:31.200]  Tribal Idol Commission the Council of Formulations everything but yet they
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:35.160]  still would not support Senator McKinney but there was support Obama I just heard
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:38.840]  I think even in the primaries I heard I was like I said Mike would barrel from
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:43.360]  what really happened that time and no he wouldn't know was no with the whole no
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:48.800]  big Obama's gonna be not as bad as McCain I think that the whole strategy of
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:52.600]  supporting some form of evil or supporting the lesser two evils it's a
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:57.200]  failed strategy I think that no people got to really just vote to support those
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:02.000]  candidates who we know will not so it's not just set up for that's right as a
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.080]  best chance of winning a real big problem across the board people like to
[2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:09.160]  feel like they're the winner and so as soon as it looks like a team's gonna win
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:13.120]  the Super Bowl in the playoffs they they become fans it's the bandwagon effect I
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:16.920]  talked about earlier and it's like a horse race they that's the horse that's
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:21.520]  supposed to win they want to battle that horse but who owns the track who owns
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:27.440]  the company who owns the whole racetrack right instead of just the horses in my
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:32.320]  whole thing is that you know I can't compromise my value in my position on
[2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:39.040]  issue just support no who's gonna win I mean I just can't compromise my value

[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:05.320]  they run electricity the solar generators like having a silent power
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:08.680]  plant hidden in your home it's the perfect emergency backup for trouble times
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:13.440]  mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com or give them a call at
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:21.920]  877-327-0365 877-327-0365 the great folks from solutions science mysolar

[2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:30.400]  carries our books and videos and I talked a lot of folks that have been
[2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:36.000]  there an incredible selection for folks in the Georgia area or in the Atlanta
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:42.600]  metro area and you've also got a way folks can call and I guess get a brochure
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:46.440]  because you've got a bunch of titles especially that are particularly
[2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:49.080]  informative for African Americans but I think everybody
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:53.600]  should read these and see these films and understand that perspective
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:57.440]  of the true awakening happening in society particularly
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:01.200]  with the black community out there so Mr. Williams put a plug in for your fine
[2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:02.480]  bookstore

[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:07.320]  appreciate you for even giving me this opportunity to come on your show to
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:10.920]  even discuss this issue and promote my story because when you called me I was
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:14.800]  shocked because I've been listening to you like over seven years I've been
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:18.120]  listening to you and I've been playing your program in my store so I get a lot
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:21.160]  people who's always listening who's always asking from time to time as far as
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:24.480]  you know who is that and I've done that it's you and a lot of people never
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:28.920]  recognize your and also know identify you know as far as being a listener to
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:33.960]  your show too so you have a large listening audience within the African
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:37.560]  American community who's also hit to a lot of stuff going on with Obama so I
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:42.760]  wanted a lot of your listeners who are who might be non-black know that don't
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:46.040]  be fooled by what's in the media stuff as far as thinking that everybody in
[2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:51.000]  the African American community is sold on Obama it's a large huge number of
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:55.120]  people who don't but you just don't get to see them on TV it looks like a
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:39:00.160]  Republican or something like that but in that though there's a large number of
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:04.720]  people who are hit to the game and well here's an example of stereotypes and
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:08.520]  judging a book by its cover normally being a fraud Ron Paul goes before CPAC
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:13.040]  the big neocon conservative you know thousands and thousands like tens of
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:16.760]  thousands in this giant auditorium as far as the I could see you know sitting
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:20.800]  in chairs and limbaugh was speaking all these other people Ron Paul gets up and
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:24.680]  says we killed over a million Iraqis the war was evil the war is a fraud the war
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:29.960]  was bad we need to stop it and they and the majority are clapping and whooping
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:33.640]  because the average conservative it doesn't believe what they say a
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:38.400]  conservative is in the media they love telling people who they are telling
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:42.080]  people what they are we need to just stop thinking that way and decide who we
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:46.200]  are for ourselves but so many people stay like David Ike says and others in
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:51.920]  that little bubble when we're spiritual beings you know we're and you know we're
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:57.720]  on this planet for a reason one time and we're all together as humanity and
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:00.840]  there's always been good and evil in the world and as soon as we don't realize
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:04.760]  that there's evil we fall prey to it I want to go to some phone calls now he
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:07.520]  called in earlier but I couldn't go to him then he wants to do give us a review
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:12.160]  of the Watchman film he got a chance to see it at a sneak peek it comes out
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:19.000]  tomorrow Tito in Canada you're on the air Tito finish up the point you wanted
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:24.040]  to add okay great I mean just to make one thing clear I you know I don't
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:26.600]  really feel comfortable giving a full review of the movie it doesn't come up
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:29.960]  till tomorrow you know so I'd really like to preserve whatever you said you
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:32.560]  wanted to talk about the movie so I'm giving you a chance to whatever I
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:37.480]  appreciate it I'm just one let everyone know that it's a great talking point for
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:41.760]  those people who may not be familiar with the false flag attack and it brings
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:45.720]  up a lot of the movie touches on basically so many things that we talk
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:49.160]  about here on the show and so many things in the truth movement you know
[2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:53.960]  whether it's the one conspiracy figure who who is trying to get the truth out
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:41:00.000]  in it and you know fighting against the the New World Order even even right
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:03.640]  till the end to never compromise even in the face of Armageddon you know and
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:07.360]  that's a message that we can all take to heart as well it's a fantastic movie and
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:11.560]  I just I just want everyone to see it so that when they have their friends and
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:14.600]  they want to talk about these kind of things this is another springboard
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:18.360]  another opportunity and it's another place for us to bring up these points
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:22.320]  about how these things happen not only in the superhero world they're showing
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:26.160]  but in our world as well yeah but you say it's a fantastic movie weren't you
[2:41:26.160 --> 2:41:30.000]  saying that they stage a false flag attack to bring world peace I mean
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:33.440]  that's how the Illuminati operates and thinks are you saying it's fantastic
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:36.960]  this is a great way to get people to wake up because the only operating popular
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:41.680]  culture to understand what false flag terror is that's true and secondly the
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:45.160]  movie doesn't necessarily say that this is the right decision or a good
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:51.280]  decision and and allows the viewer to become engaged in sort of question what
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:55.760]  they're seeing you know in the motives behind it it surely doesn't paint it in
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:00.560]  a good picture okay let me ask you this question and then I want to ask mr.
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:03.160]  Williams this question Marcus Williams our guest newbie a bookstore owner
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:09.160]  outside Atlanta Georgia children of men and scores of other films the last
[2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:14.400]  couple years come out V for Vendetta the government's putting the deadly bio
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:18.360]  weapon in the vaccines to bring in martial law the government sterilize
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.400]  the people of the government staging bombing attacks to bring in control in
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:28.040]  the film children of men all these and I've gotten a chance to actually know
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:31.400]  some high-level Hollywood people and I've seen the tribulations they've gone
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:34.280]  through trying to get the truth out because there's a group above Hollywood
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:37.000]  controlling them and threatening them even threatening their families and
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:41.760]  doing smear campaign so I do know that all of Hollywood isn't controlled but when
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:45.240]  I talk to them they tell me who is controlled and admit the Pentagon and
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:49.760]  CIA I've had the ex files you know folks on Dean Haglin same as CIA planted the
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:52.280]  story of flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center the government
[2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:56.280]  uses a drill to make norad stand down you know exactly what happened on 9-11
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:00.800]  aired six months before so it's not all just one monolithic thing do you think
[2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:09.200]  Tito and then Marcus do you think that this is a rebellion in Hollywood or is
[2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:13.960]  this revelation of the method where they're subconsciously conditioning us
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:18.760]  why do you think so many of these movies are coming out now I mean almost
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:23.120]  every science fiction or action movie you know the last diehard movie an evil
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:26.240]  guy in the government staging a thing to cause a fire cell to blow up the
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:30.080]  economy what do you think's happening Tito well I think first of all for
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:34.640]  watchmen I mean it was written in 1985 so it takes a bit it takes that sort of
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:40.840]  political still a little bit with the Cold War mentality behind it and so you
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:44.760]  know and if we're looking at it after now we're entering notice how we're
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:48.480]  entering back into that now though we're going back into the Cold War it is very
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:53.600]  specific to go ahead and I just feel like the movie is set in a different time
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:58.000]  and and it uses superheroes in place of government because in this movie
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.800]  essentially the superheroes act on behalf of governments you know sometimes
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:06.680]  and and and even bigger than the government when they take in their full
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:10.880]  power over the world and so it while it doesn't come out necessarily say hey
[2:44:10.880 --> 2:44:15.280]  governments can do this or that it it puts the idea in your head that these
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:20.320]  people who may be benign appearing and wanting to help the world sometimes in
[2:44:20.320 --> 2:44:25.040]  their cold logic you know make very horrific decision yeah all right thanks
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:28.480]  for the call thanks for the call I'll do a review coming up Monday I'm going to
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:31.520]  see it Saturday with some of the guys so somebody's birthday here so we're going
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:35.360]  out a rarity of kind of celebrating Obama's
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:39.320]  exceptions done take a few nights off and actually go out and eat and stuff we
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:43.960]  do that but that's what the higher-level luminous masons
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:48.720]  resurrections do is when you see people love these archetypal superheroes those
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:56.040]  are taking the place of of the angels the gods they worship with skull and
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:44:59.800]  bones and other things and so that's that message they're giving give us your
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:05.060]  take on this Marcus I think that I think the most difficult of all those
[2:45:05.060 --> 2:45:11.440]  movies are coming out with the government no doing I guess evil things
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:15.960]  against the public I just even go I just we guys were talking I was thinking
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:20.000]  back to the whole Oklahoma City bombing where the thing was the governor's
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.720]  brother so what's the governor the mayor who I wrote a book yeah the governor's
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:28.600]  brother wrote a book right where a Tim McVeigh bombs the federal building
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:33.200]  exactly as it happened go ahead and at the fact I think the guy who did it had
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:38.160]  the exact same or so much felt last name is the Tim McVeigh in the book and I
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:43.200]  think the most if I think a lot is just a lot of conditioning the people so
[2:45:43.200 --> 2:45:50.600]  consciously through these movies to I don't know just to it that I'm I'm
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:55.640]  really it's really mind-blowing I agree no no I agree with you and that's why
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.800]  they'll allow directors because I've looked into this that are actually on
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:03.480]  our side the big boys will say go ahead and let them do it you know and the
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:07.200]  directors themselves don't realize they're being manipulated but I mean take
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.680]  take Oliver Stone as any given Sunday it's the Aztecs versus the Knights
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:15.480]  Templars everything is Illuminati in that film that's Oliver Stone letting you
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:19.800]  know that he knows what's really going on but we still know a lot of times
[2:46:19.800 --> 2:46:23.240]  within the movies we still have the symbolism the story lines and stuff is
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:27.240]  just another it's just the mirror of what's going to happen in the future or
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:32.880]  what's going on right now in reality take a New Orleans oil storm aired nine
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:39.320]  months before Katrina hit Mayor Raynegan took part in the film where exactly
[2:46:39.320 --> 2:46:44.360]  what happens happens and then it comes out nine months later right and it was
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:49.040]  also reported that you know Mayor Neagan also had told us was a
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:54.160]  voodoo spirit con that know that that they in fact did bomb the levee and we
[2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:57.840]  still know the moves about with the oil storm when we see them just predict
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:01.840]  exactly what happened with her to Katrina was predicted or shown no many
[2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:08.120]  months in advance to that movie it's it's a it's a it's a it's really it's
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:13.240]  really crazy out it's just well you see these Luciferians are our magicians
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:17.200]  they believe in magic they believe in numbers they they believe we read and
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:20.880]  I've bought you know the official black magic books that you know been
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:24.800]  republished for five hundred years and read them and they both they call it
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:27.840]  lesser magic they believe that by showing you what they're going to do
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:33.000]  first that gives them even more power later the Native Americans call it
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:37.440]  counting coup they would have a little soft club and in a fight if they were
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:41.360]  really a big warrior you know especially in fights within the village you know to
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:46.000]  to test you know if somebody wanted to challenge them they would do death blows
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:50.200]  repeatedly and then after they counted coup five or six times yeah could have
[2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:53.760]  already killed you six times then they pull out the real club of the big rock
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:48:00.320]  and kill them so this is counting coup so if I got a quick question for you that
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:08.200]  was to ask you as far as you know what would you put that's going down with the economy with
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:12.120]  Obama city more true stuff in Afghanistan what do you think would be
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:17.400]  like the best action I guess that people would I mean what can the people do as
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:24.680]  far as trying to counter attack what's going on with the economy and everything
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:31.920]  specifically is that two questions or specifically as far as you know what do
[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:36.280]  you think that the people should do it as this I mean like to my bookstore like
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:40.200]  I always know give away you know information and stuff to try to wake up
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:44.800]  people so you know certain things that's going on within politics health and
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:50.320]  etc. but as far as I think that as far as trying to come up with some type of
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:56.480]  group or network I really have a real positive effect of real change you know
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:02.440]  I think just resist demonstrate calling to talk shows make films make blogs point
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:05.800]  out there's a shadow government it's what the Obama deception does point out
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:12.600]  that hey forget Obama you forget Bush there are the puppet masters behind the
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:17.520]  puppets things are only going to get worse until we arrest these bankers
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:22.680]  until we arrest the New World Order and talk about that as a solution instead of
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:25.400]  getting caught up I know you know this but for the general folks that they're
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:29.920]  one of the solution to not get caught up in the false choices they give us and
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:35.280]  debate just that limited universe of ideas they give us and expand out of the
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:39.640]  larger universe of ideas and and really get more aggressive and say you're a pack
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:44.400]  of made-off criminals like Bernard Madoff that are looting and robbing you are
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:49.800]  criminal you're you know you are destroying things by design and just
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:54.760]  basic educate people one person at a time to how illegitimate this is until
[2:49:54.760 --> 2:50:00.480]  the system just loses all credibility and then we can take it back and educate
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:04.360]  the police and military not to go along with martial law and defend the Second
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:08.880]  Amendment and expose that you know stand up to Democrats and say look at you you
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:12.360]  you know you attack Bush for doing all this evil but now you're for it because
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:15.720]  it's Obama and you feel like he's your man you've got a seat at the table you're
[2:50:15.720 --> 2:50:21.400]  a sucker I think being aggressive and in people's faces is the way to go so many
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:24.440]  people are nice about it and kind of you know creep up and I know you think I'm a
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:28.440]  cook but there's a New World Order all the time for that's over we need people
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:32.800]  to be bold you know fortune favors the bold what did Frederick Douglass say
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:38.760]  freedom is not given it is taken it is seized we will we just have to get
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:42.640]  aggressive and know we're right and know we have power and know we can affect
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:46.520]  change and develop our communities and love each other like Mahomet Gandhi said

[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:02.400]  today
[2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:15.320]  I was just talking to Paul Hartman during the break mr. Williams and his
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:20.520]  barber is a Prince Hall you know black mason they were having a big
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:22.880]  discussion about the New World Order and he was saying that his barber knew all
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:26.000]  about the New World Order and said they were puppets and it was bad but then he
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:29.040]  thinks that being a mason's good they wanted me to ask you do you ever have
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:34.240]  black mason's Prince Hall Lodge you know before the mason's were racist and
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:39.600]  wouldn't let black folks in they had their own group I mean do you have any
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:43.600]  comments on that like reportedly Jesse Jackson and others are really mason's
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:47.600]  you never hear Jesse Jackson say take down the statue behind the Supreme
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:52.280]  Court we've been there we video taped it in DC of Albert Pike the founder of the
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:57.760]  Cook-Lux Klan Supreme Grand Mason yeah you know here in Atlanta George I'm
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:03.240]  originally from Michigan but here in the south the masonic in the order of the
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:08.520]  Eastern Star Movement is real real big here in Georgia in the south I get a lot
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:13.720]  of mason's I come to my side and here my books I do sell no I'm gonna find a
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:18.240]  book to rituals because I get I got a large demand for people who want to do
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:22.560]  with a free masonry and so it's real big here and I get a lot of you know who
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:27.680]  also know read where I'm familiar with your books and videos and I think that a
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:31.880]  lot of in my personal opinion I have a lot of relatives who are mason's I'm
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:37.840]  not it and the masonic order I've really never been impressed with in my
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:41.320]  family members as far as I can eat knowledge and I guess I guess they're
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:48.920]  learning in the lodges or whatever so I think to me I think is I think in the
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:53.840]  black community to me personally such on the low level I think that is I don't
[2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:57.120]  really take the mason's as far as really being a real big
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:01.880]  better anything really I agree with you I believe most mason's I know most mason's
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.000]  are porch mason's let's take a call Robin California you're on the year with
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:10.120]  the owner of the newbie and bookstore in Atlanta Georgia Marcus Williams yeah you
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:13.480]  guys were right on it with the movie industry I just saw the the
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:18.040]  international last weekend that movies that chills down my spine have you seen
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.040]  that one no but I've read the synopsis to talk to folks that have seen it they
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:25.760]  claim there's one bad rogue bank that needs to be banned and the big
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:28.920]  international banks seem to stop it in the end and notice they're introducing
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:32.360]  legislation to shut down the smaller banks internationally right now so these
[2:56:32.360 --> 2:56:36.200]  movies come in perfectly just like they kill blood diamonds that stop the
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:38.760]  diamonds that only means stop the diamonds that independence are putting
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:42.280]  out it's actually the beers that has the slave camps but they imply that the
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:46.640]  beers is fighting it yeah they made a comment in there he said it's not about
[2:56:46.640 --> 2:56:52.280]  the the money said we want the debt and that just like that's something all up
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:56.280]  for me you know but I wanted to ask you have you seen the series of films the
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:57:02.920]  arrivals no no you that's what like all the kids around here that's what they're
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:06.920]  getting into that's like kind of like their new their new zeitgeist or
[2:57:06.920 --> 2:57:11.560]  whatever it's whatever you want to put it it's a series of like 15 minute films
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:15.920]  there's about 50 of them I think I've seen one or two now yeah yeah I mean I've
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:20.320]  got it I I watched about three of them but I'm just kind of up in the air about
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:26.160]  what it's I didn't know if it was like just it seemed to be kind of anti-semitic
[2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:29.480]  but I was just wondering if you had seen them and what your take was on those
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:33.000]  things before I get in and watch the rest of the 50 of them I think I've seen
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:37.480]  one or two it's like a YouTube release right yeah exactly you got to go click
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:41.680]  from one to the next to the next to the next and stuff well you know my whole
[2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:47.520]  issue is people that obsess on one group or another that just plays into the
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:50.920]  vulcanization can't we just all be against the neural order can't we all be
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:54.920]  against tyranny people being oppressed and then we could come together against
[2:57:54.920 --> 2:58:00.120]  that they they love us fighting over race or religion or issues that's how they
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:05.480]  break us down and control us do you have any comments on that Marcus I think that
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:09.080]  I'll with the whole thing as far as what you was saying and I want to kind of
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:11.600]  bring this back up before I forget about what you have to be for the last
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:16.200]  break as far as no being more aggressive and I think that I really wish that I
[2:58:16.200 --> 2:58:20.360]  wish that all that that look through I guess about the bill so senator Sanders
[2:58:20.360 --> 2:58:26.760]  of brilliant number next I really wish Ron Paul had that same fire to be a little
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:31.040]  bit more aggressive I was looking for that during the primary and I think that
[2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:34.800]  if Ron Paul had the same fire be aggressive I agree with you stay there
[2:58:34.800 --> 2:58:38.080]  stay there mr. Williams we're coming back to five more minutes with them in a

[2:59:51.080 --> 3:00:01.280]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:15.880]  coming up I'm gonna go over some financial banking news get into a real
[3:00:15.880 --> 3:00:20.720]  grilling and I don't want to go after Ron Paul but I'm hearing from a lot of
[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:25.320]  people folks big buzz out there they want him to get really aggressive when
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:28.360]  he's on the house banking committee with Bernanke and others he brings up how
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:32.200]  it's hurting things out the debt bubble isn't gonna work but why how about hey
[3:00:32.200 --> 3:00:35.880]  the fellow reserves private you know you guys engineered this thing he'll say
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:38.720]  things like that here on the air but he's just so gentlemanly on the news and
[3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:42.840]  everywhere else he's got this platform now they're putting him on the news more
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:46.400]  and more I think because they know he's not being that aggressive and I think he
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:51.240]  thinks like a Zen master it's a catch 22 where he can get on more and just show
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:56.840]  people the alternative and by being more palatable that he gets more attention
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:03.480]  but I think you've got to break through the mesmerized spell that people are
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:08.240]  under with some cold water in the face or a slap against the face but Ron Paul
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:13.120]  has done so much good and it's it's it's it's overall good and you know it's
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:16.200]  easy to look at somebody in the arena and say they should do it this way or that
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:19.280]  way I just think we should look at people like Senator Sanders and others
[3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:24.560]  who's an independent by the way as as as leaders as well you know lots of leaders
[3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:30.000]  said the McKinney very bold that's why they went after but go ahead and finish
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:34.080]  up your point on that Mr. Williams yeah I think my whole thing as far as no one
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:38.280]  see Ron Paul be more aggressive about I look at it more as being just like a
[3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:44.040]  form of constructive criticism because of Ron Paul you know he had the network on
[3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:48.200]  the internet he had the money the movement but I think that I think that if
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:53.560]  we just would be a little bit more aggressive as far as attacking people
[3:01:53.560 --> 3:02:00.200]  like Obama and now he would that's right that's right he could have baited him
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:04.720]  into responding to him and then he could have showed the world that you know he
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:09.720]  is the man because of foreign policy and on economics Ron Paul is you know he's
[3:02:09.720 --> 3:02:14.240]  the man I mean even within the black community during the polling Ron Paul
[3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:18.400]  as far as black was giving but getting more support from black than the other
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:23.360]  Republican candidate let me just throw in here people need to tell Ron Paul
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:27.000]  hey we want to hear you get behind the states rights movement we want to hear
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:31.120]  you tell your supporters to get behind that so we can try to reconvene the
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:34.920]  federal government and arrest these criminals we want I mean he is out
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:37.800]  there speaking out and he does go before the Republicans and say you killed a
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:41.040]  million people so that was very bold that that took a lot of courage but I
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:45.280]  agree it's constructive criticism we need to have more of that because he is so
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:49.480]  prominent we built this guy he needs to you know dance with those that run him
[3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:55.640]  and he is doing that it's just that I totally agree with you Marcus yeah not
[3:02:55.640 --> 3:02:59.440]  not think I even talk to you on your show I was shortly after the New Hampshire
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:03.920]  primaries where Ron Paul I guess wasn't receiving votes I think it was kind of
[3:03:03.920 --> 3:03:09.120]  sudden and I was hoping for Ron Paul to hop on and make an issue as far as the
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:13.240]  whole voting fraud thing and like hold a big major press conference maybe I can
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:16.920]  start and would do that voter for where the votes were going to be counted and I
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:20.640]  think that by him just ignoring and just moving on thinking to be away from time
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:23.680]  as far as not challenging the vote for that was happening in New Hampshire I
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:29.360]  just think that was just another sign of that passivity but Ron Paul is
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:35.320]  besides him since McKinney and Cassinage I mean I think that he's
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:40.840]  over I think he's by far he's the best politician out there and I just hope that
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:46.440]  in the future that maybe if he doesn't run in 2012 that he become no be more
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:50.200]  aggressive and get out there and hopefully pick up a running mate who has
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:54.240]  just much star power as him and hopefully try to make a difference in the
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:03:58.400]  future I really appreciate you out there even give me an opportunity just to

[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:33.640]  live from austin texas alex jones
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:37.200]  there's a bunch of these clips on the internet these hearings went for hours
[3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:40.080]  we're gonna play several of them then go to your phone calls we have a guest
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:43.800]  coming on dealing with the bird flu that they tried to mix up with the regular
[3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:50.000]  flu vaccine so it can mutate and just cause incredible devastation that's
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:54.520]  mainstream news that it could have done that that's coming up this is senator
[3:08:54.520 --> 3:08:59.720]  bernie sanders questioning then Bernanke and he starts asking him where is the
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:03.680]  money where did you spend it and Bernanke tries to spend it and says it's on
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:07.880]  our website he goes what banks did you give it to well i can't tell you that
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:15.120]  and bloomberg financial is reporting on this yet again and it's not two and a
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:17.560]  half trillion it's not three trillion like the senator saying it's over nine
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:23.000]  point seven trillion right now so let's go ahead and go to that club will you
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  tell the american people to whom you lent two point two trillion of their
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:33.040]  dollars will you tell us who got that money and what the terms are of those
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:37.360]  agreements we would we explain each of our programs in terms of the terms we
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:40.560]  explain the terms exactly we explain what the collateral requirements are we
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:44.880]  explain what to whom did you explain that it's on our website yeah okay so all
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:48.000]  that information is available in our commercial paper and who got the money
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:54.120]  hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank or that has access to the u.s. federal
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:59.160]  reserves discount tell us who they are no because the reason that is counter
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:02.680]  productive and will destroy the value of the program is that banks will not come
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:06.960]  to the isn't that too bad sorry in other words isn't that too bad they took the
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:10.040]  money but they don't want to be public about the fact that they received that
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:13.360]  we heard a whole lot about a i g there on the front page is a very I got banks
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:16.720]  and I have businesses in the state of Vermont who are in a lot of trouble not
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:20.040]  banks are banks by the way doing pretty well now how do these guys who are
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:25.480]  honest business people get it you have to be a large greedy reckless financial
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:29.320]  institution to apply for these monies there is no subsidy there is no capital
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:33.480]  involved there is no gift involved it is a collateralized short-term liquid loan
[3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:38.360]  that is both over collateralized and is recourse to the company itself we have
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:46.200]  never lost a penny doing it and how can other institutions make get get those
[3:10:46.200 --> 3:10:50.160]  loans as well according to the law we are supposed to be lending to depository
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:55.200]  institutions we let me just say this mr. chairman I have a hard time
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:03.600]  understanding I view a put 2.2 trillion dollars at risk without making those
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:08.240]  names available those institutions public and we're going to introduce
[3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:12.840]  legislation today by the way to demand that you do that it is unacceptable to
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:23.000]  me that that goes on mr. chairman one of the untold one of the issues that
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:29.360]  bothers me very much is that for many many years some of us were concerned
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:35.200]  about deregulation some of us were very concerned about where the economy was
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:39.560]  going we didn't hear much coming from the wishes administration who told us
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:43.440]  over and over again that the fundamentals of the economy were sound we
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:49.640]  didn't hear much from the Fed now looking back you think that maybe there was a
[3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:54.280]  problem there that you did not raise some alarms out there and said we got a
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:58.640]  problem when trillions of dollars are being floated around the world in a
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:03.800]  deregulated non-transparent way when you heard people talking about the
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:11.480]  fundamentals of the economy being sound how come you didn't raise an alarm well
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:14.720]  there was a massive credit crisis and it's been true that our regulatory
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:18.920]  system and our financial supervisory system did not succeed in preventing
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:23.120]  those impacts and I think it's very important that not succeed in preventing
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:26.680]  them let's take it another way do you think that the repeal of Glass-Steagall
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:31.440]  was a tragic mistake I know I don't think so but I do think we need to have
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:35.520]  much part more effective holding company and oversight supervision and I
[3:12:35.520 --> 3:12:41.360]  strongly support a strong program of regulatory reform going forward mr.
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:46.440]  chairman in my state people ask me how it could be that you're providing loans
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:50.960]  at almost zero interest rates to large financial institutions who are then
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:56.460]  charging consumers 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards do
[3:12:56.460 --> 3:12:59.640]  you think that that's acceptable or do you think that those institutions that
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:05.520]  are receiving help from the Fed should substantially cut those interest rates
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:09.920]  well expected credit cards we've been working actively in that area in a
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:14.160]  couple of dimensions one is that credit card credit availability will be
[3:13:14.160 --> 3:13:17.400]  enhanced by our top program which I've done but you're not answering my question
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:21.800]  should a financial institution that is being bailed out by taxpayers charge
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:25.560]  those taxpayers 25 or 30 percent interest rates when they're receiving well you
[3:13:25.560 --> 3:13:28.600]  need to address that to the Treasury because it's the tarp that's providing
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:33.880]  help to failing or damaged firms the Federal Reserve lends to healthy firms
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:39.520]  on a collateralized basis last question last question many again in my
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:43.840]  constituents I think people all over this country are wondering why the CEOs
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:48.720]  of these large financial institutions who have been extremely greedy reckless
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:52.960]  and maybe have engaged in illegal behavior have not been fired so that we
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:57.600]  can work with people who want to really reform the system should the CEOs of the
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:03.200]  financial institutions that have led us into this deep deep recession be fired
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:07.600]  well pay and and job tenure should depend on performance and those which are
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:11.480]  performed poorly should lose their jobs any of them who have been many have lost
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:15.480]  their jobs now most of them are the major guys are still holding their
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:23.640]  positions senator Alex absolutely amazing let's just go through that five
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:27.120]  minute clip in the lies that were there number one the good news before I get to
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:33.080]  the lies though this guy has an aura of invincibility this aura of being God you
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:40.000]  watch the body language and the verbal language when somebody like a president
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:44.360]  or prime minister goes to speak before Congress they shake their hand act
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:48.560]  friendly kiss their butt a little bit when a private Federal Reserve chairman
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:51.640]  shows up before they would quiver they would shake they would they would
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:54.560]  grovel reporters do that because they know this is really who owns and runs the
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:59.120]  country these private banks that run these scams and masquerade is federal and
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:04.240]  when you have people like Senator Sanders and just a few others treating them
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:08.040]  with the disrespect they treat us with treating him like a common criminal that
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:12.960]  he is you heard Sanders saying someone need to go to jail that guy and Alan
[3:15:12.960 --> 3:15:20.880]  Greenspan chief among them Henry Paul sent all of them Geithner Summers Volcker
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:28.640]  they engineered what's happening now on record and so Ron Paul and others need
[3:15:28.640 --> 3:15:31.760]  to start getting aggressive not even disrespectful but they need to be
[3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:34.680]  disrespect we need to pull them down off their pedestals we need to show people
[3:15:34.680 --> 3:15:38.200]  the common crooks they are that's how this is going to happen is people
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:42.120]  identify who the enemy is just identify the enemy you do that everything's going
[3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:46.640]  to hell in a hand basket people are going to bring him to justice you've just
[3:15:46.640 --> 3:15:51.480]  got to identify the criminals and the source of the infection this is the
[3:15:51.480 --> 3:15:55.000]  cancer Bernanke and the rest of them they're the new world order they're the
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:58.520]  ones using all of this to get new regulations against their competitors
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:02.520]  while they've fallen under the regulations that's their new regulations are
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:06.240]  talking about is a global government over where your money goes or some
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:09.880]  middle-class person trying to leave the country see they take the crisis they
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:12.920]  create and always get more power this global new bank that's going to run the

[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:47.640]  banks are exempt from that another hoax he lies and says that's all upon our
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:51.600]  website and the senator sander says no it's not who'd you give the money to it
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:55.440]  just says on the website we won't tell you he goes who'd you give it to oh it's
[3:16:55.440 --> 3:16:59.040]  all on our website no it's not and then he has to admit okay it's not there a
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:04.680]  criminal liar counting on you being stupid you have been not stupid but
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:08.600]  diverted by football and acting cool and you know all this other crap folks if
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:11.720]  you don't worry about the banks as the founding fathers and history shows you
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:17.720]  get the slave real fast okay because when the stroke of a pen they'll create
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:21.400]  enough money to buy the world back with this Thomas Jefferson said then as the
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:26.960]  head of the bank of England the 20 said then in the biggest lie he says there's
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:31.360]  no cost in these trillions of dollars we've given to private banks really your
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:34.680]  taxes are going up all these new regulations we're going to pay carbon
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:39.000]  taxes to pay for all this they're telling you it's over $20,000 per American
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:43.680]  and that's in five months of the bank or takeover nine plus trillion since then
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:49.400]  plus the debt service on it there's there's interest on it but he says oh
[3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:54.480]  no you're not paying a penny it's just free when the banks have no intention
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:56.560]  of paying any of that back and the government will just grow grow grow if
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:03.320]  they did then he lies and says we're just looking about credit cards everybody I
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:07.160]  know this got credit cards who even pay them they might have a 3-4% got good
[3:18:07.160 --> 3:18:10.600]  credit suddenly they're telling you it's 10% if you have bad credit they're
[3:18:10.600 --> 3:18:18.320]  going to sell longer 18 it's 29 this is loan sharking mafia level so they do
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:22.120]  they give the banks these trillions and then they go out and loan it to people
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:25.960]  at giant interest see the interest rate cuts aren't for us it's for the elites
[3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:30.360]  and then he talks about how they're getting tough on CEOs these guys a few
[3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:34.720]  of them retired when in one case with billion-dollar golden parachutes others
[3:18:34.720 --> 3:18:37.520]  you know their deputies just roll into the place behind them they're still on
[3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:42.320]  the board so they're raping everybody financially there and this is the culprit
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:46.240]  Ben Bernanke but that's how he needs to be talked to when he starts lying Sanders
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:50.480]  cutting off today that's not what's going on and Bernanke had to back off and
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:54.600]  it basically admit he was a liar there because he was faced with someone that
[3:18:54.600 --> 3:18:58.320]  wasn't completely ignorant I bet Sanders doesn't know about the Dallas Cowboys
[3:18:58.320 --> 3:19:03.600]  but senator Sanders knows how the banks work I bet senator Sanders doesn't know
[3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:09.000]  the coolest new t-shirt to wear but he knows about the banks and successful
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:13.680]  people know how the world works even if you don't care about your fellow man you
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:18.280]  better care how stuff works you better want to know how things operate ladies

[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:14.560]  Dr. Rebecca Carly is a a degree medical doctor surgeon her only child was
[3:24:14.560 --> 3:24:18.600]  damaged by a vaccine she began to investigate it and we just got her on
[3:24:18.600 --> 3:24:21.760]  the line she was pointing out something I was even aware of the London
[3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:25.800]  Telegraph reporting on a bunch of people dying in Poland from a bird flu
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:30.040]  vaccine test and we're you guys did pull that up right you said you did pull it
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:34.240]  up throw it up on screen for folks so they can see it there's a lot to cover
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:37.440]  in the time we have left and also want to go to calls for folks that are
[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:42.120]  holding on this subject but Dr. Carly let me have you back up next week for
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:45.520]  two hours if you can do it to really the tail all this and go through your
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:50.440]  knowledge now on one side bird flu itself can kill people but it's very hard
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:54.800]  to catch the point is they're mixing it with vaccines and then not even a
[3:24:54.800 --> 3:24:59.760]  radiating it that's no accident just absolutely amazing and regular flu
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:09.120]  vaccine inoculations and thank God some subcontractors tested it and it killed
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:12.560]  the ferrets they were testing this to see if the regular flu vaccine had been
[3:25:12.560 --> 3:25:15.200]  irradiated because of the ferret that gets sick they know it hadn't been
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:19.920]  radiated properly but said the ferrets died this is mainstream news this is
[3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:24.480]  deadly bird flu they were trying to mutate but let's just go ahead and go
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:29.880]  to Dr. Rebecca Carly tell us what's happening basically they're trying to
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:35.040]  cause the pandemic they have already stockpiled at least 250 million doses of
[3:25:35.040 --> 3:25:40.760]  the bird flu vaccine you know the the shelf life of that vaccine has a certain
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:44.840]  amount of time by which they'll have to throw in the garbage so they have to
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:49.280]  start the pandemic so that they can give the vaccine which will then cause the
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:53.120]  bird flu pandemic I encourage all of your listeners to go to my website
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:59.640]  drcarly.com drcarly.com go to the bottom of my site and you will
[3:25:59.640 --> 3:26:05.760]  actually see a posted an article entitled US controls bird flu vaccines over
[3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:11.320]  bioweapon fears in fact this is an Associated Press article that says that
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:16.200]  our government is reluctant to give bird flu vaccines to some of the rogue
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:21.800]  nations for fear they will use the vaccine as biological warfare so when
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:26.280]  you actually look at what's out there folks it becomes crystal clear this is
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:31.320]  genocide this is population reduction and it's happening right now all right
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:34.800]  let me stop you right there you just brought a huge piece of the puzzle that
[3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:39.480]  I wasn't even aware of we googled it it's true I have the AP article about
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:43.320]  admitting bird flu vaccine can be used as a bioweapon now this company in the
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:47.400]  US ships it doesn't tell the companies are subcontracting to make regular flu
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:51.240]  vaccine that they're mixing it by God's grace they did a test and it killed the
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:57.480]  animals they looked at it and said this is H5N1 the deadly stuff that would then
[3:26:57.480 --> 3:27:04.400]  become airborne by being mixed with the other flu vaccine and here it is
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:08.280]  homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland the London
[3:27:08.280 --> 3:27:12.480]  Telegraph July 2008 there's just three Polish doctors six nurses are facing
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:15.800]  criminal prosecution for a number of homeless people died following medical
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:20.680]  trials of a vaccine to the H5N1 bird flu virus I mean this is and they keep
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:23.800]  telling you you're a cuckoo if you don't want to take vaccines doctor right
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:29.360]  well let me also see if the of this is very intentional because the H5N1
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:35.400]  bird flu virus is not actually able to be picked up by humans on it in a
[3:27:35.400 --> 3:27:41.240]  regular scenario so by putting it but with a regular human flu they're
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:45.440]  intentionally causing it to create a hybrid virus and this is how they're
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:50.480]  going to make the bird flu virus be contracted by the people because it's
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:55.160]  very virulent and basically the scenario that it creates is very disturbing
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:28:02.880]  you actually bleed out into your lungs and suffocate on your own blood please
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:07.360]  continue okay and I want to just make it clear I encourage the listeners once
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:12.040]  again to go to my website drcarly.com and read the article I now have posted
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:16.960]  science of vaccine damage we have a number of non-pharma funded of that
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:20.680]  veterinarian researchers that have documented what I've been saying for
[3:28:20.680 --> 3:28:25.960]  12 years that it's not just the diseases themselves the vaccines cause when you
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:29.840]  inject live viruses into the bloodstream you bypass the critical part of the
[3:28:29.840 --> 3:28:35.360]  immune system and vaccines in fact cause all autoimmune diseases non-traumatic
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:41.000]  seizures cancer and genetic problems and people and in fact so this is the
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:45.280]  greatest epidemic the world has ever known vaccine-induced diseases I have
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:49.320]  developed a protocol to reverse these things but we have to stop this
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:54.720]  Holocaust on humanity and not only humanity our pets and our food sources
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:58.640]  well doctor I wanted to back you up all these big veterinary university studies
[3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:04.080]  as you know have now come out showing thousands of percentile increases in the
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:08.360]  area where dogs and cats are injected everybody I know injects their their
[3:29:08.360 --> 3:29:13.400]  cats and dogs and they almost die they have seizures it causes as other medical
[3:29:13.400 --> 3:29:17.040]  doctors have told us autoimmune responses with the brain swells that's
[3:29:17.040 --> 3:29:22.400]  causing actually most the autism the mercury is a side issue and and and
[3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:28.200]  here they are trying to send out bird flu mutated with regular flu for deadly
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:33.440]  airborne flu that kills over 60 percent of people that come in contact with it
[3:29:33.440 --> 3:29:36.200]  and then meanwhile they're running billboards and ads everywhere saying
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:40.280]  vaccines are good take more HPV is killing a lot of the girls that take it
[3:29:40.280 --> 3:29:44.600]  it's okay dying is good it keeps you safe dying keeps you safe I mean it's
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:49.400]  it's mass insanity do we're gonna come back and talk about how this kills you
[3:29:49.400 --> 3:29:53.480]  and how you think they're gonna release it we're on the march the

[3:30:03.880 --> 3:30:07.120]  have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater
[3:30:07.120 --> 3:30:10.640]  exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[3:30:10.640 --> 3:30:14.560]  water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[3:30:14.560 --> 3:30:19.000]  are absorbed into the skin the KDF dual media shower filter works with both
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:23.480]  hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine lead mercury and iron
[3:30:23.480 --> 3:30:28.680]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria mold algae and fungus the KDF dual

[3:31:15.040 --> 3:31:18.640]  to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:22.480]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:26.600]  networks inside the United States some US investigators believe that their
[3:31:26.600 --> 3:31:32.440]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that
[3:31:32.440 --> 3:31:37.400]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in London's connections to the CIA the

[3:33:14.200 --> 3:33:19.640]  them another company ships it to all these labs doesn't tell them what it is
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:23.720]  tells them oh here's the mixes mislabels it has a mix it with all these
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:29.040]  different strains of regular flu they admit that it will mutate inside the
[3:33:29.040 --> 3:33:35.200]  growing process and mutate inside the human body airborne superflu that kills
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:41.320]  you and we just lost dr. Carly I just heard her disconnect so John we get her
[3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:47.920]  back on her she's still there all the ISDN dropped okay all right well we're
[3:33:47.920 --> 3:33:51.240]  here it doesn't matter okay let's get the guys in there and get that
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:56.960]  reconnected. Dr. break this down for folks how it kills you what's going on and
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:34:00.800]  the larger picture with all the documentation you've got and she
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:05.200]  neurotically goes through all even mainstream documents mainstream news and
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:10.560]  by the grace of God a subcontractor tested the flu shots because they've
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:15.280]  had so many people get killed in Europe from them on ferrets and it killed them
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:19.480]  dead in a hammer so they tested it and freaked out saying what on earth is this
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:23.640]  this is is this is incredible not your Carly
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:34.840]  yeah we're having some phone systems go up and down get her back on for me okay
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:38.640]  you know I don't think it's the government doing it though they admit
[3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:42.160]  they've been sabotaging the people this always happens when and now Jesse
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.920]  Ventura happens like once a month but it's always and now Willie Nelson and now
[3:34:46.920 --> 3:34:53.040]  Jesse Ventura and now we will expose the bird flu plan when we've got like three
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:57.720]  backups in there so hopefully that'll get it fixed so we will get her back up
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:03.200]  and on the line okay Dr. Carly did you hear my questions
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:08.960]  strange things happen when I do shows like this I just want to mention a
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:14.000]  couple very important things that people have to realize first of all there's been
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:19.920]  almost a billion dollars with a B 954 million has been put aside in the
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:25.120]  stimulus package for further inoculations and as people are listening to our
[3:35:25.120 --> 3:35:29.480]  corrupt Congress in the district of criminals talking about mandated health
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:33.640]  insurance you have to realize that just like they're doing in Massachusetts now
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:37.400]  they're going to tell you what you need to do in terms of your health quote
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:41.240]  unquote coverage it's actually death coverage and so this is what's going on
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:45.520]  this is a population reduction agenda one other quick thing I just wanted to
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:51.200]  mention is that there's at least nine bio warfare weapons labs in every state
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:55.800]  at this point and the way they ship their viruses from lab to lab is by
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:36:00.200]  federal express so as they're trying to tell us that we have all these rogue
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:04.680]  nations to fear with their biological attacks in fact the FedEx truck that's
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:10.280]  delivering packages to your house could very well have H5N1 on it as well and
[3:36:10.280 --> 3:36:14.320]  doctor remember the wreck four years ago with the FedEx truck and they ask why
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:20.360]  is there weaponized super bird flu on board remember that yes I do that's all
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:25.520]  I found out about this all right well as a medical doctor as a surgeon as someone
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:30.080]  who's been researching this in depth for years tell us what the bird flu will do
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:34.000]  if it goes airborne or if people would have taken these shots that killed the
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:38.160]  ferrets how this kills you I see different news reports of that it kills
[3:36:38.160 --> 3:36:43.120]  60 to 90 percent of people that come in contact with it well what people have to
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:48.240]  realize is that they've intentionally weaponized this by going up to Alaska and
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:53.760]  digging up dead bodies that died people that died from the 1918 Spanish flu
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:57.920]  which was not a Spanish flu at all it was actually caused by inoculations
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:02.600]  given to soldiers in World War one and since it was such a killer these
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:08.600]  minions from the Department of Army Pathology in Washington went there and
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:13.240]  dug up those dead bodies and brought that those lung tissues back and you know
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:17.440]  did the DNA deconstruction on it and they have combined that with the bird
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:22.720]  flu in order to make a pathogen which is going to kill young people that is the
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:27.000]  very serious aspect of this this is not going to just kill you know the young and
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  the old as usually happens with different pathogens this is going to
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:37.160]  specifically target young people in the ages of say 20 to 60 and this is going
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:42.880]  to basically cause you to as I said bleed out into your own lungs you're
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:47.720]  going to suffocate on your own blood and the air the aerosolization aspect of it
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:37:53.280]  is not just with chemtrails and things of that nature if people in your
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:56.680]  neighborhood are stupid enough to get injected with this insane vaccine
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:01.720]  they're going to be coughing and sneezing on you and so that's part of the aerosolization
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:06.200]  thing they're going to be able to make this pandemic happen very quickly once
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:12.760]  they introduce this into the United States population absolutely I want to
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:16.480]  show the viewers out there the headline flu pandemic can kill one billion
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:19.840]  people around the world this is in the Journal of Nature and a bunch of other
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:24.640]  publications a few years ago where they're out there fear mongering trying
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:29.000]  to get everybody scared and then meanwhile I have the mainstream news and
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:32.480]  I see these all the time you pointed one out homeless people die after bird flu
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:36.400]  vaccine trial in Poland London Telegraph and then I bring this up to
[3:38:36.400 --> 3:38:40.480]  listeners or people on the street or talk show hosts make fun of us saying no we
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:43.800]  can trust big pharma when bear admittedly shipped out over a million
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:47.240]  ampoules of factor-rate filled with HIV and hepatitis and didn't even get in
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:50.680]  trouble for it and it came out in court they knowingly did it on purpose
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:56.680]  because it's about population reduction yes if anyone puts Henry Kissinger and
[3:38:56.680 --> 3:39:01.280]  memo 200 into any search engine you can read about how he testified in front of
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:05.640]  Congress the population reduction is the national security issue the State
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:09.360]  Department of Random State Department random 200 and the classified version
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:15.040]  the written in 73d classified in 92 states that is the overall agenda of the
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:19.880]  entire new world order is to kill people go ahead yeah yes they have to decrease
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:24.480]  the population because of the fact that since they're suppressing all natural
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:28.720]  energy technologies such as Tesla technologies and things of that nature
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:33.400]  they only have a certain amount of products that they can you know allow
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:38.200]  to be used on the planet by the people so rather than allow the natural solutions
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:42.760]  out there they're going to just kill off a large percentage of people so that
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:46.720]  they can continue to make money in whatever endeavors they have available
[3:39:46.720 --> 3:39:49.600]  to them and doctor you know you know you're a medical doctor and I've had all
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:52.240]  these other medical doctors on about this and they've caught them adding
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:57.080]  hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women yes I have documentation of that
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:01.080]  let me just say I'm writing a book about this going to the genocide level I
[3:40:01.080 --> 3:40:06.040]  have a book for the actually published by NATO the North Atlantic Treaty
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:10.840]  Organization entitled immunological adjuvant to vaccines where they actually
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:15.760]  admit in that book that they are putting the hormone of HDG human
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:20.440]  chorionic anatotrophin into tetanus and diphtheria vaccines and giving it to
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:25.080]  women that is the hormone produced by women when they become pregnant so if
[3:40:25.080 --> 3:40:29.880]  you inject it into somebody they become allergic to that antibody they produce
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:34.120]  antibodies against it and then they abort their own children when they become
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:37.880]  pregnant let's be clear and they they call it a soft-kill weapon in their
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:41.320]  documents as you know because they could just sterilize the woman but that's not
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:44.560]  enough they want the women to keep getting pregnant and have violent
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:48.080]  miscarriages triggered when the hormones released in the second trimester
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:52.160]  because they get as much as a 10% death rate with the women so it's even better
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:56.520]  they get to kill the baby and kill the women and then they also it's come out
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:00.400]  mainstream news in Thailand the UN comes in forcibly injects the women three
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:04.040]  times with tetanus shots everybody knows it's just one while their baby you know
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:07.920]  while the babies in them and I've seen the interviews of the women's on Thailand
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:11.640]  TV in English and they say and then I feel the baby stop dancing in a few days
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:16.600]  the baby dies they haven't I mean this is the savage murder and the police the
[3:41:16.600 --> 3:41:22.280]  military you're all being injected folks I premiered in game almost two years
[3:41:22.280 --> 3:41:25.320]  ago at the Elmo draft house and I'd seen this guy on TV he was the press
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:29.800]  secretary for when they end the scheduler for Governor Perry and Governor
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:33.760]  Perry's in the film and he shows up and he says hey I'm Governor Perry work for
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:36.720]  him and he says I just want you to know we're not all bad at the governor's
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:39.880]  office and I said why are you here and he said well here's my card and I've
[3:41:39.880 --> 3:41:44.160]  lost it but the point is I get piles of these he said he said I want you to know
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:50.120]  12 years ago at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio I'm a medic and they sent us
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:55.480]  these I think he said eight guys from Fort Bragg and they injected him and they
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:58.840]  all died in three days and then we had to go in and decontamination suits spray
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:03.000]  the whole room down with bleach pull everything out and decontaminate it and
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:06.080]  I said well what are you gonna do about that he goes I don't know but I just know
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:09.040]  you're telling the truth and then we have all the declassified examples where
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:13.600]  they kill our own troops the globalists are criminal go ahead well I just want
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:17.360]  to say that's the reason that we've had this big debate about whether or not
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:21.720]  they should be allowed to photograph the soldiers coffins coming back because of
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:25.640]  the news media may say okay what did that soldier die from and what did that
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:30.080]  soldier die from and then it would come out that more soldiers are dying from
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:34.960]  their inoculations than are even dying from gunfire and I've seen those
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:38.640]  numbers everything you're saying I've seen documented it's all mainstream
[3:42:38.640 --> 3:42:42.400]  it's just a piece here a piece there oh it's killing the homeless oh they
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:46.760]  accidentally put it here's the key about the manufacturer this vaccine I
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:49.240]  specifically looked it up with this particular one they're supposed to
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:54.840]  radiate the flu viruses so they accidentally mix bird flu in it then
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:43:00.120]  they don't radiate it to keep it alive another accident doctor right yeah
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:07.320]  right well first of all radiation can cause mutations so radiation does not
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:12.480]  necessarily kill the viruses this whole thing is a scam people have to start
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:17.840]  asking themselves if something is a dangerous pathogen why am I going to
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:23.360]  inject it into my body I mean if you have somebody cough on your sneeze on
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:28.280]  you at least your immune system can work in a natural fashion as the creator
[3:43:28.280 --> 3:43:33.440]  gave us to create antibodies and give you lifelong immunity and not to mention
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:37.800]  the fact of all the other additives that are in vaccines I was so glad to hear
[3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:42.320]  you mention out that as far as autism mercury is a side issue mercury the
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:47.000]  toxic poison it causes Alzheimer's along with aluminum but you see all of these
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:51.200]  different things autism is an autoimmune disease actually it subacutes
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:55.320]  grossing panacea flight if they change the name to hide the fact it was caused
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:44:00.600]  by vaccines but all of these injections are causing you harm and the more that
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:05.120]  you get the more depressed your immune system is going to be in my paper on my
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:09.600]  website inoculations of true weapons of anti-destruction I describe exactly
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:14.520]  what the pathology is in the immune system that causes all these autoimmune
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:17.840]  diseases well I'm not a medical doctor but you are and I've interviewed many
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:23.400]  others and it's simple the mucus membrane the skin that's where most the
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:28.080]  you know that's where the T lymphocyte programmer cells for the rest of white
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:34.200]  blood cells are they identify the enemy they go up and sniff it kill kill one
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:39.760]  scan it's DNA it's literally little little nanobots got made eats it scans it
[3:44:39.760 --> 3:44:43.440]  and then goes out and starts programming the defense so it's like
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:46.600]  centuries are we got an enemy we killed one this is what their uniform looks
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:50.280]  like here's how you take them down and then it transmits the info through the
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:55.040]  lymph nodes to through the lymphatic system total body defense system now
[3:44:55.040 --> 3:44:59.160]  they're ready but instead when they injected it all just bypasses the
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:04.000]  forces doesn't it yes well also secretory IGA which is a very important
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:08.560]  antibody that's in the upper respiratory and GI tract is very important in this
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:12.840]  natural induced mechanism as well but see that's what people have to start
[3:45:12.840 --> 3:45:17.040]  asking their white coat and I encourage everybody like I said print out that
[3:45:17.040 --> 3:45:21.080]  article science of vaccine damage that the veterinarians have proven what the
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:25.280]  vaccines are doing to the immune system and bring that to your veterinarian to
[3:45:25.280 --> 3:45:30.880]  your pediatrician to your elderly parents nursing home you see this is
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:33.920]  another very important thing that they're doing Alex they're actually
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:39.440]  mandating that all elderly people in nursing homes get the flu vaccine and
[3:45:39.440 --> 3:45:43.560]  they know pneumococcal vaccine every year and this is another way they're
[3:45:43.560 --> 3:45:48.520]  taking up the elderly the Medicare trust fund was stolen long ago that's what
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:51.960]  Russ Barrow brought forth when he ran for president and they've got to get rid
[3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:56.000]  of the old folks the UN openly says that so it's a soft kill weapon to get him out
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:59.520]  of the way now in the time we've got left and now I said I go to call this
[3:45:59.520 --> 3:46:05.080]  info is so important in the time we have left dr. Carly you were going into the
[3:46:05.080 --> 3:46:08.240]  NATO documents you've enlisted the book where they admit they're doing all of
[3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:12.480]  this and still the public listening or when listeners tell their friends and
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:15.640]  family hope they'll pass around this video for also live at prison planet
[3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:21.320]  on TV people watching listen you can't laugh at us anymore you can't say it
[3:46:21.320 --> 3:46:25.520]  isn't happening you know the HPV is killing the women that take it yeah
[3:46:25.520 --> 3:46:30.000]  that is admitted listen this isn't a joke people quit laughing after their kids
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  die or they die or they get sick please these are eugenicists dr. Carly
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:38.320]  explained to people what you think was happening with them trying to put the
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:44.920]  deadly bird flu in with regular vaccines and and how do you think they got caught
[3:46:44.920 --> 3:46:49.440]  did somebody inside blow the whistle well obviously somebody inside blew the
[3:46:49.440 --> 3:46:55.120]  whistle you see the dark forces have their agenda and then the good guys
[3:46:55.120 --> 3:46:59.800]  occasionally win one for the good guys and this is obviously what happened in
[3:46:59.800 --> 3:47:05.440]  the situation as I said putting the bird flu virus in with the regular flu is
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:10.320]  actually what's going to make the mutation happen to create the hybrid
[3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:15.080]  that's going to allow the bird flu to infect the human and this is self-evident
[3:47:15.080 --> 3:47:20.280]  I mean you don't have to be you know rocket scientists to realize that all
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:25.520]  these viruses mutate they admit openly that the reason they have to change the
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:29.600]  flu vaccine every year is because the vaccines are always mutating by the way
[3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:33.440]  doctor that's not your opinion up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[3:47:33.440 --> 3:47:41.000]  com we have all the mainstream news articles admitting that they put this
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:47.280]  bird flu virus in with the regular viruses and that it was being done and
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:51.440]  that it would mutate and that there's no way that that is an accident this is
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:56.120]  admitted that this was happening that and that the way they told the companies
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:02.200]  to do it was the exact way to create the mutation exactly and I want to just
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:06.320]  quickly bring it to the next level I also have another book published by the
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:11.800]  NATO life sciences division entitled the biology of aggression and that's all
[3:48:11.800 --> 3:48:16.920]  about the rabies virus they are now also putting rabies virus into many human
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:22.760]  vaccines there's many movies out now that actually illustrates this quarantine
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:27.480]  is the best because in quarantine they actually admit that the rabies virus is
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:32.040]  what's making these people become ghouls this is going to get even worse folks
[3:48:32.040 --> 3:48:35.720]  and this is being done intentionally that's right the media always throws us
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:42.120]  in our face like the government creates a cancer shot cure and the inventor of
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:48.280]  it in its I am legend and then 99% die but 1% turn into these raving lunatics
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:53.040]  take the movie serenity where the government puts this stuff into the
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:56.600]  atmosphere that kills everybody but then a small percent turn into these
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:49:01.920]  raving maniacs they and you're right the Pentagon wired magazine their head
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:07.920]  futurist a mr. Marshall brags that they're also creating compounds to make
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:12.080]  the troops psychopathic killers then they give them an amnesic they're already
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:15.640]  doing this in Afghanistan as a test and then now mainstream news came out and
[3:49:15.640 --> 3:49:19.200]  said we're going to have everybody take these amnesics where we don't feel bad
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:24.880]  about who we are anymore yes as a matter of fact I was amazed that the mainstream
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:30.040]  media I was listening to NPR one day and they were talking about a study done in
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:35.160]  Switzerland where they use the blood pressure drug propranolol to reverse a
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:40.240]  post-traumatic stress disorder people that had been traumatized by something
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:44.480]  take this blood pressure drug that's what people have to realize every single
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:49.360]  drug has a mental side effect and now they're actually admitting that they
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:55.280]  can remove these traumatic memories with propranolol so as your loved ones are
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:00.440]  being killed in Maine by the mainstream medical mafia you can take this blood
[3:50:00.440 --> 3:50:04.720]  pressure medication and just say oh that's fine I don't have a problem with
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:08.720]  that well it literally is like a lobotomy and they're saying they want to put
[3:50:08.720 --> 3:50:12.360]  statins in this drug and others in the water they're now admitting they're
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:16.640]  going to medicate the water I mean doctor they're doing it with fluoride
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:20.800]  they're already doing it with fluoride and they're also admitting that as we're
[3:50:20.800 --> 3:50:25.400]  flushing more and more drugs down the toilet and down the sink these are all
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:29.720]  being released into the water supplies isn't it amazing Alex that nobody seems
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:36.280]  to be rising up to protest that what about as far as the ecology in nature
[3:50:36.280 --> 3:50:40.040]  are concerned why don't they have a problem with all these things we have
[3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:44.880]  because they destroyed with drugs admittedly our normal human spirit of
[3:50:44.880 --> 3:50:49.600]  just burning being alive being intelligent they're just drugged out oh my
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:53.160]  gosh Dr. Carly stay there we're gonna come back and get more into this ladies

[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:55.760]  America poor brown folks think he represents them he doesn't represent
[3:54:55.760 --> 3:55:01.160]  anybody but the new world order Dr. Carly in closing I think we've averted
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:08.480]  major disaster here I mean even mainstream Canadian British Czechoslovakian
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:12.080]  news is saying was this this is in mainstream news when I first read it
[3:55:12.080 --> 3:55:15.440]  they were the news was saying it was this done on purpose because this
[3:55:15.440 --> 3:55:18.680]  company's also developed a bird flu vaccine where people keep dying in the
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:21.600]  test with other companies that are testing theirs we just covered the
[3:55:21.600 --> 3:55:27.360]  one a telegraph on that with the people dying I mean this is miraculous that
[3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:32.840]  that this did leak out and got stopped right but of course it's not in the US
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:36.320]  mainstream media thank God for shows like yours it's bringing it out to the
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:40.160]  people of America but I want to make it very clear it's not just the bird flu
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:44.320]  this is with all of these biological weapons including Lyme's disease and
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:50.120]  West Island cephalitis I have a book in front of me entitled lab 257 the
[3:55:50.120 --> 3:55:54.720]  disturbing story of the government secret Plum Island the germ laboratory by
[3:55:54.720 --> 3:55:59.840]  Michael Christopher Carroll where he quotes David Huxoff who was the Plum
[3:55:59.840 --> 3:56:04.520]  Islands director in June 2000 and this is what he said Alex and I quote the
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:09.360]  plant that will produce biological agents for weapons purposes may not look
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:13.280]  too much different from the plant that produces biological agents for
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:19.840]  vaccines this is all one in the same vaccines are biological weapons period
[3:56:19.840 --> 3:56:26.760]  that's what people have to wrap their head around well cancer is exploding 50
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:32.880]  years ago one in 33 died of it now it's one in three about to be one and two the
[3:56:32.880 --> 3:56:36.480]  Bill and the Gates Foundation as dad runs Planned Parenthood the eugenics group
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:41.960]  is openly involved in all of this my film in game covers it Dr. Carly we're
[3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:46.120]  gonna have you back up in the very very near future in fact let me just have my

[3:57:31.840 --> 3:57:35.280]  info out it's freaking me out every instinct I've got is you'll run to the
[3:57:35.280 --> 3:57:37.880]  third world get your children out of the country because I love them so much but
[3:57:37.880 --> 3:57:41.760]  there's no where to run they're doing this all over the planet and like she
[3:57:41.760 --> 3:57:44.160]  said when they really do this they're gonna be spraying it out of helicopters
[3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:47.560]  they've got government operations doing that that if the sunshine project
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:51.800]  broke in 2000 plans to spray us with helicopters and they do it to the
