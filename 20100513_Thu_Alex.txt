[00:52.400 --> 00:57.800]  incredible it was linen the evil genius that said that there are times in
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.520]  history when more happens in a week than happens in a year when more happens in a
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.080]  year than happened in a hundred years and that is what is happening right now
[01:08.080 --> 01:14.680]  so much is going on look at this headline Gates Foundation researches

[01:20.080 --> 01:25.300]  Gates Foundation why is that a top story I'm gonna cover it later because
[01:25.300 --> 01:30.840]  governments and corporations are moving and no doubt already testing vaccines
[01:30.840 --> 01:37.480]  engineered into pharmacological food crops like rice and corn and maize and
[01:37.480 --> 01:47.480]  wheat alfalfa soybeans engineering mosquitoes to deliver vaccines vaccines
[01:47.480 --> 01:56.080]  that can actually go in and engage in nanotech level viral brain damage it's
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.400]  being promoted as if it's good you're going to feel much better soon you're
[02:00.400 --> 02:05.280]  not gonna have any more pesky thoughts anymore you'll learn to serve the
[02:05.280 --> 02:09.320]  government we're approaching the point where they won't even have to forcibly
[02:09.320 --> 02:15.720]  inoculate you that you will just simply suddenly be a mind-numbed zombie and I'm
[02:15.720 --> 02:21.600]  telling you that's the next phase they are going to move with it yeah it's
[02:21.600 --> 02:27.440]  science fiction it's 2010 boys and girls it's real this is what we're facing as a
[02:27.440 --> 02:34.800]  society obviously I'm gonna go over Kagan anti-gun anti-free speech I actually
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.840]  went to the University of Chicago law review I didn't just believe the hundreds
[02:39.840 --> 02:46.200]  of quotes from her papers that I saw on CNS news AP Bloomberg prison planet
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.720]  calm and full wars dot com I actually went and did control left searches on the
[02:51.720 --> 02:58.280]  university papers and government papers themselves I don't have to read her how
[02:58.280 --> 03:04.720]  many pages is this I don't have to read her 400 page University of Chicago
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.520]  law review paper or another University of Chicago law review paper 125 pages
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.400]  long I could just go in and control F the quotes that are out there and check
[03:15.400 --> 03:20.320]  them for myself and lo and behold they're there and more she wants your
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.280]  guns she wants your private property she believes that there should be no free
[03:24.280 --> 03:29.320]  speech the government decides what you can and can't say preemptively on record
[03:29.320 --> 03:33.920]  and that's why there's just endless fawning in the media doesn't matter if
[03:33.920 --> 03:36.520]  she's never been a judge doesn't matter if she doesn't have any judicial
[03:36.520 --> 03:42.240]  experience she's a thug she's a Goldman Sachs employee she's a Larry Summers
[03:42.240 --> 03:49.120]  protege she's a cash Sunstein apprentice she's anti-america she's anti-
[03:49.120 --> 03:55.000]  liberty she's anti-freedom she is in and even we're tea party leaders are
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.200]  saying therefore on mainstream news and we've got to have her man she's great
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.360]  of course Justice Stevens is leaving Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the next few
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.640]  months is reportedly going to now she's leaving as soon as they get Kagan in and
[04:08.640 --> 04:16.080]  so we'll probably have some other woman or man who is a total globalist and
[04:16.080 --> 04:19.760]  openly anti-freedom just the entire Bill of Rights maybe to be a Supreme
[04:19.760 --> 04:23.720]  Court Justice you've got to burn the American flag and Bill of Rights and

[08:36.720 --> 08:43.800]  living video color into the second third and fourth hour we're gonna go into
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.160]  the global financial meltdown by design the latest developments the takeover of
[08:49.160 --> 08:55.320]  the Supreme Court by people who are 100% publicly against the bill of rights
[08:55.320 --> 09:01.760]  just outrageous treason going on on that front LA votes in favor of Arizona
[09:01.760 --> 09:13.000]  boycott it just goes on and on and on I have talked to a Hollywood insider I
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.520]  have also talked to two members of Robert Rodriguez's crew who were Hispanic
[09:18.520 --> 09:26.800]  with his new film machete coming out September 3rd of this year in about four
[09:26.800 --> 09:38.600]  months and I have received the script the latest script used in the film and I
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.680]  have confirmed with the Hollywood insider who has seen the film that it is
[09:43.680 --> 09:50.080]  worse than what I even said last week no wonder Hispanic members of Robert
[09:50.080 --> 09:55.640]  Rodriguez's crew contacted us no wonder they're upset I have the script now the
[09:55.640 --> 09:59.720]  Hollywood insider obviously will not show us the film isn't gonna send us the
[09:59.720 --> 10:06.600]  film he was allowed to see it at a LA internal screening for insiders but he
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.160]  confirmed it but it doesn't matter I have the script I have the entire script
[10:12.160 --> 10:15.920]  and this is not a spoiler alert because we're not here talking about
[10:15.920 --> 10:22.200]  entertainment we're talking about race war leaked machete script confirms race
[10:22.200 --> 10:29.040]  war plot that is the info wars.com Alex Jones Aaron Dykes article that just went
[10:29.040 --> 10:35.640]  live about 10 minutes ago at info wars.com with a new 10 minute video that
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.960]  Aaron has spent two days painstakingly putting together we shot this Tuesday
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.720]  night and he worked on it yesterday and this morning and it is done with all the
[10:46.720 --> 10:52.360]  documentation and close-ups of the highlighted areas of the script for
[10:52.360 --> 10:56.920]  mainstream media and others like Raw Story that have been making fun of me
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.840]  Raw Story said in the first line that it basically isn't even a real movie that
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.960]  I'm just making it all up and they said oh we can't find the trailer Fox has
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.600]  pulled it and they did pull it. Why do you think Fox pulled it last Friday
[11:11.600 --> 11:18.520]  before I'd even covered it? I didn't cover it till Sunday because Fox is
[11:18.520 --> 11:26.680]  funding it the film machete and they put out a special trailer the official
[11:26.680 --> 11:34.240]  trailer saying this is a message for Arizona and it is just unspeakable it is
[11:34.240 --> 11:44.320]  so far beyond what I could even imagine the trailer is nothing compared to the
[11:44.320 --> 11:51.320]  script and again my office has talked to a well-known Hollywood insider who
[11:51.320 --> 11:54.600]  obviously cannot come on the show because of repercussions they would face
[11:54.600 --> 12:00.720]  and they say it is worse than what I've even said well I got that news this
[12:00.720 --> 12:06.240]  morning I had discovered the error of my ways when we got the script Tuesday
[12:06.240 --> 12:11.400]  morning and by the showtime I hadn't had time to read the whole thing I read it
[12:11.400 --> 12:16.840]  Tuesday evening and shot the video that is now up on info wars.com so I
[12:16.840 --> 12:21.840]  apologize to everyone it's far worse than I thought far worse than I had said
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.360]  and after I go over all of this in the next hour I'm gonna open the phones up
[12:27.360 --> 12:34.080]  again for about 45 minutes just for Hispanic Americans to get their take
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.480]  on this because I did this last Sunday when all we had was the trailer and
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.080]  every caller agreed with me and was concerned the Hispanic callers and
[12:43.080 --> 12:47.680]  understood what's going on and said that they're intimidated and shouted down and
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.720]  called porchos constantly by the massive Mexican population that's poured in for
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.000]  Mexico if they wear American flag shirts if they have an American flag on their
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.720]  car if they have an American flag flying outside their business or home they
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.400]  are told you are traders this is Mexico we are going to get the gringos we are
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.760]  communist this is a revolution and this has been going on behind the scenes for
[13:11.760 --> 13:17.440]  decades the CIA the Ford Foundation big money our funding at all so that we can
[13:17.440 --> 13:25.680]  be played off against each other and Robert Rodriguez who knows if Robert
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.520]  Rodriguez will even release the film he has basically finished because Fox is
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.480]  now having a chance to see it Hollywood insiders are really scared of this
[13:34.480 --> 13:37.400]  because let me tell you something there's already racial attacks against
[13:37.400 --> 13:41.000]  gringos going on all over the place police being killed attacks on police
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.640]  people being raped and killed ranchers having their homes burned down they're
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.360]  being murdered it's in the news every day it's in the news today Mexico has
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.880]  fully collapsed over a year ago we had a Texas senator on who confirmed that
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.560]  martial law had secretly been declared by the federal government on the Texas
[13:59.560 --> 14:08.680]  and Arizona border this is an emergency situation and this film goes far beyond
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.440]  race war I will just tell you now it forms a religious cult I have studied
[14:14.440 --> 14:23.440]  the sociology and anthropology of Mesoamerica it makes machete a saint
[14:23.440 --> 14:31.000]  they pray to him all whites who want to control the border in the film are
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.520]  murderers they crucify Catholic priests they desecrate Catholic churches they
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.600]  they they they attempt to murder Hispanic children they murder Hispanics in
[14:40.600 --> 14:45.240]  mass which again is a false flag it's it's a false claim it's not true but
[14:45.240 --> 14:51.400]  don't worry a mustizo Chicano uprising slaughters them and there is a new
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.840]  church formed machete is now the Christ and he brings murder and death to the
[14:57.840 --> 15:05.200]  gringo I mean it is it is pure CIA brainwashing 110 percent this is an
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.760]  invocation to complete and total race war in fact you guys gave me this Sunday
[15:10.760 --> 15:16.360]  and I can't find it my stack go to troublemaker studios that's Rodriguez
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.240]  the studio IMDB give me all their numbers give me that because next hour
[15:22.240 --> 15:27.560]  I'm gonna give his phone numbers out for kids for citizens that are concerned
[15:27.560 --> 15:34.840]  about this information we are going to cover this it is again people say well
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.600]  it's just a movie Alex yeah a movie that mirrors things that are really going
[15:39.600 --> 15:45.200]  on and that's basically it's like birth of a nation which made the Ku Klux
[15:45.200 --> 15:50.080]  clan go from maybe twenty thousand maybe a hundred thousand no one sure to two
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.760]  to three million historians aren't quite sure but I know that several million it
[15:54.760 --> 16:01.760]  shows blacks engaging in massacres of whites blacks raping whites it it
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.800]  straw man's them it sets them up and the clan went from very small numbers to
[16:07.800 --> 16:11.440]  being one of the biggest political movements in the United States and they
[16:11.440 --> 16:18.440]  engaged in all sorts of persecution and abuse and massacres of black Americans
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.080]  and let me tell you something you know I took some film school Aaron Dyke says a
[16:23.080 --> 16:26.080]  degree in it from UT he's the one that pointed out it's like this script is
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.880]  birth of a nation it is birth of a nation it is the birth of a mustizo
[16:30.880 --> 16:40.320]  race-based race war religion I mean this thing is targeting immigrants tar gang
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.560]  members are the heroes in it murdering the white devils and it's the it's the
[16:44.560 --> 16:50.880]  Mexican gangs that are obsessed with san aria and all the rest of it it is it is
[16:50.880 --> 16:58.960]  pure and total unmitigated mind control and I'm asking everyone to go to info
[16:58.960 --> 17:02.080]  wars dot com that's where it's posted it's not even on prison planet dot com
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.680]  yet and get leaked machete script confirms race war plot a script leaked
[17:08.680 --> 17:11.840]  from the upcoming Robert Rodriguez machete confirms fears that the film
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.080]  seeks to build up a racial cult figure who kills for the cause of illegal
[17:16.080 --> 17:20.880]  immigrants they plan to make it a whole you know chain of films Alex Jones
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.320]  first out of video warning of the potential of machete to kickstart race
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.320]  war after he was warned by two Hispanic members of Robert Rodriguez's
[17:27.320 --> 17:32.280]  production crew about its offensive message last week on an internet hyped
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.000]  e illegal trailer for the film revealed many politicized aspects added to the
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.840]  already violence lace film premise of the pissed off Mexican quote who wipes out
[17:43.840 --> 17:49.960]  his American enemies with a machete and a mob the 70s exploitation style film was
[17:49.960 --> 17:53.680]  first spoofed in Rodriguez and Tarantino's grind house before it was
[17:53.680 --> 18:00.400]  fully developed as a feature it is however no longer a joke now that the
[18:00.400 --> 18:05.040]  production for machete is wrapping up in Austin it is clear that it's racially
[18:05.040 --> 18:12.120]  driven plot plays upon the stereotypes pejorative across cultural terms and
[18:12.120 --> 18:18.080]  exacerbated divisions between immigrants and white people particularly the film
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.840]  is dangerous because it glorifies machete as a hero invoking his fictional
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.080]  racial struggle alongside clear parallels the current events and
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.400]  headlines ripped from topical news we've already seen episodes of violent
[18:31.400 --> 18:35.960]  attacks declarations of violent attended protest such as Arizona and Santa

[24:55.160 --> 25:02.280]  sure he goes down in history for this as someone who invoked race war in this
[25:02.280 --> 25:08.280]  country if they release the film the way they have produced it and again people
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.560]  some people get confused in the YouTube video we posted and others and say don't
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.480]  call for censorship it's his freedom no no no first amendment doesn't mean that
[25:17.480 --> 25:25.640]  I agree with everything John you at the Bush White House says we're allowed to
[25:25.640 --> 25:28.560]  torture children in front of their parents and then I come out and say
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.800]  that's illegal and unlawful and wrong it's my first amendment to criticize it
[25:32.800 --> 25:39.560]  it's my first amendment to criticize machete it's my free speech it's my free
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.080]  speech to criticize Robert Rodriguez it's my free speech I'm not calling for
[25:45.080 --> 25:50.560]  this film to be pulled Fox was pulling it by Friday pulling the trailer because
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.440]  they understand it shows a bunch of racial violence with white people saying
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.280]  racist provocative things about Hispanics actors and then saying this is a
[25:59.280 --> 26:04.480]  message to Arizona with images of illegal aliens with sniper rifles trying
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.320]  to shoot politicians what do you expect
[26:09.320 --> 26:17.000]  but they're gonna release the film I believe the way it is currently
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.720]  presented and that's fine I've got my free speech to criticize it you understand
[26:22.720 --> 26:28.440]  that free speech doesn't mean you agree with everything free speech means you
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.440]  have free speech and that's what I'm gonna have coming up at the next hour
[26:32.440 --> 26:40.000]  when I break this down leaked machete script confirms race war plot so
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.360]  mainstream media film reviewers have seen it they're like oh it's so cute it's
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.160]  so wonderful it's such a good film and it's right out of the southern
[26:48.160 --> 26:53.440]  priority law center because it's not just Minutemen they demonize who've
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.200]  never hurt anybody the media has tried to lie about that in setups anyone who's
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.520]  pro-second amendment anyone who's in a militia wants to murder and does murder
[27:03.520 --> 27:09.960]  Hispanics and deserves to die just total government demonization of our second
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.600]  amendment of our militia that by the way is filled with Hispanics black folks
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.280]  Asians you name it and the feds have always been caught creating radical
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.400]  militias that say racist things to demonize militias it's all theater just
[27:25.400 --> 27:31.800]  like this film is theater and I would up this from a 90% chance to a 95% chance
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.160]  talking to the Hollywood insider and Rob do separately talk to another Hollywood
[27:37.160 --> 27:40.320]  insider that wants to talk to me we've been by the office before so I guess
[27:40.320 --> 27:44.240]  that's two Hollywood insiders they're saying it's worse than what I said last
[27:44.240 --> 27:48.040]  week now I know that I have the script but that they've seen the film and that
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.720]  it's a virtual certainty because this shows gang members as heroes murdering
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.880]  ringos and there will be violence and I guess that's what Robert Rodriguez
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.340]  wants I guess that's what he's into he's an American citizen he's from Austin
[28:04.340 --> 28:11.120]  Texas he's made hundreds of millions of dollars and you know I I live here in
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.480]  Austin I've never tried to be in movies I've been contacted I've been put in
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.520]  waking life and scanner darkly I've gotten to work with Woody Harrelson and
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.280]  also the current star of Iron Man
[28:26.400 --> 28:33.000]  Downey I've got to work with Winona Ryder I've gotten to work with Keanu
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.920]  Reeves I've gotten to work with so many great people and this is a close-knit
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.400]  Hollywood community here in Austin I mean I've I've met Robert Rodriguez I've
[28:41.400 --> 28:51.480]  run into and met Quentin Tarantino and I don't man out I don't go to castings I
[28:51.480 --> 28:57.600]  don't try to get roles I've but at the same time I you know coming out against
[28:57.600 --> 29:02.240]  Robert Rodriguez closes a lot of doors here in Austin Texas I don't care ladies
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.440]  and gentlemen I'm not a sellout I'm not somebody that gauges what I say and what
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.680]  I do off of how it's gonna affect me if that was the case I wouldn't have
[29:12.680 --> 29:19.840]  exposed 9-11 months and months before it happened and on the day and lost two
[29:19.840 --> 29:26.760]  thirds of my stations we've gained them back I wouldn't have come out and
[29:26.760 --> 29:32.280]  exposed everything that we've done here we just tell the truth that's it let the
[29:32.280 --> 29:39.360]  ships follow they may trust in God but speaking to God I wasn't even sure how
[29:39.360 --> 29:42.200]  I was gonna cover this when I first saw the trailer it was kind of on the back
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.560]  burner then I got contacted by Hispanics working on it who were upset because
[29:46.560 --> 29:51.880]  they know this is also meant to demonize Hispanics not just gringos we're on the

[34:07.800 --> 34:15.360]  rushed the government facilities in Ireland over the weekend this is all
[34:15.360 --> 34:21.080]  over foreign news but almost a complete blackout here in the United States let
[34:21.080 --> 34:25.760]  me have articles like this in job market shifts some workers are left behind jobs
[34:25.760 --> 34:31.040]  are never coming back New York Times remember the head of the IMF two weeks
[34:31.040 --> 34:35.160]  ago now almost three weeks ago saying hey the good times are over for rich
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.920]  nations it's over and we all hear about austerity oh they're gonna cut spending
[34:39.920 --> 34:45.000]  and raise taxes yeah cut certain spending and rotate it over to interest on the
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.440]  debt to bankers that isn't owed it's a fraud but like cancer they're tied in
[34:50.440 --> 34:55.280]  everybody's 401ks and stocks and that's why they think they've got the ace in
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.120]  the hole they can hold everybody hostage and just incrementally destroy the
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.320]  economy and consolidate everything and that's why we're going into an
[35:03.320 --> 35:07.040]  authoritarian system you know when you have tyranny troops on street corners
[35:07.040 --> 35:10.760]  and black uniforms with machine guns when you have checkpoints and naked body
[35:10.760 --> 35:15.720]  scanners and school laptops watching kids at home and all the things that go
[35:15.720 --> 35:23.120]  with a secret police it isn't just that you live in a police state we'll say
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.360]  well I have nothing to hide you know the government doesn't care about me I'm
[35:26.360 --> 35:30.560]  gonna bend over to whatever happens no that's not what's gonna happen here
[35:30.560 --> 35:37.000]  tyranny is always brought in to loot you to rob you to render you down to the
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.240]  level of bankrupt slaves feudal plantation serfs and that's why they're
[35:43.240 --> 35:49.240]  pulling out all the stops I mean look at the mainstream media MSNBC CNN CNBC if
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.560]  you don't like banker bailouts you're a racist if you don't like government
[35:52.560 --> 35:56.720]  takeover of health care a new tax you're a racist you need to be arrested if you

[36:00.360 --> 36:07.360]  teaching the kids this this is to shut down free speech and now if Mexico's
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.600]  collapsing tens of thousands being killed a year people being murdered all
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.680]  over the Southwest race war already going on one-sided what does the media do
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.640]  they have sitcoms and dramas and movies where anybody for controlling the
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.600]  borders a racist piece of trash a piece of scum all these TV shows were
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.240]  minute men are murdering innocent immigrants and I mean this machete is
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.480]  only a small part of that so that we can be imploded into weak impotent global
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.720]  regions that are not controlled by our government so the people have no way of
[36:38.720 --> 36:45.640]  getting control of their lives again think about how ashenite it is that we
[36:45.640 --> 36:49.520]  supposedly can't control our borders and Mexico has some of the most draconian
[36:49.520 --> 36:53.520]  border rules in the world we have the most open border system in the world and
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.360]  then the people that have been brought here have been brainwashed by the media
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.240]  and the culture that if they see American flags on a car you've seen it on
[37:01.240 --> 37:04.640]  the news rip them down if you see an American flag at a post office pull it
[37:04.640 --> 37:11.320]  down burn it run a Mexican flag up in one case or put it upside down with a
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.200]  Mexican flag above it and then when citizens try to put the American flag
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.800]  back up they get beat up the police arrest them when the illegals attack
[37:19.800 --> 37:23.880]  police the police run when citizens try to peacefully demonstrate the police
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.720]  fire sound cannons rubber bullets and release police dogs on old women the
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.640]  message is the illegals are protected 800 plus cities above the law don't get
[37:33.640 --> 37:37.320]  arrested for drunk driving don't get arrested for serious crimes it's on
[37:37.320 --> 37:41.040]  record don't get arrested with a hundred and five thousand dollars in cash cops
[37:41.040 --> 37:47.440]  let them go but if you're a citizen it's over this is all happening why because
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.640]  it's the key to the globalist program to bring down the United States just like
[37:51.640 --> 37:58.040]  unchecked immigration to Europe is the key to this program but the new
[37:58.040 --> 38:00.880]  British Prime Minister supposedly a conservative he's going to keep the
[38:00.880 --> 38:07.320]  borders open because that's what he's been put in power to do this is divide
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.960]  and conquer now I want to go over the news and also take your phone calls ahead
[38:12.960 --> 38:23.760]  of my analysis of the machete script next hour 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[38:23.760 --> 38:26.720]  for anybody that wants to call in and I'll go through a bank or two of calls
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.160]  then I'm going to break down the latest developments on machete see I told you so
[38:31.160 --> 38:35.440]  worse than I said we have the script I've talked to Hollywood insiders that
[38:35.440 --> 38:42.000]  have seen the film they say it's worse than I said what would make two Hispanic
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.280]  members of Robert Rodriguez's crew speak out against this privately and say
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.040]  they're worried about a backlash against Hispanics what is good see that's what
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.080]  this is a double-edged sword it's meant to divide whites in Hispanics it's meant
[38:56.080 --> 39:02.120]  to make whites fear Hispanics and to make Hispanics fear whites when last time I
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.640]  checked it's got to be more than half the people I know who are Hispanic or
[39:06.640 --> 39:14.880]  married to white people and vice versa I mean my god Hispanic Americans
[39:14.880 --> 39:20.600]  integrate into the Republic very very well I mean you know they they like
[39:20.600 --> 39:27.240]  private property they like to work hard they like guns but the system is there
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.560]  at the universities and high schools and elementary schools and the middle
[39:30.560 --> 39:34.680]  schools teaching them you want to be a revolutionary hate gringos you got to be
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.440]  a communist all funded by the bankers this is sick and I hope Roger Robert
[39:40.440 --> 39:43.960]  Rodriguez has just been completely played by this in and isn't a complete
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.080]  and absolute racist being manipulated but I mean how could he not be my god
[39:48.080 --> 39:55.440]  ladies and gentlemen and the fact that Fox would put this out turned out they
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.800]  had a bidding war with the Weinstein's who previously put Rodriguez's films
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.160]  out they're the distributors turns out they lost a bidding war even though his
[40:03.160 --> 40:09.120]  last two films have been failures they wanted this film bad because they know
[40:09.120 --> 40:18.400]  it is a cereal of films where he is a gringo killing god he is Christ he is
[40:18.400 --> 40:24.240]  worshipped and the whites are evil demons who try to murder Hispanic
[40:24.240 --> 40:29.680]  children who murder Hispanics who who desecrate churches and laugh about it
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.240]  and and and and and crucify Catholic priests played by Cheech Moran just
[40:36.240 --> 40:43.000]  incredible and meanwhile this is all a right-wing militia based in Austin
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.120]  Texas in the movie shot at the Texas Capitol I looked it up it was actually
[40:47.120 --> 40:54.320]  shot there not not not not green-screened not blue-screened with Robert De Niro and
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.160]  Jessica Alba and Steven Segal and Don Johnson and the list goes I mean star
[41:00.160 --> 41:11.400]  studded this is a psyop so we'll take whoever's calls but coming up later for
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.320]  at least an hour and that's after I even break down the shutty an hour of
[41:15.320 --> 41:21.200]  Hispanics you agree with me disagree with me people who are communists who
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.240]  believe in the La Raza or the Metsha and believe I am the devil seed I mean
[41:25.240 --> 41:28.440]  it's just like the white supremacist ideology that they're the supreme race
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.680]  and they're God and all this I have video well I've got it somewhere here in
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.240]  the office I can't find it guys call Steve Mason he's the guy that is in
[41:37.240 --> 41:40.760]  Austin has all this archive he was supposed to call me Monday and he
[41:40.760 --> 41:49.600]  didn't I want the Gus Garcia mayor video when he was mayor a few years ago
[41:49.600 --> 41:55.880]  saying we are the supreme master race descended from aliens and we are the
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.680]  god race I mean it's just it and that's what this film is yeah the Hutus were
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.560]  the god race when they killed the Tootsies and Rwanda with machetes and
[42:05.560 --> 42:09.560]  by the way in Latin America and in Mexico the machete is the symbol of
[42:09.560 --> 42:18.720]  uprisings of killing the rich people and the and guess who's rich if your 700
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.440]  square foot or 500 square foot apartment is one foot bigger than one of these
[42:23.440 --> 42:29.240]  La Raza people you're rich you're a rich gringo who's got to die if you've got
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.560]  two dollars in your bank account more if you've got a car with a newer paint
[42:34.560 --> 42:41.080]  job it's over for you you are scum you are trash you are evil well here's the
[42:41.080 --> 42:48.720]  deal I'm 36 years old folks I'm not some hippie and my parents brought me up to
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.560]  be colorblind and I have no guilt and I've not done a stinking thing to
[42:54.560 --> 43:03.040]  anybody and I refuse to drink the tribal that's what it is tribalism divide and
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.120]  conquer Kool-Aid but at the same time I'm not self-hating the only way to prove
[43:08.120 --> 43:12.320]  you're not a racist in America if you're white is to stand up on a rooftop and
[43:12.320 --> 43:17.960]  scream I am scum I am filth and throw your children off 50 stories down and
[43:17.960 --> 43:22.960]  then slit your own throat and scream I am trash I am scum I am evil I worship you
[43:22.960 --> 43:28.400]  I am trash I am scum I am evil you've got to worship Mexico collapsing you've
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.160]  got to worship illegal aliens above the law don't have to show anything but a
[43:32.160 --> 43:35.920]  fake matricula ID to get a bank account but a citizen's got to show two to four
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.880]  kinds a citizen gets arrested for drinking beer driving a car illegals
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.280]  don't it's all on record you've got to say I worship that I worship that I am
[43:45.280 --> 43:52.240]  trash I am scum I am filth you've got to do that and I'm not going to and and the
[43:52.240 --> 43:57.360]  spell it is broken it's over we're not under mind control anymore I will say
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.160]  the health care bill was written by the insurance companies as a rip-off you can
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.400]  call me a racist all day and nothing to do with everybody sees through you you
[44:04.400 --> 44:10.520]  can play your racial politics see what racial politics is is intimidating the
[44:10.520 --> 44:14.480]  majority group so you can tax and control them teaching them to be self-hating
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.600]  and loathing so you can attach whatever political agenda you want on that after
[44:18.600 --> 44:21.560]  you've intimidated through guilt and buffalo of people then you can
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.040]  simultaneously fill all the minority groups through absolute vicious hatred
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.640]  they can scream any form of racist trash they want about white people all day
[44:30.640 --> 44:34.960]  and you were to fall down and worship that or you're a racist and you see them
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.600]  using it as a weapon oh you don't like Obama selling on our sovereignty you're
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.680]  a racist oh you don't like Obama increasing the budget you're a racist oh
[44:44.680 --> 44:47.880]  you don't like Obama raising taxes you're a racist oh you don't like Obama
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.200]  breaking all his promises you're a racist oh you don't like the health care
[44:51.200 --> 44:55.280]  takeover you're a racist oh you're protesting against the banker bailouts
[44:55.280 --> 45:00.560]  you're a racist no no no I don't care what you call me you understand that in
[45:00.560 --> 45:04.280]  the people don't care have you noticed they don't care anymore and I'm putting
[45:04.280 --> 45:10.640]  the message out to everybody we need Hispanic leaders now just to and I know
[45:10.640 --> 45:13.320]  they're out there because I've talked to them but we need to put them up there in
[45:13.320 --> 45:18.040]  the spotlight we need to build up Hispanic leaders who are proud of their
[45:18.040 --> 45:21.560]  heritage and who are proud of their freedom and understand that collectivism
[45:21.560 --> 45:27.080]  has enslaved Latin America who will stand up and speak out to be leaders not
[45:27.080 --> 45:30.800]  just of Hispanics but of everybody in this country because this country in the
[45:30.800 --> 45:36.400]  Southwest is more than half Hispanic we passed that Rubicon three years ago in
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.240]  Texas schools over 60% of the school children are Hispanic Hispanics are the
[45:41.240 --> 45:46.720]  future of this country it's true when they say white people have committed
[45:46.720 --> 45:53.360]  suicide you have 1.3 children for every two white people they have 1.3 okay and
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.520]  the great judge of all of this is looking at a child looking at a black
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.560]  child looking in a Hispanic child looking at an Asian child I love them all I
[46:02.560 --> 46:09.880]  want them to go to the stars I want them to live in peace I want humanity to not
[46:09.880 --> 46:15.320]  be enslaved by the globalist it's that simple and that's why I will never
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.640]  embrace even though they push it so that's how it works racism's put out by
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.600]  whites that makes Hispanics become more racist Hispanics put out racist tribal
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.960]  stuff that makes whites who were never racist get angry and say I was a self
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.120]  hating white I bowed to you I've worshipped you I
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.240]  eschewed everything that was Western culture I dressed with my pants hanging
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.480]  down around my ankles I got you know the Mac Daddy tattoos all over me I talked
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.400]  like everybody else but not my people I did everything and you still hate me
[46:49.400 --> 46:59.800]  you see that's what's going on here and so you've got these arrogant swollen
[46:59.800 --> 47:04.280]  race pimps what do you think Mexico is it's all a ruling class ruling over
[47:04.280 --> 47:07.960]  everyone Rodriguez is constantly down in Mexico he's always been in the la raza
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.240]  matcha stuff and it's just a him it's fun to make a bunch of money and to promote
[47:12.240 --> 47:16.240]  the gang culture and to have on the cover he's a savage and to make his
[47:16.240 --> 47:22.000]  Spanish look like murdering savages slaughtering white people and that is
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.680]  why Hispanics who are married to gringos and who live next door to gringos and
[47:28.680 --> 47:32.800]  you go to barbecues with gringos and go fishing with gringos they know the gringo
[47:32.800 --> 47:37.680]  doesn't hate them they know the gringos just bumbling around talking about
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.680]  sports teams and sucking their thumb and they feel sorry for the gringo not
[47:42.680 --> 47:46.920]  having babies they see the gringo dying and they think the gringo doesn't want
[47:46.920 --> 47:51.880]  to get me they go down to Mexico and see how horrible it is and they go God is
[47:51.880 --> 47:57.520]  this gonna turn into Mexico and Hispanic Americans who drive nice cars live in
[47:57.520 --> 48:02.560]  nice houses God forbid they get caught at the mall wearing an old Navy t-shirt
[48:02.560 --> 48:06.560]  with an American flag and Mexicans walk over and go what's she doing poor show
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.000]  what you doing Uncle Tom what you doing trash what you doing filth we ought to
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.320]  knife you in the parking lot leave a little raza la reconquista lay you know
[48:15.320 --> 48:18.160]  invasion
[48:19.360 --> 48:26.480]  la invasora and it's all over the Mexican radio all over the big government
[48:26.480 --> 48:32.040]  pushed banker-funded Spanish-speaking radio just laughing and talking trash
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.720]  24-7 about the scum gringos the filth that are gonna be dealt with oh it's and
[48:36.720 --> 48:40.600]  look at the stupid gringo he can't even hear us we're gonna get him I mean it
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.080]  just goes on and on and on and on and on and this is what the media is
[48:45.080 --> 48:52.400]  promoting to create division in this nation and I am speaking out against the
[48:52.400 --> 48:56.920]  Ku Klux Klan I am speaking out against the black supremacist and I am
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.360]  speaking out against la raza and matcha and Robert Rodriguez and everybody else
[49:01.360 --> 49:06.800]  that's pushing this but the difference is the media has made it a taboo to be a
[49:06.800 --> 49:10.360]  white racist because that was the majority group they were intimidating
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.760]  getting ready for enslavement they've made it quasi wrong for blacks to do it
[49:14.760 --> 49:17.640]  you know when a black professor says kill all whites and there's a standing
[49:17.640 --> 49:23.600]  ovation the media says that's wrong but when these matcha affiliated groups and
[49:23.600 --> 49:30.600]  others say it the media says this is good this is wholesome this is right
[49:30.600 --> 49:35.960]  look I've got economic news coming up I've got incredible news with the
[49:35.960 --> 49:39.360]  Supreme Court justice I mean heaven help us how can you have someone who's
[49:39.360 --> 49:42.200]  about to be the new Supreme Court justice with even conservatives not
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.680]  reporting on what she's doing when it's admitted that she's vehemently anti
[49:45.680 --> 49:51.040]  second amendment vehemently anti free speech vehemently anti private property
[49:51.040 --> 50:02.760]  a Goldman Sachs operative by the way you've got six Catholic members of the
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.600]  Supreme Court and now three Jews on the Supreme Court and I see these big
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.280]  Protestant newspapers and magazines saying wow this was a Protestant nation
[50:11.280 --> 50:15.520]  what happened to it well the rapture happened to it in the last 130 years you
[50:15.520 --> 50:18.480]  were taught that you're supposed to lay down and never be involved in anything
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.200]  and that you're supposed to sit there and suck your thumb all day and wait to
[50:23.200 --> 50:30.480]  be teleported off the planet by my check off up on the USS Enterprise with
[50:30.480 --> 50:37.880]  Captain Kirk up there and so of course so just lay there and again I'm not bashing
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.040]  the fact that the court has no Protestants on it I mean that's what that
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.480]  that would be racist and Protestants are nothing to do with being white but it
[50:46.480 --> 50:52.000]  still would be and I mean I think that Protestants or white people should not
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.320]  be able to hold any position in government anywhere they shouldn't be
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.440]  able to own guns they should all be executed I mean that's their devils I
[50:57.440 --> 51:00.720]  mean they all deserve it they're they're evil
[51:00.720 --> 51:05.840]  global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new currency crisis
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.520]  financially and morally bankrupt a great and terrible storm is approaching so

[57:19.480 --> 57:23.600]  that every student has to take unless you're in the agricultural program which
[57:23.600 --> 57:27.560]  they might have to now I'm not sure it's called racing culture and that was back
[57:27.560 --> 57:31.760]  in 1994 when I was there but they had they started it before that and it
[57:31.760 --> 57:35.920]  basically is taught by all blacks and Hispanics and a couple Native American
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.260]  professors and you walk in and they tell you you're racist it's the first
[57:40.260 --> 57:43.760]  thing they say they know they beat you over the head and they tell you white

[58:17.960 --> 58:24.000]  getting F's and so I wrote articles bashing white people and suddenly I

[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:47.080]  in a high-tech enslavement grid we live in a reeducation brainwashing camp we
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:52.160]  live in a scientific dictatorship wake up to it see how you're being
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.400]  manipulated how you're being controlled you're sent to public school and college
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:02.120]  to be brainwashed and dumbed down going back to Damon who just joined us he was
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:06.800]  talking about being sent to basically I forgot all the names the classes I had to
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.600]  go to the cultural classes that what was the name of the classes you were
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:14.000]  talking about name because it's been all of the news they've had it for at least
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.880]  20 years you have to go and and tell folks again what you were taught in these
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:22.160]  classes at college was called race and culture and basically what happened was
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.280]  it was determined on a national level that University of Vermont was the
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:31.160]  whitest school in the country like at per capita they had little to know but they
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.600]  all have it they all have it and basically there was some sort of protest
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:39.240]  over it and all the beatniks at the school had like a camp out on the
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:43.960]  common stuff so the school decided what will promote a course called race and
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:48.080]  culture that will teach all the students how to be more diverse and
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:52.600]  accepting and again the beatniks are CIA technicians they're there to just make
[1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:56.960]  you guilty so you hand over your property and your guns I mean now you see
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:59.760]  the race cult it's oh you don't want government health care you're a racist
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:02.400]  you know you don't want banker bailouts you're a racist you're like what does
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:05.240]  have to do with it they said look we're gonna ban your free speech that's what
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:10.560]  Kagan says we're coming we rule you right so what happened was you know
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.280]  Vermont I mean there really are very few black people that live in Vermont and
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:19.600]  Hispanics want it's just it's mostly all white people but it's not like you know
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:23.280]  I live there grew up there because my parents are racist it's just the way it
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:26.560]  is in the snow you're evil stop excuses you need to die
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.520]  I'm me out I'm sorry you're right so basically you know here we are sitting
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:35.560]  there and we're like what are you talking about because I went to a high
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:39.400]  school with all white kids I'm racist that's that's what makes me racist and
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:43.200]  they're like you're racist whether you know it or not you're racist and I'm
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:47.120]  like well I thought racism was learned so how can you learn racism if you went
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:49.880]  to a high school this was the first argument I used in the class and the
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:53.360]  teacher just immediately tried to shut me down and from all the other students
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:57.080]  were from New York City and from New Jersey and other states that had a more
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:00.920]  diverse culture so to speak so I learned right away I was like you know what you
[1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:03.760]  just gotta sit back and shut up and I talked to my brother who's a lawyer in
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:06.560]  New York City at the time and he was like you have two choices you can fail
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:10.240]  this class not graduate or you can sit back hold your tongue and just put up
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:13.760]  with it and it just it called me to know when because I was like this is crazy
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:21.880]  no I was being failed but it didn't matter what class it was if it had any
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:25.000]  writing involved with it they would just it didn't matter it was anthropology
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.480]  sociology psychology they were all doing it this was at ACC I only went for two
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:34.240]  years to ACC I thought why pay to go to UT plus I'd already started my TV show
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:39.080]  I was too busy and I went and sat in at UT and it was all basically the same
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:44.640]  story there and it was and so I just cynically would write what they wanted
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.560]  and they thought they'd brainwash me and were like celebrating and I was just
[1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:52.920]  thinking these people are scum and I was just like I got out of there and and I
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:55.680]  would never send my kids to that school I don't care if they're like oh we want
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:58.480]  to go to school you went to I'm like you're not going there look you end up
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.320]  paying what sixty seventy thousand dollars on average for your kid to not be
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:07.880]  able to get a job and to be brainwashed and hate their family and then also
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:10.880]  Hispanics and blacks and others that go to this they're just taught to think all
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:15.200]  whites are racist he's a double-edged sword see oh god forbid these kids went
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:19.480]  to high school together they're all getting along you know these kids you
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:22.160]  know these white kids especially you know they were all brought up that to be
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:27.280]  colorblind we've got to inject racial politics into them to go to the next
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:31.360]  level and they also know there's been a backlash by whites who then become very
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:34.840]  tribal because they see that they're under attack and that plays into the
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:37.560]  program as well it's very sophisticated mind control
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:43.400]  Damon look you're evil just admit it okay you want to apologize to everyone
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.640]  for being white right now yeah but you know my wife is from the former Soviet
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:51.200]  Union so I got that going for me you know well they're evil too okay just

[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:37.040]  Robert Harrelton Matthew Adam and others and then I'm going to get into the film
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:45.000]  machete that we first covered last week you got a lot of attention I guess we
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.600]  actually covered it on Sunday so the start of this week and I've now gotten
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:55.840]  the actual script it's worse than I had first thought it is a study in mind
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:02.520]  control and racial division via supposedly fighting racism which is
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:12.240]  really just tribalism it's divide and conquer so they don't want us to define
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:16.640]  ourselves by ideas and what we stand for and what we produce and what we
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:22.360]  create the character of our deeds they wanted to all be about what group we're
[1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:27.240]  from so the government can be the big moderator the referee over it all while
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:33.360]  injecting the tribalism will also get into Kagan it's worse than I even thought
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.640]  as usual totally anti-second amendment anti-phrase speech a monster for the
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:43.560]  Supreme Court and we're going to cover the incredible developments of the
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:50.080]  economy gold continuing its rise today all-time records in the US and Europe
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:57.320]  global records in India in China amazing developments out of Iceland
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.480]  bankers jailed sued as Iceland seeks culprits for crisis and what do the
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:09.360]  internal homeland security training manual say if you want to audit the fed or
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:13.760]  if you want to do any type of research or if you want to protest banks robbing
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:18.800]  you you're a racist what does that do with race they just inject it in there
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:26.240]  as a smokescreen by the way guys it's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:32.240]  and I didn't see it in my stack Ron Paul says audit the fed bill is is is a
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:37.400]  fraud and he says that Bernie Sanders sold out I need that article because I
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:41.840]  want to cover that see there were two different versions of the bill and the
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:45.360]  one that they've passed is a whitewash so we're gonna get Ron Paul on the next
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:48.400]  week or two to cover that as well but right now let's go to your phone calls
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:56.560]  Tony in mass you're on the air welcome hello my friend are you good yes you
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:02.560]  know how they put fluoride in the water right yes well I've been doing some
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:11.280]  research on that and from what I can find which isn't much because there isn't
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:16.720]  much on it but hey do this the reason you're having trouble talking is you're
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:22.200]  listening to yourself on the radio once you turn the radio off hold on yeah
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:28.800]  that'll work a lot better yeah go ahead all right you know how yeah I've been
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:35.000]  doing research on the fluoride in the water yes and from what I can find is
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  that human beings they they have the ability to regrow teeth I'm not sure if
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:52.520]  you knew that or not sir you need to go ahead and finish up your point all right
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:12:00.240]  well from what I can learn fluoride actually diminishes the ability to do
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:09.360]  that so it actually causes more money to go into the dentist practice well I'll
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:13.320]  tell you this the average dentist is brainwashed in dental school and told
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:17.880]  that sodium fluoride is good for them but once they see the information they
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:21.800]  then wake up to the fact that it's a fraud my dad is a dentist and they also
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:25.160]  discovered that it isn't just fluoride being put in the water it's hundreds of
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:33.480]  chemicals toxic waste from aluminum manufacturing and fertilizer manufacturing
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:38.800]  predominantly also nuclear weapons uranium purification the byproduct is
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:42.920]  then dumped in the water supply and that's why for four years the American
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.480]  Dental Association recommends children do not brush with fluoride now and it says
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:52.640]  on the back of the toothpaste bottle it's poison now as for regrowing teeth I
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:57.480]  appreciate your call I believe you're mistaken I myself am not a dentist but
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:04.520]  I did work for several years as a dental assistant if your teeth aren't loosened
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:09.280]  or even knocked out they can be reinserted just like a finger can be
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:13.680]  attached if it's done quickly and then the ligaments and the bone will grow back
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:22.960]  around the tooth okay humo sapiens sapien has three sets of teeth we don't
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:26.440]  just have the baby teeth and then the second wave of teeth that start coming
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:32.320]  in and around age six on average it varies there's also the wisdom teeth that
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:37.600]  come in between 14 and 20 depending on who you are I kept my wisdom teeth I had
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:42.440]  room most people of course in primitive times ate
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:47.800]  rougher foods so you'd wear off your molars you know by the time you were 13
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:51.600]  or 14 and so there would be spacing and then when the wisdoms came in it would
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:56.280]  push them together but because we eat soft processed foods most people don't
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:05.920]  have room for their third set of teeth so I don't want to get off into it with
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:12.880]  you sir the average dentist is not running around going you know I'm
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.520]  poisoning people they're brainwashed let's go ahead and talk to Robert in
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:20.840]  Texas state it does cause dental fluorosis and causes teeth to be brittle
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:23.560]  though and doubles your chances of bone cancer that's just a little bit of it
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:28.200]  let's go ahead the floor I does do that let's go ahead and talk to Robert in
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:35.120]  Texas go ahead Robert not to mention the fact that's not the approved Alex it's
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.720]  not what it's not the approved well you have the Nazis but if you speak out
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:43.960]  against the Nazis you're racist anything the government does if you're
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:47.760]  against it you're racist okay I mean if you're against a ham sandwich you're
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:51.400]  racist if you don't like bad weather you're racist if you don't lick boots
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:59.240]  and worship government you are a racist go ahead exactly well I wanted to call
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:04.080]  in I'm with you a funk master five channel on YouTube I'm a Hispanic
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:10.960]  American and I you know my mother came here legally so I feel like she's kind
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:15.000]  of getting cheated because she had to go through the the frustrating process of
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.560]  coming here legally when other people are kind of just like something through
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:23.480]  without having to kind of put the work in into the process and I'm not for you
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:28.240]  know this machete stuff I'm not for the division divide and conquer is a tried
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:34.720]  and true method and that's what they're doing here well absolutely and again I
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:39.480]  was conducted by Hispanic members of Rodriguez's crew because they say they
[1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:42.400]  believe it's going to cause a backlash against Hispanics because here's the
[1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:49.000]  deal most Hispanics are not into this Mecheloraza business but large portions
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.400]  of recent immigrants are it's taught on the college campuses to the
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:58.360]  intellectual future leaders of this race group and then anyone who isn't for
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:04.320]  it who's Hispanic is basically going to be intimidated into acquiescing to it so
[1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:09.000]  it's a way to keep Hispanics on the reservation not learning English not
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.520]  integrating into society it's a way to ghetto eyes I mean the heroes in this
[1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:20.120]  film are illegal alien gangbangers and I mean look at Mexico literally collapsing
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:23.600]  and that's another issue with the immigrants legal immigrants come here
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:26.200]  legally because they want to follow the law and we have the most open policies
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:33.240]  in the world the illegals many of them are fleeing corruption in some cases but
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:39.800]  also fleeing justice a large percentage your criminals and meanwhile it's
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:43.600]  discriminatory against citizens that if you are I drink four or five beers and
[1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:46.680]  get pulled over by cops with beer cans in the car we're going to jail well it's
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:51.080]  on record if the legal aliens are just let go because the judges let them go
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:58.600]  Robert well you know another way to look at it is is this new movie that's
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:04.560]  coming out is very similar to Dolomite or Black Caesar or you know some of the
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:09.720]  black exploitation movies back then you know it they were put out there to kind
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:16.240]  of build a foment a this pleasure between the racial groups and that you
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:19.120]  know once you start the ball rolling it's like a snowball you know they just
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.080]  they just get people agitated and and everybody's gonna see red they're not
[1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:27.920]  gonna the reason kind of shuts down no that's it it's even got me seeing red
[1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:32.160]  and I've got to control myself because I haven't done anything to anybody I mean
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:34.920]  I really genuinely like everybody and when everybody to have freedom and
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.400]  private property and guns and and then it makes me uncomfortable and it's meant
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:43.080]  to all make us feel uncomfortable around each other and and now I'm becoming
[1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:46.680]  conscious of this and I'm getting more and more uncomfortable and that's
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:50.120]  exactly what it's meant to do and that's why we need people to stand up and
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:54.200]  repudiate this and speak out against it Robert God bless you I appreciate your
[1:17:54.200 --> 1:18:02.240]  call Carlton in California you're on the air Alex yes sir okay I want to talk to
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:05.680]  you a little bit about first I want to thank you for educating me on many things
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:11.400]  about the false left-right paradigm between the two parties that's one of
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.840]  the things that kept the catches people up today I think they just you know they
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:18.480]  want to put a republican in the place of Democrat and vice versa but it's not
[1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:20.680]  about that the both parties are controlled correct
[1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:25.040]  oh that's racist nope the banks are good world governments good the health
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:29.040]  care takeovers good well you know I was in college I went to the university
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:32.160]  Pacific and stock in California they were teaching international relations
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:36.400]  back then and they were all for the UN and I didn't know much about the UN I
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:40.280]  still don't I haven't really researched about that it was created by the
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:45.320]  Pentagon in 1945 it's a CIA globalist front the control society and turn
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:49.280]  everyone against each other and bring in world government go ahead absolutely and
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:52.680]  you know if you read the book of Revelation in 13th chapter it talks
[1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:57.280]  about the beast and it seems to indicate that everyone will have to take a mark
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:01.440]  and I don't know if that's the chip like you said the RFID chip alright is that
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:07.280]  what's called our RFID yes yeah or or some some type of a mark that would make
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:11.480]  all of us bow down and worship like you know people did during Rome's time
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:16.400]  Caesar's Lord basically it seems like it's moving that direction with everything
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:21.560]  being universalized food production the the codex element areas you know I read
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:25.720]  that well it's far worse than that sir over a decade ago they already had
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:30.720]  vaccines that attack your brain eat holes in your brain and change behavior
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:33.800]  they attack certain areas of the brain and that's being promoted his mother's
[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:37.240]  milk and that's the new thing and they say don't worry it's a patch we put on
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:41.760]  your arm and you're never gonna be depressed again how's that sound yeah
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.600]  what's pretty scary mind control vaccines and this is openly being announced
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:52.440]  by Bill and Melinda Gates oh really well good points my friend I appreciate

[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:28.440]  level to exactly validate your concerns what's going on I've experienced it I've
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:33.160]  been called a racist myself and I am Hispanic American well we got going on
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:36.440]  here San Antonio we are changed San Antonio is always on the streets and
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:40.080]  and numerous times we've been called racist when the majority of us are
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:45.160]  Hispanic we've been called racist for handing out documentaries so just any
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:50.000]  suggest any political activity now because your films are the films you're
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:53.240]  handing out are basically about the globalist blowing up the Twin Towers
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:25:00.000]  and that's racist oh yeah and you know it gets even more extreme than that the
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.440]  big weekly newspaper here in San Antonio San Antonio current had a had a vote for
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:10.800]  a citizen San Antonio best of 2009 or 2010 and the third and that activists
[1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:14.800]  category the third pick voted on by everybody in San Antonio the third pick
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:18.680]  was Communist Party the Communist Party got the third most votes of our
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.400]  activist group of San Antonio and and that's and that's true because that's
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.360]  all we see on the streets you can turn on public access here and and and you're
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:29.720]  not an activist if you're not wearing a red shirt if you're not down with the
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:34.720]  local foundation funded group which promotes heavily promotes Mexican pride
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:41.240]  anti just so racial anti-white person it's so extreme and ludicrous I've had
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.200]  people tell me well I left that a foundation group because they promote
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:49.600]  extreme racism they think all white people are bad and and and not only that
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:54.400]  but I mean it's more to that but I just wanted to tell the audience that you know
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:58.520]  we do experience everything you talk about the film machete the radicalization
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.120]  of the Mexican police it's totally true we'll be over experience that and this is
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:10.320]  Matthew Matthew Medina right yes sir well I mean look at what they're doing I
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:15.440]  mean this is going to create racism on both sides which is exactly what they
[1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:20.760]  want when in my experience you know spending a lot of time down in San
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:25.880]  Antonio and I had family that live there everybody was getting along great
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:30.760]  yeah you know that is there and then however the big foundation funded
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:34.680]  organization here that's but on the center they have a heavy influence of
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:37.880]  San Antonio they got they got mad influence here and they are the
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:41.080]  organization that is promoting they're the fourth foundation Rockefeller
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:44.840]  Foundation funded organization here heavily promoting everything you're
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:48.200]  speaking about and we've had to deal with them firsthand we had one of their
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:52.080]  people come up to us and she called me a coconut which means brown on brown on
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.800]  the outside white on the inside and she said this and that and then we try to
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.200]  reason with her and talk with her and then the chick actually threw a punch
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.720]  at me she threw a swing I mean I you know it's crazy and and and we put that
[1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:07.400]  video on YouTube and I got all these replies hey you know my friends were in
[1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:11.160]  that group and they left at our monthly weird change meetings we meet at a
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:14.760]  vegetarian restaurant the guy at the cook came up today you know a lot of
[1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:17.760]  people there are a lot of young activists out there who are hungry and they
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:21.040]  want to do something but they're caught up in this but on the center it's
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:24.760]  promoting and if you're a real activist regardless of what color you're
[1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:31.320]  exposing the phony wars you're exposing the stage terror attacks it's not left
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.280]  or right you're exposing tyranny and corruption but the right wings got its
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:40.720]  things you're supposed to do or you're not orthodox and the left wings got its
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.640]  foundation funded system where the way Hispanic Americans or anybody else for
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:52.160]  that matter are supposed to be radical is shea guavara joseph Stalin garbage
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.600]  and it's it's it's the government is pushing it what do you want to say to
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:01.560]  robert rodriguez who's put this film out because I now have it Hollywood
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.120]  insiders that have seen it they say it's worse than what the trailer even
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:10.120]  shows and I now have the script and it is worse than I even imagined it is in
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:14.560]  it's actually religious I'm gonna cover that coming up Robert Rodriguez the
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:19.440]  blood is on your hands the people the the foundation funded ideology and
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:24.000]  philosophies already there everything's established the foundation is built
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:29.520]  they're just they just need that one marching order that one of first idea
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:34.440]  of actually making it go viral of being violent and Robert Rodriguez this is on
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:38.320]  your hands it's gonna go it's gonna be bad news it's already bad news when we're
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:43.040]  handing out DVDs and without some cult figure to look up to you know and they're
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:45.920]  gonna make it hip and trendy because as of right now it's hip and trendy to our
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:50.120]  red star it's hip and trendy talk about communism and anti-capitalism and
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  anti-white person that's all hippie and trendy because it's funded by the
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.960]  government funded by the global elite and Robert Rodriguez you should know
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:00.800]  better than this being from Austin, Texas and stuff is gonna hit the fan and
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:03.800]  down here's Antonio we're gonna do everything we can to get these movies
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.520]  out and prevent that and Alex is gonna prevent that but whatever happens
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.640]  besides that it's all in you Robert Rodriguez and it's it's not gonna look
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:17.160]  good it's not gonna be good. Why were communist Hispanics angry at you for
[1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:22.040]  handing out videos that have nothing to do with race? Well you know we walk
[1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:25.880]  around with the sciences free DVDs and fours.com and she started shouting your
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:29.680]  leaders races and she was across the street and we're a megaphone and finally
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:33.200]  she came over and she said your leaders races and then we tried to speak to her
[1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:38.160]  and correct her that it's not about race and she wasn't hearing it she got
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:42.120]  upset I told her about corporations funding this philosophy and she threw a
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:46.400]  swing at me trying to punch me. But you're saying the video came out and
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:49.880]  woke folks up stay there.

[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:38.560]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:42.600]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's

[1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:21.680]  May 2010 coming up today in Ireland in Greece in many other nations like
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:26.440]  Iceland they are now arresting the bankers they're talking about actually
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:30.320]  going after the real criminals here's a headline from French news agency
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:36.280]  bankers jailed sued as Iceland seeks culprits for crisis here's France 24
[1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:42.240]  national TV Greek demonstrators say plutocracy should pay for the crisis
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:48.120]  the bankers and the banks fund communism and socialism to consolidate the
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:55.480]  public's wealth communism is always funded by big money okay it's not what
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:34:00.800]  you think it is and we have a situation all over the world but especially now
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:06.960]  here in the US where people like Barack Obama was Ford Foundation Carnegie
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:12.680]  endowment funded to go in and create racial division create race cults and
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:21.560]  to organize it around religion to make it part of the church and going back to
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:27.440]  Cinco de Mayo last week I was sent the trailer it already had like a million
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:32.240]  views when Fox pulled it it was over three million of the trailer for Robert
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:36.880]  Rodriguez's new film that's coming out in September September 3rd of this year
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:41.240]  called machete of course the machetes the symbol of peasant uprisings in
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:46.000]  Latin America and in it they say this is a message to Arizona and it shows
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.240]  groups of Hispanics with machetes you know killing the evil white racist they
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:55.880]  deserve it it shows you know attempted assassination of politicians all of this
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:00.720]  going on and I came out and really did a mild critique of it saying I'm worried
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:03.840]  this could trigger race war because you've already got illegal groups and
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:07.760]  their supporters burning down buildings knocking windows out in Santa Cruz
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.400]  attacking police in Arizona American flags being pulled down at government
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.800]  buildings Mexican flags being run up Mexican students who see themselves as
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:21.440]  Mexican nationals other Hispanic students wearing American flags in San
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:25.920]  Francisco were told go home you can't wear an old Navy shirt Hispanics over
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:29.600]  the years have contacted me and said they're called porchos coconuts all
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:34.280]  these racist terms by other Hispanics if they aren't racist and hate white people
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:38.600]  if they're free market if they're not communist this is all government
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:44.640]  funded on record well it was much worse than I thought raw story wrote an
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.800]  article implying there isn't even a movie coming out in September and then
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:52.280]  saying we can't even find the trailer like like we were making this up as what
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:55.680]  is implied in the first few paragraphs of the article which is insane it's been
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:01.520]  all over the news and but that's the psych warfare they just say you're not
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:04.920]  telling the truth there's no new world order the bankers aren't robbing you
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:07.960]  know the government health care plan isn't a ripoff and if you say it you're
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.960]  a racist they just inject it you're like I don't like a ham sandwich you're a
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:15.680]  racist I don't want banker bailouts you're a racist it's just it's used as a
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:23.320]  weapon of control and after I play this new 10 minute video where we break down
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:27.360]  the script and of course that's the big news I got the script Tuesday I read it
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:31.560]  Tuesday shot a video Tuesday night Aaron Dykes at a great job putting it together
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:36.520]  yesterday we posted it this morning it's up at info wars calm and prison
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:42.040]  planet calm leaked machete script confirms race war plot but it's worse
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:49.440]  than that the whole thing is meant to enrage Hispanics and make Hispanics feel
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:57.680]  like they've got to be anti-white pro-gang member types or they're not good
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:02.680]  Hispanics and there's a poor show played by Steven Segal that means a rotten
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:08.520]  fruit or or Uncle Tom who's Steven Segal and he gets killed by machete no one
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:13.120]  can stand against him and there's evil white racist murdering Hispanics
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:18.280]  crucifying Catholic priests in churches overturning altars desecrating
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:22.760]  Mary desecrating I mean this is meant this is off the I mean this is mind
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:28.600]  control I have never seen anything like this I'm here's the script right here
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:32.880]  machete by Robert Rodriguez and I'm gonna give you a document cam shot coming up
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:41.120]  and I'm gonna go over this but every time the white racist because all whites
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:47.520]  are basically racist so so they frame them as deserving to die it begins with
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:54.600]  men and men murdering people on the border and showing the murdered illegal
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:59.840]  aliens as Christ figures on a cross so it's blasphemous and then by the end of
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.440]  the movie they bow and kneel and pray to machete and he just literally comes out
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:09.480]  of the sky and kills men and men and that's how the movie ends so what's
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:14.000]  gonna happen is this is manipulating people's religious beliefs which is
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:19.240]  what the Ford Foundation has done this is pure liberation theology I've talked
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:23.560]  to now several Hollywood people who've seen the film and they say it's worse
[1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:28.680]  than what I covered last week well yeah all we have was the trailer and I now
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:33.560]  have the script but I wanted to go to Matthew Medina who's a good friend of
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:38.040]  mine we are changed San Antonio they expose 9-11 as an inside job they
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:42.280]  expose fake wars they expose communism as a globalist operation they're not left
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:46.920]  or right they're just telling the truth and he of course Matthew Medina if you
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:53.840]  want to see me introduce me in Austin to the 9-11 scholars event and this is meant
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.480]  to the Hispanics that contacted me who worked for Rodriguez because I saw the
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:03.280]  trailer last Wednesday or Thursday got contacted Friday two people separately
[1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:07.040]  who are Hispanic who worked on they said we're really scared of this we can't
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:09.720]  tell you what's in it because of agreements you know we've signed but
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:14.480]  you're you're you're right on track and quote we're worried about a backlash
[1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:22.560]  against Hispanics because it shows in fact that it shows machete with two
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:26.800]  machetes blood all over them the Texas Capitol basically on fire with smoke in
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:30.920]  the background and he's got the machetes and it says he's a savage who
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:36.880]  must kill and so it's like and the good guys are gang members and they they go
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:40.760]  into the armory and kill the militia people and and so now being in a
[1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:43.920]  militia's racist now I wanted to be for the Second Amendment's racist this is
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:48.880]  pure ADL pure Southern Poverty Law Center garbage but I wanted Matthew Medina
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:53.840]  because he called in to be able just to recap because we just went live on TV as
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:40:00.360]  well to to to recap just trying to hand out 9-11 truth DVs DVDs the the
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:05.720]  communist groups run up and say you are racist so any political speech that
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:08.440]  doesn't agree with world government is racist and of course they called him a
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:14.000]  coconut but that's acceptable of course and again there's a coconut in this
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  film Steven Seagal but he gets what he deserves and machete says how dare you
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.640]  sell out your race and he kills him so you know the message is kill the
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:28.400]  porchos kill the coconuts kill the gringos this is political correctness
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:33.840]  ladies and gentlemen but Matthew Medina we are changed San Antonio recap what
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.720]  you were covering yeah we are changed San Antonio down here we are always on
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:42.520]  the streets and we have been for two years now handed out hundreds of DVDs
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:46.480]  a month so we are always on the street ground level street level dealing with
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.360]  the people here San Antonio there is a good relationship between Hispanics and
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:55.000]  and and all races but however the young people and then the people want to be
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.120]  active as the San Antonio lean towards this organization which is foundation
[1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:03.040]  funded Rockefeller funded for foundation funded and we know from the
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:07.960]  Reef committee that this is an engine a tool of social engineering so we do see
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:12.080]  those social engineering being a place in effect through the people and here we
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:17.080]  are at our first Friday event months back and then our DVD and a group of
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:20.760]  people starts yelling at us across the street hey you're and they're cussing
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:24.080]  at us you know it's like you're saying they're really mad as if you know
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:28.600]  retrieving this hey you're blah blah blah racist and and we're like what and
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:31.480]  then so I start speaking to the next one they cross the street and say okay
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:34.720]  they want to speak no they don't want to they want to speak rationally they
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:38.880]  wanted to oh you're a racist you're against Mexicans out of you know and
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.760]  here we are the majority of us were Hispanic Americans you know and she's
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:46.960]  calling us racist and we're trying to explain her and you know I know I'm
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:50.160]  and I know I'm dealing with the communists yourself today are used for
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:55.440]  the corporations funding the ideology of a storming and revolution she's like
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:58.480]  corporations don't find that and then she got really mad and then she starts
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:02.440]  calling me a coconut and saying I'm giving it to the white man and she's
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:06.280]  getting really you know angry at me and then as I turn around she actually
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:10.800]  throws a punch at me I mean she is pumped up she is fired up the social
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:15.800]  engineers and by the way we have this we have this video it's on YouTube but we
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:20.160]  can't play it because of her cussing but for folks that want to see the video
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:25.440]  tell folks the title the title is it's in quote this is in quotations info
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:31.520]  wars is racist unquote dash Rockefeller funded activist and you know it really
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:35.880]  it's you know I advise caution watching it don't watch it up watch it around any
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:41.080]  any young people because this is what we deal with in San Antonio you also have
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:45.320]  the cops letting the communists hand out stuff by the Alamo on the on the
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:49.320]  street corner but they always come over and tell you not to hand stuff out oh
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:54.760]  boy that is a great topic Alex because that is true and just recently this
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:59.920]  Foundation funded organization had a big rally I want to say March they had huge
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:03.160]  banners I saw pictures on the internet but I keep an eye on what's going on
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:08.360]  here and they had huge banners bunch of people megaphone going the same area
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:11.620]  the side of the Alamo and month later we're in that same area we got a
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:15.200]  architects engineers banner on the floor getting ready to hold it up don't
[1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:18.640]  even have it up yet when we get a parts apart approached by Park police oh no
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:22.960]  you can't have that can you have that and we're like yeah we can know what you
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:26.040]  can't have some double-finged trick my you know you thought about that on my
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:29.640]  tricks trying to entrap us trying to legally get us in trouble but then it
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:34.320]  comes over and gets in your face and tries to intimidate you and then says
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.120]  what's your problem trying to start a fight with you oh yeah well that was
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:42.720]  what there is that this has actually happened three times in the last month
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:46.360]  here Alex we're being targeted you can't wake up the people about the global
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:50.320]  no no no we know exactly it's okay to attack police in Arizona it's okay to
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:54.080]  burn buildings down it's okay to hand out communist material because that's
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:59.160]  what the police you know they understand that's part of the team but you are not
[1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:02.800]  allowed to go out and warn people peacefully and that's because you are
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:07.240]  effective Matthew Medina and more people need to join your organization you
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:12.080]  need to get get on access TV more you need to you know give people the
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:15.400]  alternative between the control right wing and the control left wing that's
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.280]  all foundation run I'm gonna play this video but I really appreciate you
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:23.960]  being on with us we've got to get you up here to Austin to be in studio with us
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:27.320]  sounds great Alex keep up the great work we've got to warn the masses I
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:31.920]  encourage all Hispanic listeners get out there in Spanish and English we've
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:35.160]  got to warn them we've got to warn the Hispanic community because we it's a
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:39.480]  setup they're gonna make us look bad just by a minority of Hispanics getting
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:43.400]  violent so we have to be on this 100% and I thank you Alex for giving this
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:46.760]  coverage because it is a legitimate concern that we deal with here in
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:52.640]  San Antonio I bless you I appreciate your call yeah look at simple Hitler tried
[1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:55.720]  to use radical Muslims to control the Middle Eastern World War two and you
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:45:00.480]  know he was in North Africa with Rommel that is the German military was there
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:06.560]  and in other areas not just North Africa and after that the British in the US
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:10.840]  went in and radicalized the Muslims that actually done this with Lawrence of
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:16.600]  Arabia as well before World War two and it came out in government documents that
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:20.120]  we've covered and put in films that they said we can't have First World Arab
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:23.720]  Nations we got to radicalize them and let radical Muslims overthrow these
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:28.240]  governments and then in 53 they used radical Muslims to overthrow Mohammed
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:33.040]  Mosaddegh well it's the same thing they are going in and the colleges and high
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:39.280]  schools with federal and CIA and Ford Foundation funding on record and trying
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:42.560]  to make Hispanics racist trying to make them hate white people because they
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:45.280]  don't want us getting together against the New World Order and that's what
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:49.800]  films like machete are all about now again see I told you so we got the
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:55.080]  script Rob do a fellow from Hollywood that we know was been by here in I'm
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:45:59.080]  just gonna leave it at that confirm that he's seen the film it's worse than what
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:02.480]  we said but I have the script confirming it and I have another Hollywood source
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:06.520]  said yes I've seen it it's off the charts I'm just gonna leave it at that but
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:11.000]  here is the script we've got screenshots of it in this video up on info wars
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:17.920]  dot com leaked machete script confirms race war plot and this is meant to make
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:22.840]  whites get scared of Hispanics and it's meant to have Hispanics feel intimidated
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:29.440]  with this new cult hero who is literally Jesus at the end he is God machete is
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:33.080]  God and the and the religion is murdering white people and the white
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.480]  people all deserve it they're trying to kill Hispanic children they're
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:42.600]  crucifying Catholic priests who are also Jesus basically I mean it is there
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:45.640]  will be violence from this there will be attacks in the medial try to cover it
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.720]  up and I guess that's what Rodriguez wants this is and put out by Fox of
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:56.360]  course this is a mind control operation here it is machete the special
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:03.480]  Cinco de Mayo message to Arizona on Cinco de Mayo I was sent a trailer for
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:08.200]  the new film machete produced by Austin filmmaker Robert Rodriguez titled
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:14.680]  machete and white people are evil demons they deserve to die they're all
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:21.520]  racist and armies of Hispanics have to hack up the gringos with machetes then
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:25.440]  that's the Latin American symbol of peasant uprising in the US and Europe
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:30.120]  it's pitchforks and I didn't know what to think of it and then I got separately
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:35.080]  contacted by two different members of Robert Rodriguez's crew who are
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:40.200]  Hispanic and they said look we're afraid of a major backlash against Hispanic
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:44.040]  Americans this is really bad and I said well what's in it they said well what
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:47.720]  you see in the trailer and more it's off the chart by the time I went and tried
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:53.520]  to look at the trailer again Fox 20th Century Fox was pulling it it had three
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:57.200]  million views they pulled it they had put it out of the New York Post had
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:02.040]  attacked it Fox News had attacked it but they had suddenly expunged those
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:06.040]  articles because Fox was producing it the left hand didn't know what the right
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:10.120]  hand was doing and I talked to members of Rodriguez's crew and they just said
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:14.520]  look we've signed on disclosures but look into it for yourself I put a video
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:19.360]  out and I said look everything that's in this trailer is paralleled by illegal
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:24.520]  alien groups torching a restaurant attacking 20 plus businesses knocking out
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:29.120]  windows and Santa Cruz attacking police in Phoenix Arizona saying we'll use our
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:41.080]  pickaxes we'll use our yard tools you know to go after you and so I simply
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.480]  pointed out that this is gonna create division this is a serious problem and
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:51.720]  then publications like Ross story made jokes about it and implied that the film
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:56.160]  isn't even real when it's on IMDB and but announced that's the level of denial
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:02.240]  since then I receive the latest script of machete by Robert Rodriguez it's far
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:08.600]  worse than what we had previously thought white people are racist scum that
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:13.800]  run around murdering Mexicans everywhere killing them it all parallels what the
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:17.440]  media is hyping if you're against government health care you're a racist if
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:22.280]  you're against big government you're a racist it's a tool a weapon but it uses
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:27.520]  religious iconography and it shows white people desecrating Catholic churches
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:34.200]  and crucifying Catholic priests it has machete with illegal aliens worshiping
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:42.400]  him as Christ and that he will save them it creates a racial jihad or a cult
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:51.560]  movement it is unspeakable we have the script and this is all funded by 20th
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:55.800]  Century Fox because they know it's gonna make a lot of money and Robert Rodriguez
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:59.480]  thinks this is gonna be explosive and that it's some radical thing for him to
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:05.360]  do and all of this dovetails speeches all over the country of professors saying
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:11.360]  the gringos are evil plan of San Diego kill all whites the school teachers
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:15.320]  giving speeches saying the frail white people are scared we are communists
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:20.360]  we're going to get them these frail racist white people want to keep us out
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:24.280]  of this country this is not just about Mexico this is about a global struggle
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:29.600]  against imperialism and capitalism at the forefront of the revolutionary
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:36.800]  movement is the rasa we see ourselves all of us here as the northern front of
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:43.000]  America movies are always at the forefront of propaganda in Hitler's
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.960]  Germany in our own country and this film all right paints whites is all we're
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:52.440]  gonna go to break we're gonna come back finish up with this new video we posted
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:55.280]  we have the script I'm gonna go over some of the script make some other
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:59.120]  important points then I'm gonna open the phones up specifically for Hispanics that

[1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:11.240]  all right let's go back to my breakdown of the leaked machete script confirms
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:15.840]  race war plot we've now confirmed that the Texas Film Commission instead of
[1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:20.560]  Texas funded this they wouldn't allow a film about Waco to get any funding because
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:24.080]  that would make Texas look bad but making Texas the scene of a race war is
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:27.400]  supposedly good that's being added to Aaron Dyches article right now and
[1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:32.000]  infowars.com here's more of our breakdown films are always at the
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.600]  forefront of propaganda in Hitler's Germany in our own country and this
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:40.560]  film paints whites as all a bunch of murdering racists that are trying to
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:44.520]  kill Hispanic children and murder Catholic priests and crucify them it is
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:48.800]  unspeakably evil and so you're getting the first look at the script machete
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:52.520]  right here and people are so concerned in the production of this that I'm
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:55.840]  getting all the information this is Hispanics that are concerned about this
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:01.800]  it is just so incredible and in it it has a false flag attack where racist
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:05.920]  whites hire a Mexican to try to kill the senator so that they can have a
[1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:10.920]  pretext to attack Hispanics and you've got all these you know devout Catholics
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:15.200]  they're gonna watch this and watch the gringo desecrating the church and
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:20.560]  crucifying Catholic priests I read this script and we called the number and it
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:24.320]  is the official script this is the equivalent of a Hispanic birth of the
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.600]  nation the famous pro clan film that took the Ku Klux Klan from a few thousand
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:35.480]  members to two million members and so imagine a film where black people are
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:41.960]  scripted as terrorists scum and trash imagine a film where Hispanics are put
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:46.080]  in that light as a white person I am insulted and they say that anybody who's
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:49.360]  for border control whichever other nation has Mexico some of the most draconian
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:54.240]  where anybody that is for sovereignty is a racist piece of trash this is the
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:59.000]  mass mental illness that has created situations like California where in San
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:03.160]  Francisco Hispanic students can't wear American flag shirts because it's seen as
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:07.760]  insulting where school kids can't draw pictures of American flags now that's on
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:13.520]  mainstream news because it's seen as racist this is a cult formation this is
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:18.400]  a mind control operation and you'll see when this comes out in September unless
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:25.120]  they edited or change it I mean this is unspeakable Robert Rodriguez admits now
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:28.200]  he's gonna make a whole series of machete films who's creating a cult
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:34.920]  following for a racial hero we have the script and everything that's in the
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:40.120]  trailer is here and more and it's worse than I could even imagine we have
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:43.520]  video clips in Arizona where the woman says we will rise up with the
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:47.560]  implements where we clean your toilets and do your yards with pickaxes we will
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:52.640]  get you that's actually in the script they say in the script that they're
[1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:58.480]  using the tools of their slavery their mops their hose their pickaxes to kill
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:04.160]  the gringo this is all part of this liberation theology art type that we
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:08.600]  actually see it rallies all of this merging with reality yeah there's a
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:13.400]  border crisis yes Mexico's had 20 plus thousand people killed in their drug war
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:18.480]  yes Mexico's collapsing white ranchers in Arizona and Texas are being murdered
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:23.000]  police are being killed but none of that's in the film no the narco terrorist
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.800]  state that Rodriguez glorifies and once upon a time in Mexico where the CIA is
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:34.440]  our hero all of this is supposedly validated and you go through it over
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:39.440]  and over and over again they use the racist term wetback being spoken by
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:44.000]  white people framing white people is just running around boiling with hatred
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.960]  of Hispanics I just wish we could live in peace but we can't live in peace with
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:51.600]  people like Robert Rodriguez funded by the federal government big foundations
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:57.400]  to create division then they have the employee of the senator setting up the
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:02.360]  federally to commit the assassination of the gringo senator who wants to control
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:07.920]  the borders and machete agrees yes I want to kill this gringo for this money
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:12.480]  and it goes on he says for the good of both our peoples our new senator must
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:16.600]  die and for that I will pay you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:21.000]  throngs of people are gathered to hear the senator's speech the citizen
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:25.680]  militia led by von Kerry carries a sign of support for McLaughlin and other

[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:26.480]  Alex Jones I'm spending a lot of time on the film is Shetty because the trailer
[2:00:26.480 --> 2:00:30.360]  invokes race war we now have the script I've talked to Hollywood insiders that
[2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:36.360]  have seen it it is 100% race war creates a new racial religion that whites are bad
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:41.960]  and desecrate Catholic churches I mean it is mind control and it demonizes
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:45.040]  anybody that calls themselves freedom force which is a group to audit the
[2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:48.640]  fellow deserve it makes it to where Hispanics feel like they can't join pro
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:54.440]  gun groups it will create a backlash against Hispanics it does so many things
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:00.600]  and I want to hear from Hispanic callers at 1-800-259-9231 on the other

[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.920]  discuss this and I've got a host of just tons of other economic issues supreme
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:16.920]  court issues it's all coming up but let's finish up but the 10 minute
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:21.640]  breakdown video that I put together with Aaron Dykes and it's posted on
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:26.120]  info wars dot com leaked machete script confirms race war plot and here's the
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:30.200]  key we have now confirmed a email or point of the sound and I already know
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:34.520]  Rodriguez's all his films are funded by the state Film Commission with big tax
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.520]  exemption and money his studios at the old Robert Mueller Airport or paid for
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:43.200]  about taxpayer money city of Austin and state of Texas they're now funding this
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:46.760]  but they wouldn't fund a film about the Waco massacre saying that would put
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:50.440]  Texas in a bad light but but but showing Texas is a bunch of racist evil
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:54.920]  people that's okay so these would be a state-level investigation and remember
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:58.760]  the fox that's putting this out has pulled the trailer so the whole films
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:03.040]  in crisis right now and it should be because this is seriously gonna invoke
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:06.200]  violence there's there's almost no doubt of that here's the end of the video
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:10.560]  throngs of people are gathered to hear the senator's speech the citizen
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:15.280]  militia led by Von Kerry carries a sign of support for McLaughlin and other
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:20.360]  anti-immigration slogans they were caps marked freedom force there is a freedom
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:23.480]  force I'm part of it freedom force is about auditing the Federal Reserve
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.960]  kicking the IMF and World Bank out of the US it's founded by Gia McGryffin
[2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:32.480]  state senator McLaughlin is once again under investigation for his ties to
[2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:37.240]  extremist militia organization in the capital city all of this shot in Austin
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:43.160]  Texas at the capital all of this merging with reality blurring the lines and as I
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:47.560]  said over and over again every white person that talks in the film hates
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:53.480]  Hispanics calls them racial names over and over again they repeat the same
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:58.680]  thing that wetbacks must be dealt with and men and men are murdering and
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:03.160]  slaughtering Hispanics which is totally made up the one grain of truth in this
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:07.680]  film machete is that government stages terror attacks against themselves they
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:12.440]  talk about senator McLaughlin since the assassination attempt his approval
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:15.920]  ratings are up he's not being investigated for being part of an
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:20.720]  illegal second amendment group anymore there's no way Rodriguez wrote this
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:27.000]  this is a scyop straight out of hell that's meant to drive a wedge between
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.120]  Hispanic and white Americans and they have evocative scene after evocative
[2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:38.000]  scene we're poor pathetic innocent illegals are cornered by minute men that
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.920]  murder them in cold blood and then it says in the script they corner the last
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:48.520]  illegal he's lit in the spotlight like Christ on the cross and he's murdered not
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:53.720]  only do white people from start to finish spew racism at Hispanics that's a
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:57.080]  straw man they hire actors to say horrible things about Hispanics to make
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:02.440]  whitey the devil okay this is like a Hitler film or something demonizing
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:06.720]  people he wanted to go after they actually made films like that but it's
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.560]  religious machete who runs around killing the green goes and killing
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:15.560]  border patrol and killing minute men who go down and defend the border it shows
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:21.120]  minute men murdering innocent Hispanics and the film ends with him murdering
[2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:24.840]  white people evil people who deserved it they were going to kill Hispanic
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:30.560]  children it describes innocent illegal trying to get to a water station a
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.600]  bullet brings one of them down on the other scramble for safety but there's
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:39.760]  someone out there shooting at them say a prayer to el machete to protect you
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:45.400]  they light a candle and say a prayer young illegal opens eyes there's a glass
[2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:51.160]  candle in his hands but no one else is around instead of Christ or the virgin
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:58.840]  on the candle it is a silhouette of machete over and over again they pray
[2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:03.600]  and they they project crosses on him in March Alex Jones announced the foods

[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:35.880]  there there's just too much here's page 85 of the draft that was used to make the
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:40.720]  film machete okay you're seeing this for the first time says a family of
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:45.040]  illegals crossing the border in the desert sees a water station up ahead they
[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:48.640]  make it for it opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply a
[2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:53.120]  bullet brings one of them down as the others scramble for safety but there's
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:57.040]  someone out there shooting at them now in reality I have four mainstream news
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:00.720]  articles about coyotes robbing them drug dealers robbing them death
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:05.200]  destruction mass murder whites being killed everywhere their homes being
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:10.200]  burned down but also Hispanic illegals being killed never a word from the
[2:09:10.200 --> 2:09:13.920]  Larica on quista matcha movement they've had a bunch of the leaders of this
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:17.640]  movement caught in Austin being being coyotes because they're caught beating
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:22.400]  up the people they're shipping in they're caught bringing in drugs all of
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:26.600]  that's kept real quiet though just this incredibly corrupt gangbanger drug dealer
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:31.000]  culture that's dominating Mexico and now dominating the Southwest but no no
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:35.640]  that's not the problem ranchers being overrun and killed would invite people
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:39.840]  in on the weekends with binoculars to set up hidden cameras and call police oh
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:44.280]  you don't do that because we're gonna make movies about you where you're
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:49.600]  murderers where you're killing everybody where you're racist where if you're part
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:53.840]  of a second amendment group you're evil throughout the whole movie it it cuts to
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:57.560]  white people murdering Mexicans and attacking them and killing them and
[2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:02.760]  it'll whites deserve what they get continuing all of this taxpayer paid
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:05.920]  for we've now confirmed that I already knew this about Austin I knew this about
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:10.880]  Rodriguez but but we looked it up it's correct I'm gonna cover that in a moment
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:15.360]  a family of illegals crossing the border into the desert see a water station up
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:18.760]  ahead they make for it opening it up and drinking heavily from the water
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:22.480]  supply a bullet brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:26.120]  there's someone out there shooting at them the mother hushes the younger ones
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:32.880]  the children oh my gosh the white people they're so evil they're gonna kill the

[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:45.480]  the children and this is a message to Arizona remember this is a political
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:51.840]  message say a prayer to El machete to protect you the younger ones start to
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:57.840]  pray a jeep patrols the area and we see it is a minute men taking photos of
[2:10:57.840 --> 2:11:02.280]  potshots at the illegals I had a Freudian slip actually take photos but a jeep
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:06.440]  patrols the area and we see men and men taking potshots with the illegals so
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:12.440]  they're just running them down chasing them down committing this evil crime did

[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:16.440]  on the candle it is a silhouette of machete over and over again they pray
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:21.960]  and they they project crosses on him he is the race consciousness Christ instead
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:27.960]  of the Virgin Mary it's him oh machete they're creating a new icon like
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:32.720]  Guadalupe Hidalgo again they're using racial warfare to divide this country as
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.040]  a tool of control and Robert Rodriguez has been used as a dupe in this or he's
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:40.720]  a government operative there is no doubt since I got the script it is far worse
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:46.200]  than I can even possibly imagine okay ladies and gentlemen we'll come back

[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:22.200]  the Capitol to blur the lines and that's why Hispanics have contacted me who

[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:23.920]  part of the new world order takeover program I appreciate Adam Michael Tony
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:29.360]  Lewis Truth Patriot and others Chris and others for holding while I had to go
[2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:32.680]  over all of that but I wanted to have it on record let's go quickly your calls
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:39.760]  now Adam in Utah you're on the air hey Alex hey buddy yeah I'm just calling a
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:45.520]  little first-off thing for taking my call but I'm just calling the sharing
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:49.840]  experience I have with the Metsha group at the University of Utah I am
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:55.680]  Hispanic-American but before I even get into that I just want to say that I
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:25:03.800]  first learned about your website info wars dot com but I think it was we are
[2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:08.480]  changed people they're on campus at the University of Utah two of them about a
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:14.240]  year ago handing out the copies of DVD copies of the loose change in the
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.640]  Charlie sheen 20 questions to the president remember I took one of their
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:23.440]  paper and I was looking at the I mean it was pretty there was nothing about
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:28.520]  racing there and Charlie sheen's Hispanic yeah Carlos Estevez is his real
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:34.560]  name but again go ahead yeah but but I'll be only part of getting with that is
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:41.040]  that that's how I learned about info words dot com it was one of the links out
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:45.280]  on that sheet of paper one of the copies and you know it woke me up
[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:50.640]  everything makes a lot more sense you know I think clearer and so on and so
[2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:57.240]  forth I well anyways about a few years ago when I started going to the
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:02.120]  University of Utah you know I lived in Utah my entire life I went to grade
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:08.160]  school secondary school I'm Hispanic so you know obviously minority if anyone
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:15.480]  has a grievance it's me but you know I try not to be a bad person you know you
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:22.320]  gotta root out oh hate out of your heart but anyways you know one day when I was
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:26.840]  when my classes are over I was walking around campus looking for something to
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:33.320]  eat and I figured hey if I go to one of those student commons a multicultural
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:38.360]  center they always have free coffee and donuts and so I went to it I looked
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:44.480]  around and then that's where like these other the lady the the Metchah lady
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:50.360]  middle-aged woman she introduced me to the other people there and then you know
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:55.160]  I took a seat on the beanbag chair and I was enjoying it but now then I started
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:58.920]  looking at their brochures Metchah I never heard of these things before
[2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:04.920]  it's kind of a briefly part of that but you know so I never really cared and then
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:09.800]  I was reading their literature and it showed the what is it the Western United
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:12.440]  States I said line yeah you got groups all over the
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:17.680]  University's government funded to try to make the US Mexico why on earth will we
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:23.160]  want that exactly that's what I was saying I was like these people serious
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:29.920]  reconquista of the La Raza this the rather than I mean it's again to be
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:36.240]  aware of sure but I mean the point is this is revolutionary so so bottom line
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:41.640]  what do you think of the Robert Rodriguez script that we now have I think it is
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:47.240]  absolutely unnecessarily inflammatory I mean that there's probably one of the
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:50.040]  worst times something like this could come out do you think this should be
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:55.080]  taxpayer do you think this should be taxpayer financed no this has a
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:59.400]  political message but notice everything they're doing well god bless you I
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:02.600]  appreciate your call Adam and again that's why I hate even having to talk
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:06.040]  about this but this is going on underground everywhere now it's being
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:10.120]  pushed out in the open by the government by the media why do they want this
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:13.360]  because they don't want us going against the bankers they want us fighting
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:18.440]  with each other Michael in Texas you're on the air I think they my call I just
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:24.160]  want to say that someone I know was actually attacked with machetes over
[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:28.760]  at a party over an incident with with beer like there were random people that
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.280]  came up to him and I guess that they didn't bring their own beer but and they
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:40.160]  thought that his American beer was obviously worth it worth it but he didn't
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:45.120]  know you know he obviously didn't give it to him but then it ended with just an
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:51.440]  argument there but as he asked as he left the party like six guys jump them
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:57.120]  and he ended up getting a few hundred stitches to his arms and his hands over
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:00.840]  that incident now was it Hispanics attacking Hispanics or whites attacking
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:04.520]  whites what I mean what was the racial nature of it or it wasn't racial just
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:09.040]  machete well it was like a Hispanic like like I'm a Hispanic it's just
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:16.120]  Hispanics just mostly speaking English and attacking each other no but the
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:18.920]  people that are attacking the more likely whether where the gangbangers of
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:21.680]  Mexicans they come over the border kind of thing that they they show up
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:26.120]  uninvited at parties but then if you can't come out they come back with groups
[2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:30.480]  of people with with bats and machetes and and they occasionally do shoot a
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:34.960]  party and they can't get in trouble because nobody knows what their name is
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:47.800]  anything else you'd like to add Michael you said stay there out your phone was

[2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:47.160]  issue is the media and the corporate the state of texas funded this we've
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:47.920]  discovered
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:54.160]  what's this message for all of us to hate each other i mean it's so obvious
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:57.760]  i know i do you should make some of your films in spanish about
[2:37:57.760 --> 2:38:00.720]  how part of we are change the cargo and we're gonna get the case of chicago for
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:01.760]  the summer and
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:05.120]  pass out dvd and i know it's gonna be a lot of immigrants there
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:08.600]  then turn english they won't understand you know here's a problem we barely have
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:10.720]  the money to get our films out
[2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:14.880]  but almost every one of my films if you google say in game spanish
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:17.720]  uh... obama deception spanish they are on youtube
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:18.920]  i just
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:22.840]  i mean i looked at cheap places it's like ten thousand dollars to have one
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:25.880]  language done we ain't got the money man
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:29.240]  i mean uh... i welcome people to take the dvd
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:32.760]  put it in german put it in chinese put it in and people done that
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:37.080]  uh... but uh... you know just do it i mean i we're a small operation
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:39.840]  i mean a lot of days i'm the one carrying the trash out of here i'm not
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:44.120]  robert rodriguez robert inero funded by the federal government but absolutely
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:47.720]  we want to reach out to ever that's what makes me so mad
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:49.160]  is that
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:53.120]  is that
[2:38:53.120 --> 2:38:56.200]  and then i've got to come out against this and some people
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:38:59.560]  aren't sophisticated enough out there understand even when i'm saying you see
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:01.080]  what i'm trying to get a tony
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:05.000]  yeah yeah i try to pass a film up some people i can i can buy copies of films
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.760]  to watch and they tell me i don't really understand it i'm like
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:10.440]  and some of our teachers and they're like they really don't understand it
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:13.400]  i'm like well i can understand this i can understand it
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:16.320]  that's because they've never been in the real paradigm they've never been in
[2:39:16.320 --> 2:39:19.400]  reality that both parties are bought and paid for that they're dividing us
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:20.640]  they're manipulating us
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:24.560]  tony guy bless you and uh... yeah most the films are on youtube and google
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:27.240]  uh... in other languages at least they have subtitles
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:30.860]  and uh... you know folks we can't do it all if you want it in russian if you
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:33.360]  wanted in chinese if you want it in japanese
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:35.280]  make a version put it on the web
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:38.840]  you know my films are not copyright uh...
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:40.160]  as long as you give them out free
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:43.400]  because i said you can have the copyright then i could lose the copyright
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:45.680]  i've been told by copyright lawyers
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:46.920]  it's all available
[2:39:46.920 --> 2:39:50.760]  i mean i'm just look what we take the hard stands if nine eleven's an inside job
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:54.080]  i don't care if it's popular to come out they want to say it's an inside job i
[2:39:54.080 --> 2:39:55.000]  do it
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:56.480]  uh... i don't care
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  what the issue is i
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:39:59.720]  cover it
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:00.560]  talk about it
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:02.040]  i'm about justice
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:05.840]  about telling the truth i'm about being honest about who i am
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:08.680]  and i mean i don't want to come out against robert robert regus
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:10.040]  i mean i live here
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:12.800]  you know i mean i've been i've been put into pretty big hollywood films that
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:14.120]  even asking
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:16.800]  i'm a rick link letter you know who's a good friend of mine and part of the
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:19.080]  texas film commission and involved
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:22.520]  you know i mean i i've been approached before but by other filmmakers
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:24.680]  instead come cast for this role
[2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:27.800]  and it's not a political role or i can talk about freedom and shattering the
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:32.400]  left-right paradigm exposing the phony drug war like i do in scanner darkly
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:34.400]  uh... and uh...
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.720]  waking life i don't do it and by the way who put me in both those films not just
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:43.080]  rick link letter a great hispanic american good friend of mine tommy palata
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:46.200]  who's one of my best friends and i wish you still live in austin
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:48.400]  and you know what
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:50.440]  tommy now has a baby
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:53.300]  you know uh... the lady had the baby where this is
[2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:55.640]  is white i mean what uh... again
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:59.520]  everybody wants to live in peace together but that's not gonna happen with
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:01.480]  films like this you can't just say
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.520]  well this is just an art project not when you say it's a message for arizona
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:08.720]  not when you've got white people trying to murder mexican kids and murdering
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:09.760]  priests and
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:12.680]  and again it's malicious it's gun owner groups
[2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:16.240]  the message is to hispanics you can't join a pro-gun group
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:18.960]  the system is scared to death that blacks and hispanics are part of tea
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:20.040]  parties and they are
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:23.000]  that's why they want to set the tea parties are racist and hate people when
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:23.600]  they don't
[2:41:23.600 --> 2:41:26.680]  and and and groups have been caught the democratic party's been caught sitting
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:31.840]  people out dressed up like nazis at tea parties to discredit this is a set up
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:34.360]  and i'm gonna give you trouble maker studios number again i guess they think
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:36.120]  it's real funny over there
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:37.320]  you let him know

[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.320]  control and i will i wish i brought mob psychology up that's it
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:28.680]  that they've learned how people get a group think
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:32.560]  the thinking process which is off its literal mind control sorry go ahead
[2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:36.040]  yeah exactly uh... i'm a high school teacher like i said and uh...
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:39.800]  as you know across the country they're doing massive layoffs with teachers
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:41.440]  uh... our students
[2:46:41.440 --> 2:46:45.720]  wanted to do something about it so at first they did something called it
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:48.360]  and out of the thousand kids in my high school
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:50.720]  only maybe fifty kids didn't fit in
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:53.760]  and i'm looking at from a psychological point of view it's because
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:56.480]  most of the thousand kids are not fully educated
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:00.280]  and it it also required additional work for them to fit in means they had to
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:01.720]  stay after school
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:03.800]  it required extra work
[2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:07.920]  so it wasn't very successful but two days later they did a walk out
[2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:11.600]  and that was much more successful now again i'm watching this from a
[2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:13.000]  psychological point of view
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:15.440]  the walkout was much more successful even though
[2:47:15.440 --> 2:47:18.560]  what to the kids didn't really know the reasons for the walkout didn't know the
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:20.720]  pilot uh... you know the politics
[2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.160]  everybody got behind it
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:24.560]  because it's something all the kids want to do anyway they all want to leave
[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:25.480]  school
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:27.520]  so almost every kid
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:28.640]  left school
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:29.960]  because uh...
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:31.880]  you know the protest was designed
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:33.480]  to get everybody aboard
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:36.800]  now i i kind of wanted to tie that little pilot program and
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:39.000]  so what's really going on now
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:40.520]  things like ron paul he's
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:43.080]  really ron paul wants to abolish the federal reserve
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:47.680]  and he's trying to do things like hr twelve oh seven he's trying to uh...
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:49.160]  let me see here
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:50.880]  with uh...
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:53.320]  well audit the fat now and then you got
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:56.520]  bernie sanders now trying to like you know do a big switch at the last
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:47:57.080]  second
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:47:59.880]  well we're really not going to be able to audit the fat
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:04.560]  uh... romp all want to abolish the sixteenth amendment you know the irs
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:08.160]  what is unconstitutional and i think right now what's going on
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:12.480]  is that they're doing this kind of appease the tea party
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:14.920]  the controlled opposition like glenn beck
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:18.560]  here's here's basically my big idea alex i really want to think about that
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:20.240]  it's a peaceful revolution
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:22.520]  actually never called
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:25.680]  he's never called for violence and this is a peaceful revolution right here
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:29.800]  i suggest that on july fourth the fourth of july two thousand eleven
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:31.120]  every american
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:32.640]  stopped paying their mortgage
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:36.320]  we stopped paying our car payment we stopped paying our credit cards
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:39.920]  we are fueling the bankers that are inflating up
[2:48:39.920 --> 2:48:40.560]  i
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:41.600]  suggest
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:44.640]  that we have a movement where we stopped fueling the empire
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:47.920]  if we all stop doing the first thing we need to do is make sure we have a two
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:49.160]  year food supply
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:50.800]  we need two years of water
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:53.480]  and we need to have some medicine and things like that we need to be self
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:57.120]  efficient for two years let me say that i'm going to say this this is what i
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.960]  saw in others have done it successful similar things and if we don't do
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:02.160]  something like this
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:03.760]  the banks are just gonna
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:04.560]  get rid of
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:07.520]  all the basic services teachers potholes
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:09.480]  that's the plan that's the uh...
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:11.240]  new jersey austerity
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:15.680]  but then the money all the money basically then just goes to the banks
[2:49:15.680 --> 2:49:19.600]  that's how and then they scapegoat the greek workers they scapegoat peak
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:24.080]  mortgage holders they scapegoat teachers again it's a scapegoat
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:27.200]  right that the money basically worthless like we're not on a gold
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:29.040]  standard anymore we're kind of on like a
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:30.680]  a fiat oil standard
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:32.520]  i i believe right now what we need to do is
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:35.600]  stop paying our mortgages that they cannot foreclose everybody's house
[2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:37.400]  they cannot repo everybody's car
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.440]  and if we stop paying our credit cards
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:41.280]  that the money's worthless anyway
[2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:45.000]  so it they will be a peaceful revolution as long as we got people like
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:48.720]  old keepers and we raise the collective consciousness of the public
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:51.720]  everybody will get a board this late like that model i gave you of the walk
[2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:53.920]  out most people won't get in on it
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:55.600]  because it requires extra work
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:49:59.320]  but everybody will get in on behind not paying their mortgage everybody
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:01.560]  understands banking systems abroad
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:03.840]  ever understand we're getting raped by the bankers
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:04.680]  therefore
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:08.000]  everybody knows a great idea it's just how to have the media power to
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  coordinate it
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:10.520]  good enough people to do it
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:13.760]  because that would bring the bankers to their knees but in closing what do you
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:15.600]  think of the information in machete
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  i mean do you not agree i mean do you agree that that's going to cause a
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:22.080]  backlash against hispanic so that's what it's designed to do
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:25.240]  well yeah i i i think you're covering this you know extremely well
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:27.960]  and if it wasn't for a watchdog like yourself
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:30.720]  i think they would be able to come through with us and it would create a
[2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:31.360]  you know
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:36.080]  it more divide and conquer more more race wars between hispanic and american
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:37.440]  and that's what they want us to do
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:38.440]  is to invite
[2:50:38.440 --> 2:50:41.640]  what we need to do is stay united and not let things like machete and all in
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:42.920]  all their countless
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:45.480]  amounts of divide and conquer techniques that they try to do
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:47.640]  blacks against whites hispanics against whites
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:51.600]  arizona is against mexico but they try this over and over and over and over again
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:54.240]  and it's not going to work because we got people like you
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:57.480]  uh... you know exploiting their divide and conquer techniques
[2:50:57.480 --> 2:51:01.840]  machete is just over the top god bless you but we have a break
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:03.080]  fatigue

[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:29.040]  others on this subject Rob Redding on a host of issues is joining us but he
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:34.280]  wanted to come on about the the whole open border situation in Arizona Rob
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:38.280]  Redding coming up a syndicated radio host here on Genesis it's also a station
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:43.280]  manager one of the stations we're on and so he is coming up at the aid after
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:51.920]  you know I keep waking up in the middle of the night because when I'm awake I'm
[2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:56.120]  all geared up and you know macho consciously but then when I wake up
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:54:58.720]  middle of the night like my god the banks are stealing trillions they're
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:02.240]  they're gonna raise taxes on everybody they're gonna take everything we've got
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:06.880]  they're setting up a police state all of this is really happening gold went up
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:11.880]  to 1,240 bucks it's right there right now we've been right about everything I
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:15.640]  wish I wasn't right they're coming out with vaccines that brain damage you by
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:18.640]  designed to make you behave yourself that's mainstream news I haven't even
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:23.640]  gotten into that a Kagan is absolutely anti-second amendment and free speech to
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:27.920]  be the new Supreme Court judges I mean this they're going for it and they
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:30.840]  plan to have us all fighting with each other and killing each other and all I
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:36.680]  want is freedom that's all I want but I wanted to bring Ted up for this segment
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:41.680]  part of the next because I hate to say see I told you so again when gold was
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:45.800]  $280 an ounce six seven years ago and then four hundred and five hundred and
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:48.440]  six hundred and seven hundred eight hundred nine hundred thousand eleven
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:55.840]  hundred twelve hundred twelve forty I mean it's insane and it also supports
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:56:00.320]  the network not though not much because Ted's so competitive but he is running
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:04.080]  out again and it keeps going up and he still bought gold when it was what
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:07.200]  seventy eighty dollars less than it is now an ounce he can pass those savings
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:11.520]  on to you but not for long because even mainstream news is now saying three
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:15.680]  thousand dollars an ounce gold because the printing presses are on high this is
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:19.280]  a guarantee they destroyed America we may be able to fix it and rebuild
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:23.240]  something but we'll be too busy killing each other in a race war I guess what
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:26.080]  about our children what about our children living in peace together
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:29.360]  Ted Anderson I wanted to bring you up here just to give people today's gold
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:33.000]  offer and talk about what's happening gold has now gone through its all-time
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:37.600]  record high and is holding there this is incredible it sure is Alex I mean
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:41.160]  yesterday we've seen gold during the middle of the trading day run all the
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:45.200]  way up to twelve hundred and ninety dollars and sixty cents it was forty
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:50.400]  cents away from hitting twelve hundred and fifty dollars an ounce it closed at
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:54.160]  its high that's never seen before right now it's holding that number right now
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:57.880]  it's trading at about twelve hundred and thirty five dollars an ounce and I got
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.960]  to tell you Alex the European people are just scared out of their skin about
[2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:06.640]  having their money and cash they're watching the banking system destroy their
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:12.040]  economies it really burns me up when I think about the fact that we are bailing
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:18.200]  out through the IMF here in the United States us the taxpayers of Greece and it
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.200]  just you know I mean how many countries do we have to carry when we can't even
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:27.120]  carry ourselves I mean the United States Mexico's collapsing Iceland's collapsing
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.080]  Portugal Italy Greece everything's collapsing and everything's got to go to
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:35.560]  the bankers and they're all over the news today Ted saying the good times are
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:39.040]  over we're going to cut all your services but taxes are going to go up but
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:42.640]  look at least people can protect themselves with gold and silver it's not
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:45.560]  perfect but it's the best thing out there tell folks the coins fast we're
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:48.240]  about to go to break give them the number sure the but the best coin right
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:52.960]  now is the Frank at two fifty six sixty eight we do do the full forecaster for a

[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:09.600]  there isn't there's nobody out there that's even selling the coin for two
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:13.640]  hundred and fifty six sixty eight that coin is so far discounted when you
[2:58:13.640 --> 2:58:17.160]  consider the fact that it's four eighty eight down four hundred eighty eight forty
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:20.400]  an ounce you're not going to buy gold for less than that out there goes over

[2:59:53.760 --> 3:00:01.440]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:01.440 --> 3:00:16.560]  Ted Anderson is our guest Rob Redding a great syndicated radio host here on
[3:00:16.560 --> 3:00:21.840]  Genesis also station manager he happened to be on is coming up talk about a
[3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:28.480]  host of issues and to continue with your phone calls but Ted I mean this is a
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:35.280]  no-brainer back when I mean you guys send me the daily coin offers and I see
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:39.160]  it and it'll be a fifth of an ounce say European Frank and it'll be two three
[3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:43.080]  four five dollar markup depending what day it is I happen to know your markup
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:46.480]  on a two hundred and say fifty dollar coin is three four dollars I've asked
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:52.120]  you how you even operate then on top of that you sell bullion collector coins you
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:56.240]  name it you buy them when the markets down and then you sell it when the market
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:01:00.080]  is up at the original price and I know I keep explaining that to people but
[3:01:00.080 --> 3:01:04.040]  folks are not going to find better deals what about the half ounce silver coins
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:08.200]  you've got that you bought when silver was at fifteen bucks but of course you
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:11.360]  had to pay the premium to get them and then now it's right up there at nineteen
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:16.000]  something almost twenty I mean tell folks about that offer yeah sure it's the
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:20.040]  walking Liberty half right now I'm selling that coin at nine seventy five and
[3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:23.720]  that coin right now is trading at eleven dollars plus out there in the
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:28.280]  marketplace so that is just a fabulous buy as well you know what else I have I
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:32.560]  have the British sovereign at three thirty two twelve I've been checking my
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:37.640]  competitor sites they're out of them I accumulated these things when the price
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:41.200]  was lower I guess I'm really lucky I locked into what I did yeah that's
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:45.720]  another issue they admit in Europe especially in Austria they're running
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:49.920]  out of gold or have run out they're putting in gold vending machines in
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:53.880]  Europe Asia and the Middle East people are really starting to discover gold and
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:57.600]  when the yuppies finally discovered that it's over well that's right because
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:02:02.240]  there's not enough above ground supply to go around you replayed that that
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:07.920]  interview that you had with the gata guy and and that was that's what he was
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:12.200]  talking about the above ground supply of gold is not enough to submit the demand
[3:02:12.200 --> 3:02:15.760]  right now and that's why we're seeing the price go up there just is simply not
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:21.920]  enough coins to run let alone a coin that was made previous to the 1940s you
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:24.880]  know that British sovereign goes all the way back into the 1800s so to the
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:29.080]  Franks it's a there's a finite supply of them out there I don't know if you
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:32.640]  understand what that means it just means that then they're never going to be
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:36.960]  manufactured again ever so what I'm dealing with is something that was
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:42.520]  manufactured in the 1800s and the early 1900s a lot of people like to buy these
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:46.440]  coins because they're talk about exemptions from confiscation this type
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:49.960]  of thing I just like to get small pieces of gold in your hand in this
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:54.560]  particular case I'm selling it for less than half the value of the spot price of
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.560]  gold so I don't know how in the world I can make this easier for people to buy
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:03.080]  gold I need people to get into gold coins so do you and of course your

[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:04.320]  let me just say thank you again for having me on I really appreciate it
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:09.480]  you're one of the most important voices in radio congratulations on a radio
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:13.760]  ink cover I was showing my boss the other day the owner of the radio station
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:18.760]  that this this show is definitely a growing by leaps and bounds I look for
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:21.640]  you to be at what five or six hundred affiliates before it's all over with that
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:26.160]  I don't know about that but okay well people see the light of day I think that
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:29.480]  they're starting to understand that there is definitely something afoot in
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:34.000]  Washington DC and it's corrupt and it needs to be addressed and this show does
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:40.240]  just that well thank you this type of show that I do is I'm an independent I
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:46.480]  do I guess radio from an independent perspective I we share a lot of the same
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:50.860]  views in that I believe that government is corrupt I believe that the
[3:10:50.860 --> 3:10:54.760]  Republicans and Democrats are duping us and that they need to be exposed and
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:10:59.800]  that's what the show seeks to do it's called ready news review and the website
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:03.480]  ready news review dot com well I always enjoy the show not just because of your
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:10.320]  commentary and energy and intelligence but also the guests you have on so I mean

[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:19.640]  same place I'm at having to a lot of work yeah absolutely and you know it's a
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:24.080]  it's a lot of work but it's it's important work that you were doing and
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:29.240]  that I think that I'm doing because you know you know you can always say that
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:33.480]  you know I've got products and things like that that I that I sell but I almost
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:36.760]  also the products that I give away I give away just as many books as I sell
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:42.960]  it's probably more books that I that I sell I know you you you supply your your
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:48.640]  audience daily with your radio show and I get little our reward from it but you
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:53.440]  also I have a lot of YouTube videos that I've watched and I think are very
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:57.280]  compelling I don't agree with all the elements but I do believe that your heart
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:11:59.960]  is in the right place and that you ultimately stand for the same thing I
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:05.320]  stand for and that's truth well Rob Redding let's get your take on the
[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:10.320]  hottest issue right now in the United States or we disagree I mean maybe it's
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:14.120]  the war with Iran or the economy imploding but what I hear on talk radio
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:17.840]  in the newspapers what I hear people talking about on the street is the fact
[3:12:17.840 --> 3:12:23.320]  that Mexico is collapsing that there are people here who do not want our
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:27.960]  borders controlled and both political parties basically want to drive down the
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:32.000]  wages they want to have you know basically groups in this nation that they
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:36.320]  can exploit but either way you look at it it looks to me like it's starting to
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:40.960]  really deteriorate and come to a head what's your view on the Arizona situation
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:46.400]  well I believe that this is a situation where it clearly there's some issues of
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:51.080]  race here but however this is identity politics smash mouth identity politics
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.120]  that the Democrats are playing they would not be concerned about these people in
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:02.720]  this state being free if they didn't gain something from it you wouldn't have
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:08.000]  Al Sharpton out there talking about boy cotton boycotting you wouldn't have you
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:12.560]  wouldn't have the likes of Jesse Jackson out there talking about this is Selma
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:16.200]  Alabama if they didn't think that they were going to gain something from it so
[3:13:16.200 --> 3:13:19.440]  the Democrats have always been a hodgepodge of different groups whether
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:24.320]  it be blacks whether it be gays whether it be Jews or whatever is a hodgepodge of
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:27.080]  different people and this is identity politics where they're trying to bring
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:30.960]  these 500,000 people these illegals people that are illegally here from the
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:34.680]  moment they step into the country are illegally here have committed a crime
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:39.120]  into the Democratic Party and that's what's going on here and I've been
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:44.040]  saying on my radio program and I'm serious about this we need to lock
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:48.840]  every single individual that comes across the border up and put them in jail
[3:13:48.840 --> 3:13:54.200]  don't don't deport them for them to come back over put them in jail that's what
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:59.600]  I'm talking about because the reverse of that is they would rather us carry
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:07.080]  national ID cards in our own country so they can mark us so they can track us
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:12.600]  okay the government people that are here legally that were born here raised
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:17.720]  here like you and I carry these cards so they know exactly what we are what
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:21.800]  we're doing and God knows what else to be in our own country and that's
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:25.840]  ridiculous well I'm ready here Rob Redding that's a point I've made I'm glad
[3:14:25.840 --> 3:14:29.680]  you bring that up they have a hundred mile deep zone around the whole country
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:34.280]  with border patrol checkpoints where citizens the YouTube videos are famous
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:38.560]  pastor Anderson and others get beat up for asking questions black Hispanic white
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.520]  if you're a citizen you're a piece of trash we have all over the news where
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  illegals get let go for no driver's license no insurance drunk driving the
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:52.560]  judges just let them go the railroad serial killer killed a bunch of people
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:56.160]  continued to be released they're undocumented and then it's a bait and
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:15:01.680]  switch Bush's and now the Democratic Party of Obama's President Obama's
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:06.520]  legislation is the same thing citizens have to have an ID to work we're all
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.040]  tracked but then they're still gonna selectively leave all the illegals
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:15.360]  alone I mean I want to be a first-class citizen and and as a citizen I'm not I'm
[3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:19.880]  at the bottom of the totem pole why do you think that's going on I think it's
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:24.400]  going on because again they want to with in terms of identity politics with what
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:27.280]  we're seeing with the Democrats they're trying to bring these people into the
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:30.480]  fold and I don't understand it because I was having a conversation with someone
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:34.640]  who's fairly independent who said to me he said these guys are largely
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:40.120]  conservative on most issues the only issue that they even agree with the
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:43.080]  Democrats on is the fact that they should be able to break the law and stay in
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:46.600]  the country illegally these people have no allegiance to the Democratic Party so
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:49.800]  why are the Democrats clamoring to help them I'll tell you why because for the
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:55.480]  first time you know we saw Barack Obama gain a whole a lot of votes the
[3:15:55.480 --> 3:15:58.600]  Democrat gained a whole lot of votes from sectors that they hadn't gained
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:04.360]  votes from before that being one where many Latinos and Hispanics have been
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:07.840]  known to be a little lethargic about supporting the Democratic Party however
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:14.120]  now they are and so we're seeing them clamoring to to to to help them stay in
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:17.920]  the country illegally and that's just wrong it's wrong as hell if these people
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:21.320]  come into this country illegally they have committed a crime they should be
[3:16:21.320 --> 3:16:24.960]  held accountable just like everybody else brothers in the hood are getting
[3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:29.240]  locked up for less so if that's the case then if you come across the border
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:35.520]  illegally you have to be sent to jail forget that forget deporting them put
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:38.800]  them in jail and people say we don't have enough jail space of course we don't
[3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:43.320]  five make tense cities because my goal is to make them run right back across the
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:46.760]  border instead of running running over here to this country don't run back
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:51.120]  across we start I mean here's the issue if somebody came from China or Japan or
[3:16:51.120 --> 3:16:56.680]  Europe that's thousands of miles away and we don't have a history of wars with
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:01.440]  those countries so many of these illegal aliens that are up here right now are
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:05.380]  trying to intimidate Hispanic Americans to join their race movement their
[3:17:05.380 --> 3:17:09.680]  la raza their matcha movement I've had Hispanic caller after caller call in
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:12.200]  we're gonna go to some more of those folks here in a moment I've won got the
[3:17:12.200 --> 3:17:15.720]  disagree so he'll go to the head of a line the first caller and three shows
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:19.720]  I've done on this who actually disagree so so please stay there Gilbert I believe
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:26.000]  is the name yes it's Gilbert but think about this and the news hid this but I
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:30.280]  finally saw it in one local NBC news story out of San Francisco over the
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:35.000]  weekend of the five kids at that school sent home for wearing American flag
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:40.580]  shirts three of them were Hispanic and it turned out that two of them just so
[3:17:40.580 --> 3:17:44.080]  happened to be wearing shirts that had American flags I mean we've all got those
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:47.000]  they sell them everywhere they're you know they're at Old Navy they're like
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:50.800]  five bucks my little kids have got them we wear them on the fourth of July I mean
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:54.480]  I don't mean to threaten anybody when I put out a picnic table that's got red
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:58.080]  white and blue and for the July to eat barbecue I mean I'm not evil here and
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:02.920]  it was so threatening to the illegal group that was in that school that they
[3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:06.160]  demanded they be thrown out of school and they were thrown out of school that's
[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:11.960]  the issue is that so many of these people coming in you know really don't
[3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:16.720]  like the United States because Mexico lost that that war and you're right and
[3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:20.320]  it doesn't you know what and Alex you shouldn't have to sit up there and and
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:24.360]  say what race they are what ethnicity or whatever because it doesn't make a
[3:18:24.360 --> 3:18:28.800]  difference I go by America's independent voice look this country has sin it's
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:34.120]  fallen short but it needs to be held accountable for striving to be the
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:38.240]  great land and nation that it should be and so that that's why some America's
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:41.080]  independent voice yes I know about slavery yes I know about civil rights
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:44.280]  yes I know about Jim Crow and all of that we overcame all of that stuff and
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:48.440]  we're still overcoming but the point is is this they're American citizens they're
[3:18:48.440 --> 3:18:53.920]  entitled to wear the flag if they so choose and and when do people that come
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:57.880]  here illegally who have committed a crime see that's what people forget people
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:19:01.800]  want to say all illegals are criminals I'm not saying that just because people
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:04.640]  want to say that they come here committing crimes I'm saying by the act of
[3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:08.680]  coming here without documentation you are an illegal citizen so when do you
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:12.960]  dictate to me the American citizen what I can wear when I can wear it and how
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:19.200]  long I can wear that's preposterous it's incredible and it just gets worse and
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:22.200]  worse I want to go to Gilbert who disagrees Chris and Paul because they've
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:25.560]  been holding for a long time when we come back in this next short segment we're
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:28.600]  going to continue with our guests but you'll get a chance to not just talk to
[3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:33.800]  Alex Jones but Rob Redding of ReadingNewsReview.com excellent syndicated
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:39.280]  broadcast I suggest our affiliates out there look at picking it up great radio

[3:19:47.520 --> 3:19:51.080]  want to have a chance to read over it a few times but it's a pretty positive
[3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:55.880]  report it's an insider publication for those that don't know and Dr. Laura went

[3:20:36.680 --> 3:20:40.200]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:44.240]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's

[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:28.880]  scheme our country ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an
[3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:32.280]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also

[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:10.760]  Rob Redding is our guest and kid radio host let's talk to Gilbert in Texas he
[3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:19.000]  says he disagrees Gilbert go ahead sir Gilbert in Texas go ahead yeah I think
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:23.200]  I wanted to say that this is a little overblown I think the movies terrific I
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:27.880]  think it's a fictional movie and I think people know to distinguish between
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:32.240]  fiction and reality and that we're not that stupid to go out there and do
[3:24:32.240 --> 3:24:37.520]  exactly what the movie what a movie tells us to do or implies us to do and
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:41.440]  Gilbert Gilbert Fox put out the trailer and they said this is a message to
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:45.520]  Arizona and then it cuts to people with sniper rifles at politicians shot at the
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:49.600]  Capitol and it has white people running around like a bunch of races killing
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:53.960]  Hispanics the point is is that this is taxpayer funded we've now discovered as
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:59.160]  well well let me tell you I'm as a supporter of the event of immigrants and
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:02.800]  I'm not for open borders but as a supporter of immigrants because I was a
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:07.000]  former teacher that I've worked with that with immigrants myself and they're
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:11.120]  fine people the majority of them are all fine people and right now I know an
[3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:15.120]  illegal immigrant myself that it that has been here all his life his parents
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:18.560]  were too irresponsible to get on his papers so now that he's married with
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:22.040]  kids here you have to go all the way to Mexico and spend a couple of the years
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:26.040]  or whatever I don't know how long and leave his family here which is something
[3:25:26.040 --> 3:25:29.480]  that's out of his out of the question sir if we just let everybody in the
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:32.760]  country if we didn't have this big welfare system it might work the
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:36.640]  country is going bankrupt have you seen California laying all these people off
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:41.000]  totally falling apart but the immigrants are the hardest-working segment of the
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.560]  population look at every kitchen look at every street look at every construction
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:48.000]  like the hardest work is being done by the end let me get a comment from Rob
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:52.440]  Redding on this Rob kind of weed are you smoking I don't understand I mean if you
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:56.160]  say the immigrants are the hardest-working population they are taking jobs away from
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:25:59.880]  individuals that were already in line even people that immigrated legally I
[3:25:59.880 --> 3:26:03.400]  have tons of people they call into my show that immigrated here legally they
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:09.120]  say these folks are jumping in front of us and and unemploying us they came here
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:14.560]  legally well let me tell you something you can make the case for Walmart and
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:19.000]  any any good corporation over competing for jobs and taking away jobs for my
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:23.040]  and businesses from everyone you can make that case don't change the issue
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:28.360]  you're the one saying that immigrants are good for America I'm not saying
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:31.600]  immigrants are bad I'm saying illegals are bad and as far as your friend goes
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:35.280]  it's not our fault that he's illegally here his parents should have done what
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:39.640]  they should have done it in taking care of that paperwork so I you know what I'm
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:43.680]  crying no tears here but this guy having to go back and handle his business
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:47.880]  well that's an opinion of this is not a fact I think let me let me expand on this
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:53.120]  sir are you denying that they have 800 plus sanctuary cities where citizens
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:58.080]  are arrested for drunk driving and and not having insurance and ticketed but
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:02.840]  illegals aren't you know that's the truth let me tell you the problem is that
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:06.440]  is the government it isn't the people that are that the immigrants they didn't
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:11.640]  make that law what do you mean Vicente Fox came to Austin came to Austin and
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:17.440]  gave money five years ago and gave awards to the state to the city and to
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:23.280]  Wells Fargo for for allowing them to have rights that citizens don't have sir
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:26.680]  look listen what about all the illegals that are running around saying this is
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:31.640]  Mexico Spain had it France had it Russia had California I mean they don't say
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:37.040]  they have a claim I mean it was the United States Mexico attacked troops in
[3:27:37.040 --> 3:27:41.600]  Oklahoma that's why the US Marines and Army went down there and took over
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:45.760]  Mexico City and they didn't take that they paid Mexico for what was here I
[3:27:45.760 --> 3:27:50.040]  mean I mean it's I mean I mean if look let's just say this is really Mexico
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:55.880]  why would people want to turn this into Mexico look at what's happened in Mexico
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:28:01.200]  Gilbert people you know who cares about what those people say you know that's
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:05.240]  just a small portion of the population I mean I'm I'm like I'm a Latino and I
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:08.680]  don't say that I don't care who owns this country as long as I'm free and then I
[3:28:08.680 --> 3:28:12.320]  could do whatever I want who cares what any who cares with a minute man well you
[3:28:12.320 --> 3:28:15.280]  say you think it's a great hold on you think it's a great movie have you seen
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:19.160]  machete I've seen the trailer it looks terrific and I've seen his other movies
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:22.800]  and they're absolutely entertaining so I'm gonna I'm looking forward to see it
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:27.760]  Gilbert are you here legally no but if I wasn't I would be proud to be here
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:31.360]  legally because there's nothing wrong with looking for liberty any human being
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:35.040]  that looks for liberty power to them I don't think liberty should be only allowed
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:38.800]  you can't just say that liberty sir you can't take liberty hostage and that's
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:46.600]  what these people are doing well you know so well I'm not gonna let some
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:51.920]  illegals hijack liberty sir I'm not gonna do it and you know what I'm not gonna
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:55.760]  stay in a country where I'm a slave an economic slave I'm not gonna stay in
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:29:00.360]  a country where I might get killed and and I'm not gonna killing you no one's
[3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:04.680]  in slaving you talking about Mexico oh I'm talking about Mexico okay and I
[3:29:04.680 --> 3:29:08.080]  would state that any time and I don't care what anybody says and you know what
[3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:12.360]  I'm a supporter of the 9-11 movement I'm a supporter of a false flag I believe
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:15.080]  the country that the government does false like but you know what I can't
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:19.080]  disagree more with you guys on this issue and I think I have a right to you
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:23.640]  sir sir sir we everything sir we just had you on here we went to you first I
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:27.760]  mean my whole issue is there's 600 million people in Latin America there's
[3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:31.560]  over 6 billion globally that all want to come here we can't have 6 billion
[3:29:31.560 --> 3:29:37.480]  people here and we're the most open country in the world I mean Mexico has
[3:29:37.480 --> 3:29:41.680]  their most draconian border control after North Korea they admit that they
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:45.560]  grab Guatemalan immigrants and treat you know in Mexico they treat natives
[3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:49.320]  horribly I'm just sick of Mexico telling America how bad it is Rob Redding's our

[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:18.440]  you on this subject but this is the perfect divide and conquer for the Ford
[3:33:18.440 --> 3:33:23.080]  Foundation and the government where you bring in tens of millions of people and
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:27.600]  they just say look I'll come here if I want people come here there's ads in the
[3:33:27.600 --> 3:33:31.160]  newspaper in Mexico this has been in the news saying come here when your water
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:34.960]  breaks have your baby you can stay you all go on welfare the babies paid for
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:39.280]  they're telling teachers and highway patrol people they've got to work five
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:42.600]  days a week and be paid for four they're laying off half the cops in many
[3:33:42.600 --> 3:33:47.040]  towns in Ohio California you name it everything's collapsing the nation's
[3:33:47.040 --> 3:33:53.640]  bankrupt and kids wear American flags in school and have to leave because it's
[3:33:53.640 --> 3:33:58.320]  upsetting and then he says oh no that's not the view and I think this movie
[3:33:58.320 --> 3:34:02.480]  machete is wonderful when I've got the script and it is off the charts
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:07.920]  horrible mr. Redding I break this down for us your view on it I think that what
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:12.120]  we're seeing here is exactly what you you just said that this is a tragedy in
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:16.760]  motion and their people that are racing toward the flames Al Sharpton Jesse
[3:34:16.760 --> 3:34:20.760]  Jackson what we're seeing in terms and the only reason why I'm thinking clearly
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:23.640]  here is because I'm an independent almost a political party plantation not
[3:34:23.640 --> 3:34:26.840]  Republican I'm not a Democrat I'm not even a partisan independent I'm a
[3:34:26.840 --> 3:34:31.440]  non-conformist independent I can see this for what it is I don't care about
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:34.080]  the Republicans getting more votes I don't care about the Democrats getting
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:37.680]  more votes of libertarians or anyone else I'm not aligning with any right
[3:34:37.680 --> 3:34:42.880]  left-center coalition on this thing either for against I am going rogue here
[3:34:42.880 --> 3:34:47.480]  I guess for a better way to put it and just saying look this is wrong to have
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:51.000]  these people imported as the quote-unquote new slaves within this
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:54.960]  whole economic structure that these people are trying to build here and we
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:59.720]  see it being built before our eyes on their backs and unemploying people that
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:03.560]  have been in line first that are American citizens and not lock these
[3:35:03.560 --> 3:35:10.120]  people up is dead wrong it is Robin is dead wrong let's go ahead and talk to
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:16.120]  Chris in Texas we just talked to Chris who's up next John Chris in Texas is we
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:20.120]  had an earlier Chris Chris go ahead hey Alex I want to thank you man first time
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:25.400]  caller long-time listener I am just blown away now right furious I mean from
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:30.640]  this Robert Regis film I once and I will say used to be a fan to his I enjoyed
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:35.400]  some of his earlier shows but as a Hispanic American you know as a Hispanic
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:40.240]  in America I literally just have to step down from that and just say it's not
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:45.200]  right I mean as Hispanics you know that live here in America people had they
[3:35:45.200 --> 3:35:49.120]  have to and I'm talking about them specifically have to sit back and say
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:54.040]  listen we're his we're we're Americans first we were born here we had loved
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:59.840]  ones and family members die and wars in this country to give us the right to
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:04.400]  live here and to sit there and join arms with groups that believe in this I've
[3:36:04.400 --> 3:36:09.160]  slown this Mexico rising it's it's ludicrous and it's a slap in the face
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:13.560]  of everybody who's fought whether you were Hispanic and Mexico's not rising
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:19.680]  it's not the example I mean you never had a 1776 I mean I wish I you know we
[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:24.760]  I have you seen the video of that communist school teacher saying look
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:28.080]  these racist white people don't really dislike us because we're brown they
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:31.240]  don't like us because we're communist and well that's actually true
[3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:34.680]  imagine having a bunch of foreigners saying we love communism and let me
[3:36:34.680 --> 3:36:37.800]  tell you that's a big percentage of these people because the universities and
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:42.240]  schools teach it I mean I mean I'm not for turning my guns in and most of these
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:46.200]  immigrant groups when they vote they end up voting for big government and gun
[3:36:46.200 --> 3:36:50.760]  control and so of course I've and then Robert Rodriguez is making a movie where
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:55.720]  these pro-gun militias are the bad guys there aren't militias out murdering
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:37:02.040]  people at the border it's made up he demonizes it Alex what Robert Rodriguez
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:05.920]  and people in Hispanics don't understand is they are going to demonize good tax
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.320]  paying voting Hispanics that live in America that you know like myself who
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:13.360]  married a white woman who's having a child you know what there's nothing
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:17.040]  wrong with embracing your your heritage and your ancestors but there's
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:20.800]  something wrong with not embracing who you are as an American having and having
[3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:24.400]  the pride in what you are my son will speak Spanish but he will learn
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:28.360]  American first your learning was first you know our son will embrace that but
[3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:31.480]  but you know Alex when I saw that that teacher that college teacher sitting
[3:37:31.480 --> 3:37:35.520]  there talking that hate that communist that's socialistic it broke my heart as
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:39.720]  an Hispanic because right then and there when people see this they're just too
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:44.520]  ignorant and dumbed at that to sit Chris that's why I saw this on single to
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:48.280]  mile last week I was going to play it but I was like man I don't want to give
[3:37:48.280 --> 3:37:52.240]  into the division because even countering it may cause that and I was
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:37:54.760]  thinking about not even covering it because there's so much other stuff to
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:37:59.840]  cover and then I got contacted by two Hispanic members of Rodriguez's crew
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:05.800]  saying look have you seen the trailer it's worse than that and then I got the
[3:38:05.800 --> 3:38:13.080]  script and I can't even when you read this script I mean it is just and I
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:15.600]  don't want to spoil the whole film so I'm not gonna release the whole script
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:19.240]  and it is it is a free speech issue and I could probably release it but I'm not
[3:38:19.240 --> 3:38:23.440]  going to we've shown certain sections of it so we can prove what we're saying I
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:27.480]  can't believe it and I appreciate your call Chris comments on that Rob Redding
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:33.280]  well I haven't seen the Rodriguez movie or trailer so I'm kind of jumping in on
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:38.440]  this but I can say this that that you know it to demonize groups that carry
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:42.800]  guns in and say that they're a supremacist or what have you is an
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:50.160]  overgeneralization I have never been for gun control in this in this country I
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:53.680]  believe that we should have the right to carry we should defend our country and
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:57.800]  those things are important but I just to blatantly say that these groups
[3:38:57.800 --> 3:39:01.960]  automatically oppose you because of your race is wrong lots of people stand on
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:05.200]  principle here I stand on principle of the fact that you have to do it the
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:09.680]  right way yes there's a process it takes a while but if you want to truly get in
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:12.840]  this country you can't but you cannot come in breaking laws and we cannot
[3:39:12.840 --> 3:39:17.920]  condone the porous borders that we're seeing well plus we're being told we've
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:21.040]  got to give all our rights up as terrorists are gonna kill us and then
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:24.880]  the borders basically wide open and they use illegal alien labor to build the
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:28.440]  50 miles of the 200 mile fence they never finished I mean it's a joke let's
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:33.200]  talk to Paul in Texas you're on the air with Rob Redding go ahead oh Alex
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:39.680]  like I've been listening to you concerning this Robert Rodriguez like movie
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:45.120]  and like you have to keep in mind that keys up there with Tarantino you know
[3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:50.480]  it's just ridiculous and absurd you know like I understand how it just comes in
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:55.000]  at exactly the right time you know to incite people but for the most part
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:59.120]  people will not replicate this you know it would be like people going around
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:03.880]  after watching American history acts and committing the same acts of violence
[3:40:03.880 --> 3:40:07.800]  that they see there you know now it's different in American history acts the
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:13.240]  white supremacist is the bad guy okay this isn't done that way whites are
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:18.720]  attacking churches crucifying Catholic priest trying to murder Hispanic
[3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:22.680]  children murdering Hispanics in cold blood they shoot it at the Capitol they
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:28.280]  put out a trailer saying you know this is a message to Arizona that's why Fox has
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:32.160]  now pulled the trailer they realized that that was then mixed in with reality
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:37.160]  and believe me it once you see this movie when it comes out because I haven't
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:42.240]  seen the film but I've got the the script which is the film this is not
[3:40:42.240 --> 3:40:45.400]  like a black exploitation film or something that you know has a little
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:50.040]  bit of this in it and this is free speech so he can do this my only issue is
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:53.760]  I'm constantly hearing how tea parties are all racist and they want to kill
[3:40:53.760 --> 3:40:58.040]  everybody and 99% of that's made up in a line okay and if you're against
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:00.800]  government health care you're racist or if you're against the bank or bailout
[3:41:00.800 --> 3:41:04.720]  you're racist when it hasn't when that's injecting the racial issue look I'm a
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:09.200]  36 year old white guy okay I grew up in Dallas Texas I will assure you I
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:14.520]  hardly ever heard anything racial nothing from my parents nothing dear
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:19.960]  hunting with rednecks nothing from anybody and I mean the only I mean the
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:22.560]  only time I heard it was from other groups and it was man like a joke you
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:28.920]  know to me so so I I don't understand it because because believe me all I ever
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:32.920]  hear about is how white people have this big secret you know operation of
[3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:36.640]  racism and yeah there's some toothless Klan members out there running around and
[3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:40.240]  half the time you do the research it's federally funded like out how Turner was
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:42.680]  always attacking me I don't even know what to say but I appreciate your call
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:47.920]  comments on that rob running well there definitely exist in America racism and
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:52.800]  that that's definitely an issue people that say that the tea party movement is
[3:41:52.800 --> 3:41:56.280]  all racial obviously it's an overgeneralization however let me just
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:00.760]  say I was at a tea party gathering where they were protesting on tax day in
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:05.480]  Seattle and I felt like I was at a clan rally I'm not going to lie I felt very
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:09.040]  uncomfortable there were there were black people there but they were watching
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:13.520]  on the outskirts I decided to go in and mingle with the crowd it's just that the
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:17.280]  number of white people that were seeing that opposed the president it was it's
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:20.880]  that it's the signs that were that some of the signs that they were carrying on
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:26.560]  Barack Obama felt clan like so I mean it's it's easy it makes it easy for the
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:29.760]  Democrats because remember I'm not one I'm an independent it makes it easy for
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:32.680]  the Democrats to turn these people and say you know what all of these people
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:37.040]  were racist but isn't that also a self-fulfilling prophecy that from day
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:41.040]  one the media said it was racist and so black people then don't feel comfortable
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:48.480]  going might be I mean I that's why I made it a point to go into the rally and
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:52.880]  to see for myself how it would be received no one spoke to me no one said
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:56.520]  hello I said hello to several people some people just looked at me like you're
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:43:00.400]  out of place what are you doing well that's bad news I hadn't seen much
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:03.960]  evidence of that but certainly there's a lot of different variants of tea party
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:07.360]  there's Republican tea party nation there's the Ron Paul type tea parties
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:12.200]  that I sure you black folks are welcome at and look I have no doubt that there
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:15.920]  is you know racism in some areas the Republican Party and there are white
[3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:20.400]  people out there that are racist I mean I'll be honest I like Northerners but
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:24.960]  I've been up to New York in places a lot and that that's when I really first in
[3:43:24.960 --> 3:43:29.520]  my life heard racial politics and maybe it's because everybody's heard it in
[3:43:29.520 --> 3:43:34.080]  together in a big compact city but I did hear some of it you know over the
[3:43:34.080 --> 3:43:38.520]  years you know just just just randomly in places like that but that is
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:42.440]  certainly not good news there so it's just further division then it is further
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:46.320]  division I mean look it does exist some of it's being overplayed by these
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:49.680]  political parties and that's exactly what we're seeing here on the immigration
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:55.360]  issue so I think that you know again some of it in terms of tea parties and in
[3:43:55.360 --> 3:43:58.720]  terms of what we're seeing in terms of opposition to the president I have a
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:03.240]  concern though I will say about a Barack Obama being called a socialist
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:06.840]  every charismatic black guy that we see that comes into power and I've been
[3:44:06.840 --> 3:44:10.080]  saying this over and over again that comes in the power you can look at
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:14.760]  Martin Luther King Malcolm X they were all called socialist so people say well
[3:44:14.760 --> 3:44:18.000]  that completely absolves me of being racist I just believe Barack Obama's
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:21.400]  socialist we're all Democrats under that description are socialists because
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:24.840]  Hillary Clinton will be doing the same thing you have to call Hillary a
[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:29.040]  socialist too I mean I mean I mean look how big the government's getting look
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:33.320]  but it's more like fascism because it's all going to the banks but he's
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:37.120]  continued that that that destructive fascist policy that we've seen from
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:42.080]  George Bush and I and that's you can attack Barack Obama on sheer policy you
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:45.840]  don't have the name call you can just say the fact that only 1% of the
[3:44:45.840 --> 3:44:50.480]  stimulus has gone to to black ferns when 5% exist out there you can say he lied
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:53.160]  to the black farmers and be completely right and say why are you guys
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:56.360]  supporting this guy I mean he's supposed to be black like you but he doesn't act
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:44:59.920]  like you the whole point is he's not he's not catching quote-unquote you're
[3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:03.000]  back here and he's not speaking to the issues that you're concerned about he
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:05.920]  says he's not going to do anything about black unemployment he says he's not
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:09.200]  he's not particularly concerned he says this these are the new highs that we're
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:12.280]  saying we shouldn't be too concerned in terms of unemployment altogether in
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:15.960]  general the point is is that the guy's not doing what he said he was going to do
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:19.200]  and that's where you nail him you don't have to nail him and say he's a
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:23.320]  socialist you don't have to nail him a name call or or to paint him as some
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:28.480]  jigaboo on a on a big poster you all you have to do is say he is not doing what
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:31.480]  he said he was going to do and he's continuing to give money to corporate
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:37.440]  crooks just like George Bush did well that's my issue is Republicans who like
[3:45:37.440 --> 3:45:41.720]  George Bush should love Obama continuing the Patriot Act secret torture new
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:46.640]  wars banker bailouts the insurance companies wrote the health care plan I've
[3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:51.120]  pointed out it's not really socialism it's just piracy right it's it's it's
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:55.200]  robbery but you know the Republican Party loves to play that thing they're
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:45:58.360]  fighting socialism and they're against big government when we see the
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:02.280]  government grow just as fast under Republicans so I I agree with you there
[3:46:02.280 --> 3:46:06.880]  I haven't egic ambiguity that's what it is strategic ambiguity that's a good
[3:46:06.880 --> 3:46:11.160]  term yeah we never really get a nail down that's right because if you just say
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:14.480]  he's a socialist they get on this whole big bandwagon therefore you put them
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:18.840]  right back into that Republican tent and that's when you've got them and they're
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:23.240]  going again in the Republican sphere and putting another Republican office so
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:26.160]  they can continue this farce that we're seeing over and over again it's just
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:29.760]  recycling good point Ivan in Texas you're on the air with Rob Redding go
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:36.080]  ahead thank you yeah I woke up a long time ago back in
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:40.000]  high school I stopped believing in the whole Republican Democrat thing and I
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.680]  realized that it was what it was really all about just a Galilean system it's the
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:47.480]  state of supreme and the individual really has no right the individual only
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:53.080]  exists and they only let you exist in your group and then your group's got a
[3:46:53.080 --> 3:46:57.840]  government anointed leader who gets the airtime who gets put on the news and then
[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:01.520]  that leader makes it all about your group it's that about your rights as a
[3:47:01.520 --> 3:47:07.160]  human yeah exactly it's collectivism and all I want to say I basically called
[3:47:07.160 --> 3:47:11.160]  because that the color you had on earlier he said that all the people you
[3:47:11.160 --> 3:47:15.560]  see working are all Mexicans well the only reason that is because they're
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:18.720]  willing to settle for lower wages as more of them come in and take up more of
[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:22.280]  the jobs it's going to lower wages for everybody and you know they keep going
[3:47:22.280 --> 3:47:25.440]  away it's going eventually the economy is going to collapse everybody's going
[3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:28.960]  to be poor and that's the reason why Americans are trying to we're trying to
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:31.640]  fix our country which is what the Mexicans should be doing they should be
[3:47:31.640 --> 3:47:35.080]  going back to Mexico and fix that well that's another issue the US is used as
[3:47:35.080 --> 3:47:39.920]  a steam valve for revolution for crime Mexico needs to become free if it was
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:44.360]  given a true private property free market system it would be just as wealthy
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:48.960]  as the United States perhaps more so and you know that's the issue is they want
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:52.560]  to get out of Mexico they want to say this is Mexico but then they don't want
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:56.120]  to embrace America a lot of them and you know that guy said well I'm all for
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:00.760]  America but you know he thinks the film machetes great but he hadn't seen the
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:05.320]  film well I've read the script and I've talked to filmmakers that have seen the
[3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:11.600]  film now and I have you know it's worse than I can even describe comments on
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:16.280]  what Ivan was just saying mr. Redding well I agree with him and I agree with
[3:48:16.280 --> 3:48:20.040]  you again you know it's disturbing anytime you have anybody that's trying
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:23.760]  to stoke emotion stoke fear and that's what it sounds like this movie is
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:29.400]  doing there are enough issues that are real true race issues in this in this
[3:48:29.400 --> 3:48:33.000]  country that we should be concerned about I don't believe people being here
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:36.600]  illegally and defending quote-unquote their rights when they have none under
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:40.200]  our Constitution how could they they're not here illegally we should be
[3:48:40.200 --> 3:48:45.600]  concerned about them absolutely very well said I mean it's simple I mean it's
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:49.680]  like special rights for these people yeah it's someone said to me the other
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:53.120]  day the Constitution said I was like why are you talking about the Constitution
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:57.760]  these folks don't fall under it they're not American citizens meanwhile the
[3:48:57.760 --> 3:49:01.320]  Congress is trying to take the rights of citizens if they think you might be a
[3:49:01.320 --> 3:49:05.160]  terrorist you don't get a new process it can be disappeared but nobody's worried
[3:49:05.160 --> 3:49:09.000]  about that or naked body scanners for all Americans whether you're you know
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:11.520]  babies or whatever color they are they're gonna be put their naked body
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:15.720]  scanners yeah this is ridiculous this that's hold the scanning and watching
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:20.920]  individuals and being able to see their entire body what's under their clothing
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:24.200]  it's lewd it's it's and they're talking about when nobody's gonna see these
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:28.440]  images well they are going to see these images and they can archive these images
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:30.960]  they're lying through their teeth and I don't know who they think they're
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:33.760]  fooling and that's why you were the most dangerous voices in America that's
[3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:37.960]  reason why I put you on KMLB because you're telling the truth Alex and I'm
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:41.880]  telling you people are starting to wake up keep doing what you're doing you're
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:45.440]  gonna see more stations at your show well thank you God bless you let's go
[3:49:45.440 --> 3:49:48.720]  ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin you're on the air with Rob Rudd and go
[3:49:48.720 --> 3:49:53.760]  ahead hi how you doing I'm raking in Bush are you know when they were in
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:59.120]  office they had some rich friends on Walmart big corporations big factories
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:03.600]  they wanted Mexican labor oh yeah that happened and then let me tell you
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:08.080]  something our power our politicians have sold us out of the country as the
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:13.600]  people for the less agreed to set up by their selfish power lust to rule and
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:18.120]  control the earth our forefathers sacrificed our liability and our
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:24.160]  freedom was in vain due because of these monsters that are the Bilderbergs and
[3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:30.000]  the politicians who obey them the president the politicians do not want

[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:31.400]  today syndicated radio broadcaster look when I saw the machete trailer when I
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:35.040]  see these students getting up and professors saying aha we're gonna get
[3:54:35.040 --> 3:54:39.440]  the gringos there's scum I know that's not the majority of Hispanics listen to
[3:54:39.440 --> 3:54:44.720]  all the Hispanic callers I go have events here in Austin or places or LA and
[3:54:44.720 --> 3:54:48.840]  half the people are Hispanic right I mean I don't want to be fighting with
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:53.160]  people I'm sick of it and and and you know the Democratic Party was for
[3:54:53.160 --> 3:54:55.680]  slavery at the time it was there then they were the party that fought it and
[3:54:55.680 --> 3:55:00.720]  that's good later you know segregation and all that and now most the time
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:04.560]  they're just invoking it politically to go after their enemies but so are the
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:10.520]  Republicans with you know ads they run about convicts and things Rob do you see
[3:55:10.520 --> 3:55:14.440]  us coming out of this or do you see getting worse I I see us cut well first
[3:55:14.440 --> 3:55:19.080]  of all I Barack Obama scared the hell out of me and he still does and and when
[3:55:19.080 --> 3:55:24.280]  when he was elected people said oh great you know because people had already
[3:55:24.280 --> 3:55:28.000]  started to get so disillusioned with George Bush and government I thought
[3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:32.680]  that was a great thing not government but politics and partisans and I talk
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:37.080]  about this in my book hired hatred the point is this when I saw Barack Obama
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:42.040]  this charismatic black guy come up through the ranks I was completely
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:45.440]  infuriated and the reason why it's because he's been able to corral people
[3:55:45.440 --> 3:55:50.240]  back into identity politics back into the Democratic fold and it starts all
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:54.520]  over again I am looking for an implosion in political parties looking for the
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  fact that we need to get back to good government we need to understand what
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:01.960]  George Washington said a long time ago when he was the first president that
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:06.200]  political parties are divisive we divided ourselves within race we divided
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:13.920]  ourselves within family husband against wife son against son against a brother
[3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:18.000]  it's just one of those things what you know father against son it's one of
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:21.360]  those things we have to get back to good government and what Barack Obama has
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:26.480]  done is set us back and put us back under this tent and now we're starting to see
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:30.720]  a division where the Republicans are playing race politics against him it's
[3:56:30.720 --> 3:56:35.320]  just a it's an ongoing cycle so for us to answer the question to get out of this
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:40.120]  we have to have more shows like yours more shows like mine that expose these
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:45.080]  people for what they are they are playing us against each other and until we
[3:56:45.080 --> 3:56:49.560]  recognize that until we stop it will we ever come out of this we have to get
[3:56:49.560 --> 3:56:52.800]  back to good government we have to get back to policymaking and calling a
[3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:57.880]  spade a spade if these people are here illegally let's deal with that but let's
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:01.880]  not pat somebody on the back that's done wrong and say you're right you're
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:05.720]  wrong as hell the truth is the truth that's the one thing that I agree with
[3:57:05.720 --> 3:57:10.520]  you on you said over and over on this show I am for the truth and that's what
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:15.280]  I believe the same thing you do well I apologized all the other callers we
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:17.880]  don't have time to get to but Dan in Virginia and many others should be able
[3:57:17.880 --> 3:57:22.680]  to get back on live tomorrow on the Friday edition and we appreciate our
