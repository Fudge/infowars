[00:00.000 --> 00:12.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.840 --> 00:21.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.600 --> 00:28.080]  well this is gonna be a old-school broadcast for you today on this Tuesday
[00:28.080 --> 00:35.880]  25th day of February 2014 power is off to large sections of South Austin or
[00:35.880 --> 00:40.480]  our studio is based we have backup generators but I guess not enough of
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.320]  them to be able to run all the cameras the lights and the video streams we do
[00:44.320 --> 00:47.640]  have audio streams going to the satellites and the audio streams at
[00:47.640 --> 00:54.120]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and this only happens about once a year and
[00:54.120 --> 00:57.760]  usually when the power goes out we have enough backup power and batteries keep
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.640]  running but it's been out since about 7 a.m. this morning and so we exhausted
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.800]  the backup batteries and are on generator right now and I guess we need more
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.880]  generators is the answer because I didn't have to run the TV network all of it
[01:10.880 --> 01:16.160]  our websites are obviously hosted outside this facility but that is what
[01:16.160 --> 01:22.000]  is going on right now and it's almost like a shindig here at the office and
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.480]  most the equipment's not working and there's a still not powered a lot of
[01:26.480 --> 01:32.320]  different areas and so folks are kind of standing around the coffee cooler
[01:32.320 --> 01:38.120]  hell I might just take off and go play pool or something who knows no but
[01:38.120 --> 01:44.320]  seriously folks we are broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday edition and
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.280]  we had a lady that I was really excited about getting on because I remember
[01:48.280 --> 01:55.400]  interviewing her back in the late 90s Kathleen Wiley a world that daily's put
[01:55.400 --> 01:59.240]  out a new book target caught in the crosshairs of Bill and literally Clinton
[01:59.240 --> 02:03.080]  she was one of the women sexually assaulted by hair Clinton the male
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.040]  Clinton the goblin like Clinton and she was scheduled today but we're gonna do
[02:09.040 --> 02:16.000]  that tomorrow or the next day when when we're fully fully operational here at
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.840]  the old facility that said I mentioned this some yesterday but didn't make a
[02:20.840 --> 02:27.000]  big enough deal out of it because it really is an ultra massive issue and if
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.440]  you go up to places like drugreport.com the era of designer babies is here dad
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.520]  may join two moms for disease-free babies designer babies of course the
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.480]  argument is it's all genetic but a lot of it is you're predisposed genetically
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.880]  but then why are all these disorders and cancers up it's the chemicals the
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.560]  biologicals the radiologicals on record and all the studies that are triggering
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.520]  these gene disorders to manifest and so as we get more and more toxic in the
[02:57.520 --> 03:01.840]  environment from GMO and other things but on record sterilized 99% of guinea pigs
[03:01.840 --> 03:07.600]  after three generations does the same thing to humans and other mammals not
[03:07.600 --> 03:15.400]  just mammals but but but creatures with spinal columns period vertebrates but
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.400]  we're here looking in all this this is the end of humanity and then they
[03:19.400 --> 03:26.600]  toxify us and then we're unable to reproduce without artificial systems in
[03:26.600 --> 03:32.120]  the government-run healthcare system and they add the social engineering and the
[03:32.120 --> 03:35.120]  back door engineering just like they've done into smartphones computers smart
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.680]  meters you name it into our very genetics and that is the next level so you
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.120]  know it's funny I got up this morning and was mad at myself for not really
[03:44.120 --> 03:49.080]  getting into this in depth yesterday I mentioned it some and then I went up to
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.520]  Drudge and saw that that was the top story and so we're on the same page there
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.800]  this really is a big deal with the cloning and the GMO and all of it I
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.480]  want to talk about the future we face and what it's going to look like and what
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.320]  it's going to be like that come up today and we've canceled the guess we had so
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.680]  I'll also kind of do it C-span style where you can talk about Obamacare how
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.640]  you liking that you can talk about Ukraine we can talk about any of the
[04:14.640 --> 04:17.160]  big issues that are out there and have a discussion about where you see the
[04:17.160 --> 04:24.040]  future going so I'll open the phones up as well in the in the first hour
[04:24.040 --> 04:29.400]  actually and then as I start the second hour I'll do a breakdown on the
[04:29.400 --> 04:35.120]  situation with the designer babies FDA weighs risk of three-person embryo
[04:35.120 --> 04:40.280]  fertilization that's all coming up today I'll give the number out when we come
[04:40.280 --> 04:45.000]  back on the other side of this quick break but again I'm coming to you from
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.040]  near darkness with one little light bulb in here in the broadcast studio great
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.880]  job the crew keeping us up and running so our backup systems at least got us on
[04:52.880 --> 04:58.160]  the minimum which is radio which is about 90% of our audience will be right
[04:58.160 --> 05:01.680]  back sorry to prison planet our TV members on video the globalist social
[05:01.680 --> 05:05.720]  engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they are manipulating our
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.520]  genetics we are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower
[05:10.520 --> 05:14.800]  our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.960]  after consulting top doctors nutritionist pharmacist and others we have

[08:06.480 --> 08:08.920]  network
[08:10.240 --> 08:18.280]  well this is a old-school style radio broadcast today we're not simulcasting
[08:18.280 --> 08:23.200]  video for folks watching on prisonplanet.tv because there's been a sustained
[08:23.200 --> 08:29.240]  power outage today in South Austin where our studios are located so we're on
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.520]  generator backup power right now broadcasting across the planet but the
[08:33.520 --> 08:40.080]  main heart of the transmission is and has always been radio so we are here
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.480]  ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday the 25th day
[08:45.480 --> 08:53.360]  already of February 2014 I am rescheduling Kathleen Wiley who was
[08:53.360 --> 08:57.960]  sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and he settled with her target caught in
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.200]  the crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton I am rescheduling her because I
[09:03.200 --> 09:07.560]  want to be able to have the full production when she does join us so
[09:07.560 --> 09:14.320]  we're gonna have open phones today this is going to be C-span style radio where
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.120]  I'm gonna take a lot of your phone calls oh and by the way John Harmon I don't
[09:18.120 --> 09:22.080]  even have computers in here so what you're gonna be doing is you're going
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.640]  to be texting to my globalist tracking Trojan horse surveillance system iPhone
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.960]  you're gonna be texting me the callers to that so that'll be a good way for me
[09:35.960 --> 09:39.920]  to be able to take the calls you know I've got a lot of remotes over the years
[09:39.920 --> 09:47.400]  from the Grand Canyon to rodeos and car shows and golf ranges so in shooting
[09:47.400 --> 09:53.000]  ranges so this is really no big deal I am here basically doing a remote from
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.600]  Austin Texas with one light bulb on above my head and I do have some wireless
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.040]  iPads and things I'm able to scan the news as it unfolds and as it develops so
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.640]  that is what we are doing here today just letting you know why there are no
[10:08.640 --> 10:14.120]  video feeds at prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com for a show we have the
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.920]  free feeds now there is so much obviously to cover today but in the
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.000]  interest of shaking up the transmission I am gonna just mention some of the
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.440]  headlines and then I'm going to give the phone number out to everyone it's
[10:27.440 --> 10:34.000]  800-259-9231 you can talk about any subject you can be a long-time caller
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.400]  first-time caller all I ask is that you be awake because we don't screen your
[10:37.400 --> 10:41.680]  calls so we get some bad calls we get some really good ones too and all I ask
[10:41.680 --> 10:46.680]  is that you not be drunk and all I ask is that you have your point that you make
[10:46.680 --> 10:50.240]  and that we move to the next person you can call in and agree with me you can
[10:50.240 --> 10:53.920]  call in and disagree if you've got a beef you can call in and tell me how much
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.440]  you want to beat me up that's usually what some people want to call in about I
[10:58.440 --> 11:01.840]  want to hear what you think about the Ukraine situation now with Russia
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.680]  sending troops in to an area of the Ukraine Crimea and Russian general
[11:08.680 --> 11:12.160]  saying that they're facing an information war in an attempt to break up
[11:12.160 --> 11:15.320]  countries on their border that's definitely what's happening we've got
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.520]  other articles here were Soros group triples its lobbying spending here in
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.320]  the United States and worldwide his open society foundations that are
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.840]  overthrowing countries and funding the Arab Spring and funding just every
[11:26.840 --> 11:30.360]  nasty organization of the Sun it's not like the Russians are great either but
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.840]  I mean George Soros the guy that wants our guns is the one funding a lot of
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.160]  Ukrainian opposition that's in the Washington Post today and it dovetails
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.160]  with this article out of the Washington Times with the headline Obama proposes
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.360]  IRS rules to limit tax exempt status so they're gonna restrict basically
[11:48.360 --> 11:52.600]  anybody who isn't a communist but George Soros can run around with his
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.680]  billions of dollars and do anti-gun initiatives anti-free speech initiatives
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.920]  and be a well-known Nazi collaborator that's cool he gets ADL awards because
[12:00.920 --> 12:05.520]  of that and we criticize Nazis so we get ADL attack pieces that's just that's
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.040]  just how it works when when the globalists are running things also I
[12:11.040 --> 12:13.840]  mentioned this yesterday but I really want to spend a lot of time on it in the
[12:13.840 --> 12:18.160]  second hour I want to talk about the globalist master plan to radically
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.560]  transform humans to where we can't even reproduce and to basically build Trojan
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.520]  horses into our genetics to totally control us in a brave new world just as
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.440]  they've done with the smartphones the smart meters the smart refrigerators the
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.080]  smart appliances as total control grids to track trace and dominate society we
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.320]  as a human species need to wake up to this and say no to it we've also got a
[12:43.320 --> 12:50.800]  lot of NSA news Bitcoin exchange MT gox disappears in blow to virtual currency
[12:50.800 --> 12:56.160]  that is in Reuters and another report here the virtual currencies value
[12:56.160 --> 12:59.600]  plummets after hundreds of thousands of bitcoins are apparently stolen in
[12:59.600 --> 13:06.600]  cyber attack I mean Bitcoin ladies and gentlemen is a giant fraud is a giant
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.240]  scam and I've been warning people up front if you want to get involved in a
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.000]  bubble and ride it up and get out at the right time that's your issue I don't do
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.960]  stuff like that I don't invest in the stock market even though I know how to do
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.240]  it and have done some tests and been successful before because fundamentally
[13:23.240 --> 13:26.880]  it's a fraud we need to build real economies and I'm not judging if you
[13:26.880 --> 13:31.200]  got involved in Bitcoin but don't be mad at me when they start trying to arrest
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.760]  people that have been involved in it and having the IRS grab your wages and all
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.440]  sorts of things they want to promote this it is credit private cryptocurrencies
[13:39.440 --> 13:43.120]  that are the answer I don't like that we don't know where the providence of it
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.360]  came from there's no vetting there's no transparency my gut has told me to run
[13:48.360 --> 13:54.320]  not walk from Bitcoin so we can discuss Bitcoin today as well here is the toll
[13:54.320 --> 14:04.440]  free number to join us it is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 we will
[14:04.440 --> 14:09.280]  get you up and on the air on this live Tuesday edition first-time callers
[14:09.280 --> 14:16.120]  longtime callers total free for all 800-259-9231 and then when I start the
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.400]  next hour I'm going to get into the really big issue FDA ways risk of three
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.160]  person embryo fertilization folks it's already been going on for a long time
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.120]  cloning's been going on for a long time I want to break this down for everybody's
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.560]  at the start of the next hour and then we'll just continue on with your phone
[14:34.560 --> 14:37.880]  calls and a bunch of special reports from the nightly news the last few days
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.240]  that are really really important but as I said most hosts if the power was off
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.840]  at their studio we have the backup network who can run backup out of
[14:46.840 --> 14:49.960]  Minnesota and every once in a while every couple years they have a problem we
[14:49.960 --> 14:55.320]  have backup here so we are somewhat redundant for even a big-time media
[14:55.320 --> 15:02.120]  we're about as redundant as they are but again no no video feeds today with the
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.840]  power being off and it shows you how tenuous our whole civilization and
[15:07.840 --> 15:13.200]  situation is when you realize how dependent we are on the electrical grid
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.760]  when you realize the electrical grid is under attack it's not being upgraded
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.920]  it's not being repaired in many areas that's on record the infrastructure
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.840]  across the board roadways rail beds for trains and transportation across the
[15:28.840 --> 15:33.440]  board but our power plants they've dozens of them around the country that
[15:33.440 --> 15:36.960]  were completed one of them cost three million dollars in Corpus Christi they
[15:36.960 --> 15:41.160]  did not allow it to be opened under Obama the last six years and so now
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.400]  they're opening new plants in Mexico that just spew totally dirty mercury you
[15:45.400 --> 15:52.480]  name it out just straight up coal stacks turning turbines to create steam to turn
[15:52.480 --> 15:58.640]  turbines to create electrical power and now China Mexico India they're just
[15:58.640 --> 16:02.600]  building power plants everywhere they're totally dirty and we're having a more
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.800]  than 500 power plants now shut down under Lord Obama and scores of them that
[16:07.800 --> 16:10.960]  were brand-new were never allowed to open that nothing comes out of the top of
[16:10.960 --> 16:16.560]  them but carbon dioxide that plants literally breathe and then create oxygen
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.000]  from part of the carbon cycle and water vapor that's why they've listed carbon
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.440]  as a pollutant even though the Congress wouldn't pass a law saying it they've
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.320]  listed carbon dioxide because once they do that they have a corner on the entire
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.280]  global market and I know I talk a lot about that it's just that it's such a
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.440]  big deal to know that 51% until five years ago six years ago of our power
[16:37.440 --> 16:42.680]  came from coal it's now depending on the region 30% 45% and going down and
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.800]  power prices are just absolutely exploding and that really hurts Americans
[16:46.800 --> 16:54.520]  and I don't like poverty you know I was going to see my uncle before he died a
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.480]  few months ago back in early January and I pulled over with my son in Waco on the
[16:59.480 --> 17:04.800]  way to East Texas to Lubies on a weekday where I took off the radio show and
[17:04.800 --> 17:10.760]  drove there and I stood there in line when Lubies opened at 11 a.m. cafeteria
[17:10.760 --> 17:15.120]  watching all these old women and I've been going to Lubies since I was knee-high
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.840]  to a grasshopper since I was born in Dallas Texas they have all over the
[17:19.840 --> 17:26.160]  state and so I go to Lubies every few weeks and my kids like it so I people
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.680]  watch and I sat there and I watched all these old people who couldn't even
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.040]  afford the Luan platter the Luan platters from King of the Hill she's
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.560]  named Luan from the Luan platter and Lubies is in King of the Hill little
[17:38.560 --> 17:42.720]  Texas stuff that Mike judge wrote into it but to make a long story short it
[17:42.720 --> 17:47.760]  physically is painful for me to be buying whatever food I want and not having
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.160]  to worry about it because I'm middle-class and then to be watching working
[17:51.160 --> 17:58.240]  class men and women and old women mainly who literally were were were stressed
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.400]  out when they were paying for their food and and and really worried about it
[18:01.400 --> 18:05.400]  trying to go out once a week with their friends at the cafeteria trying to just
[18:05.400 --> 18:09.960]  live like you know working class people and they can't even do it that
[18:09.960 --> 18:14.480]  irritates me to a great extent and then I get physically angry by the injustice
[18:14.480 --> 18:19.000]  of the deindustrialization the offshoring of our jobs NAFTA and get written to
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.640]  shut down our industry devaluation of our currency and I think about all the
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.680]  family I've got that used to be middle-class that now work two three jobs
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.120]  and can't even barely pay for their children to have new shoes and I just
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.280]  see the poverty creeping in everywhere and then I know it's all by design
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.520]  clowered in heaven all by designed to bankrupt us and put us on food stamps and
[18:40.520 --> 18:45.080]  Obamacare is meant to make you go from 40 hours to less than 30 and they tell
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.160]  you now they tell the businesses this came out last year oh just tell your
[18:49.160 --> 18:52.880]  employees go on food stamps Walmart tells their employees that the vector
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.240]  strategy is pay their employees at a level where they qualify for assistance

[35:23.880 --> 35:29.200]  alright folks let's go back to your phone calls I've really done a new record
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.800]  35 minutes in the broadcast I've taken one call the old days I take like a 50
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.040]  calls an hour never been able to do it in like a decade let's go ahead and talk
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.200]  to Travis in Washington Travis you're on the air thanks for calling hey Alex
[35:41.200 --> 35:45.240]  how you doing good brother what you calling about today I just want to give
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.440]  you an analogy buddy you um I love you everything you bring up is true head on
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.920]  but uh you never really seemed to do the analogy if you run me somebody that's
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.720]  really hard working with a machete in his hand cutting down weed but you're not
[35:57.720 --> 36:03.960]  going after the root and the root is in 1867 they made this a corporation US
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.600]  corporation and every person that's born into this corporation is filed under
[36:08.600 --> 36:13.600]  it and when you refer yourself as a person you are not talking being a human
[36:13.600 --> 36:18.240]  you're parting talking being part of this corporation and this corporation is
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.280]  ran by a president like the banks and that president of course he's above all
[36:22.280 --> 36:26.080]  the laws of the banks and that's the way they look at every one of us Alex and
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.640]  if that route is still there after you cut down all these weeds they still own
[36:29.640 --> 36:33.400]  that route they still own this nasty corporation they'll do whatever I mean
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.600]  it is true with the amendments that came in that supposedly ended slavery it
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.600]  created a new type of citizen that's a ward of the state and there is a lot of
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.800]  truth to that and then there's the private Federal Reserve that's been
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.040]  operating for a hundred years and three months dominating and manipulating the
[36:49.040 --> 36:53.040]  economy and so it is all based on fraud just like they say every year it's the
[36:53.040 --> 36:56.760]  law to take vaccines there is no law to take vaccines to attend school it's a
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.200]  mass criminal lying fraud you have to go in their office and say there is no law
[37:01.200 --> 37:04.800]  you have a waiver to the policy but I don't even have to fill out the waiver
[37:04.800 --> 37:10.400]  and then they will go okay you're right here's the waiver it's it's all fraud
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.080]  there's just so much patriot mythology though that if you just go in and revoke
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.920]  the bond and point out that your birth certificate has been used as collateral
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.480]  which it actually is to the IMF and World Bank that's true they don't care it's
[37:23.480 --> 37:28.600]  force du jour force majeure they're just operating by the power of the gun as
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.160]  Mao Zedong said all power goes out of the barrel of a gun that's why they want
[37:33.160 --> 37:38.640]  our guns to complete our journey into slavery but yes they did not free the
[37:38.640 --> 37:43.520]  black folks after the Civil War they simply made everyone a ward of the
[37:43.520 --> 37:49.440]  state and inducted us into the system and then with the Federal Reserve Act of
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.640]  1913 War Powers Act of 1933 they set up the state police that are really an
[37:53.640 --> 37:59.680]  international OC organization of economic cooperative development
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.600]  combined and we have been bankrupted into that that's how they're appointing the
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.960]  presidents of Greece and Italy and other places now and signing them onto their
[38:07.960 --> 38:10.720]  debt that's how they're doing this they're in the Economist magazine
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.480]  announcing that they're gonna privatize basically all the public lands and give
[38:15.480 --> 38:19.160]  it to select corporations but not because they even bailed us out because
[38:19.160 --> 38:23.240]  we've been signed on to those corporations those banks debts because
[38:23.240 --> 38:26.960]  we've been signed on to their debt we then go into debt to them it's
[38:26.960 --> 38:34.160]  incredible yes I am and it's all done without our consent and it's all fraud
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.680]  right and you're talking about a amendments to a Constitution and the
[38:38.680 --> 38:42.920]  Constitution was a contract between the government that Washington DC to run
[38:42.920 --> 38:46.920]  the states now that's humans now that's no I agree the Bill of Rights and
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.920]  Declaration of Independence as well as the especially the Ninth Amendment is
[38:50.920 --> 38:54.480]  saying that all the powers are reserved to the people and that everything
[38:54.480 --> 38:57.800]  listed here we have a lot more rights than just that
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.880]  it's all paper it's all crap it was all funded by the European powers that came
[39:03.880 --> 39:06.880]  over here they had stopped yeah I mean let's be clear the founders weren't
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.000]  perfect and none of it was perfect from the beginning and they had to sue for
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.800]  peace and then make some deals with King George the third but this system is
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.600]  under attack because it's anathema to the monopoly capitalist the monopoly
[39:20.600 --> 39:25.480]  gangsters and so our real republican form of government with the Bill of Rights
[39:25.480 --> 39:29.880]  Declaration of Independence and Constitution if properly implemented by
[39:29.880 --> 39:37.720]  the people is the best system ever created people blame our system and and
[39:37.720 --> 39:43.440]  say that capitalism failed this isn't capitalism this is crony federal
[39:43.440 --> 39:48.600]  reserve picking the winners fraud and that's what I'm here to expose but I
[39:48.600 --> 39:51.200]  hear you and I appreciate your call Travis that's why I love the grab bag
[39:51.200 --> 39:56.440]  calls the wildcard calls they're just all over the map today now let's go
[39:56.440 --> 40:00.880]  ahead and talk to Jeff in Texas and Lance truth raider Richard and others go
[40:00.880 --> 40:07.560]  ahead hello Alex hey Jeff hey man I got a question for you I'm a disabled
[40:07.560 --> 40:12.480]  veteran and from what I understand about the Ryan Murray budget bill they capped
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.400]  the income of cost of living allowances for veterans and senior citizens is that
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.680]  true do you know about that yes there's all sorts of cutting veterans benefits
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.360]  and cutting disabled veterans benefits and they're getting ready to scale back
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.160]  on the pension funds of officers so it's it's going to be a nightmare situation
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.760]  unlimited trillions to foreign banks and derivatives but they're going to cheat
[40:34.760 --> 40:40.440]  and falsify the contracts by law and are moving now and have all sorts of
[40:40.440 --> 40:44.480]  articles in the Army times and stuff about about taking and cutting back the
[40:44.480 --> 40:50.200]  pensions of the armed services veterans yeah it's just not fair to me I was
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.920]  trying to get Social Security disability for ten years and what it is is they
[40:54.920 --> 40:58.160]  keep you in the system for ten years and after that you're no longer eligible
[40:58.160 --> 41:02.320]  just so all the veterans that are out there coming back from the wars know if
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.600]  they're disabled they'll try to keep you in the system for ten years and then
[41:06.600 --> 41:09.920]  after ten years you're no longer eligible to even apply that's right I've
[41:09.920 --> 41:13.600]  had veterans ride scription the VA spends like half its money on PR and
[41:13.600 --> 41:19.640]  propaganda and it's there to keep an eye on the obsolete weaponry that they see
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.600]  the humans as they want to spike like an old cannon and it there's some good
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.160]  people in the system is still trying to do a good job but it's extremely
[41:26.160 --> 41:29.600]  predatory I mean look at how they announce veterans as the number one
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.880]  enemy of Homeland Security with a straight face in the news and and the
[41:33.880 --> 41:38.120]  new army that's going to be domestic as they scale back worldwide is pointed
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.640]  directly at anybody that is a real American I mean it's it's it's twilight
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.960]  zone level well I'm doing what I can to keep myself occupied I might be disabled
[41:47.960 --> 41:53.120]  but I I'm a recording artist SRV was a friend of mine a lot of your friends
[41:53.120 --> 41:57.000]  are I've met before and I'm sure we've ran in the same circles as part of
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.440]  musicians go but that's what I do man I play music and I'm real good at it in
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.240]  the blues I love the blues well we played some of that earlier for your
[42:05.240 --> 42:08.840]  brother God bless you and I appreciate your call yeah I don't want to get into
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.160]  complex economic discussions here but we can build with the technology we have
[42:14.160 --> 42:22.280]  and automation and factories we can build any society and any culture that we
[42:22.280 --> 42:27.880]  want it's basically unlimited what we can do and dr. Bob Bowman who was a
[42:27.880 --> 42:32.120]  nuclear physicist wrote about this we had him on the fact that with automation
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.240]  and the systems we have we should be working two days a week and the rest of
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.560]  it doing art and literature and and and uplifting more needy people and the
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.960]  globalists talk about this they talk about the Federal Reserve wants to keep
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.040]  the economy from quote overheating and growing faster than 3.5% well our
[42:48.040 --> 42:51.200]  economy grew at 10% for most of our history until the Federal Reserve came
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.200]  in so what they want is stagnation they want feudalism and they want that on
[42:57.200 --> 43:03.280]  record and if anybody deserves to get their health care and to get their
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.680]  pensions it's the service people but notice the World War one marchers the
[43:08.680 --> 43:15.200]  bonus marchers that Eisenhower to his discredit along with MacArthur they were
[43:15.200 --> 43:19.320]  both young colonels you know killed a bunch of veterans in DC that have been
[43:19.320 --> 43:24.000]  camped out for months demanding that they get their World War one bonus and
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.120]  these are people that arms and legs blown off it wasn't even that big of a
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.160]  sum and what they got was army tanks and bullets and horses and MacArthur and
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.040]  Eisenhower who weren't bad guys compared to our elites today notice were
[43:36.040 --> 43:40.520]  elevated to running everything because they would kill US veterans so just a
[43:40.520 --> 43:45.960]  little little factoid that most people most people are not aware of right there
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.800]  truth Raider you're on the air worldwide thanks for calling the truth Raiders on
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.440]  the March the Empire's on the run live with Alex Jones from Austin Texas in the
[43:55.440 --> 44:00.120]  dark that's right you got a really good voice over a telephone buddy thank you
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.680]  very much I'm no I'm praying that something will come along the future
[44:04.680 --> 44:07.200]  that I have my opportunity but we'll see what happens if I ever get into radio
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.800]  or become an annexed broadcaster for you perhaps in the Northwest maybe you can
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.320]  use well I suggest is if you build it they will come I would start out with
[44:14.320 --> 44:17.200]  access television because that has pretty good audiences and nobody uses it
[44:17.200 --> 44:20.720]  people if it's interesting will tune through and stop then I'd use those tapes
[44:20.720 --> 44:25.680]  to get a local radio show or I'd start your own radio show on YouTube every day
[44:25.680 --> 44:31.920]  do an hour or so and then you'll end up getting a radio show but people are
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.400]  always waiting for it to happen yet you have to go out and do it exactly okay
[44:36.400 --> 44:40.120]  today I want to talk about two topics the electronic disassociation that we
[44:40.120 --> 44:45.160]  have in society and number two the slow and lose in insidious transition into a
[44:45.160 --> 44:53.000]  social society here in America we'll go ahead okay electronic cell phones iPads
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.120]  iPods wherever you look people people buried their faces buried in these
[44:59.120 --> 45:05.200]  electronic gadgets and it's disassociated people I go by by conspiracies
[45:05.200 --> 45:08.840]  that I can prove I've seen this no no it's on record with the wavelengths and
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.360]  all of it the language is shrinking people aren't communicating they're
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.800]  becoming total loners and they're living inside their devices instead of living
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.200]  in the real world it's a very serious phenomenon that's being done by design
[45:20.200 --> 45:27.120]  yes I see that and the insidious transition into a social society how
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.120]  they're doing this well there I've seen this for over 10 years and it's starting
[45:31.120 --> 45:34.680]  to come here to the Northwest but we're having an Hispanicization of our
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.720]  country now I have nothing against Hispanic people most of them are pretty
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.440]  good people but they're bringing the wrong ones here to our country well it
[45:42.440 --> 45:45.680]  is true that a lot of the criminals and dregs of Latin America are coming here
[45:45.680 --> 45:50.560]  gaming the system and then they keep extreme nationalistic anti-white
[45:50.560 --> 45:55.960]  anti-black racism and that's a minority but it's a large minority and then it's
[45:55.960 --> 46:01.800]  supposedly has to be overlooked and ignored and it's cute and and it's it's
[46:01.800 --> 46:04.520]  meant to break the country up and create more Balkanization for the North
[46:04.520 --> 46:09.240]  American Union because again they merge the three states into one but then
[46:09.240 --> 46:13.840]  they're going to break things up into subregions within the larger unions yes
[46:13.840 --> 46:20.120]  the the the best Mexicans I've ever known the ones that that went through the
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.520]  process I had a good friend that went through the process of immigrating here
[46:24.520 --> 46:29.120]  he went through a 10 to 12 year excruciating process always have to fill
[46:29.120 --> 46:34.440]  out applications and and everything he had to go through yeah yeah no no no I mean
[46:34.440 --> 46:37.440]  good hard-working people in they get impossible I don't care if you're from
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.040]  Western Europe wherever it's at or Mexico and then the criminals just come in
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.800]  and get legalized I know it's amazing I appreciate your call I mean look folks
[46:44.800 --> 46:48.760]  you can't go to Mexico and demand to have your baby for free or demand welfare
[46:48.760 --> 46:52.640]  they'd laugh at you and nobody else does this but Western Europe and the United
[46:52.640 --> 46:58.840]  States and it's it's designed to break the countries up and they can politically
[46:58.840 --> 47:04.480]  correct go oh no it's for peace and to diversify things no it's it's being done
[47:04.480 --> 47:08.840]  as a political tool everybody knows it let's go ahead and talk to Lance in
[47:08.840 --> 47:13.760]  Kansas Lance you're on the air how are you doing today sir I'm doing all right
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.720]  brother well thank you I like to first of all you know you hate to hear thanks
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.920]  but I'd like to thank you for pointing me in the right direction to wake me up
[47:23.920 --> 47:28.080]  not that's not necessarily for waking me up but thank you for presenting
[47:28.080 --> 47:33.040]  information to me that I did not know existed and give me the ability to
[47:33.040 --> 47:41.200]  research it myself and use my own brain yes yes use my own brain to figure out
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.720]  what is right and what is wrong and I live in Lawrence Kansas and I just wanted
[47:45.720 --> 47:53.960]  to comment on Ted Nugent last night and how whatever her name was would deviate
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.120]  from his points and keep on her point and trying to get Ted Nugent to admit
[47:59.120 --> 48:08.640]  that he was you know a white trash potty mouth you know just a hater of all
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.480]  races she would point he would point out that Obama is murdering people Hillary
[48:13.480 --> 48:16.880]  doesn't care that four Americans got killed in Benghazi but that's not
[48:16.880 --> 48:22.960]  important because Ted Nugent called them pottymouth names and listen the issue is
[48:22.960 --> 48:29.160]  is it's all about the establishment setting the the parameters of values
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.680]  and then lecturing us all day and obviously Nugent is using this to get
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.280]  himself more fame and fortune which I think is fine and it's backfiring on
[48:37.280 --> 48:42.040]  them but the the so-called dinosaur mainstream media doesn't have any power
[48:42.040 --> 48:45.960]  anymore and as soon as people realize that and just laugh at them it goes away
[48:45.960 --> 48:52.840]  all they've got is race politics and they are the ones that I mean did did did
[48:52.840 --> 48:58.320]  people get mad at Bill Maher last week when he called Matt Drudge a stupid
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.720]  cracker you know it's again I mean I've got MSNBC calling white people names
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.480]  white people doing it they're only trying to stir up race in fact let me
[49:07.480 --> 49:10.480]  just mention this article since you raise it this out of the Daily Sheephold it
[49:10.480 --> 49:16.880]  was first reported by WHO television this is up on info wars.com a Bible
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.800]  stopped the bullets when a white man was targeted by young black polar bear
[49:20.800 --> 49:25.280]  hunters and it goes on to describe it as an expansion on the knockout game to go
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.840]  in knockout unsuspecting crackers and the new game the police say the bus
[49:30.840 --> 49:37.040]  driver this is a WHO WHO news police say the bus driver is lucky to be alive
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.240]  after three black teenagers stabbed and shot him a Bible over the bus driver's
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.680]  heart stopped two bullets and allowed him to fight off a knife attack from his
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.720]  assailants one additional bullet stuck him in the leg the teens also stabbed
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.400]  him in the arm the attack came in the morning at 5 30 the driver stopped his
[49:56.400 --> 50:01.320]  bus because of mechanical difficulties as he was outside the bus assessing how
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.200]  to fix the problem the three suspects came up to him and said they were going
[50:05.200 --> 50:09.960]  to shoot a polar bear today and it just goes on right there the Bible saved him
[50:09.960 --> 50:15.800]  they were ages 15 to 18 my issue is if a if white groups were doing this it would
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.560]  be on every channel and they would be saying whites collectively are to blame
[50:19.560 --> 50:23.360]  I'm not saying blacks are collectively to blame but there are large subcultures
[50:23.360 --> 50:29.760]  of young black males that viciously hate white people and viciously go out in
[50:29.760 --> 50:33.960]  the tectum I don't blame everybody because of that but but again these type

[57:30.920 --> 57:36.880]  absolutely I call today about the situation in the Ukraine I keep hearing
[57:36.880 --> 57:43.800]  the one word over and over Nazis I hear the deposed president saying that they
[57:43.800 --> 57:51.760]  are facing the return of Nazism the new angelic leader with her braided hair
[57:51.760 --> 57:57.160]  Tomaschenko came from a party far right wing party called the fatherland party
[57:57.160 --> 58:00.160]  now it's being funded by George Soros and again they're not right wing in the
[58:00.160 --> 58:04.640]  sense of private property guns they're right wing in the sense of their anti
[58:04.640 --> 58:09.880]  Russian and anti-Slav and think they're subhuman absolutely and last year in
[58:09.880 --> 58:16.080]  December when our illustrious senator from Arizona John McCain took Democrat
[58:16.080 --> 58:22.080]  Chris Murphy over to meet with the leaders of the swabota party the freedom

[58:38.080 --> 58:41.080]  the whole thing what does that tell you about it George Soros is piece of crap
[58:41.080 --> 58:48.880]  and by the way is a Nazi as well and just you can never get rid of these people

[58:55.280 --> 59:00.560]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.560]  to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the

[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.200]  Richard Mississippi you were bringing up the Ukraine situation look both sides
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.320]  have issues with each other and I'm sure the government was corrupt most
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.400]  governments are corrupt but it was elected the point is they already over
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.520]  through the government 2004 then that got reversed George Soros the State
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.000]  Department Hillary Clinton John McCain they started this whole thing during the
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.680]  Olympics so that the Russians wouldn't want to respond during the first take
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.480]  over the Russians are on record now saying they're sending trips into Crimea
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.280]  nearby this is a serious situation go ahead and make your points you were
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.240]  starting to get into there Richard yes thank you I as far as Crimea goes that's
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:51.680]  the Russians only option is to annex Crimea and to save the ethnic Russians
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.640]  who live in that region from probably what we would see what we had in Bosnia
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:03.600]  ethnic cleansing they've the new the coup d'etat they took place the new
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.840]  government quote-unquote has already voted to outlaw the Russian language
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:17.640]  today in Western Ukraine and they have no remorse for anyone who sided with the
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.640]  former Soviet Union the far right-wing parties as a collective that came
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:31.080]  together with George Soros and the EU and the United States started out as the
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:36.240]  organization of Ukrainian nationalists who formed after World War two to
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:45.720]  collaborate with the Nazis to slaughter 60,000 Poles and those folks have no
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:52.280]  love for Jewish people they have no love for anyone who even has a hint and it
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.680]  shows how George Soros will literally work with anybody well absolutely it
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.520]  defies logic that look at how they're funding al Qaeda to attack Syria and
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.640]  Egypt I mean it's just on it's despicable and and that gets to my
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.760]  question that I'm trying to get to with this background for you is in USA today
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:19.840]  yesterday they ran a photo of a protester quote-unquote wearing a World
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:29.600]  War two SS helmet and the the gist of the protest is not any type of
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.640]  independence for Ukraine but to return fascist ideals to a region which they
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.960]  thought had had them taken which is even more ridiculous because the EU's can
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.160]  open the borders up to immigration from all over the world let's just look those
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.840]  right wing get people are idiots I wouldn't even call them right wing because
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.200]  they were connected to the Nazis I'd call them fascist slash socialist and
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.880]  because that's fascism and socialism we're almost the same thing Russians
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.280]  will annex Crimea in order to preserve you know obviously their heritage and
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:11.960]  the largest naval base that they have yeah I think that's gonna happen in
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:18.040]  fact it's being reported up on m4s.com out of zero-hedge Joel Scalzen by the
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.440]  way let's get Joel Scalzen on about what's happening I want to talk to him
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:26.600]  this week about Ukraine it's on Putin deploys troop battalion Russians raised
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.520]  flag over Ukraine Republic of Crimea and I'll cover some of that coming up after
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.440]  I get into this cloning news that's really what it is straight ahead good to

[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.960]  want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at my Patriots
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.520]  supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.720]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.160]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.720]  Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.960]  or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities and
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.600]  employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find companies
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.400]  who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with high quality

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.960]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:20.880]  there's a war on for your mind I want to be clear here I am not anti-technology
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:27.480]  technology generally is neutral but historically it has a lot of bad side
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:36.920]  effects as well and examples of that are obviously legion but I remember being
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:43.080]  on the radio 18-19 years ago and reading BBC news articles about how they'd
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.000]  already cloned humans and laboratories they had just killed the embryos before
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.560]  they developed to any major size and then I saw mentioned in the Washington
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.560]  Post and other publications about how in places like Costa Rica they had
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:05.360]  created laboratories and the word is brought human clones to term the word
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.200]  is is that in the 1940s some of the Nazis were able to clone rabbits now of
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.200]  course in the last 20 years they've cloned sheep they've cloned rabbits
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:20.640]  the list goes on and on the issue here is that well there's many issues but the
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:27.440]  larger issue is the globalist or social engineers and they hypothesized DNA in the
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.600]  1850s under Galton the father of eugenics who also invented the strictures
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.760]  and the science of biometrics and it has been eugenics the last hundred and
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.520]  sixty years or so that is the governing undergirder of philosophy of social
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.800]  engineering and societal architecture and my greatest goal is to simply get
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.760]  listeners to realize there is social engineering there is social architecture
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.760]  going on and the people that are implementing it and the people that
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.760]  are carrying it out are extremely intelligent extremely neurotic and
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.880]  extremely anti-general public and are on big power trips and believe that they
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.440]  are going to be able to seize the future by walling off society in an arrested
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.360]  shut down stagnated technological system while in government and corporate and
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.600]  university reservations they will be able to build the next level civil
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.800] ization with the life extension technologies the interstellar's travel
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.800]  and all the things of that we think of as the future and so that decision has
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:50.760]  been made to give us Justin Bieber and all the rest of the mindless hype in the
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.480]  NFL and while we're busy obsessing over those little factoids that don't affect
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.760]  the establishment they are building the new world around us and the fact that the
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.440]  public is so dumbed down and so distracted and so already raised in
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.480]  front of a television set from birth the establishment literally has written
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.560]  thousands and thousands of white papers and books admitting all this
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.400]  Google's head of technology came out two days ago and said rise of the robots
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.760]  into the humans 2030 and that will be like a bug that they just step on now
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.480]  I mean he was saying that 20 years ago the issue is is that he's actually
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.640]  racially running Google and it's not about the trillions of dollars now
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:40.320]  folks it's about these guys never dying but see before they can develop those
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:46.680]  technologies they have to create a world government and restrict our access to
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.960]  healthcare and bring in the death panels so that you don't get access to it and
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.080]  you've got to also understand they're not going to let you know about the real
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.200]  medicine and and technological systems they've created that is going to be
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.440]  closely held international security and is closely held under national and
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.320]  global corporate security I mean look at Dick Cheney he survived with a heart
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.360]  pump for two years nobody else could survive a year he looks great now got a
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.600]  heart transplant and if you don't know that he got advanced technologies to be
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.320]  able to do that he runs around giving speeches claiming he didn't you're a
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.320]  fool and so this is the ultimate discrimination we're talking about not
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.160]  letting the general population have access to all of this not even letting
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  us know that there have been space planes in orbit for 30 years not letting
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.160]  folks know there have been giant DU meteor gun platforms in space for 30 years
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.760]  not letting the public know that they've been cloning humans since the 1950s not
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.240]  letting the public know they had underground based facilities building
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.680]  cyborgs in the 1980s they tried to hire my dad in like 10 other top dentists in
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.520]  Dallas you know they need to be paid a half million dollars a year when I was
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.800]  like 12 years old I sat around the dinner table saying well this is classified
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.520]  but honey blah blah blah you know they they won't tell me what it is but it's
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:18.280]  cybernetics and it's probably you know putting you know hidden electronics and
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.240]  special forces is basically what he'd been told and I'm not trying to impress
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.600]  you folks they tried to hire a whole bunch of oral surgeons that were
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.360]  pioneers and implants like my dad was and what do you think they're putting in
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.120]  spies jaws spy skulls he was told I mean literally he was going to be in
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:39.760]  Maryland in underground facilities creating cyborgs you're not in Kansas
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.720]  anymore ladies and gentlemen I want to just get all this across to all of you
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.600]  so that you understand that and so that you realize that it all of these
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.280]  technologies we are tested upon with all the new genetic therapies and the new
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:04.400]  endocrine therapies and the new DNA therapies we and the viral therapies we
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.200]  are tested on that's why they call the medical system in the West a practice
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.080]  because you're never perfecting what you're doing you are practicing on the
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.320]  patients just a hundred and fifty years ago in England the general public did
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:26.680]  not have access to doctors period unless you were in a medical facility and
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.880]  had been signed over for medical experimentation you were then practiced
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:37.080]  upon so that the elite doctors could then go and actually carry out the
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:42.720]  medicine on the elite so this isn't something new that we're practiced on
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.400]  we've always been practiced on we've always been seen as animals whether it
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:52.160]  was Japan or ancient France or ancient Russia we are animals of the elite are
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.920]  gods every culture has a upper class that says everyone else is an animal
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.800]  under them as the excuse to keep people like animals so you can control them
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:11.760]  because humans homo sapiens sapien predator but what's the word in Latin
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.760]  for predator because that's what I would really call the elite homo sapiens
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:22.320]  sapien tyranus homo sapien sapien tyrant homo sapien sapien vampiris
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:31.280]  homo sapien sapien parasitis these are the names of the elite and my biggest
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.440]  problem with them is sure there's dumb down lazy evil unwashed masses they're
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.600]  always out there and I understand the elite of God I mean I've seen them I've
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.600]  been around them I mean they are really smart people their eyes twinkle with
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.560]  with demonic intelligence my only issue is the crime of trying to dumb
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  everybody down so you can manage people shows that you're not really as elite as
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.160]  you say you are you believe your social Darwinism gives you this authorization
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.880]  to dominate and kill and rule over everyone and the mere fact that you're
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.680]  in charge means that you have a right to rule over everyone but the very
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.480]  sciences of control that you're bringing forward or blowing back on your
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.440]  children I've run into some of the most elite families in the world growing up
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.640]  some of my crew have grown up around some of the most elite family some of
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:25.560]  the biggest names out there and they literally are totally unhappy screwed up
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.880]  people the path you're going down is not a good one now I've prefaced all of
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.040]  this with with just some basic background it's such a big area it's hard to get
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.480]  into but I saw this article yesterday and I mentioned it there's a new one out
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.320]  today on Bloomberg the stories are up on it for wars comm in prison planet calm
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.200]  right now here it is out of Bloomberg dad it may join two moms for disease free
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:58.000]  designer babies you're that disease free talk about selling it disease free
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.360]  you're gonna be disease free now just let us get in there and change the embryo
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.280]  and put other people's DNA in which they can now basically nanotech and and
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.200]  create artificially and put whatever Trojan horses whatever programs they
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.880]  want into there just like all the Monsanto crops and the rest of it they'll
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.120]  have eight stacked traits and then they go in and look at them and they find
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.480]  other traits and people assume and they declare national security and
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.120]  proprietary and the courts rule no you can't look at what's in that Monsanto
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.200]  corn or that Monsanto canola or that Monsanto soybean they're stacking other
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:37.440]  stuff in there if they do it to all the electronics and they do it to all and
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.880]  all the secret testing of course they're doing it in the genetic engineering and
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:47.400]  to change one genetic trait it then randomly when you reproduce the next
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.000]  generation creates hundreds if not thousands of other random mutations so
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.280]  here's the deal once they start randomly changing people to get rid of some
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:02.120]  predistribution predistribution form and suddenly say that word predisposition
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:09.440]  for cancer or for going blind or or for leukemia whatever the case is that when
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.160]  you try to have kids later the person that's been altered you're not going to
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.120]  be able to and that's the holy grail for the establishment you're going to have
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.400]  to go back in to their system and have them quote take your genetics and the
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.640]  other people's genetics and create the new designer human that is not really
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:32.600]  your son or daughter it will be a laboratory product and in the year 2014
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.320]  this has been going on for a long time and we come back I want to read over
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.440]  these articles for you so you can hear this and of course the FDA board is
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.840]  going to authorize it it's already being done in China China 10 years ago was
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:51.520]  feeding their troops human milk that comes out of the udders of cows 15
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.240]  years ago you could buy glow-in-the-dark monkeys in South Korea and in Hong Kong
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:04.040]  that are part jellyfish 20 years ago they were getting secret body armor the
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.000]  programs public but how they make it secret with goats that are part spider
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.160]  whose milk produces spider-man web and I would cover it then and literally have
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:18.760]  people threaten me on the street saying I was a liar because it was a culture
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.240]  shot for them they couldn't believe that was happening well now it's just past
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.960]  say the dam is broken okay there's spider-goats okay they got monkeys that
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.360]  are part jellyfish that glow-in-the-dark and cats and dogs you can buy I could
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.080]  buy and have it shipped and get it through quarantine after a few months and
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:40.280]  I could have in the studio a glowing Labrador tree blows blue in the dark okay
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.880]  see we're not in Kansas anymore folks and so you'd understand right beneath the
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.680]  surface is a 35 to 40 year advanced technological civilization that is
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.200]  about to roll out genetic engineering in the food or no one's gonna be able to
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.640]  have children you'll then have to go to them to have your kids but they won't be
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.200]  your kids it'll be an engineered Microsoft product a lot of people's

[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.080]  want to tell you about Matt Red Hawk and his team of patriots over at my
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.680]  Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.800]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.920]  charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.120]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.400]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.840]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.480]  companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with

[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.960]  folks your phone calls and a ton of other news look I just see myself on team
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.480]  humanity and I think people should know the decisions that have been made and
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.480]  what's being set up for everybody and that there literally is a national
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.400]  security breakaway worldwide corporate civilization that in their own words have
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.680]  endangered the human and planetary biosphere to such an extent that they
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:40.840]  built giant animal plant seed vaults and emergency DNA RNA vaults all over the
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:48.200]  world under the UN in the middle of nowhere all over the planet and they're
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.200]  absolutely irrevocably changing our DNA I mean it's on record that the major GMO
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.920]  crops kill the honey bees it's on record that they cause genetic mutations off of
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:04.080]  the charts with near total sterilization in guinea pigs rats and mice and monkeys
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.800]  within three generations and it's designed to hurt us and you can see what
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.240]  they've done you can see the IQ dropping you can see the test scores
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.880]  dropping you can see the cancer rates skyrocketing I mean people ask why I'm
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.120]  not worried about being killed I mean what is the point here the average cop the
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.080]  average military person the average FBI agent the average bureaucrat the average
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.000]  politician the average school teacher the average factory worker the average
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.480]  cowboy the average auto parts person they're good people they just have been
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.960]  brought up with television television allowed government for the first time
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.720]  ever to totally create a false reality and to be an accelerate social
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.360]  engineering and put people into it they've been taken everybody's blood
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:53.760]  worldwide in the West any Western control country since 1973 41 years I told you
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.880]  about that first in the mid 90s we got classified documents they've now claimed
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.320]  patenting on everyone claiming when you go in for a DNA based treatment using
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.000]  your own DNA they charge you hundreds of thousands there's a Supreme Court cases
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.880]  on that and I don't blame people ten years ago hear me talk about this and
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.200]  say man you're nuts but now it's all out in the open what are we going to do
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:21.160]  about it and listen you know if I had a bunch of genetic disorders in in in my
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:30.640]  family and and predestined if there was a pre-existing program where where
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.640]  because of environmental stresses something serious might manifest itself
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:41.000]  because I was predisposed then I would want to know that information and it
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.320]  started out with genetic testing and it's no big deal and oh there's not
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.520]  really any history a little bit of cancer a little bit of this and that
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.560]  little bit of heart disease now they say oh no we're going to give you a
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  disease-free baby a designer disease-free well you know that's not what
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.320]  they're going to deliver they've been testing this on monkeys and other things
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:07.160]  in the new study and the FDA is set tomorrow to meet to look at authorizing
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:13.520]  three parents and of course people try to ban cloning because it has that
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.040]  social stigma and rightfully so of a brave new world and what can they tweak
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.560]  in the clone it really won't even end up being a clone and doesn't have a soul
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.640]  this is beyond that where they call it three parents and what they do is they
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.800]  go in to three different people's profiles and then they basically go and
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.360]  fuse these systems in together and heaven only knows what's going to happen
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.760]  we know in plants animals and insects what happens with this the next
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.640]  generation and believe me they're going to tell you you're not going to have kids
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.040]  properly after this because if you do you're going to have to go back in and
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.160]  get a designer again because the first time you're going to have hundreds of
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:57.840]  mutations and the next generation it's thousands of mutations you can't go in
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.720]  the way science does it and just change major genetics and fuse them together
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.600]  and not have them then start mutating because you're designed to mutate but
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.760]  you're designed to take the genetic code of all the men and women before you and
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.960]  then randomly display that for survival of the species you're not meant to just
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:22.520]  jointly make changes in the genetic code that would have happened over hundreds
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.640]  of thousands of years and then manifested a new human there's never been two
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:34.040]  mommies and one daddy none of this has ever gone on and it's a disaster with
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.120]  crops that are much simpler it's a disaster with the salmon that's three
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.880]  times the size of the natural salmon and they predict within 40 generations
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:49.840]  that's 40 years university studies will extinct all natural salmon it's already
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.440]  happening they go out and they kill them they go out and they swim past them
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.200]  they go out and they eat their food and so the globalist believe in the
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.320]  technological growth curve though they've got to do this testing and that they
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:09.000]  will advance so fast technologically the analogy I read from Kurzweil or in a
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.240]  decade ago I forget which book it was was that if we sent folks out with say
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:21.000]  nuclear-powered ramjet type technology to go to Alpha Centuries and it took 35
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.320]  years for a colony to get there by the time that craft got halfway there they
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:30.840]  would have light jump or warp capability and you would have those ships
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:37.040]  launched before after surpassing the colony ships that left before so their
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.520]  argument is they're gonna have enough advanced technology to clean all this
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.480]  stuff up you guys can't even run a nuclear power plant okay you're not
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:48.760]  gonna be able to handle this god-like technology we'll be back
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:56.440]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.360]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.200]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.880]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.560]  documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been

[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:27.160]  tuning in on this Tuesday worldwide transmission 25th day of February 2014
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:32.520]  your phone calls are coming up took a lot of calls in the last hour and we will
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.800]  take a lot in this hour into the next hour and cover a ton of news we haven't
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.680]  gotten to yet but the FDA and this is already going on other countries getting
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:46.840]  ready to approve looking at approving three parent babies again there's no
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.480]  debate here about the false advertising of saying it's you're going to be
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.000]  illness-free there's no discussion of mutations down the road there's no
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.960]  discussions of what type of new creature this creates because this will not be a
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.040]  human by any stretch the imagination it will be a laboratory manufactured
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.840]  creature and as they bring in the toxic waste as they bring in the GMO as we
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.560]  lose our fertility sperm counts are down over 85% in the west within another
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:18.040]  generation you'll have almost total sterility many areas of Latin America
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.400]  that had the highest fertility in the world now see there's plunging it's
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.880]  being done by design and you can argue a lot of yuppies will say well there are
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.680]  too many people okay but what about the secret program with the bisphenol a and
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:36.640]  the additives in the GMO you're under attack too you don't just accept there's
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:42.280]  all these secret projects going on many of which are actually public and then
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.960]  just accept that our free will has been taken and we and that someone else is
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:50.360]  governing our future in our world look at the mainstream media dying look look
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.000]  at their pertinence dying look at the New York Times not being relevant in their
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.800]  own words not being able to get a story out there and have others covered it we
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.600]  could easily discredit this technological terror that they're building and we
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.640]  could easily take these technologies and actually test them properly and have a
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:15.480]  real public discourse about it and have it be open for genetic engineering to be
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.200]  public so they can't hide stuff inside of it you think scientists that are
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.800]  gonna let people have kids or get rid of pre-existing conditions by adding the
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:28.360]  genetics of a third parent into the mix are gonna have any liability 15 years
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  from now 20 years from now when one of these creatures has children and it's
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:39.520]  got three heads literally have you seen the rats that eat Monsanto corn third
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.320]  generation they've got hair growing out their mouths genitals on top their heads
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.840]  they look like something out of the toxic Avenger they have mutations post utero
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.520]  folks unknown in mammals I mean this listen I don't know what's behind this
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:59.920]  in the final equation and I do know what's behind it but I can't say for
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:07.520]  sure but let me just tell you this it might as well be a black devil with a
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.800]  big old long for tail folks because let me tell you this stuff so diabolical so
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.680]  twisted so freaked out so crazy there's so many reams of documents and public
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.560]  statements and admissions and humanities that have been created in labs in Georgia
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:27.640]  and Costa Rica it's so crazy what we know about I don't even want to know what's
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:34.000]  going on that we're not aware of and it's all in a Promethean mad dash for
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.440]  life extension period let me read some of these articles and I'm gonna go to
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:47.680]  Kevin and I'm gonna go to Matt and John and Simon and Duke and others the toll
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.840]  free number to join us is 800-259-9231 if I sound different today for AM and
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.880]  FM affiliates I undoubtedly do a better radio show when I'm in a dark room with
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.040]  one light bulb on above me talking right into the microphone it's very
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.200]  intimate it's very relaxing it's just like I'm here by myself or I'm here
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.840]  talking to one friend and I'm telling you what's really going on in my mind and
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.520]  I'm calm television is more of a cool medium but I've always gotten hotter on
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:20.320]  television radio is a hot medium but I tend to be cooler on radio and don't
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.040]  ask me why the psychology is that way but with the power out in this area of
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.680]  Austin they finally got it back on we're on generator power until a few
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:36.240]  minutes ago and I am just really enjoying not being on television right now
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.560]  maybe I should start doing maybe two hours TV and then maybe a third and
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:48.000]  fourth hour radio radio only stagger it it would be it because it's it's very
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:38:01.600]  relaxing I like it I'll continuing here with the news Bloomberg dad may join two
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:09.800]  moms for disease-free designer babies and the other pitches for the LBGT DDY
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.720]  whatever it's called lesbian gay coalition they're saying oh two women
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:19.400]  can have a baby how great yeah cut men completely out of the equation do you
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.640]  have any idea genetically what that's gonna do do you have any idea that women
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.280]  have mitochondria DNA that men don't have I mean you're really jacking what
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.440]  stuff then it's like shut up racist it's good for two women that love each other
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.320]  to have a baby yeah and then that child is gonna have all sorts of genetic
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.760]  problems guaranteed but they don't care they're just going ahead with all this
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.000]  this brave new world a new technology aimed at eliminating genetic diseases oh
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.480]  it's aimed at eliminating and I thought it did because there's a headline dad may
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.680]  join two moms for disease-free designer babies just because you have a
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:03.320]  predisposition folks just because you have a predisposition to have cancer or
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.200]  heart disease the reason cancer and heart disease are going up is because of
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.880]  the lifestyle the chemicals the biologicals the GMOs that then cause
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.000]  your genetic predisposition or have some trouble that word for some reason
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.440]  today disposition your predisposition to manifest itself that's like the best
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.800]  analogy is some crops of wheat are known to not be drought resistant but to have
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.360]  high yields well the wheat doesn't die because it genetically isn't good and
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.200]  has a disease it just dies because it needs water and yes they've got wheat
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.440]  varieties that can use a lot less water because they've had their genetics
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  manipulated but it doesn't mean something was wrong with the other wheat and a
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.600]  lot of times in studies somebody that has one disease genetically will end up
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.240]  having a higher IQ and and and other attributes and gifts in other areas it's
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:07.440]  a very complex situation but to say oh we're all collectivized government run
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.080]  healthcare we all pay for the insurance of everybody we have to certify that's
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:15.080]  where this is all going we have to certify through the genetic bioethics
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.400]  boards with genetic testing under law they're now passing all over the world
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:23.680]  that you're not allowed to have a baby because we're not going to pay for the
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.080]  fact that they're predisposed and have a serious you know statistical chance of
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:35.000]  developing breast cancer and breast cancer is up depending on the country but
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.240]  the US is number one in the world England's number two when we take the
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.200]  take the trophy from each other each year it varies year to year and it's
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.520]  because of the bisphenol a the estrogen mimickers I mean if a girl is going to
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.840]  puberty when she's 7 she's supposed to be going into it when she's 14 double that
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.640]  age and these women have the breast when they're 40 of 80 year old women because
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:04.160]  you've been bathed in estrogen your whole life that's why male genitalia
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.960]  across the board are smaller sperm counts are smaller boys genitals are not
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.440]  dropping just like ovaries they're up inside you till you hit puberty and then
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.800]  they start to drop down they're not dropping till 15 20 25 30 years of age
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.400]  now because these are little girls these are not men and the brain develops
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.880]  differently in utero with these hormones and you have a quasi-female brain
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:33.440]  the women have hyper-female brains hyper feminine just bathed in high levels
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.520]  of estrogen mimickers and it's killing them and these women that are
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.400]  predisposed that if they get estrogen mimickers and they admit this and it
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:46.360]  grows these breast tumors just like they have certain breeds of cows that they
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.120]  could feed the growth hormone to that wouldn't get cancer and they knew other
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.640]  breeds you couldn't give it to so they're trying to develop cows
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.000]  genetically that you can give all these hormones that won't die it's the same
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.440]  deal you put women on a whole bunch of these hormones and they go into puberty
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.280]  at age 7 or they're going to puberty at age 3 now they have babies at age 5 now
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  look it up and that's those are extreme cases you know you've got puberty now
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:16.720]  coming down to the age of 10 for Western girls supposed to be 14 or 15 14 or
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.760]  15 ladies and gentlemen and I look at these little girls and they look like
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:28.960]  women it's incredible and it's because of what is in the food what is in the water
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.680]  we try to feed our daughters nothing but non-gmo really high quality stuff but
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.920]  they still end up eating meat and stuff and you know peteries hamburgers
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:40.400]  whatever they claim are organic and I was looking at my nine-year-old daughter
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:47.120]  last night and she looks like she is 14 and now she's very athletic and in
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.200]  really good shape and she's not going into puberty yet but undoubtedly some of
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:58.680]  the stuff's passing through and getting to her and my son eats so healthy that
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:04.400]  he's more masculine than any boy at sporting events I mean he is just he
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.280]  he's gonna end up being like six foot five I'm like 5 11 he's already got
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:15.960]  giant muscular arms it's it's in telling you something's going on folks the
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:24.720]  environment is just chopped full of unnatural stuff and my son we have him
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.880]  on his pretty serious exercise regimen that's part of it but he is just a total
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:34.040]  bruiser and my six-year-old daughter is a bruiser and I look at little girls at
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.320]  a mall you'll see their mother and their father you can tell that they're
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.320]  biological parents and they'll be 5 10 and their daughters are 6 3 and I'm
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:48.520]  telling you folks it's the GMO it's the hormones it's out there and it's a serious
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:54.600]  situation so let's continue reading this oh disease-free designer babies the
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.920]  headline oh it's so wonderful it's as good as Obamacare it's as good as
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.160]  amnesty it's as good as gun control they're all total nightmares but so what
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.240]  the fruits of these people are death folks a new technology aimed at
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.760]  eliminating genetic diseases and newborns would combine the DNA of three
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:19.240]  people instead of just to to create a child no it's not a child it's a
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.120]  biological humanoid mutation and see they're gonna have rights for these
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:31.080]  people too folks you know Ted Nugent's in trouble calling Obama a mongrel which
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:34.000]  they can claim has some racial connotation I guess it does but so
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.240]  what it's free speech Obama's like a space alien on a mongrel to me the point
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.720]  is is that what are these people that have had the government and big
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:53.640]  corporations go in and tinker with their genetics and combine three people
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:45:00.760]  that's that's not a human they go on to say potentially redrawing ethical
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:06.840]  lines for designer babies the process works by replacing potentially variant
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:12.760]  DNA see it's potentially bad it's not that all the GMO and chemicals are
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.040]  triggering the cancers and things no no no it's potentially variant you
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:23.520]  understand DNA in the unfertilized eggs of a hopeful mother with disease
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:30.360]  free genes disease free they're saying your genes are disease from a donor US
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.720]  regulators today will begin weighing whether the procedure used only in
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.600]  monkeys so far is safe enough to be tested to humans hey sorry you know the
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.520]  psychological written by the Democratic Party manual says if you don't like
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.280]  government that's a mentally ill oh the genetics here show that he's gonna be an
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.560]  aggressive leader that's mentally ill we're gonna have to change those genetics
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.240]  who do they target with the with the Adderall and the Ritalin is the
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.720]  leadership males to burn their brains out with the impediment because the
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:04.760]  process would change only a small specific part of the genetic code yeah
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.400]  scientists say a baby would largely retain the physical characteristics of
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.800]  the parents still DNA from all three mother father and donor would remain with
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.760]  a child throughout lifetime opening questions about long-term effects for
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.280]  the generation yeah when they have more kids and the mutation starts and
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:26.560]  potentially the next that's the key ethicists worry that allowing pre-birth
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.200]  gene manipulation may one day lead to build the order designer babies it's
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:35.400]  already going on I was there at Charlie Sheen decided to spin the sperm on his
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.360]  kids to make sure he had boys and you can argue well he only had girls before
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.480]  he has a predisposition for girls he wants boys yeah but then where does it
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:48.720]  lead after that once you make this change if a female arises from the
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:53.280]  process and goes on to have children that change has passed on so is it
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.920]  forever says Phil Yasky chief science officer United
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.360]  mitochondrial disease Foundation yes see it's the by the way I never even read
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.480]  this article I knew it would be all about the mitochondrial DNA said by
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.200]  telephone that's uncharted territory we just don't know what it means no we do
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:17.840]  know what it means massive mutation permanent change of human germline has
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.280]  never been done before yeah it has in secret laboratories and we don't know
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.840]  what will happen in the future generations oh we have a really good
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:31.720]  idea it's not going to be pretty the food and drug administration is scheduled
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.960]  today and tomorrow to explore the issue at a meeting with doctors and research
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:38.800]  are scheduled to talk the FDA will then decide whether to allow scientists at
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.960]  organ health and science university in Portland who engineered the approach to
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.920]  move their testing program from the macaw monkeys to women potentially the
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.480]  procedure may cut off mitochondrial diseases that are passed down through
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:59.120]  females and occur in about one in four thousand people one example is Mela's
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.480]  syndrome which causes a person to have continuing small strokes that damage
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.880]  their brains leading to vision loss problems with movement dementia and
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.240]  death according to the National Institutes of Health and so opens the
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:17.240]  Pandora's box and again you have a Russian roulette people only want to
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.600]  have kids because they're scared of Down syndrome you got to roll the dice
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:26.320]  folks that's part of life got a roll the dice and jump on the Mayflower and go
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.920]  through you know vomiting in the hole of the ship with rats to make it over here
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.240]  and that half the party die and the last two British expeditions died before
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:42.160]  that Jamestown other areas you got to take a risk you've got we don't know the
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.520]  genetic code I mean you told a few years ago and we knew this was a fraud they
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:53.840]  said 98% or 96% of the DNA was garbage now they know it isn't garbage and it's
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:59.320]  the entire genetic code of everybody before you including other material that
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:05.080]  has the scientists becoming religious because their species never before seen
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:10.000]  in there ladies and gentlemen we are a master creation of the super being even
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.680]  you don't believe in that folks I mean it bare minimum there's no way this all
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.560]  just magically happened in an ocean and then all this came together all the top
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:23.840]  scientists are saying it's transpermia and off and off world stuff bare minimum
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.880]  folks if you don't believe in God believe me we were made there's stuff in

[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:42.600]  there and it's incredible and they're gonna go in there and we're gonna let
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.960]  the establishment with all their social engineering and all their dirty
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:49.280]  backgrounds all the things they've done we're gonna let them come into this
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.040]  which is not transparent at all because they proprietorily protect these
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.440]  companies and only people look and tell they do it they can hide anything they
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.600]  want they've been caught doing it this is an abomination and it will be the end
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.280]  of us if people wanted to voluntarily take their families and go on to off
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:12.480]  world colony basis and do experimentation I would be I would think
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.880]  that's reasonable if you want to sign on to be an experiment and do this I
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:22.440]  think that's your issue but you cannot do this here on this planet with a
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.760]  dumb down public that doesn't even understand what's happening and again
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.080]  I go back to what I said earlier the elite can't even run nuclear power

[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:37.080]  pretty smart compared to the general public but you're not that smart and I
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.800]  just can see that you we're really gonna destroy the planet here this is not a
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.840]  good move and I don't fear for my own body or even my own children I fear for

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.400]  giant globalist experiment they're trying to basically get us out of reality
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.520]  and insert us into their control television psychotronic positronic
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:47.200]  smart grid and we're in the clutches of really hardcore predators that think we
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.840]  need to be exterminated and their own record saying that and most trendy as
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:54.520]  you talk to go well there are too many people well even if you believe that
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:00.120]  you're in the crosshairs dummy and you know they'll beg for their lives when
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:03.400]  they're dying of cancer but right now they're just shuffling around watching
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:07.960]  you know sitcoms and dramas and everything's funny to them and it's just
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.440]  really disgusting it's really weird to see a false reality being brought
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:15.800]  down upon us and to see the general public not aware of it but I do see some
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.280]  major signs of awakening and that's a positive thing okay even holding a while
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.400]  appreciated Kevin and Canada you're on the air than Matt in the UK and others
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:29.600]  that go ahead so Alex I got a beef I want to settle with you so that the beef
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.800]  that I have is I've been listening for 17 years longer than I've even known my
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.240]  wife I think I got a pretty good read on you the problem is is your operation is
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.960]  starting to see more and more of the church where there's tons of preaching
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:50.120]  and money-making not a lot of change and before you respond to that I'll answer
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:57.880]  just want to say one more thing Jesse Ventura Larry Pratt Max Kaiser whenever
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:02.320]  they are questioned about you they'll stand behind you like you stand behind
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:09.160]  them well I don't even care what people say about me and I've heard Jesse say a
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:14.160]  lot of nice things about me on different shows and things so and I've
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.280]  heard Kaiser say a lot of nice things without me even looking for it but if
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:21.560]  someone attacks someone on one of my views I don't expect them to defend
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.840]  something that they disagree with but but look I'm gonna put you on hold for a
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.200]  minute I'm gonna come back to you but I'm gonna try to respond to what you just
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:37.400]  said none of us are perfect number one number two I cover the issues and try to
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.600]  give people knowledge believing in you that you'll be able to check out the
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.920]  info yourself learn even more than I know and then go out and affect change I
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:51.960]  have trailblazed alternative media we have reached hundreds of millions of
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:57.680]  people total and we promote liberty but for people to say you've never fixed
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.240]  anything Alex or you know you haven't come up with some master plan to reverse
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:08.800]  everything I'm up here saying don't authorize designer babies I'm up here
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.680]  saying let's get rid of abortion I'm up here saying it's not good to finance a
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:19.800]  war in Ukraine we helped stop the Syria war even the Syria government said that
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.800]  even our own corrupt government said that I just don't get the criticism you
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:29.320]  say making a lot of money it takes a lot of money to run this operation I don't
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.840]  get MPR money from taxpayers or stimulus money like MSNBC but then I'm
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:37.400]  even dirtier that I would sell high-quality products to finance our
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.280]  authors our operation it's just amazing I'm gonna come back to you by the way

[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.040]  the serious ones and I'm not calling for people supporter thanks but man I I
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:41.280]  work 18 hours a day many days and I've been doing this 19 years and you know I
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.960]  don't make any apologies about the fact that I drive a nice Ford F-150 pickup
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.160]  truck and I don't and I live in them you know decent house and I wear okay
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:55.080]  clothes but I don't worship materialism it's it's not my God it's way down the
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:59.320]  line on my pyramid of hierarchy of needs for those know the hierarchy of needs
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:04.320]  is you know up at the top is helping others and and building a better
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.920]  civilization and spirituality at the bottom of it is housing and clothing and
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:16.000]  and and heating and cooling and things like that but I mean I'm more than
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.680]  happy to be criticized by anything legitimate by the caller that's been
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:26.120]  listening 17 years I mean Kevin I think we've had some real success stories with
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:32.560]  this broadcast I think we've gotten better over time here on air at really
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.360]  articulating a lot of serious social issues that need to be discussed and
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:40.080]  debated I'm just trying to get people to realize reality is a lot deeper and
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.600]  wider than what mainstream media is trying to project but set me right I
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:49.280]  mean explain to me how I'm a church explain it all to me well first off
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:52.920]  thanks for letting me respond because you you literally could have let me go so
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:56.880]  thank you I love being criticized it's actually boring to me to be thanked I
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.360]  mean tell tell me though yeah and and and then secondly remember I'm a 17 year
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.520]  listener everything that you've ever talked about I listen every single day
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:09.400]  everything you ever talked about that goes into my brain so I'm not well I mean
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.240]  I think after 17 years people get irritated with something I get irritated
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.200]  myself maybe you need a break from the show maybe if you do your own show that's
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:19.240]  actually funny that you mentioned that because I was thinking the same thing
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:24.400]  for you and the reason why I say that is because if I'm a 17 year listener and
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.720]  I'm starting to lose a bit of faith there must be a reason why it's not just
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:31.480]  because I'm listening no it's because you you you you start associating me
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:36.240]  covering the problems with the problems at a subconscious level well I think
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.880]  it's actually a little bit more than that and probably right but I think what
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:45.040]  it has more to do with is I know you're right and a lot of people do as well but
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:49.680]  for the last 17 years if you had to measure your your accomplishments or
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:57.040]  your trophies by either what you've done to change whether it be drone killings
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.800]  whether it be poisoning the water if you were actually at the floor I'd pulled
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.520]  out a lot of the place but I don't deserve but a small part of that credit

[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:24.000]  800-25-99231 I'm gonna give him the last caller about 10 minutes but I want him
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.320]  to finish up his point he's being critical I want to find out exactly
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:32.480]  what he's getting at then coming up geoengineering no holy grail in quote
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.520]  climate change there's massive geoengineering going on changing our
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:42.000]  climate basically terraforming it also Berkeley girl among California children
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.120]  who contracted polio like illness it's up to 20 by the way these have been
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:52.400]  vaccinated children I should add whenever I hear about polio like polio
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:57.440]  like outbreaks where it's not polio it's always vaccine related overseas I think
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:00.560]  that's the main culprit here the main suspect that should be looked at that is
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.880]  coming up right now let's go back to Kevin Kevin I'm gonna give you about a
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.280]  minute to quantify your criticism as a 17-year listener exactly what you're
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:14.240]  getting at go ahead great I'll make it quick you keep pushing the mute button
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:17.240]  there so I can't actually get out what I'm trying to say but I'll make a whole
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:21.720]  long just a minute hold on just a minute now see you had about a minute or so
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:24.840]  before we went to break last hour you had a couple minutes of that short
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.560]  segment and you're on air right now are you okay hold on put him on hold now
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:34.560]  that's not a fair intellectual discussion I'm not hitting a mute button on
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.760]  you I don't have control of this phone call they're airing it in there now I
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.160]  just told them to turn you down so I could talk that's a fake intellectual
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:46.640]  argument to call in and say that I'm muting you when I'm giving you about
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.320]  three times longer than the other callers have had the day now I'm gonna
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:54.280]  give you I'm gonna give you two minutes and I'm watching the clock it's gonna
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:10:00.920]  be ten after in five seconds five four three two one you got two minutes go
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:06.000]  ahead okay I would appreciate if you could since you say that Jesse Ventura
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.440]  Larry Pratt Max Kaiser I'll have something good to say about you in
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.080]  public on TV or some kind of video recording if you could just give me
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.240]  three for each that I can go look three for each and I'll go out and have a
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.520]  look because you're the one that say that we're supposed to stick together and
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:27.920]  have each other's backs and when I look at Jesse Ventura who I look up to just
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.920]  as much as I look up to you and I look at Larry Pratt the exact same thing and
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.040]  they're not backing you that's all I have to say Alex you can use the rest for
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:41.400]  another caller okay so that's your criticism of me that's that's that's
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:49.240]  Juan bad I mean that sounded like high school or something I don't follow a
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.920]  lot of what Jesse Ventura and Larry Pratt do because I'm busy but I've
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:58.080]  actually heard Jesse Ventura say nice things about me on other shows and I've
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:05.760]  actually heard Max Kaiser say nice things about me without even trying to
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:09.600]  find it now I'm sure they disagree with me on some issues and that probably gets
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:16.080]  brought up but what is that even about listen it's not my job and I want to be
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:22.560]  clear about something here people always tell me hey Alex you're paranoid no I'm
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.760]  not paranoid when I know about thousands of declassified studies using
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:33.760]  lethal chemicals biologicals radiologicals on veterans on foster kids you
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.000]  name it that shows me we've had a long-term scientific elite that Eisenhower
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.520]  warned us of it's a lot of secret evil testing on the public to set that
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:44.680]  precedent I know about the US code that claims as long as it's for law
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:51.960]  enforcement or research purposes even even lethal testing they claim is legal
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:58.240]  well I say that's a fraudulent law in the US code is entitled 50 chapter 32 it
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:04.600]  bars secret testing but then authorizes it for law enforcement or research
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:11.680]  purposes and so I'm just up here trying to get people to think about big issues
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:18.280]  like that and all the secret testing and things that are going on I'm not trying
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:23.640]  to sound popular I'm not trying to say what's palatable for the establishment
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.400]  I'm not trying to go along with the system's talking points so that the
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:34.120]  system will put me on air I am trying to build my own media system and I'm
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:39.480]  trying to be as true as I can to the truth and to try to be as accurate as I
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.920]  can with all this research and information to really tell people what's
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.360]  going on in the world and I think if you go back to what I was saying 1718 19
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:51.160]  years ago now on air you will hear those old shows we ought to re-hear some of
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:56.720]  those from like 15 years ago and it is like I was in a time machine breaking
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.200]  down what was going to happen but I'm not in a time machine the globalist are
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.600]  very public about their programs it's all a giant scientific test with them
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:13.240]  tweaking and changing but it all basically goes in the same direction and
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:23.800]  so I don't care what other people say about me on air I don't care I mean you
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:26.800]  could take somebody like Mark Dice who I put on the map he's a talented guy
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:30.600]  eight nine years ago he'd do these videos and write books and stuff and I
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.760]  helped him more than anybody you get a niche in media as a media analyst he's
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:42.600]  got it as an RTF degree and then he got mad at me a few years ago and you know
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.720]  basically made up a bunch of stuff and attacked me and and and then after his
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.680]  attacks failed after about a year I said to him the prodigal son I said you're
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:55.040]  doing a lot of really good work and I said I forgive you and and I just did
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:00.040]  all this to show you a life lesson and as I'm a term or I realize it doesn't
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:05.480]  matter if people deny me to other folks when they're under pressure or they buy
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.440]  into the Cass Sunstein you know attack system of you know Alex Jones is being
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.400]  attacked I'll be popular by attacking I'm being attacked because I'm on point
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:18.760]  I'm being attacked because I'm on target and if you're over the target with a
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:23.240]  bomber you're gonna have flak you're gonna have the big guns firing at you
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:27.320]  and then exploding rounds that since wrapping around so I fly into the flak
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:31.040]  if I'm not being attacked if I'm not getting controversy if I'm not being
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:38.280]  demonized I'm not doing my job and it's that simple and I'm here to get people
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.240]  out of their comfort zone I'm here to shake people out of their their trance
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:45.400]  and if it was shocking to a nation of zombies even mainline conservatives to
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:50.600]  have me yell and scream at the BBC or yell and say this isn't a game to Pierce
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.040]  Morgan you notice in hindsight everyone says it's one of the best moments in
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.320]  TV ever that's all over the news the last two days people say it's a defining
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:01.600]  moment I had a major publisher call me yesterday and some media analysts and
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.200]  they were saying we believe that's when the tide turned in the debate on the
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:09.120]  second amendment was when we just called it all out and I'm not giving myself
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:14.120]  credit but folks when you're under attack and the enemy is flagrantly
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:19.240]  violating your rights and nakedly stomping around playing patty cake and
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.280]  being soft-voiced about it is a recipe of slaves but I'll be the first to tell
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:30.440]  you I could do a better job in hindsight a lot of times when I hear my show or
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:34.360]  when I make a mistake but it doesn't matter I'm in the arena doing the best I
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:39.160]  can so I've learned to just move forward and I think it's good to get some
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.200]  criticism sometimes you know it's good but at the same time it becomes a
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.920]  distraction and there's never really any meat to it or there's made up rumors or
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:55.320]  there's you know all this other garbage you know if you hear somebody not back
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:00.360]  me up or say something you you talk to them don't don't talk to me I'm not my
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:07.760]  brother's keeper okay and that's what it comes down to is that I'm here to try to
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:10.400]  promote other people that have interesting ideas to get people thinking
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:16.120]  I'm not here to promote myself I'm here to die if need be because I want to live
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.560]  forever through my progeny I want humanity to succeed I care about the
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:29.800]  big game I care about the long-term goals I'm alive it's that simple all right
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:32.800]  we've been making people whole way too long Matt is in the United Kingdom and
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:36.520]  I apologize for making you hold so long but I had to respond to that caller Matt
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.800]  go ahead you're on the air that's fine hello Alex how you doing buddy yeah
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:44.160]  basically you know I agree with everything you're saying there's quite a
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.520]  moving little speech there and Pierce Morgan last night all over the BBC
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.920]  they're ripping him to bits but you know they showed the best bit of you
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.040]  ripped it in you know it was buddy it was all you what a milestone what a
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:59.720]  success to get rid of him here's the vampire blood sucking vampire reptile

[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.720]  think Matt drudge but he deserves it it was Matt drudge put a tweet out to them
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:17.680]  and that's why they called me and and and weeks after he did it they go no Matt
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.000]  drudges tweet you know we think it's a great idea and then I went that's that's

[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:42.960]  much we can do what do you think overall of the cloning news and and and the
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:48.760]  genetics of three parents into one baby oh well you're talking major ethical
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.720]  issues there really let's be honest I mean the human soul is a very precious
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:58.040]  thing and is it ethical to you know the factory produce human souls no it's not
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.320]  that mass essentially what we're going to be doing sir opens up massive ethical
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:05.400]  debates no it's definitely wrong and then of course you've got the GMO and all
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:08.680]  the diseases and everything else they come no definitely not definitely not
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.320]  well that's the key they give us all this garbage to destroy our genetics and
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.200]  then we have to go to them to have kids and then they backdoor all their changes
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:20.360]  into us to make us literally servile biological androids in all the
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:24.720]  sucklies on words yeah yeah well that's the plan you see I mean I was doing a
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:29.840]  psychotherapy course at the local university and they were teaching
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.400]  behaviorism you know we're all apples and and it was that's the mainstream we
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.840]  have no free will and it's all stimuli the truth is they want our free will
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:44.120]  they want our soul they want to enslave us they want your soul and that they
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:47.560]  will deny the human spirit they deny determinism the only way that they can
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.000]  control you is with psychotropic medication you know if they treat you
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.400]  like an animal we're not animals we have that animal nature but we have part of
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.560]  the animal brain but we have the conscious mind the animals don't have
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:01.800]  that and we have the ability to change our environment and envision things
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:08.520]  exactly Beethoven's not an animal Vincent van Gogh's not an animal we are an
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.520]  incredible divine species made in the image of the creator we are made by by

[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:25.000]  that God experiences the universe through us as just another manifestation of
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.720]  our creator made in God's image and these blasphemous control freaks know

[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:34.600]  auditing of some of the biggest banking institutions over the past several years yeah they're the they're the new Arthur Anderson yeah leading up to the financial crisis they were found to have been deeply involved in obvious securities frauds fraud that involved big mortgage assets Taylor Bean and Whitaker Mortgage Corporation looked
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:28:00.600]  at up the sharing of confidential information on several occasions they were busted for being involved with clients that were caught money laundering HSBC for example and paid settle they paid settlements of undisclosed amounts for their fraud involvement Deloitte has been involved in so many scandals to make your headspin in February of 2007 the Federal Reserve of New York's board extended the contract of international
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  auditing company Deloitte to Tomatsu limited the future Treasury Secretary at the time Tim Geithner was president of the New York Fed at the time by the way they're tied in they're tied into the NSA to even though Deloitte violated the New York Banking Law Statute 3610 by disclosing confidential information of other Deloitte clients to standard chartered and that was just the tip of the iceberg Deloitte's
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:46.600]  interest here in Florida are protected by one of the most powerful lobbyists in Tallahassee Brian Ballard who is a major campaign fundraiser for Governor Rick Scott and the other GOP officials so you gotta imagine though he's he's up for reelection and that whole thing all those people that dropped out
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:59.600]  you know not getting paid for six weeks can't file the numbers came down when it came down under 7% they were able to drop the federal extensions so all these people drop off the unemployment numbers come down and Rick Scott looks great
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:05.600]  sure they're gaming all the unemployment numbers in the inflation numbers everything is as phony is a $3 bill

[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.600]  but I am not going to take this kind of crap on my property especially
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:53.600]  no I hear you I hear you and that's why they're getting armored vehicles and you're enough they want to war with us so bad they can taste it and not even the average cop but their bosses are people that want to teach American school children 2 plus 2 equals 5 literally I mean that says everything you need to know about these people they are the scum of the earth
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:38:14.600]  anything else Duke what was your other take on the GMO get something else to say well on the GMOs we've got a couple natural places around Oklahoma City Sprouts and Whole Foods and everything and I've gone to even them and they don't even even the managers have no idea where this thing comes from they don't they cannot tell you where it comes from
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:27.600]  well a lot of it certified a lot of it isn't but a lot of stuff at whole paycheck Whole Foods is not non GMO organic but a lot of it is it'll actually have numbers on it it'll be listed but I hear you and I appreciate your call
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:40.600]  and again folks it isn't like they cross to squash to make a better squash with open pollination with a hybrid this is where they go in and fundamentally change the plant
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:59.600]  and a lot of these things are plants that grow their own pesticide off of bacteria toxins or fungus toxins and they argue well this fungus normally occurs in corn yeah they boost it a thousand times with the BT Monsanto corn there's other varieties
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:19.600]  they take it and boost the toxin 1000 times what sometimes naturally occurs as a natural pesticide it's a symbiotic relationship with the corn and other plants and the fungus or the bacteria depending on which one it is and then if bugs eat it they die folks and then we're eating it
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:40.600]  it's a pharmacological crop look it up 15 years ago they were growing live HIV in corn open air in Texas that's what's going on they can grow chemicals in corn they could they can engineer corn to grow Coca-Cola in it if they want that's how neat plants are look up pharmacological crops they can do anything
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  we're not in Kansas anymore folks we are in the advanced 21st century the year is probably about 2045 right now to technologically speaking John and Michigan you're on the air
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:10.600]  hey Alex Colin mainly because you know you know we were bought at a price and so we cannot become slaves of men you know and like government as I see it is just man you know so
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:15.600]  it's systems of extraction systems of enslavement systems of authoritarianism
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:28.600]  right and mainly I've had this idea for a while like I don't know why everyone doesn't you know file suit towards the IRS mainly because for stealing our identity
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:39.600]  everyone you know has a lot of throws a lot of words around citizens person all this but like the legal you know definitions there's three different different definitions for the term United States
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:49.600]  you know there's the country the United States and there's the federal zone the United States and then there's the collective states of the union you know and like
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:41:01.600]  it's the same thing turns to what a citizen you know we're not citizens if you're if you're born this country or your parents or you know you're a national you're a state national you're a member of your state and
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.600]  that's right that's right originally you were a citizen of your state and they had for a mutual defense combine the federal government
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:17.600]  yeah and it's sad because a lot of people don't grow up learning any of that and like also the average American doesn't know that the earth orbits the sun
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:27.600]  it's pretty insane main person I think you should have a show to Deborah Tavares because she's the smart meter lady you know a lot of weapons for quiet wars
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:32.600]  I think we've had her we've had her on a couple times very very interesting lady John
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:40.600]  she's very even to this like taxation stuff but I think we should file suit against IRS for stealing our identities I mean because most people spend in the 1040
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:50.600]  and being residents and plus you violate your fourth amendment your fifth amendment you waive your right to incrimination I appreciate your call
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:58.600]  money magazines done and others have done 30 40 50 different tax returns the same tax return to different CPAs they all give you a different answer
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:11.600]  and again it was set up in 1913 the Federal Reserve that same week they passed the IRS act it wasn't even widespread implemented until the 50s it is it is a tax to offshore banks
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:21.600]  not just an absolute fact Ronald Reagan's own commission found in 81 not one cent of the IRS money goes around the country it goes to interest on the debt to offshore banks
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.600]  which the debt only gets bigger because that's how they control us
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:33.600]  just like banks don't want to farm or never got a debt I mean this is really 101 folks and old timers knew this so we couldn't be enslaved
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:38.600]  I mean we are so enslaved it is just unbelievable Clinton Ohio Clint you're on the air
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:50.600]  Oh yes I'm calling because of the Teddy's law that I emailed you about I emailed the blaze I emailed coast to coast
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:43:00.600]  tell me about the law what is it that was the Teddy's law where they're going to have a CSB come into your house if you wanted to home school
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:10.600]  oh yeah that was in that's in Ohio right I called I emailed you in the next day you covered it man so as far as anybody saying you don't change anything
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:24.600]  that law was gone in two days we had people from the Philippines from Canada from Romania from Israel Germany and the UK all call that senator and say that that's ridiculous
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:32.600]  so I know you always have adults calling up and saying you stop so here this is for the future generation man
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:45.600]  thank you Mr. Jones thank you Mr. Jones thank you Mr. Jones so you did do something man don't let anybody tell you and there's the kids
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:51.600]  that's what it's all about beautiful anything else Clint nope that's it keep up the good work man I will brother
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:44:02.600]  imagine the horror of being Clint where they're going to send CPS to every homeschoolers home to open a criminal investigation that you're an abuser
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:08.600]  or make you get a teaching certificate to be able to homeschool your children that's the final domino folks coming for our kids
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:14.600]  doesn't matter the homeschoolers when all the spelling bees all the geography bees that they're sought after by colleges and get full
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:23.600]  tuitions and scholarships it doesn't matter the statistically they're not all screwed up and again homeschooling
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:29.600]  homeschooling there's these giant communities of homeschoolers it's people that want out of the system and that's what's so good about it
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:37.600]  I mean my parents were naive they were really good people but they grew up in the 50s they put me in high school in Dallas and it was unbelievable
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:48.600]  the sex people like oh that sounds fun no it wasn't fun the fighting the drugs which I never got into the corrupt police
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  the meanness of the people the persecution of nerds the cliques and I was like an animal in high school and so I was oblivious to it all
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:07.600]  and didn't even know that you know I'd been basically the most popular person in school because I was just completely like a mad dog
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:17.600]  you know just not in a bad way but like an animal I was just didn't even click into any of it and didn't follow anybody's style
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:28.600]  didn't you know go with any of that and saw the disdain by the cliques and things and all told them they were scum with their face
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:36.600]  but even though I was super popular I was in high school three years in Dallas so I was in so much trouble one year I had to take off half the year
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:43.600]  to work on the ranch and then two years in Austin I came to Austin and just kept my head down and you know ended up making straight hundreds
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  I just got out of school but I didn't mean to get off into myself and say I was popular in high school
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:46:02.600]  the point was is that it was a bad experience it was a really bad experience it was empty and I just cannot imagine throwing my children
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:12.600]  in sixth grade where kids that have flunked four grades who are really fourteen and you're eleven and they're beating you up
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:21.600]  I mean games beating you up it's gotta be a hundred times I was beat up before I started literally just stomping the hell out of people
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:28.600]  but my whole point is is that I guess it made me who I am today but I would not want that on my children
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:36.600]  and I'm not knocking my parents I know they listen they were old school you know coming with black eyes well you just better be tougher next time
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:42.600]  that wasn't some macho bravado thing that's just what old time Texans are like that's how my dad's dad was to him
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:48.600]  but it's just a different world absolutely different world these public schools are hellish ladies and gentlemen
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:54.600]  some of them aren't that bad in rural areas but my god big cities phew man might as well just put your kid in a juvenile hall
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:59.600]  it's bad and the problem is you beat up one gang member you gotta fight the rest of them later
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:07.600]  then you beat them up and you gotta beat up their big brothers then you gotta beat up their ex con you know older cousin
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:14.600]  who's twenty five years old when you're sixteen and that's Dallas for you you know somebody you're at a sonic
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:19.600]  and somebody comes out of the back of a truck with a knife trying to kill you I mean it's just animal land
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:25.600]  I tell you one thing I like about liberals in Austin Texas at least it's changing now cause all the Dallas folks are moving in and stuff
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:31.600]  is that people don't kill each other all over the place and I just I really don't like getting in fights with people
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:38.600]  I really don't like everybody got something to prove and start in trouble cause I mean I've had enough of it a lot of it
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:43.600]  let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Texas Ray you're on the air go ahead
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:46.600]  hey Alex how are you doing man I'm on the talk
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  yeah brother what's on your mind today
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:58.600]  if you look up KVUD man claims DPS falsely arrested him I'm surprised that you haven't put my video on there man
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.600]  you actually have somebody fighting back that knew his rights that knew the laws
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.600]  well I must have missed it tell me it's KVUE that's local TV and again Austin
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:11.600]  man claims DPS falsely arrested him
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.600]  okay I haven't seen that video what happened
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  there's two videos on there and the police violated I believe it was eight of my constitutional rights
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:24.600]  and I believe it was they committed 120 felonies amongst the six officers
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:27.600]  well I haven't seen the video what happened to you
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:35.600]  well it's a long story I need to sit down and talk to you about it I mean it's a long story but they committed so many felonies in the jail
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:44.600]  and otherwise I mean they I mean just like the bond they violated my constitutional right by it should have been like a $200 bond
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:48.600]  which actually shouldn't be anything at all but they gave me an $8,000 bond
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:52.600]  well let me tell you the state of Texas I was talking to a friend and he showed it to me I wanted a piece on it
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:49:00.600]  he has a 1993 Chevy Silverado that's worth about $3,000 on a good day in the blue book
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:07.600]  and he went in to get license of registration as he bought it from his body for $3,000
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:16.600]  and they told him this thing is worth $57,000 even though all the books show different and we want something like $12,000
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:22.600]  and they laughed at him and said go get a state appraiser well he can't find a state appraiser
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:25.600]  and when he goes in they all laugh at him and that's happened to everybody I know
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:33.600]  the states are just robbing everyone and if you get arrested for not having your driver's license on you or whatever
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:38.600]  when you get there they'll do all these fines and fees yeah I know the government's just gone to seed
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:46.600]  and the government's been told raise taxes over and over again or raise taxes or you're going to go bankrupt
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  well no amount could ever keep us from going bankrupt because they want us to go bankrupt
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:56.600]  but listen a caller called earlier and said thanks for calling and thanks for covering how they tried to ban homeschooling in Ohio
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:02.600]  okay I'm glad I saw that and covered it I remember covering it but I mean I'm not omnipresent bro
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:07.600]  I don't know about your case with the DPS usually you say you're surprised I didn't cover it
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:11.600]  it's just somebody that stood up to them and fought back and is winning
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.600]  no I know but do you understand that I didn't know about it
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:16.600]  no I understand you have a lot of your play
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.600]  no but you're saying you're surprised I mean so you're winning how are you winning

[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  and I've still got a little bit of a hoarse voice so I'm not trying to talk like Batman
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:11.600]  I assure you this is what my voice sounds like but I probably need to take some time off
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:17.600]  I'm probably gonna go visit a voice doctor I've never really gone or had my I guess a throat
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:23.600]  I whatever they call it doctor I've got a good name of one just to get checked out what's going on down there
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:27.600]  I've seen another doctor last week and they recommended I do that when they were looking down my throat
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:32.600]  after all my yelling and screaming didn't mean to get the signature voice on purpose
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:37.600]  there's a lot of news I haven't gotten to that's up on infowars.com and prismplotted.com
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:44.600]  one of them is really creepy secret US government watch list forces companies to place hold on orders
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Australian David Jones told his order had been delayed due to the name being flagged by a database
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:57.600]  a secret US government watch list is forcing companies to place orders on hold in case they want to grab them
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:01.600]  and put spy tech in them without warrants according to an Australian named David Jones
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  whose name was flagged up a suspicious when he tried to purchase computer parts
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  after Jones processed a innocuous order with element 14 a large distributor of electronic and computer parts
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:19.600]  in Australia he arrived at the company's trade counter to pick up the goods only to be told that his order had been placed on hold
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:25.600]  well the NSA admits it came out with Snowden that they reroute stuff worldwide to put spy tech in it
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:30.600]  after confirming that the hold was not due to his parts being restricted or suspicious
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:36.600]  anyway Jones was told that it wasn't the parts that had been flagged it was his name that had been flagged
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:43.600]  see all commerce is tracked and it came out in the news yesterday that the TSA pre-screening thing is quote under fire
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.600]  because it's like the NSA I think that was AP yesterday that's what I've been saying day one it's an NSA scandal folks
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:57.600]  it's their tracking everything you do before you ever even leave your house and that was the winning video
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:04.600]  make me air the winning video tomorrow I never announced the winner I was supposed to announce that last week
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  that's how punch drunk I am and how busy we'll announce the winner in fact we'll announce the winner today
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:18.600]  and then I'll play it tomorrow but it deals with that and then continuing here

[03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:25.600]  Alex Jones
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:28.600]  We're going back to your phone calls right now
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:31.600]  Fred and Canada you're on the air go ahead
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:32.600]  Hello Mr. Jones
[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:33.600]  Hey buddy
[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:35.600]  Hey how's it going
[03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:36.600]  It's going alright
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:39.600]  I see you're very relaxed today that's good to see you're relaxed for a change
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.600]  I am a little bit relaxed my life's so insane why not
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:50.600]  Hey hey why not it's always good to take one day of you know there's one day to relax for a minute
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:56.600]  The reason why I'm calling is because I did a discovery about nine months ago
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:01:02.600]  And then I took a trip to Beirut Lebanon for about eight days to go for a wedding
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:10.600]  And I suggest that anybody who doesn't know what's going on in the world to get out of it for a minute and then come back to it and realize what you have
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:15.600]  Because we truly don't understand the freedoms that we do have even though we are slaves
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:22.600]  We don't realize how much freedoms we have until we go somewhere and they're completely taken away from you
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:29.600]  Because when I was there all I felt was fear all I felt was like I felt like a literal slave
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:35.600]  Like that movie 12 Years a Slave that doesn't compare to what I went through in those eight days
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:42.600]  Like honestly I would have much rather someone with me at least I know who my master would be
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:48.600]  I'd rather that than go somewhere and describe what it was like to visit the Middle East
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:56.600]  Oh my goodness where do I start the first day I got there the next day there was a car bomb in a supermarket
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:02:01.600]  Like it was like a clothing area to buy clothes
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:09.600]  Two girls that were best friends were buying dresses to their prom or some school dance and they both got killed for what?
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:16.600]  Like there was no prime minister there was no political influence they just wanted to kill people
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:22.600]  And on all honesty it was the Saudi Arabians that are trying to do this as a child
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:27.600]  Our loving allies as usual we support whoever is most horrible
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:35.600]  Oh yeah obviously but you know as a kid I was told that as you know as a Lebanese person you're going to be persecuted your whole life
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:40.600]  They want you for your land they want you for your water they want you for your natural resources
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  That's not true they want us for our oil apparently there's this huge oil basin underneath the Lebanese grounds
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:55.600]  And Israeli government right now as we speak are in the oceans of where you can barely see close to Cyprus
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:58.600]  Drilling the oil out of the Lebanese oil
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:04.600]  So what they're doing now as we speak through the media through television through everything my wife does
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  Full Lebanese and she watches all the shows
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.600]  Every show she ever watches all they talk about is what are you still doing here
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:16.600]  You know they're trying to push all the mostly the Christians because they know if they keep the Muslims there
[03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:20.600]  You know they'll just eventually kill themselves though but they want to take all the Christians out
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:22.600]  They don't want the ones that fight
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.600]  I'm just saying that you know this as a Christian I'm a very open minded Christian person
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:29.600]  I have a lot of best friends that are Muslim and I think that
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:32.600]  You don't understand but Christians are being persecuted interesting Fred
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:37.600]  I'm going to take one more sorry to Jay Jeremy and Chris I got time for Dave and Michigan Dave go ahead

[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.600]  Sometimes I want to beat you up but most of the time I want to give you a big fat hug
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:57.600]  You asked the other day what are people doing to stay out of the system to resist

[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:23.600]  They lied it isn't I wouldn't let them put it on it's still not on my meter spinning backwards
