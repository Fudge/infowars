[00:00.000 --> 00:10.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:10.240 --> 00:18.680]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:18.680 --> 00:24.800]  jones I'll guarantee you it's an intelligence operation to infiltrate
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.280]  and set up these men general who sent thousands of inappropriate emails to
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.260]  a woman who reported harassment by patreus mistress you got the FBI spying
[00:34.260 --> 00:37.200]  on the CIA director give me a break ladies and gentlemen that's off the
[00:37.200 --> 00:41.760]  charts we're gonna be breaking that down with dr. Steve Pachennick coming up
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.600]  getting his take on what's really going on he personally knows patreus goes to
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.120]  the CFR and called out general Dempsey he said there wouldn't be an Iran attack
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.080]  because the joint chiefs had told Israel there wouldn't be I respect what he has
[00:55.080 --> 01:00.000]  to say but we're gonna try to flesh it all out coming up this is gonna be some
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.600]  pretty powerful radio Gary in New York you're on the air thanks for holding sir
[01:04.600 --> 01:11.480]  are you celebrating Obama's victory no sir no I'm not I'm a true patriot first
[01:11.480 --> 01:15.440]  off I bless you and your staff I appreciate all you guys do thank you
[01:15.440 --> 01:21.640]  um you know I was thinking maybe this before I get on my a bomb you know it's
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.760]  a push in no bomb unism statement possibly this put the trace thing could
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.640]  be a blessing in disguise maybe you know start some things up possibly get
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.120]  Obama maybe in some trouble well my gut is this is what they did with Nixon and
[01:40.120 --> 01:44.200]  others when somebody goes into a second term they're dangerous to even the
[01:44.200 --> 01:47.840]  establishment because they're not facing reelection and if a president ever
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.120]  tried to actually act like a president and not just a total puppet they have to
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.800]  assassinate them but they don't like that either because people won't buy that
[01:54.800 --> 01:58.800]  anymore like Kennedy so instead what they do is they destroy with a scandal but
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.040]  they don't like scandals that deal with corporate corruption so they usually get
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.720]  you with a sex scandal like Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and again I was no
[02:07.720 --> 02:10.880]  fan of Bill Clinton but that was all part and parcel of that the Republicans
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.640]  wouldn't go after him you know for the missile secrets of Laurel and Hughes the
[02:15.640 --> 02:19.760]  Communist Chinese or the death of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown they went
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.400]  after him on a sex thing because that's isolated to just that and that's
[02:24.400 --> 02:27.480]  probably what's gonna end up happening here I think it's a balance of power
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.520]  thing that's happening but again that's that's that we know this is a big
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.240]  scandal we know it's bigger than what they're saying we know it's an
[02:34.240 --> 02:37.600]  intelligence operation we know they knew about Benghazi we know they lied
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.040]  about it the question is who's behind it what are the real players what's the
[02:41.040 --> 02:45.400]  outcome gonna be I don't think we really know that yet you can speculate but I
[02:45.400 --> 02:50.400]  want proof I go ahead and make your other points sir well real quick it's
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.040]  just ironic that you know hitlery Quinn is going away
[02:54.040 --> 03:00.120]  Patrice isn't going to testify it's just really shady and that on top of the all
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.000]  the executive orders Obama passed in his first four years should have been
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.960]  frightening enough and that gets me to my point but he gave us a phone he's
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.800]  gonna do more I'm sorry oh it's crazy and and you know you got people like
[03:12.800 --> 03:18.680]  that idiot Eric from New York calling up yesterday you know the thing that
[03:18.680 --> 03:24.680]  that discussed me the most is it seems like the the globalist double standard
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.200]  is trickled down to to the dumb down masses I mean oh no they think it's
[03:30.200 --> 03:35.480]  good to kill other people so they have more room in there but they don't
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.680]  understand they're being killed too is that what you were gonna say yeah well
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.320]  you know it doesn't it doesn't make sense that the average person I mean your
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.600]  son this is more intelligent than 90% of the people in this country and you know
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.520]  these guys they could kill we kill we go to jail they could sell drugs we sell
[03:52.520 --> 03:56.640]  drugs we go to jail they could push away vaccines we push away vaccines on our
[03:56.640 --> 04:00.920]  kids they have CPS come snatch up our children you know and it's trickled down
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.240]  to the people and you have you know I live in the broth unfortunately it's
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.040]  bittersweet I understand it's a police city state I understand that but I got
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.920]  I'm Italian I got a lot of people who are African-American they're not dumb
[04:14.920 --> 04:20.240]  down and ignorant and people forget when Planned Parenthood was created they
[04:20.240 --> 04:26.120]  used people who were who were the black faces of the society movements and use
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.440]  them to push their eugenics on the black society and yet you have all these
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.680]  people if you're white and you didn't vote for Obama you vote for a white guy
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.920]  your race no that's what's crazy is that I'm like hey they're killing half the
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.920]  black people in abortions the guys like I don't care I love it you're racist and
[04:42.920 --> 04:46.360]  I'm like so I mean I'm telling you man it's sick because I'm telling you I've
[04:46.360 --> 04:49.720]  been around those type of people we got a bunch of video clips over we're gonna
[04:49.720 --> 04:52.440]  air it soon where there's black folks saying yeah kill the little nappy head
[04:52.440 --> 04:59.000]  black kids because it's this idea of kill somebody I'll get more it's amazing

[08:33.600 --> 08:42.920]  November 2012 we are seeing massive geopolitical movements worldwide we are
[08:42.920 --> 08:48.320]  seeing incredible movements inside the military industrial complex what you're
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.080]  seeing from my perspective we'll get dr. Pachennick's take on this is soft
[08:52.080 --> 08:59.360]  power coos going on back and forth you have the FBI on record and and even
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.240]  judge Andrew Napolitano was saying this is clearly illegal unconstitutional
[09:03.240 --> 09:10.320]  spying on the CIA director without warrants because another woman who was
[09:10.320 --> 09:18.840]  involved in in in the host hospitality a volunteer at the special forces
[09:18.840 --> 09:26.600]  command bases she was a volunteer they're helping the men in social services
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.680]  she was a social volunteer what a nice lady and you've got the head of the
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.000]  Afghanistan operations sending her thousands of inappropriate according
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.440]  to the Associated Press emails dr. Report.com has it all calling it a four
[09:41.440 --> 09:47.800]  star circus info wars.com has it all as well so does prisonplanet.com we're
[09:47.800 --> 09:50.640]  streaming video right now for radio listeners and they like to watch at
[09:50.640 --> 09:56.400]  info wars news.coms you can see all these articles and documents and photos
[09:56.400 --> 10:02.640]  that we're talking about but I remember just a few days after the Benghazi
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.800]  situation we had dr. Steve Pachennick on who is a member of the council on
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.160]  foreign relations he confronted a few months ago the joint chiefs of staff
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.720]  chairman Dempsey at the CFR and said you know that he needed to go public and
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.320]  say don't attack Iran that later even came out in the news months after he
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.400]  talked about it and to his credit Dempsey went public and said it's a
[10:26.400 --> 10:29.960]  suicide mission just as many as the Israelis are saying it's going to be a
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.080]  catastrophe including the former massage chief instead of using soft power
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.640]  against Iran some want to go to this larger regional war that will probably
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.400]  lead to a third world war at least conventional world war and you saw
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.120]  Benghazi we know it didn't go five hours it went seven hours we know there's
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.520]  been a cover-up we know it was an orchestrated attack why did the White
[10:50.520 --> 10:54.640]  House come out and say it wasn't an orchestrated attack then dr. Pachennick
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.520]  said it was a neocon internal government operation as a false flag October
[11:00.520 --> 11:05.520]  surprise to knock out Obama he's been critical of Obama saying the bin Laden
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.080]  story was a hoax he said it ten years ago on my show he said it right after it
[11:09.080 --> 11:12.800]  happened and that started to come out Stratford responded the mainstream media
[11:12.800 --> 11:16.320]  responded and said that a lot of the intelligence community weren't buying it
[11:16.320 --> 11:21.680]  so this became a big international story but also within it within internal
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.360]  intelligence it became really big and dr. Pachennick was approached by
[11:25.360 --> 11:30.840]  different spy agencies massage CIA you name it I was approached off record and
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.920]  asked to shut up I have not shut up I have been threatened as well so you know
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.200]  at a certain point even though I researched this stuff no exaggeration
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.880]  18 hours a day and even dream about it because once you get obsessed with
[11:42.880 --> 11:47.280]  something and you've got a decent brain the world opens up I'm not sure what's
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.280]  going on there's a cover-up I know it was an attempted false flag at some
[11:51.280 --> 11:54.880]  level I know there were missiles at that facility the thousands that are missing
[11:54.880 --> 11:58.640]  to be shipped into Syria that's now come out we said that a month ago dr.
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.840]  Tarpley and others did we know that the ambassador was starting to become critical
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.320]  of what was happening that since been confirmed Pachennick said that so that
[12:07.320 --> 12:10.880]  backs up some of what he's saying but I don't get and we're gonna walk through
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.320]  this here today I wanted to give us the big picture first and simplify thinking
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.480]  into more details I don't get if it's a if it's some type of internal false flag
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.480]  October surprise against Obama because certain power structures wanted in you
[12:25.480 --> 12:28.720]  know to control the middle of the military industrial complex trough and
[12:28.720 --> 12:34.240]  wanted a hot war against Iran why Obama stood down why he lied about it why he
[12:34.240 --> 12:39.560]  gave the press conferences why the US ambassador to the UN rice shed on all
[12:39.560 --> 12:42.880]  different news shows that Sunday after it happened the day after that it was
[12:42.880 --> 12:48.920]  just a protest going wrong why the cover-up if if it was a black op against
[12:48.920 --> 12:54.000]  him okay and now why are they purging betray us why are they purging the head
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.720]  of african why are they purging who was over Benghazi why are they purging the
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.360]  head of the afghanistan operation this is all happening all connected to this one
[13:04.360 --> 13:11.160]  woman is this woman a operative is this woman what they call a honeypot that's
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.440]  a question we're gonna ask and dr. Pachennick again is an MD PhD in American
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.040]  psychiatrist trained and served under Kissinger former State Department
[13:19.040 --> 13:22.000]  official author and publisher he of course has written many a co-written
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.840]  many of the Tom Clancy books have been turned into major movies and TV shows and
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.200]  series he's a critically acclaimed author of psycho political thrillers and co-
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.240]  creator of the best-selling Tom Clancy's op-center and net for just name a few
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.360]  trained in psychiatry at Harvard University international relations at
[13:36.360 --> 13:41.280]  the same time only got to have two degrees at the same time MIT his novels
[13:41.280 --> 13:44.520]  are based on over 20 years experience resolving international crises and
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.160]  hostage situations for the Department of State before administration Steve
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.320]  Pachennick.com and notice he's revamped and upgraded his site looks really good
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.160]  and of course if you really look up his name he's been involved in overthrows of
[13:56.160 --> 14:01.000]  governments using psych warfare to get people to kill you know we're talking
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.280]  about this on air but the London telegraph you can correct me if I'm wrong says
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.880]  that he tricked the communists into killing the Italian prime minister things
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.040]  like that so it's a serious guy he joins us now sure I know I've thrown a lot out
[14:12.040 --> 14:15.400]  there that's what I do is everybody kind of gets some of the pieces I want to
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.880]  start with the big picture you said that there were internal jockeying and things
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.680]  going on I'd like to start with Petraeus and what's happening now lead that
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.640]  into Benghazi lead that into bin Laden and and and what the power structure is
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.760]  doing right now with the internal tectonic fissures dr. Pachennick thank
[14:32.760 --> 14:36.440]  you for joining us thank you Alex for having me on the show let me let me
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.960]  start with number one basically what Petraeus is doing is doing what all
[14:40.960 --> 14:47.640]  generals have done previously is to basically fall on the sword of Malaysia
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.840]  basically take himself out because he probably did not agree with the decisions
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.520]  of general density and Anna and what I call the choir boys the people who are
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.520]  Donlan Brandon the president of the south what this really is he is a
[15:03.520 --> 15:10.160]  internal fight between what is the military a culture which is rising
[15:10.160 --> 15:14.400]  something I encourage against the civilian culture which was really
[15:14.400 --> 15:20.320]  dominated by the CIA an antiquated tia and it's been a power structure fight
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.920]  for a very very long time over 20 years probably starting with the back to the
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.760]  bush senior going through the Clinton administration where you had two different
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.520]  types of cultures trying to dominate our foreign policy and it was much more
[15:35.520 --> 15:39.920]  Machiavellian than anybody realized it was behind the scenes what you have as
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.600]  the tia that's really dysfunctional that is consisting of people who have
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.520]  never really been able to acclimate to the new world the world which become
[15:49.520 --> 15:55.040]  more electronic what precise more incisive and what happened is you have a lot of
[15:55.040 --> 16:00.200]  men who are in the 70s and 80s many of them were alcoholics who I treated many
[16:00.200 --> 16:04.520]  of them came out of a Catholic religion I have nothing against Catholicism people
[16:04.520 --> 16:10.280]  like Dempsey who's a chairman of joint chiefs staff Brandon of Donald and all
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.200]  of whom really were not very qualified to run anything other than serious the
[16:15.200 --> 16:18.600]  past failure so I'll give you an example Brandon who's now the count of
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.560]  terrorism had was in charge of the towers that blew up in Saudi Arabia he's
[16:24.560 --> 16:30.800]  totally incompetent station chief who's been an advisor and not only Clinton but
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.240]  went through Bush Junior was involved in 9-11 the original 9-11 and it's
[16:35.240 --> 16:39.920]  created a total series of false narratives that the CIA has been very
[16:39.920 --> 16:45.520]  not effective in doing including the 9-11 Osama bin Laden story Osama bin
[16:45.520 --> 16:49.440]  Laden Rage which was false and now it finally came to the compensation of
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.720]  Benghazi Benghazi is really the trigger point of the entire conflict between our
[16:55.720 --> 17:01.440]  US military which is a highly trained very precise organization which would not
[17:01.440 --> 17:09.040]  tolerate the ad hoc or the kind of a willy-nilly efforts of the CIA to create
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.240]  all kinds of conflicts and the incompetence of our stability in government
[17:13.240 --> 17:18.560]  including Obama including Hillary Clinton who has had a history of men who
[17:18.560 --> 17:23.320]  have died all along the side who've allowed men to die remember Foster she
[17:23.320 --> 17:28.200]  herself has been a very bad the bastard figure in our farm policy going all the
[17:28.200 --> 17:32.440]  way back to Bill Clinton but she encouraged him not to get involved in
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.120]  the killing in the massacre of 800,000 people who are one that nobody knows
[17:36.120 --> 17:39.160]  about sure doc listen I'm gonna give you the floor to get into all this but just
[17:39.160 --> 17:42.600]  for listeners tuning in right now I understand some of the background you're
[17:42.600 --> 17:46.160]  talking to people out there in government not just the audience but but I
[17:46.160 --> 17:49.920]  mean come on you've got the same woman connected to all these generals you've
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.120]  got to forget about the woman Alex but I want you to remember all of this is
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.800]  what we call a cover story and a honey trap that doesn't really exist whatever
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.480]  the story is we're talking about characters now we're the real bigger
[18:03.480 --> 18:07.600]  picture you've got to pull back Alex for a minute the real picture now is what
[18:07.600 --> 18:12.320]  happens when you have a military that was read by Petraeus taking over the CIA
[18:12.320 --> 18:17.160]  and saying that you're going to have to now not work a loosey-goosey and out of
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.400]  control as you've been doing it for 20 30 years but you're going to be a
[18:20.400 --> 18:25.520]  militarized service so what happened a lot of the CIA is no longer what we have
[18:25.520 --> 18:30.800]  civilian we have really outsourced special forces who have been on contract
[18:30.800 --> 18:35.840]  so basically our entire covert operation institution has been contract
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.240]  officers who make a lot of money 250,000 ex-special forces and we have the
[18:41.240 --> 18:45.520]  military who's been standing by and being told what to do if they go into
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.720]  areas that they don't want to create wars for example in Libya there was no
[18:50.720 --> 18:55.720]  reason whatsoever to take down the top absolutely no reason there was no reason
[18:55.720 --> 19:01.160]  whatsoever to go into Libya and to Syria to take down Syria and so now it's
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.800]  purely about the payday and if they continue this even if there's a corrupt
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.720]  power structure there's not going to be an America left if these mercenaries
[19:10.720 --> 19:16.880]  continue to get in the way of the real you know national goals and national
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.400]  interests of this nation correct the mercenaries was the problem that was
[19:20.400 --> 19:26.320]  brought up to me by the general actually of the special forces general and years
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.480]  ago when he asked me what I think would be the next and the next major enemies
[19:31.480 --> 19:35.040]  of the United States and I said the mercenaries that were okay doc we got to
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.280]  go to break humor when we come back and recap what you're really saying happened
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.720]  in mcgasey and then let's get into what's happening with betray us because
[19:42.720 --> 19:48.360]  clearly the FBI and the Justice Department is now spying on generals
[19:48.360 --> 19:53.560]  without warrants this is some type of internal battle coup operation I want
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.560]  you to put it in layman's terms talk to me like I'm six years old doc we're

[24:08.960 --> 24:29.400]  mind
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.080]  okay Dr. Steve Pachennick is our guest this is short segment long segment
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.680]  coming up I just want to revisit this because you were honest month or so a
[24:38.680 --> 24:47.920]  go you you said that it was a Israeli neoconcube from the information you had
[24:47.920 --> 24:54.400]  against the Obama administration who you've been critical of but you were
[24:54.400 --> 24:57.760]  saying there were all these internal power structure coos I'd like to hear
[24:57.760 --> 25:01.920]  the evidence of that now in the aftermath why would Obama then try to
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.520]  cover up why wouldn't he send aid there was a CIA torture base right down the
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.400]  street why is all this going on and how does it tie into five generals now in
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.240]  the last month the head of african the head of the Afghan operation now
[25:17.240 --> 25:20.840]  Petraeus and one other I guess present with the head of was he the head of
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.600]  sent com I mean I mean I mean this is getting this is getting really really
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.280]  crazy and obviously there's seismic you know the ground is rumbling in
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.200]  Washington and we're being told it's about these women I know that's a
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.360]  distraction I know that's the cover story I get that but I'm saying what's
[25:38.360 --> 25:43.240]  deeper dr. Pachennick so let's start at Benghazi placer all right the Benghazi
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.680]  issue was the totally illegal operation which was signed off by the president
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.960]  United States who remember it's part of the CIA his mother was CIA his father's
[25:53.960 --> 26:00.240]  grandfather CIA he was trained in the CIA what you have here is the CIA versus
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.600]  the military conflict going on and you have basically an out-of-control foreign
[26:05.600 --> 26:12.080]  policy that's run by mercenaries and by a military that refuses to engage in
[26:12.080 --> 26:18.800]  civilian intrusions into Libya Syria and what happened in Benghazi was that
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.080]  ambassador was clearly murdered under the direction of the Hillary Clinton who
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.280]  has had a history of allowing people to die and then to die so that the
[26:29.280 --> 26:36.080]  consulate was really used as a senator as I said before RPG for torture now they
[26:36.080 --> 26:44.280]  had the mercenaries the seals had several Libyan and other foreigners in the
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.360]  embassy in the consulate which was used to torture and basically this was a
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.280]  totally illegal operation which did have a finding when I say it's illegal it
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.240]  means it's illegal it by the International Court of Law it's legal by using
[26:59.240 --> 27:05.520]  embassy or consulate it's an illegal usage so what you have here is military
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.880]  fighting the CIA basically in a military coup that was beginning to say we no
[27:10.880 --> 27:14.240]  longer want to find we don't want to listen to the president United States
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.520]  we're tired of listening to the bushes we're tired of listening to Obama's we're
[27:18.520 --> 27:23.600]  tired of listening to Pineda who really has no credibility and we were tired of
[27:23.600 --> 27:27.640]  listening to Dempsey who I had warned a month before as I told you the council
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.760]  finalization would you ever stand up to the president of the United States and
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.640]  in this building Irish the man but the real issue was that General Homme the
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.240]  career admiral in charge of a carrier task force were watching their own men
[27:43.240 --> 27:48.640]  being killed in a place where illegally the operation was not legal but
[27:48.640 --> 27:54.120]  nevertheless it's with their soldiers their special forces and all over the
[27:54.120 --> 27:58.960]  world we could monitor this for eight hours no no and you said this a month
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.680]  ago they had two drones over so why don't the generals come out and say you
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.880]  you made us stand down and go public because if what you're saying is right
[28:07.880 --> 28:11.760]  and I agree that's where this is pointing then they're gonna end up killing
[28:11.760 --> 28:17.080]  these guys before they can come out and blow the whistle let me tell you Alex
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.200]  why because we have created this is why it's important for our public
[28:21.200 --> 28:27.040]  understanding I've said it for a long time we have created a general core that
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.720]  is not consistent with what we had in World War two and we had a George
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.880]  Marshall who would fire six hundred generals in minutes and an hours because
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.480]  they would not stand for it and instead of standing down they should have never
[28:41.480 --> 28:46.200]  stood down and should never stood down the rear-admire should never stood down
[28:46.200 --> 28:50.480]  none of them should have stood down because the field teams that were in
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.640]  there is that no special forces that were in there were told that they would
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.760]  have overhead cover and they marked the entire consulate to say look we have to
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.040]  blow this up and instead what we've had is a military which has wanted to assert
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.160]  power as back down because several reasons number one America has to
[29:08.160 --> 29:12.400]  understand our military now is a non-functional military it is filled
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.320]  with generals who have never really been in war who was really concerned about
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.200]  getting more medals and more positions but it never served it their their
[29:21.200 --> 29:25.400]  aggressiveness or they wore like attitudes which they shouldn't and
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.960]  basically they're making three million dollars when they leave the government
[29:28.960 --> 29:32.640]  and they go on to go to the health brief okay break it down this is riveting and
[29:32.640 --> 29:37.120]  it makes sense and you did call it early on saying it I'm saying our military has
[29:37.120 --> 29:42.040]  been dysfunctional for the past 20 to 30 years however we developed a small
[29:42.040 --> 29:46.240]  core of generals who I've worked with whether it was betrayers or others okay
[29:46.240 --> 29:50.480]  stay there doc we gotta go to break satellites we're on the March the

[33:46.720 --> 33:50.160]  we are all in grave danger when I talk about what this means that there's
[33:50.160 --> 33:57.280]  obviously a giant battle between the intelligence agencies the FBI and the
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.560]  Defense Department that's undoubted general sent thousands of inappropriate
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.600]  emails to woman who reported harassment by Petraeus Miskris FBI agent banned from
[34:07.600 --> 34:14.440]  probe after he grew obsessed and sent her shirtless photos bombshell story is
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.920]  just a smokescreen for something bigger that's what the father of Petraeus's
[34:19.920 --> 34:26.080]  biographer girlfriend has said and he says it's about to come out local TV
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.760]  station mistakenly airs altered sexually suggestive version of Broadwell's book
[34:30.760 --> 34:34.120]  cover this is a big battle inside government they're talking about
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.800]  impeachment of Obama they're talking about this being the new Watergate
[34:38.800 --> 34:43.840]  we're going to cover it with Dr. Steve Pachennick of Steve Pachennick com high
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.240]  level former and intelligence operator the head of psych warfare for the state
[34:49.240 --> 34:54.720]  department worked on peace deals with of course Egypt and Israel successfully
[34:54.720 --> 35:00.160]  other camp David and he is you know giving us his inside scoop member of the
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.000]  council on foreign relations and what's happening we're going back to him to give
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.760]  him the floor here in one moment to go out of Benghazi to the battle that's
[35:06.760 --> 35:12.080]  happening where he sees it going and why the generals didn't come out with this
[35:12.080 --> 35:14.760]  because it's now confirmed the military sat there and watched that's been
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.600]  confirmed Colonel Schaefer agrees with a lot of what Pachennick saying he says
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.440]  it was a hit a murder he just says you know it looks like some elements want
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.760]  missiles to get to Al Qaeda because that's good for military business that's
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.360]  basically what Pachennick saying this is about arming Al Qaeda for the next stage
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.320]  is will that be terror attacks here you should take our liberties we'll talk to

[37:20.000 --> 37:24.880]  roll through it in layman's terms Benghazi what this signifies where it's
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.760]  now going why these generals are all leaving what this signifies you know
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.080]  shouldn't they be speaking out we know they sat there while those people were
[37:33.080 --> 37:36.320]  murdered who was really behind that where is it all going what do you
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.880]  predict number one the Benghazi episode has been the culmination of the legal
[37:40.880 --> 37:47.640]  operations that have been done under the CIA with Treyas first with Piedena who
[37:47.640 --> 37:53.760]  was the CIA and basically the CIA is no longer the CIA we knew about 10 20 years
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.640]  ago where I had men who would work for our country they're basically mercenaries
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.080]  who had been hired out of special forces have been using drone attacks and
[38:03.080 --> 38:08.280]  killing many many people and then his seriously should be impeached for war
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.880]  crimes he was then brought into the military and really does not understand
[38:13.880 --> 38:18.400]  military he does not come from the military coach the military did not set
[38:18.400 --> 38:25.200]  Pineda's view of drone attacks they have a much more sophisticated approach to
[38:25.200 --> 38:29.640]  the world they're much more precise they follow orders unfortunately the
[38:29.640 --> 38:35.360]  military watch a series of attacks occurring Benghazi within a legal
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.960]  operation legal meaning literally it was illegal using the cover of a consulate
[38:40.960 --> 38:48.200]  which is an illegal cover to use torture of Libyan prisoners and foreign
[38:48.200 --> 38:54.000]  prisoners which we were interrogating and repeatedly in the CIA denied that and
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.320]  was also supplying weapons in Syria in a misgotten a misbegotten type of foreign
[39:00.320 --> 39:06.960]  policy which was initiated by Hillary Clinton Obama Valerie Jered and the
[39:06.960 --> 39:11.760]  people in the White House so we've been running an incredible amount of secret
[39:11.760 --> 39:16.680]  wars under Obama when normally we should have known about it our Congress has
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.160]  never covered it and we have had more wars and covert operations under him
[39:21.160 --> 39:26.760]  than any other president I know and since he's come out of the CIA he's run by
[39:26.760 --> 39:31.640]  the CIA what you have here is a cultural clash between military generals who
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.600]  refuse to continue to listen to civilian authority and I have encouraged that
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.840]  through my lectures at the war colleges my meetings with the general saying that
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.160]  at some point in time you generals will have to stand up the billion leaders who
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.040]  led us into the war in Vietnam who led us into the wars in Iraq who led us into
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.600]  Afghanistan you have performed poorly you have performed exceedingly poorly you
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.240]  have destroyed the integrity of the military and the army and yet these
[39:59.240 --> 40:03.960]  generals watched while their own men were being killed and said nothing now
[40:03.960 --> 40:08.680]  it's unfortunate they should have said something they should have stood forward
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.320]  and instead they were given the cover story by Dempsey who's a total coward
[40:13.320 --> 40:18.440]  someone I've met had total disrespect for and Panetta another coward who should
[40:18.440 --> 40:23.880]  be a teacher and in the White House and in turn they were told to stand down but
[40:23.880 --> 40:27.560]  what was happening in the middle of all of this thank god the episode was the
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.280]  fact that not only was a navy we're admiral and a carrier task force sent
[40:32.280 --> 40:36.520]  back which is unheard of and they were ready to protect our soldiers after
[40:36.520 --> 40:42.600]  seven hours of an attack and where these special forces units were literally
[40:42.600 --> 40:46.680]  putting their lives on the line to say look save us and they were told that
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.080]  they would be saved but they weren't basically what happened is this was an
[40:51.080 --> 40:56.440]  attempt by the White House by Panetta by all the men in the CIA from
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.600]  the old days like Brandon should have been indicted for war criminals under
[41:00.600 --> 41:05.640]  9-11 2001 who's a continuing problem
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.520]  donlan who should have been indicted for criminal activities under 9-11
[41:10.520 --> 41:14.440]  and this is all culmination where the military did not do what they should have
[41:14.440 --> 41:17.560]  done which was to refuse a civilian order and
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.840]  to be treasonous as I have been repeatedly and defied civilian order to
[41:22.840 --> 41:26.920]  save the lives of our military I'm ashamed of our military for having done
[41:26.920 --> 41:30.280]  that I'm sorry that they did it but basically what's
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.840]  happened is that there was a fear in the White House and a correct fear
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.000]  that part of what I had been doing and others had been doing was to develop a
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.680]  military corps of generals which betray us as part of
[41:42.680 --> 41:47.080]  say that we will no longer follow civilian military civilian orders
[41:47.080 --> 41:50.360]  meaning that the civilians who've come to our president's
[41:50.360 --> 41:55.160]  junior Clinton and Obama really know nothing
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.840]  about foreign policy and the people who they picked Susan Rice
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.960]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powers, Brandon all of these people are incompetent
[42:03.960 --> 42:07.080]  they've had a history of incompetence and they're in ideologues
[42:07.080 --> 42:11.320]  and they basically wanted to go into countries like Libya and overthrow
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.200]  Gaddafi who was our ally for years and create stories that really were not even
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.680]  rational and claimed that we would create an Arab spring when in fact they had no
[42:20.680 --> 42:24.360]  solution as to what that meant and where that was going
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.680]  and in Benghazi this was the final point of where the military and the
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.320]  civilian or the CIA came to a clash of who was the
[42:33.320 --> 42:36.680]  charge and it was clear that at this point in time
[42:36.680 --> 42:41.720]  the president committed not only a legal act to use the State Department as a cover
[42:41.720 --> 42:47.480]  for torture and extradition as well as sending a
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.600]  weapon illegally to Syria on rebels where we never declared war but at the
[42:52.600 --> 42:56.120]  same time it was the clash to allow the civilians
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.400]  to get rid of all those generals who in any way could be
[42:59.400 --> 43:03.400]  defying the White House so this is really a coup attempt
[43:03.400 --> 43:08.680]  this was the taking down of a real military coup
[43:08.680 --> 43:13.320]  to say we've had enough and unfortunately our military back down
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.800]  and they will pay a heavy price for it 14 other Navy
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.120]  commanders were dismissed during this period and that was not written about
[43:22.120 --> 43:26.680]  so that basically the White House under the direction of Brennan who's a very
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.920]  dangerous CIA operative who was involved in 9-11 should have been
[43:30.920 --> 43:36.280]  indicted for criminal activities under the 2001 9-11
[43:36.280 --> 43:42.920]  Donlan as well and this gets into that specific issue now the person who's
[43:42.920 --> 43:46.440]  missing in all of this and the most important person who's never been
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.640]  talked about is exactly the person you were talking about
[43:49.640 --> 43:53.160]  and that's Mr. Bob Mueller who for years I have born
[43:53.160 --> 43:57.480]  and if he doesn't watch what he's doing he should be under investigation
[43:57.480 --> 44:00.360]  and should be the one who's being investigated.
[44:00.360 --> 44:07.160]  The user has had a very very very dangerous history of having come in before 9-11
[44:07.160 --> 44:10.520]  one week beforehand appointed by Bush Jr.
[44:10.520 --> 44:14.440]  to head up the FBI and knew very well that is involved in
[44:14.440 --> 44:20.360]  9-11 the attack the stand down and the false attack that we had
[44:20.360 --> 44:24.120]  and basically he was covering that up with the FBI agents
[44:24.120 --> 44:31.160]  is no question. And by the way his number two just to briefly interject
[44:31.160 --> 44:35.240]  was saying that they were going to allow an al-Qaeda attack as a pretext even gave
[44:35.240 --> 44:39.720]  newspaper interviews John O'Neill and then he died in the World Trade Center were
[44:39.720 --> 44:42.360]  told. Correct and I knew about O'Neill because
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.360]  John O'Neill was the CIA operative who was sent to New York and the head of
[44:46.360 --> 44:51.080]  count intelligence to the CIA told me about him and he warned about it
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.360]  Mueller should be investigated should be indicted
[44:54.360 --> 44:58.040]  for war crimes he is very much a part of this cover-up
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.160]  and has been for a very long long time. Mueller goes back and so does the FBI
[45:03.160 --> 45:05.960]  which should also be investigated but unfortunately we don't have
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.400]  investigative capability our Congress our Senate it's
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.040]  totally defunct so we have to develop some kind of body where the American
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.880]  public comes in and says you know what our congressmen and senators are
[45:17.880 --> 45:21.480]  useless our civilians are useless but Mueller has to be
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.760]  investigated repeatedly for his involvement not only in
[45:24.760 --> 45:30.040]  9-11-2001 it's cover up the criminal activities but now illegal
[45:30.040 --> 45:33.960]  operation against the military the CIA and it
[45:33.960 --> 45:37.480]  harks back to the time of J. Edgar Hoover when he used the
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.000]  investigative powers of the FBI to illegally
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.880]  monitor not only president Nixon which was an illegal monitor by the way
[45:45.880 --> 45:50.040]  but used the legal monitoring of every other political candidate
[45:50.040 --> 45:53.800]  and use that as a way to punish our military
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.920]  in our CIA so the notion that the FBI has worked closely with the CIA or the
[45:58.920 --> 46:02.200]  military is so as fictitious as far as I'm concerned
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.360]  for over 30 years when I've worked with the FBI or the CIA they have been the
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.560]  most least cooperative group I've ever seen in
[46:09.560 --> 46:12.600]  particular they also make up their own storyline which is
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.080]  absolutely amazing I was involved in the Hanafi Muslim and they failed
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.080]  terribly and I defied presidential order and that was
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.600]  basically treason I threw out the president of the United States
[46:24.600 --> 46:28.840]  Jimmy Carter and warned him that if he would have come back into the room
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.600]  I would have 500 hostages killed but he started it
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.320]  that was basically treason at the same time I committed treason when I over
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.240]  through someone in the Aldo Morrow kidnapping and that's what we call
[46:41.240 --> 46:45.720]  a hard coup there was no question that I overrode the CIA
[46:45.720 --> 46:48.920]  overrode military orders overrode civilian orders
[46:48.920 --> 46:52.680]  but in my opinion and at the directives whoever it was
[46:52.680 --> 46:56.520]  in my own opinion I was able to do that and for those years
[46:56.520 --> 47:00.280]  nobody could understand it that's why I was able to override the CIA
[47:00.280 --> 47:03.640]  and either fire dismiss them or marginalize them
[47:03.640 --> 47:06.840]  well now that you've told the Jimmy Carter story I looked it up it's on record
[47:06.840 --> 47:09.560]  that you were the state department representative
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.400]  at the famous Camp David accord we should have you on just about the history
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.160]  sometime but let me get back to this story of
[47:17.160 --> 47:19.800]  why this but I mean let's get back to you what happened with
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.920]  president Carter well Jimmy Carter president Carter had
[47:22.920 --> 47:27.800]  initially created a got himself involved in a bankhold up where he was
[47:27.800 --> 47:31.000]  micromanaging everything and as a result of that
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.240]  what happened was a man by name Khalid who
[47:35.240 --> 47:39.240]  saw his daughter drowned by the Elijah Muhammad group
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.160]  held five different building hostages including the May Brits
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.640]  shot Mayor Barry and we had 500 host the FBI could not handle it
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.720]  the CIA could not handle it and I was called in in the middle of the night
[47:51.720 --> 47:56.600]  to take it over and Earl Silver who was at that time not my friend but with the
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.640]  US Attorney General I told him that whatever happens
[47:59.640 --> 48:03.720]  will be answered will have a gag ordered no one is to talk nobody's
[48:03.720 --> 48:07.400]  saying anything and I took over complete command and control they were three
[48:07.400 --> 48:12.280]  ambassadors from my yahoo Khan from Pakistan from Egypt
[48:12.280 --> 48:16.760]  and from Iran all of whom were just sitting there so I provided the Quran I
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.840]  quickly formulated the strategy and tactics where I took over the control
[48:20.840 --> 48:24.120]  of Khalid and told him that this is what's going to happen
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.040]  and through a colony who was a very good
[48:28.040 --> 48:33.000]  police officer we were able to change the entire course of the disasters that
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.080]  were 500 people with napalm on the stairwell
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.480]  was about to die and Jimmy Carter had no no understanding of it neither did his
[48:41.480 --> 48:45.480]  people and I literally threw them out and I warned them that if they didn't come
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.000]  in they will they will have a blood death on their hands
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.920]  sure and that's on record too it sounds amazing the listeners
[48:52.920 --> 48:56.520]  this is not something let's expand on this let's expand on this then
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.240]  where I'm just letting people know the kind of stuff you've done and what
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.880]  you've seen where is this going now where mercenaries because the US has been
[49:03.880 --> 49:07.720]  corrupt for a long time and that's part of the whole Machiavellian system
[49:07.720 --> 49:10.920]  and you know when you've danced with the devil you the devil doesn't change you
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.920]  change but now you can see it that what these
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.240]  mercenaries and the CIA and 80% of intelligence now run by
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.080]  private groups I found an NSA base by my house and have confirmed it
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.200]  well it's a private group data mining I mean that's how bad it is it's just
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.600]  everywhere now they've made the American people their
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.920]  enemy too because that's a new battlefield for them
[49:30.920 --> 49:35.080]  they don't care about long term now they really just want their paychecks
[49:35.080 --> 49:38.760]  you've got contractors low level paid more than top generals
[49:38.760 --> 49:42.040]  and and and so it's a private corporate coup
[49:42.040 --> 49:46.520]  that we see happening and they brag about it where is it going then
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.000]  well it is going into the into a major confrontation with our military because
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.480]  for every mercenary who's basically was either ex-special forces
[49:57.480 --> 50:03.480]  receives $250,000 and you put in a special forces legal
[50:03.480 --> 50:07.720]  uh soldier next to him and he's only making 40 or 50,000
[50:07.720 --> 50:11.480]  you're going to get real conflicts and I remember telling General Schumacher
[50:11.480 --> 50:14.120]  they had a special forces on the head of the army
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.840]  10 years ago that our major enemy within five to ten years and it's right now
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.200]  about Benghazi will be those mercenaries under
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.800]  L3 under Northrop Grumman under all the companies that have been outsourced
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.360]  and and Panetta has been one of the greatest uses of these L3 communications
[50:32.360 --> 50:37.400]  as has the CIA. By the way they plan to use L3 domestically for civil unrest
[50:37.400 --> 50:40.840]  they got a giant training base here in Texas stay there I want to come back
[50:40.840 --> 50:45.720]  then and just zero in why did Obama stand down then
[50:45.720 --> 50:49.880]  if it was some type of internal operation with the neocons
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.600]  wanting to get missiles uh you know into the next theater to expand the war
[50:54.600 --> 50:58.760]  why did Obama play into their hands or is he joined up with these people I mean
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.200]  I want to zero in on have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.600]  electrical power even save money on your electric

[53:15.880 --> 53:19.000]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your

[53:26.760 --> 53:30.760]  lights start going out across america but here's some good news
[53:30.760 --> 53:34.680]  there's an underground video at exposed123.com

[53:42.600 --> 53:46.520]  has already been banned by google and the liberal media is doing everything in

[53:53.720 --> 53:58.760]  again that's exposed123.com
[53:58.760 --> 54:09.880]  the decision is being made by the president and the joint chiefs in the war
[54:09.880 --> 54:14.600]  room at the pentagon and when they realize there is no possibility of
[54:14.600 --> 54:19.240]  recalling the wing will be only one course of action
[54:19.240 --> 54:25.800]  total commitment. Mandry you recall what Clemens once said about war
[54:25.800 --> 54:30.680]  and now i don't think i do that i know he said war was too important to be left
[54:30.680 --> 54:35.640]  to the generals when he said that 50 years ago
[54:35.640 --> 54:40.840]  he might have been right but today war is too important to be left to
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.600]  politicians they have neither the time the training
[54:46.600 --> 54:52.840]  nor the inclination for strategic thought resistance to tyrants is
[54:52.840 --> 54:59.000]  obedience to god it's alex jones
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.520]  okay we got one more segment here and then another two more segments short
[55:02.520 --> 55:05.960]  ones with dr steve pacenic riveting powerful interview
[55:05.960 --> 55:09.720]  unfortunately so much is what he's saying i can just verify from open
[55:09.720 --> 55:12.760]  intelligence reading between the lines here
[55:12.760 --> 55:16.840]  uh we were i was saying isn't it about phasing out the military converting it
[55:16.840 --> 55:21.880]  to a social uh enforcement thing domestically everything going to drones
[55:21.880 --> 55:25.720]  controlled by mega corporations that have hijacked our country and he said
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.160]  bingo that's it so dr pacenic you also another
[55:29.160 --> 55:32.840]  announcement you wanted to make about the cfr breakdown geopolitically where
[55:32.840 --> 55:35.800]  all this is going because soon the mercenaries are going to be cut out of
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.040]  the equation too the new world order it likes uh robots it likes
[55:40.040 --> 55:43.560]  drones it likes uh drone subs and drone ships explain
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.480]  where we're going basically this is the end of the army
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.240]  we no longer really need an army it will be decreased in size
[55:51.240 --> 55:54.680]  they know this this is the end we don't need army
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.120]  units we don't need for the the teeth to tail ratio then
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.800]  in other words the amount of supply that we need to get actual fighters in
[56:01.800 --> 56:06.840]  would not done well it's very high so basically where we are going into is a
[56:06.840 --> 56:10.680]  new kind of warfare which space warfare cyber war
[56:10.680 --> 56:16.120]  cyber attack which is really very important does it belong to the army
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.040]  it really now belongs to a whole new concept that which the united states has
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.000]  to begin to understand which has to deal with
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.840]  private industry and working in cyber war and cyber security because the army
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.160]  isn't necessarily designated or has been trained in cyber war and
[56:33.160 --> 56:35.560]  cyber attack although they're interested in it
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.720]  it's not the cynical unknown they're a reason
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.240]  so what you have is the elimination of really war structures
[56:43.240 --> 56:47.800]  that can effectively change the world powers what can change world powers
[56:47.800 --> 56:52.040]  is now social media statements like what you make what we do
[56:52.040 --> 56:56.680]  the CFRs have finished i quit as i told you have signed it was it was an
[56:56.680 --> 57:02.520]  antiquated respawn for you know very retarded individuals who were just
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.640]  what you got to get in gemsy's face there it's still useful for that
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.600]  well but the mc is a coward i mean if i was if i were what i normally was the
[57:10.600 --> 57:14.840]  george marshall i would have fired him on spot i would have fired 600 generals
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.920]  on spot we don't do that anymore instead we promote the generals we give them
[57:18.920 --> 57:21.560]  pensions for three million dollars so they use that
[57:21.560 --> 57:24.600]  sure bottom line where's it going with obama then
[57:24.600 --> 57:29.320]  how bad is this is going to be heading into a very serious problem of impeachment
[57:29.320 --> 57:32.840]  he continues all these wars that are illegal wars which have not been
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.120]  overseen by the congress and i don't know how it's effective congress but the
[57:36.120 --> 57:39.400]  american public understands that this is not just the president
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.480]  who quietly goes around and does what he does he has been ordering these
[57:43.480 --> 57:48.280]  covert operations for years on end and is a product of the cia and can no longer
[57:48.280 --> 57:51.800]  continue this we will implode in terms of both our national
[57:51.800 --> 57:56.600]  security and also our military will refuse to follow any more orders and in
[57:56.600 --> 58:00.520]  particular i talk about our air force which is in space warfare
[58:00.520 --> 58:04.040]  which has to do with satellite warfare and our navy
[58:04.040 --> 58:07.720]  because our navy when you talk about our navy nobody's really talked about our
[58:07.720 --> 58:11.160]  nuclear subs in our our our fleets what we call
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.400]  sink pack commander and other pacific or the nuclear drone subs they have those
[58:15.400 --> 58:19.720]  classified uh missile platforms that have been around for 20 years
[58:19.720 --> 58:24.120]  right so some kind of deterrence is required are we going to be going into
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.440]  another major war no but we have created under obama and the bush
[58:28.440 --> 58:33.480]  administration more unnecessary wars thanks to the cia thanks to incompetent
[58:33.480 --> 58:37.800]  civilians and incompetent generals who wanted to just get there uh
[58:37.800 --> 58:42.440]  back in 60s
[58:42.440 --> 58:49.640]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:16.600]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:23.320]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.280]  well we were just talking about space space weapons and how advanced they
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.720]  really are dr pacenic okay we got five minutes docked and larry pratt's
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.840]  coming up folks on the assault on the second amendment
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.080]  uh government is getting more and more corrupt more and more out of control
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.720]  look at the secret service and the hookers all of it
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.200]  um they've got all these super weapons but they're starting all these wars
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.760]  they're trying to convert america to the police state
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.240]  what's the establishment's grand plan and is there any way to turn it around
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.400]  in your view dr pacenic yes i think it's very easy that the
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.080]  american public now yesterday started requiring that states
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.200]  rights that they wanted to secede from the union
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.680]  i think this is something i wrote about 10 20 years ago in state of emergency
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.080]  that the federal government has lost its legitimacy across the board on the
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.840]  civilian side legislative executive judicial
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:20.120]  on the military and the intelligent side it is no longer a legitimate body of
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.320]  our our national of our republic it has become a serious problem
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.960]  to our republic and the sustaining of the ability of the republic to remain
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.440]  so therefore the question becomes does the republic really have legitimacy
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.760]  and the answer is no the federal government has lost its legitimacy and
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.920]  i think those who are requiring and asking for states rights i think are
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.880]  right i wrote about in the state of emergency when
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.640]  i said state after state will fight over water resources
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.120]  and that from now on our country has to be concerned about domestic issues
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.080]  taking care of our veterans taking care of people's jobs
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.680]  and making sure that we grow domestically and not fund some military
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.160]  industrial complex that generalize on how one of our greatest generals said
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.000]  we no longer need is dangerous and at the same time warned
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.760]  the cia that they would be able to create a legacy of ashes
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.360]  his words have come back to resonate 40 50 years later
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.680]  we have to decrease and eliminate most of our military across the board
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.840]  just as george marshall did when he fired six to seven hundred generals
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.360]  in one day eisenhower kept firing them until young men who were 26 and 27 were
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.720]  division commanders we don't need an army anymore
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.640]  we have space warfare we have cyber war we don't need that
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.560]  and the notion that we really need is the greatest national security problem we
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.800]  have is our national debt and the greatest problem in our national debt
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.720]  is that we're not really developing our own economic strength
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.560]  force and in doing that we have to now get rid of those people who have
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.000]  committed the crimes against the state number one is newler
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.200]  i think newler should be brought forth more than anybody else
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.680]  and investigate it for what he has been investigating number two is the cia
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.200]  and they should be eliminated completely number three the generals
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.160]  about three to four hundred should be dismissed right away
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.840]  and taken down to the simplest core of special forces
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.800]  number four i think everybody involved in this
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.120]  vengazi attack from pelary clinton should be indicted for war crime
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.560]  the president should be possibly impeached every one of the men in the
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.400]  white house donlan brandon particularly should be impeached
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.120]  and indicted and as well as a clapper and the dmi
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.520]  which is totally useless and general density should be court martial
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.040]  that's my opinion i think that's what's going to happen i think the american
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.520]  public is sick and tired of corruption of excuses of lies
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.960]  and throughout the world we have been the only country that has lived through
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.680]  those lies and have been able to break through them
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.520]  the american public is not stupid and they will not tolerate that
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:01.960]  but the lies of 9-11 have come back of 2001 to recapitulate again
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.600]  the lies of vengazi of 9-11 congress needs to wake up but it
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.880]  represents nothing congress is now a dead dead body
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.080]  that's very little legitimacy the white house has very little legitimate
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.320]  and so all we have is giant organized crime syndicates battling for taxpayer
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.640]  money that's why they want to keep raising taxes
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.320]  to get more corporate welfare and they plan on using the giant welfare hordes
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.920]  as the political muscle to vote the middle class's money directly into the
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.400]  bankers hands while the dumbed-down welfare queen
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.400]  queens drool demanding more goodies i think it goes back to the original
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.440]  statement i made 10 years ago on your first show which said we needed
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.280]  revolution revolution doesn't have to be violent it has to be one
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:45.160]  which takes down the uh totally corrupt white house totally corrupt congress
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.360]  totally corrupt the judicial system totally corrupt
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.760]  FBI secret service it's totally time to restore the republic dr

[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.920]  and i think you guessed it i am alex jones and we've got a lot of new
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.520]  listeners tuning in every day as the broadcast continues
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:56.120]  to explode well the bugle has sounded the charge has begun obama
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.640]  is not facing reelection he has the power of the executive order
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.000]  he has shown he'll use it like no other president
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.480]  and he as a state senator and the u.s senator we did this in a report last
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.680]  week read the clothes from the voter guides uh there in
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.720]  illinois he said he believes in the abolition of private
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.360]  ownership he believes in the total ban of guns
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.120]  you see chicago total ban you see new york total ban
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.040]  uh for the general public if you're kind of the mafia connected
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.400]  big wigs they can get you know arm guards or whatever you know the mercenaries
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.440]  they're always allowed to have their guns the un's above the law they can rape
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.440]  and kill whoever they want get the diplomatic community in any city
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.960]  so that's that's what it's all about the government massing weaponry against
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.400]  this private mercenaries but we can't have anything
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.200]  uh and obama has said he wants the assault weapons ban back
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.560]  and diane feinstein as you know has said that means
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.960]  physical she wants california style where you have to turn them in she wants
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.840]  gun show shut down and again i did a 20 minute
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.400]  respectful report last week titled you know proof obama is coming for your
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.840]  guns but i thought we should get larry pratt on for about 40 minutes or so and
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.040]  then we'll uh go to your phone calls those of you that are holding and get
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.960]  into some of the uh economic news that i have not
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.800]  not gotten into yet uh in any detail that we need to cover
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.920]  uh but i mean this is just from um last year and again this year atf to accept
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.720]  public comments prior to outlawing shotguns
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.600]  and then you go they have a link in the greeley gazette this should have been
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.520]  national news to the atf and they said oh we're going to have a rulemaking
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.800]  saying we're going to ban most shotguns 60 plus percent
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.080]  made in in the last decade that can uh take a clip
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.760]  that can be converted to take a clip well that's any gun that is semi auto or
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.600]  pump that you load in the bottom that's pretty much all my shotguns
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.200]  uh so it's not just law they're suing gun manufacturers bloomberg who also
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.320]  wants to tell you what you can eat and drink uh these are control freaks they
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.280]  want us to live like folks in chicago and new york
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.640]  with six seven locks on our doors the great people in new york and chicago
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.120]  not allowed to defend themselves this is mafia
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.800]  government we're on the air by the way in chicago we've had folks call in saying
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.160]  they wish they could have guns almost impossible to get one
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.880]  uh and they harass people statewide there uh but not but but but those cities
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.560]  is where they really restrict it uh california highly restrictive
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.240]  and if you look at a map of the world most countries of ban guns outright
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.320]  and they always follow the same pattern so the plunge is happening now and i
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.400]  know larry platt doesn't like to be alarmist but
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.680]  uh what did barry goldwater say uh extremism and offensive liberty is
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.200]  is no vice so i really want him pun intended to hit him with both barrels
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.880]  gun owners dot org he's the executive director of gunners america for 30
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.080]  years needs no no introduction and again the the mra's gotten better
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.120]  i remember talking to larry 12 years ago and saying that you've got to go after
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.360]  the nra for their 68 gun control act support for their current support
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.720]  and he finally started going after him a few years ago when they were basically
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.680]  saying oh we can have some you know restriction they've they've gotten a
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.160]  little better but still gun owners is the place
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.960]  to keep the nra honest so all i could say is go sign up become a member
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.280]  and get their free email alerts gun owners dot
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.760]  or g because we would have our guns basically banned if it wasn't for gun
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.600]  owners of america and you supporting them and many others and it's just a
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.840]  fact understand folks we don't have a lot of allies but the ones we've got are
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.280]  like big junkyard dogs in defense of the republic
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.920]  larry how bad is it because we know the former chief of staff at the white
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.320]  house said we're going to put you on a no gun by list we know they're moving
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.440]  towards that i mean they are licking their chops right now
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.440]  obama said in the second debate that he wants to ban not just semi-auto rifles
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.400]  but handguns so so they're letting us know the un has
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.320]  reconvened they're letting us know that you in gold
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.680]  of quote banning civilian ownership of firearms saying they threaten the
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.520]  legitimate power monopoly of the state that's uh
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:06.520]  july 7th 2001 unidire i mean how bad is it what is the state of our precious
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.000]  second amendment the only country really in the world
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.080]  left other than switzerland that doesn't have disarmed slaves
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.080]  well alex first of all thank you so much for letting me
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.240]  appear before your viewers and listeners you have a tremendous audience
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.840]  i'm very grateful every time i have a chance to visit with you
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:32.920]  um i don't think your concerns are misplaced i think this president showed
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.200]  us during the time when he still had to face
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.160]  reelection that he didn't have any basic problems
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.480]  certainly no moral objection to rule ruling illegally
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.920]  and to ruling unconstitutionally uh and his use of the executive order is
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.720]  something like perhaps 10 times what george bush's was and his was quite a
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.200]  bit more than those before him uh so we have seen
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.640]  government growing like a metastatic cancer
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.800]  here in washington and it's uh enclaves all around the country and i
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.880]  suppose around the world it's just stunning to me
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.120]  that we have reelected a man who really doesn't give a rip about his oath of
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.040]  office uh whatever he understands by the constitution
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.600]  isn't what the founders understood and so i think we're in for uh as you're
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.480]  indicating a real of time i would have no surprise
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.840]  if the president were to have his department of justice
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.280]  issue an edict to gun stores who were
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.960]  ultimately under them uh through the bureau of alcohol the back of the
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.400]  firearms and explosives which is part of the department of justice
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.840]  telling their dealers you'll lose your license after
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.880]  oh maybe maybe 30 days from now if you sell another
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.400]  handgun that has a caliber bigger than
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.880]  380 or if you sell a long gun rifle or shotgun
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.400]  that accepts a high capacity magazine and as you indicated
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.040]  that's probably most of your shotguns and any rifles you might have might also
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.960]  fit that same description uh it's going to hit
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.800]  if he were to do something like that in a way that the dealers would have no
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.440]  choice because unconstitutionally they have to
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.040]  have it right now they have to have a permit a license
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:33.240]  from the federalis in order to be able to open a business and stay in business
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.200]  and today they pull that license from any dealer
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.720]  he's out of business he can no longer sell any of his guns
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:45.240]  to the general public he's finished and so if your livelihood depends on
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.960]  that unconstitutional scrap of paper well you're going to tend to do
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:53.800]  whatever you're told from washington or else
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.400]  and so i i can see something like that happening
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.680]  and by the way it would probably make the un so happy because in countries where
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.200]  they do let you have a gun my wife's from Panama
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.680]  and their laws are rather similar to those of Latin America
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.960]  if you can crawl over enough glass and you have enough connections and you
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.640]  finally get a permit you'll be limited to a 380
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:23.000]  and you won't be able to have any long gun that accepts a high capacity magazine
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.400]  so that's that that would make us so much more responsible
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.800]  in the eyes of the rest of the world you you know that that will be one of the
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.440]  arguments that well our good friends but if we're
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.280]  going to be a responsible citizen in the world community
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.840]  these are the kinds of conditions that we will have to impose upon ourselves
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.080]  in order to be a good neighbor in the international community
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.840]  barf uh that's i'm afraid that's what's coming down
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.040]  and there's two ways that i think we can try to deal with this
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.840]  one is that there's there are a small number of representatives coming to the
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.120]  congress the likes of which there have never been
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.040]  in my memory maybe if i go back to john ashbrook
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.320]  uh somebody like that was a very outspoken
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.480]  conservative and died mysteriously in a senate campaign
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:21.720]  years and years ago um but for the recent past we've had nobody
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.000]  like steve stockman who just got elected from
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.600]  a district outside of houston to the east into the north
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.040]  and jackie willorsky in the northwest corner of
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:38.280]  indiana these two have a history that tells me and since i know them personally
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.320]  i'll just describe them but i understand there may be a
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.560]  handful of others coming with the same steel backbone that these two have
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.560]  when stockman was in congress for the his one term
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.880]  with the class of 94 he introduced a bill to overturn
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.240]  the recently enacted clinton gunman and the republicans
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.880]  were even more if you will gun shy than they are now
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.680]  this was a controversial issue they didn't want to i get what you're going
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.640]  it's time to get on the offense or we're cooked
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.360]  it's over we either realize we either gain ground or we're gonna lose it all
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.400]  this is a war we cannot just keep having battles
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.680]  we have to literally go dig these people out we have to call them the
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.160]  authoritarian uh uh scum they are because listen the gun
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.480]  culture is what the reason they call us bitter clingers
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.640]  is they know it's it's the core it's what brings everybody together
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.800]  even liberals i know on social issues get now that they need guns and we're
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.400]  gaining ground on this so they're coming in to take it all
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.760]  the battle the final battle is it's starting to really unfold
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.960]  i think so i think uh we're going to see
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.440]  the fangs bared by this administration again
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.920]  and no more elections so that he has to worry about and i don't think he worries
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.920]  about his party and only worries about anything about the people and bringing
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.560]  bills up is that what you were getting at is it's time to go on the offense
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.960]  it's time to go in the offense it's time to
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.560]  reintroduce and to push all over again repealers
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.560]  uh that repeal whole swaths of unconstitutional federal gun laws
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.040]  stockman did it against his republican leadership when he was in
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.280]  we were in a meeting in dick army's office he was the majority leader then
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.600]  and he told us to our face you're not going to get a vote on stockman's bill
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.760]  if you do it'll be over my dead body well gingrich was a little
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.520]  politically moxier we did get the vote because gingrich didn't want
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.360]  gun owners of america messing over his guys in their districts
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:43.560]  over this issue that's right we've got to really just just remove the rhinos put
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.920]  real people in there i want to come back and get into what i'm
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.960]  now seeing on the news they're saying it's racist to own guns
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.600]  kind of like if you don't want government to run a health carrier racist
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.840]  and obama is now being called the conqueror i mean this is some really
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:02.200]  scary nomenclature we're hearing stay with us we just had a terrible storm in
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.040]  the east but we are all still in the eye of the perfect storm

[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.840]  america's worst drought in agricultural history and what about the
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.840]  presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to

[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.320]  ban your handguns that are semi-automatic that's most handguns
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.000]  and they've got the UN treaty coming up that once it's passed
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  the member nation's 50% vote 51% it becomes law here
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.600]  they've got more democrats in the senate
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.440]  and we're in deep trouble i mean we've never had the second amendment hanging
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.240]  by a thread and they try to play this double game of going
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.760]  we don't want your guns you're stupid to go out and buy them
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.960]  even though every gun i've bought over the last 20 something years has gone up
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:52.280]  in price um it's amazing and they they really can't
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.600]  stand the fact that we know they're liars and we're voting with our dollars
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.720]  and the fact that our gun culture i just showed the Huffington Post article
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.680]  there in the last segment if you're watching on prismplanet.tv
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:07.000]  but it says Obama's got to do something about this growing gun culture
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.080]  they are hitting the panic button when you guys pull that back up that was a
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.760]  great article you found they are panicking no no not
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.640]  not that article about uh the general general portrays but that one yeah
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.200]  Obama must take drastic action to end gun culture to end our culture see
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.080]  the media has destroyed our culture they've destroyed christianity they
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.520]  destroyed everything we don't have anything left hardly but guns i hate to
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.160]  say that but that's the one thing people still get
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.160]  i'm not a slave i have a right to defend myself places that take the guns have
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.240]  higher crime larry pratt i mean is that an
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.920]  overstatement that it's so many levels the strongest thing we've got it's so
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.080]  many areas is the guns and they know it and they are
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:51.640]  launching a total assault on it uh a do you agree b what do we do
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.800]  to defeat them i mean i agree with you go on the offense
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.480]  well in addition to going on the offense and i think now we have
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.320]  some players who are willing to play the offense
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:07.240]  i mentioned two of them steve stockman a new representative in the house of
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.680]  representatives here in washington and jackie walorsky
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.840]  also a new representative they have a history of standing up
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.680]  to their party leaders elected leaders and jackie walorsky's case she bucked
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.480]  a governor mitch daniels who is known as a fiscal conservative well he wanted to
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.000]  raise taxes to balance the budget and she bucked him and got
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.480]  a whole caucus eventually to go along with her forcing him to make cuts
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:38.600]  instead of raising taxes now in a way that's almost
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.040]  it's at least as impressive as what stockman did because stockman got his
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.640]  vote on the gun issue and unlike the last time if it goes over to the senate
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.840]  it's not going to be smothered by a bob dole
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.360]  and harry reid has shown that when push comes to shove
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.560]  he's a little reluctant to have an up or down vote on a gun issue
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.960]  and so what i think might well happen is we'll get something out of the house
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.000]  it'll go over to the senate reid won't want to bring it up but the rules of the
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.840]  senate are rather somewhat more uh available for getting things done
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.920]  and as an amendment uh on threat of a filibuster
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.600]  i can see somebody like jim deman mike lee
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.440]  rand paul ted cruise somebody of that sort
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.840]  uh making sure that there's a fight to amend a say a spending bill that the
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.160]  president has shown in the past he will sign even with pro gun
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.800]  amendments to it and that way we could actually have
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.600]  the prospect of getting something done so it's time to get on the offense
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.320]  briefly we're gonna come back with part of the next segment and then let you do
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.080]  uh gugs only you're a busy man oh you had one more point
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.600]  no we can break if you need to that's fine no no i was just gonna say shifting
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.640]  here's another subject because i mentioned it before the break
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:01.160]  we are seeing and i'm getting callers saying this
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.680]  when i'm defending the second amendment saying you're just a racist and i go
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.480]  what does that mean and they can't even say and now i'm seeing ms nbc and
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.720]  people say aha the age of the white man's over you're
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.640]  gonna have to turn your guns in and i'm getting emails and seeing comments on
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.680]  youtube this is some new meme like like like oh
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.880]  it's like a it's like a weird reverse racism or something
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.120]  and the cover of newsweek says you're white your history the obama conquest
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.160]  and he's in a napoleon outfit with a sword
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.600]  it's like some on the left now just are screaming for authoritarianism but it's
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.760]  almost like hit larry and though because it's mixed with a weird racial vitriol
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:48.680]  uh that i guess ms nbc's been able to sell it's very bizarre
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.000]  yeah they've they've learned that many conservatives or at least many
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  quote republicans are cowed by the playing of the race card and i think
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.760]  what we need to do is to if we're uh i speak spanish i address spanish
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.120]  audiences i did a debate for an hour uh on cnn and
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:11.880]  espanol and the point has to be made
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.720]  that the fact that guns are readily available here is why
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.280]  america is different it's a tangible expression
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.960]  of the american spirit that we the people are in charge
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.360]  not the governments from which you fled to get here to america
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.920]  i want to hear you break that down further when we come back because it's
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.760]  fundamental that if they can get our guns they believe they won i mean
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.160]  because then it's about living under the socialist they're gonna take
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.840]  everything we got i mean this is slavery uh hitler took the guns
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.760]  Stalin took the guns lin and mal the mousetongue said political power grows
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.960]  out of the barrel of a gun the big government people don't like the fact
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:53.080]  we've got the gun we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.960]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.080]  then some of your phone calls when larry pratt leaves us larry i've been
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:31.000]  asking a lot of the questions here uh i want you to be able to add any
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.240]  other points that you think are important for listeners and other
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.840]  assaults we're going to see but they tell us they're coming after our guns
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.800]  they go they go you got a second amendment we just have a right to take
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:44.120]  them but finishing up the point that you were trying to get to
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:49.240]  um because they say oh i mean it's racist that our guns are killing people
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.560]  in mexico well mexico's banned guns and most the guys that have them it's hang
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.200]  grenades and grenade launchers and machine guns
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.480]  they're not getting those at gun stores you know it's turned out the atf was
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.120]  shipping them directly into mexico fast and furious goes a lot deeper but
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:09.720]  finishing up with this weird racial vitriol
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.720]  uh where time magazine says you're white your history and shows obama
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.400]  as a general with a sword i mean that's pretty
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:21.720]  they show him as a dictator they also show him as lincoln and then say he may
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.960]  have to deal with the states we have uh uh texas now
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.320]  in in less than 24 hours what is it 50 something thousand second church now
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:34.680]  it's 25 000 in hours saying we want to secede uh we need to just kick the
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:38.280]  globalist out of this country and just take our country back but
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.880]  i mean where do you see obama going and again you were trying to finish your
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.080]  point about this whole racism angle it's like
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.440]  hey i don't like lemon pie why are you racist you know it's like hey i don't
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.160]  like your food this restaurant what are you racist it's just this
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.800]  my people call in like it's powerful like they're gonna say why are you a
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.240]  racist when i'm talking about not wanting to shut down our cold
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.720]  power plants and i go what do you mean i'm racist well you know you are
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.000]  you don't like obama and i go yeah i don't like him he's a front man for the
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.360]  globalist i mean it's like a religion now
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.840]  i mean what can you say to this you were you were getting cut off by the break
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.920]  talking about your seeing an end debate
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.680]  well uh i think it's somewhat disappointing for the
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.880]  other side to realize that there are a number of us
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.440]  on the right who i'm married to a latin american woman
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:32.680]  have been for almost 50 years and i can debate them in spanish and so
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.760]  that kind of takes a little bit of the starch out of the shirt i think
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.760]  because it doesn't fit the stereotype uh that somebody that
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.600]  they just assume if you don't agree with me as you were saying
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.600]  alex it's one size fits all well you're a racist i mean if you don't agree with
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:52.040]  me down the line everything i say you're a racist
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.640]  they don't increasingly have the ability
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:01.400]  to debate their point and uh when i did the cnn debate in spanish
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:05.640]  it they felt uh i guess they were comfortable with the strength in
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.280]  numbers so it was three against one um but you know it's all the same
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.840]  argument so i was really only debating one other
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.120]  that argument that they all three were making uh
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.920]  and they don't uh i'm not sure they figured out how to get out of that pit
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:26.440]  now so far they were able to do a very effective job with mit
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  romney because mit romney who doesn't share say a reagan
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  view of america's greatness and he doesn't know how to articulate it that's
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:38.280]  for sure and he didn't and so he let obama get away with
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:44.360]  anything he wanted and in fact as you say they came up with the race card
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.600]  in the fast and furious scandal wait wait wait excuse me
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.760]  those are mexicans that are dying almost none of whom
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.600]  uh traced back to spain through my wife's lineage
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:03.640]  these are people who are brown who are uh typical latin americans uh and i
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.120]  thought it was kind of racist to kill some 400 plus in counting
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.880]  with guns that our government sent down there for that purpose
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.160]  but i mean why isn't that racist sure i mean you're right but i mean it's
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.560]  literally like you said you go hey i don't want socialism i don't want
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.680]  to lose our freedoms and they just call in and go you're a racist
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.560]  right and then they wait like you're about to fall over
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.760]  uh and i guess they and they repeat talking points of msnbc and christ
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.200]  matthews and and rachel matt owl and all of them
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.000]  i mean they get up there and they say if you don't like health care it's because
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.360]  you're racist uh no uh i don't i know government's
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.480]  going to ruin health care and look the prices are already going up
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:47.320]  the economy's shutting down i mean socialism
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.240]  i had a guy call in uh you know who said he was a socialist
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:54.280]  and when i said well i don't like socialism we see he's endorsed communism
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.960]  before his name john from ohio he's called many times he's a white guy
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.680]  and when i said look socialism doesn't work he goes well that's a
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.960]  typical racist statement and i'm like
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.240]  i mean the russians are white it didn't work over there
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.360]  i mean you know there's hardly any black people over there maybe you know
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.040]  one out of a thousand what is that now racist too i mean it's like
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.320]  i mean if i say i like lemon pie over cheesecake they go that's racist i mean
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.440]  it's like if i say i like blue skies instead of
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.960]  you know uh red skies it's i mean it's like if i have an uh
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:29.480]  all they say is that it's like a weird cult of people just
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.400]  like parents racism racism right it's really bizarre
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.680]  racism racism racism some of the folks that have been produced by the public
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.680]  schools the government schools uh are probably
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.200]  okay with that comeback that's racist but
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.200]  frankly a lot of people in this country still can think
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.240]  and if that's the way they want to conduct a debate in front of the american
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.160]  people bring it on i think it's done we
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.600]  we uh have that debate and let the whole country see
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:07.720]  just how inadequate their arguments why would newsweek come out and have
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.320]  david from has attacked me seven ways to sunday
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.600]  come out and say if you're white your history i mean that isn't it and then i
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.440]  see that as a meme online it's like trying to i guess they want the left
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.680]  really wants to try to have a race war in the hopper
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:28.280]  well golly you're gonna have to be attacked by somebody at more substance
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:31.720]  than newsweek they're no longer publishing in paper
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.840]  they're only online what what the american people are not buying
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:40.600]  that stuff and if that little kept house conservative
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.960]  mr from is happy associating with newsweek
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:52.040]  bless his heart more power to you're right he is a just a piece of work
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.720]  what do you think this election really signified i mean i saw a lot of fraud
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.040]  against romney i just call it like i see it uh some states didn't even count
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.320]  that day's votes and just said he you know that obama was the winner
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.320]  i see them saying conservatives and libertarians had better become
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:11.000]  socialist if you ever want to win the democrats well i mean you
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.520]  if you if you became Stalin they would become linen if you became linen
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:20.280]  they would become marks there's no way to ever become them to win because you've
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.760]  already become them you've got to go out and promote real constitutionalism
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.840]  we saw 12 million to 15 million ron paul people go out and not vote this time
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:33.400]  because of the way they were treated and in a way some say let it get worse
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.280]  that's what will cause real change i mean is there a way to make
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.840]  lemons out of this lemonade well i'd prefer to make lemons
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.800]  that i purchased rather than they were shoved down my throat
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.920]  sure but i'll do what i have to do and so in addition to going on the offense
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:53.080]  in congress which i think now we might be able to do
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.400]  we also need to keep in mind and you and i've talked about this before
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.880]  there is in most of our states the very powerful institution
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.480]  of the county sheriff in fact one of the things i'd urge people to buy
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.480]  at our site at gunowners.org in the media section
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:13.560]  where we have the bookstore uh or one other site you'll find the bookstore
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.800]  uh it's called the county sheriff by richard mac you've probably interviewed
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:21.320]  him excellent book we carry it as well people should go to gunowners.org and
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.040]  buy that book and give it to your sheriff and give it to all the
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.120]  sheriff candidates yes that's exactly read it first so you're
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.520]  sure you know what's in it but it's the history and the constitutional doctrine
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.040]  of the sheriff is the top cop because he's the only cop
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:40.120]  that has a an immediate delegation of authority via election
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.280]  from we the people by we the people and so it is
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:49.000]  very important that we increase the number of these constitutional sheriffs
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.840]  throughout the land who are willing and able to
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:57.080]  tell the feds not in my county if what you're trying to do
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.360]  is not an article one section eight of our federal constitution
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.400]  and there's a couple other things the constitution tells them to do as well
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.280]  then you're not going to do it here in this camp and the sheriff gets their
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.200]  authority from the state constitutions expanding on that
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.560]  what do you make of nullification i think that's something we're going to
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.960]  really see explode now uh the sheriff is the guy who can
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:23.000]  nullify a state legislature can nullify an acting legislation that's and some
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.800]  states have done it saying uh there's not going to be any
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:31.560]  exchange for obama care in our state uh they are just flat out telling the feds
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:36.680]  take a hike that's what the federal system was designed to do
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.680]  and now with 25 states i think is the latest count
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.640]  petitioning the white house for secession and it's a rather more serious
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:48.040]  matter than any of the other states when texas
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:54.040]  does that because texas came into the union with the proviso explicit
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.640]  proviso that it can also say adios and it can be on its way that's why it's
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:03.960]  called the low star state because it has that proviso built in
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.080]  uh go ahead so i i think that's a very serious threat
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.840]  the texas is one of the few healthy economies
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:17.240]  in this among the states of this country uh it's robust
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:23.000]  it has a conservative political culture and frankly i think there could be a
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.480]  majority of texas that say you know why not we've got our own sea coast
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.520]  if they want they can't really boycott our airports because
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.800]  we have too many hubs that are central for the airlines
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.360]  that we're just too important for them to ignore uh and if they
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.480]  do they really think they're going to invade texas and take it over
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.360]  um you know they tried that once and uh they got away with it that one time i
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.240]  don't think they'd get away with this time i don't think the military would
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.840]  would uh most of them would say that's not a constitutional order
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:56.520]  i'm not going to do it well the texas legislature last year said you're not
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.200]  going to grove us anymore because all of the house reps been flying into austin
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.840]  had been getting groved unanimous house vote do-hurst killed it in the senate
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.320]  so he lost his national senate run cruz says he's going to support the second
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.480]  amendment of ron paul type guy we'll let's see if that's really the case
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.520]  um but expanding on all of this they threaten a federal blockade with
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.680]  aircraft i say throw me in that briar patch let's get this
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.200]  confrontation going let's show what crooks you are
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.520]  right i don't i think that blockade would hurt uh the remaining states more
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.040]  than it would hurt texas and it could well precipitate
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.960]  a sympathetic joining of texas's action you know it's going to happen we need
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:43.960]  texas to lead out of this new order takeover and then we can reconstitute
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.160]  the republic because there's no doubt larry we've got a globalist takeover
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.480]  in washington they think they conquered this country
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.680]  they brag on the news that these foreign banks have taken us over
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.600]  they're the ones that want us disarmed so that they can create socialism
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.320]  to suck our money offshore to themselves and they want to use a giant gaggle of
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.480]  illegals and welfare queens as they're arming and i just you know it's time to
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.080]  call them on it it's time to get in their face
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.760]  texas could effectively seal its own border that would be
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.400]  an extremely positive first step whether or not they
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.200]  ultimately secede to simply say we're being invaded
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.040]  united states you're supposed to protect us from invasion
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.560]  you're not we're going to take that over because we didn't give that
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:33.320]  power away we just said that was something the federal government should
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:36.280]  do but if you're not going to do it we're going to do it
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.800]  and what are the feds going to do invade texas in order to not
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.480]  close the border i think at some point the american people are going to say
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.320]  what uh one of the the biggest problem i saw with
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.720]  romney is he as a liberal would not join
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:55.160]  issues and he would not call obama the socialist that he is
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:01.400]  he would not specifically draw attention to the many socialist programs that
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.640]  obama has been implementing and advocating and he would not
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.280]  address the country in terms of the greatness of america
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.000]  what it has been and what it can be again he didn't spell any of that out
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.440]  sure because he couldn't he agree with obama on so much
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:22.200]  and instead of again people going and joining the globalist
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:25.480]  this this is a real shot across the bow the republicans
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.080]  that that no more games they're not co-opting the liberty movement
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.760]  it's over they're either going to disappear and let the democrats take
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:36.280]  over and a bunch of states are going to secede or the power structure is going
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.160]  to get it right they're either going to have to
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.920]  act like republicans talk in other words they're going to have to walk the talk
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.480]  or i agree with you there will be uh at that first i think we might see
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.240]  next election an increase in what we saw
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.400]  this time the establishment continue to lose
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.080]  in contests that are brought by conservatives uh the one
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:05.880]  in your texas senate race was a great example of an outsider
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:10.520]  challenging the establishment dohurst and dohurst
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:15.160]  showed what the establishment was like he's a facilitator of all that is wrong
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:19.240]  in texas he makes it happen or keeps
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.600]  reform from happening as a lieutenant governor there in texas exactly he had
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:30.440]  a terrible record and crews calling on it showed how you should run a campaign
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.360]  and when people hear that there is a distinction being drawn
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.520]  by somebody who really believes in freedom the freedom fighter is often
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.280]  going to win and we will well there's no doubt ron paul would have beaten
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:45.080]  obama but the republicans had to throw him out of there
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.920]  uh and so now look what they've gotten larry pratt by the way we were gun

[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.400]  trend in illinois you're on the air go ahead how you doing alex good
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.560]  um i want to start off by saying i do not support obama and i do not support
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.840]  the actions that he is undergoing with the country at the moment
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:40.120]  but my real question i want to get your take on
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.560]  when are we going to see denver airport come into play from the research that
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.600]  i've done is that it's going to be the the base for the for the
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.400]  globalist elite to survive while they're just destroying
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.000]  everything yeah i mean it's official that colorado is the designated
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.600]  secondary capital it's got a bunch of underground bases in colorado springs
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.480]  they're at norad and all over denver there's a bunch of underground
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:06.600]  stuff there at denver that's just the globalist digging in in case they have
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.520]  a nuclear war with china or russia and they have the cog government operating
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.160]  there the congress is all vestigial unless congress stands up and retakes
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.720]  its power uh and uh show yeah that's my take on that on
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.360]  the denver airport serve so you think that we're going to be
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:27.240]  seeing a lot more action with it coming here shortly
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.360]  no uh we already have a north com military over the us

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.680]  special from reports that are going to premiere here
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:56.040]  on the radio in the third hour today including the proof that yes the un

[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:07.240]  it's on they're moving on every front they're going to shut down
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.520]  the industry they're going to raise the taxes they're going to put in the carbon
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:15.000]  taxes all of it designed you see all these businesses
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.960]  finally shutting down now that obama has been reelected
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.240]  tens of thousands being laid off just in the first day
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:26.440]  it's because a lot of companies operate on such small profit margins
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:31.480]  that they cannot compete with the government health care system
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:34.680]  also increasing the price of health care they could barely hang on against
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.640]  china against india against mexico who don't have
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.800]  any health care any workers comp make you work 18 hours a day
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.800]  suicide nets at the apple factories and so it's like okay
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:49.800]  we're shutting down we're closing our doors we're gone we're not going to hire
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.000]  anybody or we're going to lay off you know half our workforce
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.600]  or all the big corporations are saying you know what you get 20 hours a week
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.600]  down instead of 40 so you don't get your uh insurance
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:05.000]  and that's great that's the plan now you'll go from
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  25 million on food stamps when obama got in to write it 50 million
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.200]  it'll go to 100 mil and the even more will shut down until we have the gas
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:18.680]  shortages the food shortages that this is a plan
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.600]  they did this in china they did this in russia they did this in cuba
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:25.560]  they did this everywhere they've been doing it in venezuela
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:30.680]  and this is it until those of us that even know how to work
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:37.160]  are enforced labor camps producing for the welfare queens uh walking around
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:40.360]  with their submachine guns beating a sub of the head but shovels
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:44.120]  now it'll never get to that point it got to that point in north korea
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.640]  got to that point to a great extent in cuba got to that point in the sovi
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:51.320]  union got that point in china china got smart made a deal with the globalists
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.200]  who put them in place to begin with in 49
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.480]  to be uh just a slave system or a fascist system
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.960]  calling itself communist but but allowing some free enterprise
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:04.520]  but they're not going to do that they're going to strangle the goose with the
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.920]  golden eggs because they hate america so much
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:12.760]  and it's about total domination and so there will be
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.720]  plenty of cream in the globalist bunkers uh the armored redoubts and the
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.480]  new status will be black uniforms what matter if you live in a little
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.360]  hovel and you know don't get a lot of food either at least
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.560]  you're going to get to strut around into the new austerity and
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.760]  check some papers and break some jaws all right and
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:34.200]  run some checkpoints and see the once great citizens pull up to them and
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:38.840]  be scared uh this is the pure baptism and enslavement
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:42.920]  because we think abortion's good i mean i was thinking about this morning and
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.400]  it really hit me that i need to codify an entire 10 minute special report on
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:50.920]  this and not just get on the air and talk about it
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:54.600]  and really break down an epiphany i had about abortion you know i knew this
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.040]  about abortion but it really hit me in like a
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:03.400]  five ten minute epiphany where i just stood there with my hand on the counter
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:08.360]  after my wife and children had left before i came into the office
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:14.200]  they were gone on some errands i just sat there and it all made perfect sense
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.640]  because if you'll say those aren't humans and that that's not a life and
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.880]  you've got that choice and all the excuses once you have the abortion
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:28.120]  you're now committed to that idea and you'll commit to any other rationalization
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.000]  a lot of people been involved in abortions and uh as long as you realize
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.360]  it's it was wrong what you did understand the fraud of it
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.720]  you're cleansed it's a great weight off your shoulders
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:43.560]  i know but i'll tell you those of you out there
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.400]  it is your religion when i said women who have all these abortions there
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:51.000]  and love abortion and are proud of it and brag about it
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.640]  their wombs are temples to human sacrifice they are the ultimate satanist
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:00.840]  they have murdered their children well they're right back with ron paul
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.080]  we just had a terrible storm in the east but we are all still in the eye of the
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.200]  perfect storm we have the most devastating economic

[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:43.080]  uh ron paul soon to be former congressman ron paul
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:46.920]  uh he is set to join us in about 30 minutes here on the air
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:50.520]  and obviously uh he was quoted by the washington times and others when he was
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.040]  on bloomberg television as saying america already went over the cliff and
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:00.280]  we're far gone and that we have converted to socialism and will collapse
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:03.240]  and that is the plan yes they were they're going to collapse us into total
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:06.360]  tyranny and the domesticated masses will not know
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:11.160]  any better and they will demand anyone who has any money any property
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:14.920]  that everything be taken from you until finally
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:19.880]  you are physically put in forced labor camps that that is what every socialist
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:24.520]  and communist country ends up collapsing into uh if the people put up with it
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:28.360]  that's where it leads is the north korean soviet communist chinese
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:33.160]  uh you know foxcom apple uh suicide nets around the building forced
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:36.760]  abortions uh you know inside that's where it leads that
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.360]  that's who these people are that's what they create
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:47.400]  that is uh what they push uh in every single case so uh ron paul
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.880]  the congressman uh will be joining us to break all of that down
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:10:00.520]  later in the hour on top of all of that they're pushing the fiscal cliff and
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:03.960]  this has been done in europe over and over again uh they've
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:07.240]  the the globalists the megabanks that bragged they've conquered our country
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:10.600]  and the rest of the world through fraud and derivatives and manipulation
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.920]  hold everyone hostage saying the economy is going to implode unless you give us
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.000]  carbon taxes increase carbon taxes vat taxes
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.280]  higher income taxes and they call it austerity
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:29.880]  and then the prostitute media plays along with it and never points out that
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:34.200]  almost all the debt is really uh from bailing out the megabanks
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.720]  themselves so that is some of the information
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:41.720]  uh that we're going to be covering uh on that front as well today
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:46.120]  and again coals election loss could mean gain for carbon tax
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:52.760]  bloomberg uh the hill uh carbon tax could be an obama's toolbox
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.200]  bloomberg obama may levy carbon tax to cut us deficit
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:02.360]  hsbc says that's where this is going on top of the vat obama's set to give a
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.600]  speech today and you know he's going to talk about
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:09.480]  how we're in trouble why the economy just imploded the day after i got elected
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:14.440]  again the same megabanks that financed to get him back into office
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:17.960]  and finance romney just to make doubly sure they maintain control either way
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.880]  their guy got in they dropped the hammer after the
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:24.680]  election because they've been somewhat propping it up
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.720]  because now they're going to the next phase of austerity
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.520]  and when they raise taxes just like they've done in california
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.200]  or like they've done in other countries uh like greece other places
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:39.000]  it actually lowers revenue and kills business that's the plan
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.120]  you don't want people uppity with their own businesses running around with
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:45.480]  money in the bank you want them with the hands out
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:48.920]  that's why they they chris mathews has said it uh
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.640]  michael morris said it how great the storm is because it makes you dependent
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:59.000]  and it teaches you to be dependent of course we see 11 days
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:05.400]  without power sandy victims want answers we have other reports power
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.760]  outages continue to plague new jersey new york you
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:13.720]  name it 30 hour wait for fuel offers plenty of
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:18.920]  intrigue but no gas new york daily news gas rationing new yorkers welcomed to
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.960]  the third world ready to snap in cedar grove

[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.120]  and what they're really freaking out about is the liquor deliveries aren't

[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.760]  there's more looting more crime going on but the media is keeping it quiet
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.320]  bitter cold inside disaster shelter even the government shelters in places like
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:49.720]  moral bro don't have power that's the type of information
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:56.280]  that we have here all right now there's your government 11 days can't won't
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:01.720]  help you but we're bad if we say that you should

[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:24.040]  button to the ground if they assault you but the new religion in america there's
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.920]  three groups of people really there's globalist technocratic
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:32.440]  crime syndicates that know the street no other world works
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:37.320]  and decided to fleece the sheep you've got good hard working people that try
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.000]  to work within the system it's fraudulent who are being attacked
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.160]  and and and destroyed and then you have the giant mass of dumbed down
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.720]  kim kardashian you know fans who don't even know what day of the week it is
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:53.320]  literally who were in helpless zombie like states
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:57.000]  and all they know how to do is beg and plead and demand that somebody else's
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.440]  stuff is theirs they are going to literally
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.560]  societally culturally eat us alive this has happened everywhere it's not like
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.200]  we're just theorizing this is guaranteed it's like
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:14.360]  you got gangrene on your leg and your toes are turning black
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.600]  and and smelling they're gonna have to cut those toes off and if they don't
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.640]  you're gonna lose the whole leg and then your whole body you're gonna die
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:25.720]  well we have gangrene flesh eating bacteria all over us politically okay

[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.640]  death's doorstep which is the plan going from liberty
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.520]  and four percent of the world's population having half the wealth
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:43.880]  because we weren't perfect we had more freedom and so it was a cornucopia it
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.960]  was an engine of wealth and we became spoiled brats and people
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.440]  learn to sit around or get government jobs and you know
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:54.040]  festoon themselves and convince themselves that they make the earth
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:57.480]  you know turn and the grass grow and the birds sing
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:03.400]  and uh i mean we look i've been saying it we're far gone we're over the cliff

[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:34.760]  the point is that this is an engineered
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:39.400]  situation now now i spent three days making sure of this and i went and
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.480]  checked at blackboxvoting.org her numbers uh in the past bev harris was
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:45.960]  a pretty much a democrat she called herself an independent because she
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.960]  realizes they're all a mafia she helped expose republican theft of
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.640]  elections so we're not saying mit romney's good
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:56.360]  we had obama supporters calling yesterday you heard me up in the phone
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.320]  so we're gonna do it again today later if ron paul leaves us
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:03.160]  and i would say now listen my guy didn't lose
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:08.440]  mit romney's a globalist but the referendum if you believe this election
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:12.920]  certifying that people say yeah you didn't build that i want an obama phone
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:15.800]  and the government needs to give us a little something we went on to interview
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:19.880]  obama supporters at the driscoll the democratic party of texas celebration
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:23.000]  here in the capital city of texas austin and and that's what they were all
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.960]  saying yeah we need to help people we need to give people money
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:29.240]  give them free health care give them free education there's an
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:32.520]  there's no such thing as free when you start giving out free it starts to
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:37.320]  basing everything uh democrats polled want quantitative easing
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.040]  they want money printing they just don't get it folks
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.320]  they really are in this weird starstruck fantasy
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.520]  does that mean republicans are good no they like torture secret arrest
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.680]  lying wars they bought into their own brand of evil the point is
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:56.280]  if they would have kicked obama out that would have been hey incumbents look out
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.200]  hey you know people are mad the fact that things are so bad obama has been
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:03.480]  caught lying so much india a torture secret arrest
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.800]  hiring nothing but lobby assigning statements all the insider deals
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.840]  shutting down the coal plant shipping general motors of china
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.440]  salindra all the i mean just makes bill clinton looked like a saint it's not
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:16.920]  the bill clinton's the saint he's actually running this administration
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:21.480]  it's a clinton operation folks it's on record it's that things are so far gone
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:24.840]  now they get away with anything just department running fast and furious
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:29.000]  the list goes on and on and meanwhile they're buying 1.6 billion bullets
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.480]  they're digging in their fortifying police stations
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.600]  they're training them the gun owners and libertarians of the enemy that those
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.800]  that don't don't like world government of the enemy those of us that
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:40.600]  understand the takeover those of us that don't want this to happen
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.960]  we are now listed as the enemy and they're putting the internet kill switch
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.600]  in with cyber security and they're announcing they want the fairness
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.440]  doctrine back to shut us down and they're doing all sorts of cyber attacks
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:56.840]  alternative media it's on folks it's on now here's the good news
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:00.360]  and i've studied this and i can tell you right now bev harris
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:03.960]  vote fraud expert romney votes not counted in key states
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:07.240]  and if you add up all the places where there was clear fraud that
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.200]  they wouldn't that they admit none of the votes were counted on election day
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:13.320]  they would just announce it and the trends where romney really won those
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:19.000]  states met romney really won now that's not a good thing
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.240]  but it's not the worst scenario because it just shows people at least
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:27.480]  hitting the reset button you know going you know what we don't like what bush
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.880]  did we're putting obama in we don't like what obama did we're putting
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:34.680]  romney in at least it shows some primitive
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.320]  inkling of understanding how much trouble we're in there's video bev harris
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:42.680]  breaking it down two days ago but we went and correlated it all
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:46.440]  you know get our own vetting it's accurate it's a very important article
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:50.200]  because here's the deal folks you don't really believe that most polls showed
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.280]  two-thirds of people wanted gmo labeling in california
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.440]  but then magically 60 percent or close to 59 percent
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:02.680]  voted against it they're still counting votes
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.080]  i mean you don't really believe californians don't want to have something
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:08.600]  labeled gmo does anyone buy that does anyone when there's admitted election
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:12.040]  fraud everywhere and and now they call states you know when they haven't even
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:15.000]  counted the day's ballots they're not even in
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.360]  i mean does anyone believe this look here's the deal the system's totally
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:21.080]  discredited now they're going to say the voting machines
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:24.200]  at state levels say band guns they're going to say
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:27.080]  that oh all the new property tax increases pass
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:31.080]  wow who would have thought it oh my gosh you know and a few times they'll you
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:33.560]  have a few state referendums to make it look like
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.640]  you're having some victories i'm telling you folks this is a scientific takeover
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:42.120]  where they grab power see if we buy it okay they bought it move forward
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:45.960]  you have to either discredit the whole system disengage
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.320]  fight against it everywhere you can or we're going into

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.720]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.120]  so stocks are falling people are laying off their employees all over the
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.640]  place because you see we're in a global
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:47.800]  system designed by the megabanks and it's designed to shut down the
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.160]  ones wealthy economies and convert them over to
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:54.840]  tyranny and the globalists brag about this they write about this but that's
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:58.600]  in their economic treatises the general public just likes to buy
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.000]  into whatever the mainstream media is telling them and they're telling them
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.440]  the government wants you to do great and wants to help the little guys
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.360]  and as more people get poor they think well the answer must be government
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:11.880]  because they say they want to make me rich and then government gets bigger
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:16.040]  more people get poor and they go well we better have a bigger government
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:20.280]  that's what makes poor people rich and bigger government more poor people
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.640]  until we convert from the richest country in the world
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.240]  to a globalist new world order military colony where they just get
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:30.440]  conscripts and they're coming out with the drone ships
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.440]  the drone aircraft the drone submarines the drone soldiers
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:38.760]  that won't even be needed soon you see the future doesn't need us human life
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:42.200]  it's always been cheap but now now because of robotics and automation
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.240]  we're not even needed according to the globalist
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:48.760]  and so they're just shutting down the ones free society so they can convert us
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.000]  into pure authoritarianism ahead of forced population
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  reduction that is that is just some of what's going on and
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.200]  we did a national poll that i mentioned yesterday on air but this got
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:05.720]  published by the time we went off air at 2 p.m. central yesterday
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:11.640]  poll nearly one-third of americans should accept tsa body cavity search in order
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:17.720]  to fly that was a harris scientific poll of 2000 plus adults that we
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.160]  commissioned you can read the full poll at info wars
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:25.640]  dot com and some newspapers picked this up
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.480]  but you you would imagine that'd be a big national story but some people are
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:32.760]  commenting no i think they should check us there could be a bomb
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:36.600]  well why not cut you open there there can be something in your stomach i mean
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.560]  why not just not let you leave your house how about you just live in a little
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.520]  confined to gen 21 ghetto just for your security of course that's what hitler
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.560]  said go to these ghettos that have bar bar around them for your security i mean
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:50.600]  that's where this is all going but if you advertise it is the latest greatest
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:53.240]  thing and have madonna promote it well it must be great
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:56.680]  and the poll asked six questions one of the others was would you wear an electric
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.280]  shock or taser bracelet a poll 35 percent of americans would wear
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.920]  electric shock bracelet in order to fly
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:08.440]  and homeland security actually has taken bids and had meetings about making
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:11.320]  everyone wear it shocking survey results show how
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.000]  much freedom americans are willing to sacrifice
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  whereas they don't care if you don't like it they'll just try to implement it
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.920]  and they already put you in a radiation bath uh... to uh...
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:24.040]  to uh... you know get your authorization you know for the safety of
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:26.600]  everybody of course the government needs to have that happen and they grope you
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.400]  of course for your safety uh... so that's what's happening in the once
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.400]  land of the freedom of the brave because of al-qaeda
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:37.160]  that the government publicly runs in libya and syria and always ran and
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:43.240]  always will run out of sauney arabia but it's just so much fun to be islam
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.280]  phobic even the globalists run the radicals and put them in power
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:49.560]  that it's like so what just get rid of my future get rid of my kids future
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:52.600]  take all my rights hey but the government manuals that police and

[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.960]  nineties she said that the biggest cult in america the most dangerous people
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.080]  are quote evangelical christians who believe in the second coming to christ
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:32.280]  why you believe in the second coming a christ and that's what they teach on
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:35.320]  those manuals and you know what if you're a cop and
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.720]  you go to those intelligence training deals and you don't agree with that

[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.600]  something different it's just that obama openly says you didn't build that
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:35.240]  openly that we're collectivist openly that uh banning all guns is good in the
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:37.960]  past and now he's coming after the guns now they're

[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:28.520]  out there speaking to millions of young people around the country
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.760]  and we're doing a great job exposing collectivism and
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.920]  that the path this country is going on and on this friday edition a few days
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:41.720]  after the election we have a couple of minutes here or 30 minutes or so
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:47.240]  with congressman ron paul congressman i don't know how you do it
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:51.400]  holding up under something that a young man couldn't do but a great job getting
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:54.680]  the message of liberty out during the campaign
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:34:00.040]  well it's been a lot of fun and the tedious and of course at times frustrating
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:06.040]  but what really gets me going or keeps me going is what everybody knows is that
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:09.320]  i have identified with a lot of young people as you have
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:14.200]  you know i'm going to the campuses and that's why i've never dwelled on
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:19.160]  DC DC is important but DC is a reflection of what the next generation is
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:22.440]  going to be thinking about and realizing so that's where i'm
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:26.040]  optimistic uh washington's is biggest mess is ever
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:31.080]  but there's there's reason to believe that uh all the freedom organizations
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:34.200]  your radio show we're all making some progress and
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:38.600]  more in the last five years than we did probably in the previous 20 years
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:42.840]  absolutely uh look uh bev harris who he is as you know
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:45.400]  one of the top voting fraud experts in the country she's
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:49.320]  non-partisan she says a lot of romney votes didn't get counted they called
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:52.520]  states long before they should have that articles
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.400]  up at info wars.com i know it looks like you're a spoiled
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:58.920]  sport if you talk about election fraud but it's been certified and proven over
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.520]  and over again i don't so much see it as a mandate
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.720]  for collectivism that obama got reelected i see it as a mandate that
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:12.920]  people have been dumbed down and that romney wasn't really a
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:15.960]  somebody who was really speaking out against obama but when you make the
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:20.920]  statement congressman uh that the u.s election shows were far gone
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:26.360]  uh can you elaborate on that well yes the subject comes up because the big
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:32.120]  talk now is a fiscal cliff and uh in many ways uh i work on the assumption
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:36.200]  that we've sort of gone off the cliff nobody realized it because we haven't
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.120]  hit the bottom we don't know what the limitations are
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.520]  but in the key in the election what i was thinking about that time was
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.240]  that one of the things that obama was able to do
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:53.640]  was play on fear fear of those people you know in a rough belt uh who are used
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.320]  to artificially high wages and jobs and bailouts
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:01.080]  and he played on that so in many ways it was
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.480]  those individuals in uh oh high india from michigan and wisconsin are saying
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:09.080]  hey you protect me take care of me make sure my checks are coming
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:12.200]  and i said it's not a whole lot different than the way they line up on the streets
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:16.360]  in greece you know don't cut anything and the people who are on the dole
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:20.600]  wanted so in that way that's side of the argument one
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:26.440]  uh the but i'm not as as down on what happened in the election because 12
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:31.480]  million decided not to bother which isn't all that bad you know because
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.400]  they decided they looked at ronnie and they and they looked at obama
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:38.520]  he says it's not worth the effort and they know this whole system is rigged
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:42.440]  against us if we try third party so they just said the heck with it
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:45.880]  and uh but i think those are our supporters i mean i think those are
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:49.640]  people who probably listen to you and uh pay attention to me but
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:54.440]  but they they know that uh you know the current system isn't working
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.760]  but i think we're the majority there's no doubt in my mind if you take people who
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.320]  uh have dropped out a want to go or dropping out now i'm not enthusiastic
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.080]  wouldn't vote for either of them i think they're listening more to what we're
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:09.720]  saying that was my next question i saw some of the
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.320]  breakdowns uh in areas of florida and other places
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:16.840]  where there were massively less republican voters
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:21.560]  just not voting uh this time around that voted four years ago
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.760]  uh with mccain and obama and i looked at the numbers and and the demographics i
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:29.160]  think you're alluding to this i'd like you to expand on congressman
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:32.280]  congressman ron paul joins us if he's just tuned in live here on this friday
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.000]  edition that it is the ron paul libertarian constitutional
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:42.280]  true america uh group that was snubbed and demonized and
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:45.720]  attacked and drummed out by the rockefeller blue blood
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:50.280]  republicans that just didn't vote i mean i know that i ended up not voting
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:53.240]  because of that richard reeves uh one of my crew members was one of your
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.920]  delegates he ended up not doing that most republicans and conservatives and
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.760]  libertarians i talked to just said hey let obama come in and bring in total
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:03.960]  communism let's let everybody really see what this is like
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:08.120]  no more of these fake republicans uh who are basically exactly the same
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.040]  republican and name only uh counterfeit conservatives
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:15.880]  uh i mean what i'm hearing is people are voting by buying four five million
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:21.240]  guns a month and uh they're done you know
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:24.600]  now people are humping down and they they realize this
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.400]  and uh the big question the big job we had is uh
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.680]  when the major crisis is the really big one
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.120]  is uh you know there will be a revamping there's always a
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:39.640]  a restoration of a currency that people can at least
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:43.400]  trust for a while are told to trust it and they have to have
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:48.840]  restored confidence in a government and right now though the contest is between
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:52.840]  us who would like very limited uh federal government and a lot of self
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:56.200]  government uh versus those who want to march on
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:02.600]  we're not to see i don't i don't usually use word carelessly but onto a form of you know just
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:07.320]  socialism but it's a form of socialism that's called fascism and that's what
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.240]  why i dread the combination of big government big corporations and when
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.680]  you look at that whether it's medical care or the media or the military
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:20.600]  uh the uh golden tax in the banking industry that
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:24.360]  that's that's who's uh been in charge and they're going to
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.920]  hang on tenaciously so our challenge is uh is very great
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:32.200]  but our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds and people
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.960]  because of the crisis they're looking elsewhere because they know that
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:42.200]  uh the economic policy of kanesian uh and the inflation of the fed uh
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:46.840]  they're they're not uh you know confident that they can do it again
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:51.400]  there's a term out there obamaism or obamaism
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.720]  basically communism and you you just said it as someone who studied history and
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:00.120]  also uh finance and economics they're always saying
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:03.880]  oh we have the choice of fascism or socialism in the extreme of
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:08.120]  socialism communism but stalin and hitler had a
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:13.320]  packed together uh they divided poland in half stalin admired hitler and adopted
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:17.800]  much of what he did uh musolini and hitler were actually
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.040]  national socialist uh they socialized things for the general public
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:26.600]  but allowed mega robber barons to have a centralized fascist economy and
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:29.640]  historically that's what i've seen just studying history myself
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:32.520]  is you get a socialism or communism on the bottom
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:36.600]  with powerful uh exempt elites or empires
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.360]  that are uh you know incredibly wealthy with the general public
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:46.040]  fighting over scraps and i mean this is the type of real definition we need out
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:48.520]  there that liberalism we hear about is not
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:52.440]  liberal at all like thomas jefferson a real liberal this is a virulent
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:56.920]  authoritarianism you know and uh when these
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:01.240]  changes occur if uh national socialism is defeated
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:05.880]  they have no trouble becoming uh becoming communists
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.960]  in this in the in the communists in russia kgb became
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.680]  uh sort of uh you know corporates you know all the stuff that was amazing to
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.520]  me the five years that you had these billionaires and then i found out that
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:22.280]  it was the kgb that ended up opening most of the big businesses
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.520]  they did have more of a market economy and you can't complain about the soviet
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:30.040]  fallen apart but really but many of the same people
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:32.920]  stayed in charge so they're very flexible they went power and money in
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.520]  control and what they call it is secondary to that
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.040]  sure and again the proper definition of obama unism
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.040]  which i hope everybody adopts is the high tax big government economic growth
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:48.040]  killing centrally planned economic regime favored by barack who's saying
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:50.440]  obama essentially the same as communism and
[02:41:50.440 --> 02:41:55.400]  socialism uh and i mean if this isn't obama unism i don't
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:59.320]  know what is congressman when you talk about we're already over the cliff
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:04.680]  when you talk about uh you know we are basically far gone
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:08.280]  that's not negativity that's that's historically being
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:11.560]  being accurate in in in my well research view but can you
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:14.840]  flesh it out you know you talked a few years ago about something big is coming
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.280]  break down where we're going because i've seen numbers even in the wall street
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:21.160]  journal that are per capita government debt
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:25.880]  individual debt is far above greases even and so how you expect historically
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.960]  you've predicted so much of this what you expect to now unfold as we see the
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:34.440]  economy imploding just days after obama gets back in
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.440]  i was always impressed with uh talking with the young people on the campuses
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:42.840]  and telling them how bad i see things and then the comments afterwards when we
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:46.120]  talked to them they say you do only gives me hope and they come across very
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:49.640]  optimistic and i think knowing the truth and what to do and offering them
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:54.680]  something else uh is a reason for uh for optimism but my point
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:58.840]  about uh us being over the cliff means that
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:02.360]  i don't work on the assumption that all of a sudden there's going to be an
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.280]  agreement in december or january and they're going to solve spending
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:10.760]  and deficit problems in the entire way now that that's that's not going to
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.280]  happen so to work over the cliff in that sense
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:18.440]  and we're falling off we just don't know the entire consequences of this
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:22.920]  so i see the consequence being that uh there will be
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:26.520]  more and more debt and more and more inflation
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:30.600]  the money will finally come out and start beating up the price is even
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:34.120]  even more so and uh today i wrote a little thing
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:37.480]  commenting on the germans wanting to get their gold
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:40.840]  holdings out of the fat holdings back to new york
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:44.280]  and i said maybe this is the crack in the themes
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:49.960]  where they're losing confidence uh of the uh supremacy of the dollar as well
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:54.040]  as the supremacy of our political system you know we went through
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:59.240]  depressions we went through world wars and we always came out on top
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.480]  you know people said and even now i mean we're still on top
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:06.440]  uh in the sense that when they have a crisis
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:09.880]  day in the market people will still buy those stupid
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:13.160]  government bonds you know because they don't know where else to go
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.400]  but i think this idea that the germans are saying hey do you really have our
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:20.920]  gold and what if they find out there's gold isn't there what if they decide to
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:24.440]  go along with our concern and check and say tell us where
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:28.360]  our gold is as well and that to me will combine
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.200]  with the recognition that the war that we took upon ourselves
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:38.520]  the drone war and the uh unwarranted continuous bombing in this global war
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:43.080]  on terrorism is going to be something that we can't handle
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:47.560]  because just having a lot of nukes on submarines can't solve those problems
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:50.760]  and uh and if we get weakened with our dollar and
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:56.120]  financially uh i think we'll be a paper tiger militarily
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:59.160]  and then i see what would happen then as a movement
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:05.480]  for all these all the countries that we have uh be little and badgered and uh
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:10.360]  and you know bomb they're going to love to come piling on us
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:13.800]  and uh it'll be interesting to see if the next year or two this
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:17.000]  whole thing about what germany's talking about might not be
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.200]  in the opening salvo on uh an international attack on our dollar
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:25.720]  and congressman as you know there's a bunch of other countries a lot of
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:28.920]  latin american countries led by venezuela that are pulling their gold
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.760]  out of england out of the euro out of the us as well
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:36.600]  and so we really see the battle lines being drawn we see the chinese trying to
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.160]  get away from treasuries and then here at home
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:45.880]  we did a national harris poll for info wars dot com that just came out yesterday
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:49.880]  a scientific poll 35 of americans would accept the electric shock
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:53.960]  bracelets at the tsa actually with homeland security two years ago
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:57.560]  looked at adopting where we all wear taser bracelets that way we're all safe
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:02.520]  i'm not joking folks and also 30 percent or nearly a third
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:07.000]  in the same harris poll said they would accept a tsa body cavity search
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:11.400]  and this is not satire ladies and gentlemen congressman you yourself have
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:14.280]  complained of the abuse at their hands
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:17.880]  and now we've seen other congress people complain of it and it's getting more
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:22.040]  intense what is your take on the 1.6 billion bullets
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.480]  now being purchased by homeland security what is your take on the tsa
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:29.800]  now on the highways all of this expansion of the police state
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.480]  well it's all preparation they say just in cases of emergency
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:38.280]  we have to restore order uh some of them are probably sincere in the sense that
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:41.240]  we can't control events they didn't control events uh
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:44.600]  they didn't know when the storm was coming but if it does occur
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:48.040]  you know they want to order is is what they want
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:52.920]  they want order and therefore uh it doesn't prove
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:56.440]  that they have something absolutely planned on paper is actually what they're
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:01.160]  going to do and when but uh they also know the fragility of the system like
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:05.160]  we know we know it's fragile and we know that uh whether it's a
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:10.600]  storm or a financial crisis that uh people people are going to unruly
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:14.760]  and and my argument is that it is a moral issue
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:19.400]  but uh there's a lot of morality that needs to be taught because people
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:24.600]  who give out government services uh are they believe themselves to be very
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.960]  moral just like you know the thug on the street
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:32.040]  he doesn't necessarily lay awake at night for what he has done wrong
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:36.200]  but i think as the government breaks down and can't provide the services
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:40.280]  that immorality will be expanded in with the people
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:43.400]  and the people will say well the government has to do this and now
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:46.760]  they're not forthcoming so therefore i am going to take what is rightfully my
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:51.640]  own and i think our enemies know that and they'll say well
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:54.760]  uh even though they have pretended that they were going to take care
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:58.680]  of everybody who needs help they're really there to control them
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:02.600]  so this is why i think they lay these plans but it is rather scary
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.600]  uh especially since the founders didn't even want the national police force
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:10.520]  we should have any federal agents other than our military to have guns
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:14.200]  and now we have hundreds of thousands i don't know the exact number i know it's
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.120]  over a hundred thousand federal agents who are carrying guns
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:21.000]  and uh that number is going to continue to expand
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.080]  uh it looks like they have a lot of guns if they're buying a lot of bullets
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:29.160]  so basically do you agree with the i mean my
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:32.520]  boil down that they know the collapse is coming
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:36.600]  they're digging in for it while telling the public it's bad to basically be a
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  prepper i mean why doesn't government want us to be preppers
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:44.840]  11 days without power now in many areas of new york and new jersey
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:48.200]  and all government is doing is frustrating the efforts at churches
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:51.720]  and citizens that did prepare that are actually holding things together and
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:55.400]  giving their neighbors food some estimates are more than 60 made no
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:58.760]  preparation uh they're they're just begging the government
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:02.520]  that's the obama disaster plan is to have just i guess a can
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:05.720]  a bucket you beg beg for government handouts from
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:09.720]  yeah but that that'll come going in i don't know if you saw it but
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:13.960]  this this picture should be used by all of us to show
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:17.480]  is actually how efficient they are did you see the picture
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:21.800]  of the fema office up in new york they had to war the storm then
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:25.160]  and then the northeast and northeastern come in
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:28.920]  and the snow came and you know in the sciences fema office
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:34.680]  closed due to weather yes i did see that did you see that thing in fact guys
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.040]  pull it up fema office closed due to weather it's all over the place we can
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:41.240]  show people watching on tv that's something else that is
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:45.480]  so symbolic of the idiocy and you know people
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:49.560]  always you know they went after me for having condemned fema for so long and
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:52.360]  voting against it in spite of the fact that i took care of a
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:57.800]  of a coastal uh district but i won that argument over with my
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:01.800]  constituents because i did more to help them get around the
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.480]  bureaucracy and get through the bureaucracy and when the police
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:08.680]  wouldn't uh or the fans wouldn't allow them to go in and get there probably we
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:12.680]  would go to bat form so that the people themselves are a little bit
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:15.640]  further ahead than than the politicians and the media people
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.480]  think we are they are absolutely congressman moving quickly now in the
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.680]  last 10 minutes we have left with you um what do you expect obama to do now
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:28.360]  that he's got four more years in his in his victory speech he talked about how
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:32.360]  we're a collective or not individuals very creepy kind of you didn't build
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:35.960]  it statements again uh he's got constituents literally that just
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:39.880]  beg uh incoherently for their free obama phones i'm not trying to be mean
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:44.520]  it's just very very sad what dependency does to people uh and now
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:49.320]  they are just racing ahead saying you in uh gun treating and now dying feinstein
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:52.920]  it's on record says she physically wants california style
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:56.760]  not just a ban on sale of semianas they want you to turn them in
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:00.200]  i mean that could cause a civil war congressman people are not turning their
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:04.680]  guns in now that that's right and uh you know
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:08.360]  politically they going back off on that you know in the last several
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:13.640]  presidential elections even this one obama didn't campaign on stricter gun
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:17.160]  control that doesn't mean he won't work for him but he knows
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:22.040]  politically is not popular and i think those are the uh you know
[02:51:22.040 --> 02:51:26.120]  drawing the lines in the sand if they knock on the door they want your gold
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:30.040]  and want your gun uh i don't think people are going to give them up
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:34.200]  but that doesn't put them out of business to harass us
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:40.040]  they're going to uh maybe uh put more limits on buying ammunition
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:43.640]  uh you know more taxes on it they're going to
[02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:47.160]  uh make it more difficult for you to sell your gold or use your gold and maybe
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:52.760]  have 50 70 tax on your gold and they will do this
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:56.680]  but that'll just drive the underground economy uh you know
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:52:01.640]  to a much greater height but now they're going to they will continue to do that
[02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:05.720]  but i don't know how this treaty will pay on how i keep always wanting to be
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:09.960]  you know bit off the best thing is they they can possibly do that that's going
[02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:13.960]  against the grain so once again it's going to be up to us
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:18.600]  to reach people and not reach our hardcore friends
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:23.080]  i mean that's why we have to reach out to a new audience as well
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:26.520]  and say that they have to join us in these efforts
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:29.880]  and uh that's i'm hopeful for that because
[02:52:29.880 --> 02:52:34.360]  we do have the internet you know and and uh i know they're trying to attack us
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:38.360]  there but we're still uh able to get more from me right
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:42.680]  now we're we're riding high on our internet
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:47.080]  abilities compared to uh the three major in the tv right now
[02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:50.200]  absolutely are you concerned about the internet kill switch
[02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:53.720]  cyber security and all these calls to reinstate the fairness doctrine for
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:57.400]  talk radio yeah i am concerned but
[02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:02.120]  i also hope that technology is so big and so broad
[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:06.600]  that uh you know that the private market as they would overcome any
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:10.440]  obstacles so and i don't understand exactly how all that
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:13.960]  works sure uh i hope i'm not naive to think that
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:18.280]  people can uh you know develop their own protection but ultimately the only
[02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:22.120]  thing that counts with its guns the goals of the internet or war
[02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:27.320]  is to awaken the people to saying we're not going to put up with this
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:31.240]  uh governments reflect the people sure expanding on that in the limited time
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:33.720]  we have left going to move quick now congressman because i want to get to
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:36.680]  several other points here uh i'm very glad to see that you've
[02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:39.880]  taken back over campaign for liberty now that you're not running for president
[02:53:39.880 --> 02:53:43.480]  and about to finish up there with congress so congratulations on that
[02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:47.320]  very exciting to see uh you in there because i know you know like nobody
[02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:50.600]  else can uh drive it right and with all the grassroots
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:54.600]  what do you make of the republicans in this new spin that republicans need to
[02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:58.840]  get uh more uh socialistic and become the democratic
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:01.800]  party to win when the reason the republicans have lost in my
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:05.160]  view uh is that they've gotten so unconstitutional
[02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:08.280]  people are just standing down that's what the numbers show
[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:11.880]  uh what's your take on this talking point we're seeing that
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:14.840]  republicans should just adopt Mao Zedong's views
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:19.560]  yeah it's just diversion because but where we are in this country today and
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:22.840]  when we look at our political system we only have one party so we're already
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:25.800]  there it's just tone and rhetoric is slightly
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:29.080]  different so yeah they may move a little bit in that direction and what they
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:32.600]  say has nothing much to do with what they do
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:36.040]  and uh that's why uh you know we have to watch
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:40.840]  what they do and where they go but uh going in that direction of course would
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:44.520]  be the obviously wrong thing and i think it's becoming more clear
[02:54:44.520 --> 02:54:47.640]  because we don't know the exact numbers of support
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:51.400]  that we had in the campaign but it's bigger than they gave us credit for
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:56.680]  and uh i i keep thinking of those 12 million that refuse to vote some of them
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:59.480]  maybe a large number of those are sympathetic to us
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:04.040]  uh so therefore you know our our numbers outside
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:08.520]  uh are significant and uh i still work on the assumption it
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.280]  it is that attitude that eventually prevails i mean when
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:16.680]  when the attitudes change in the Soviet system uh communism you know fell apart
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:20.760]  because it had no strength left and the people no longer supported it
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:24.280]  absolutely they can only steal from one group to give it to the other
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:27.080]  and as it gets clearer and clearer the big government doesn't work it'll
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:29.880]  finally implode that's what we've just got to keep working keep getting the
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:32.360]  word out uh congressman is it time for people to
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:35.400]  apologize to you and my shelf and others we're talking about
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:38.600]  the Bilderberg group and the Davos new world order crowd
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:42.600]  because now in the financial times of london reuters ap they say there is a
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:45.560]  global government technocrats mega bankers
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:48.280]  they're going to run the countries they're going to appoint the leaders
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:51.640]  they're going to get us at a fiscal cliff hold us hostage i want to play you a
[02:55:51.640 --> 02:55:55.560]  brief clip here from the kudlow report where they announced we're slaves to
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:58.760]  international bankers here's that clip congressman paul
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:04.680]  so mostly what they do is hold summits i think that right now the question is do
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:08.360]  we all work for central bankers that's what i want to address to our guests
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:13.480]  tonight is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:18.440]  in charge jim jimiorio you say we've got some downside here a correction in the
[02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:21.480]  markets fine but aren't we all just living and
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:25.320]  dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:30.200]  that there's a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go any lower than say
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:33.880]  five percent down from here of course we are because we look at the economic
[02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:36.920]  and then all four guests agree we're under world government they're bragging
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:40.360]  we're under world government but then i hear we're not supposed to talk about it
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:43.720]  congressman isn't this our strength and not our weakness
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:47.720]  that we've been right about this instead now we're being told we should not talk
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:51.240]  about this well obviously they we should talk
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:54.040]  about the fact that they don't want us to means that we really have to talk
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:56.840]  about it i've written a speech at uh hoping i get
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:59.800]  enough time to give them a house floor a farewell speech
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:05.240]  and i listed five major problems that we face and one of those five is
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:10.680]  international government you know that the fact that it's the UN WTO IMF and
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:16.120]  and uh and at the world bank taking over deciding when we go to war and
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.880]  and how to deal with trade war the whole works so i would say
[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:22.840]  giving up our national sovereignty it's bad enough that we've given up
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:26.840]  individuals and state sovereignty to our federal government but i see the
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:30.200]  giving up of our national sovereignty to internationalism
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:33.800]  and uh they they claim well they need a WTO to have free trade
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:37.640]  they need a WTO to protect this powerful trading special interest the
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.880]  international so uh yes that is a big issue but don't hold
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:44.680]  your breath on getting your apology because i don't think chris
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:47.720]  matthews is going to call your russian ball is going to call you in the next
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:51.720]  week or two absolutely well i got a minute and a half left congressman i hope
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:54.440]  you can come back again soon i don't want to kill you literally
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:57.720]  you're making you work so hard but thank you so much uh for coming on the
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:01.800]  broadcast uh in closing uh we just want to thank you for all you've
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:04.840]  done and can you talk about also the vindication
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:07.960]  uh that they now admit all over the news la times you name it
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:11.320]  that al-qaeda was put in by the un and nato and our government
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.640]  in libya now in syria uh we'll fade the music down for a moment
[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:19.640]  uh and is now blowing back on us again your your comment on that
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:22.680]  yeah well i shouldn't surprise any of us because i think both
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:27.400]  when that uh you know started uh and just at the very beginning i made some
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:31.160]  projections on that and before you knew it uh the weapons and the support we
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:33.480]  were given to certain groups returned against us
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:37.800]  so it's uh but i don't have to be a genius you don't have to be a genius to
[02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:41.960]  figure out very well said congress
