[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:35.580]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:35.580 --> 00:40.620]  alright ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us we're
[00:40.620 --> 00:46.020]  going to be on the air here for the next three hours today we've got a jam-packed
[00:46.020 --> 00:51.620]  broadcast for you we've got the latest on the activation of FEMA camps across the
[00:51.620 --> 00:57.500]  United States they've been expanded and proliferated in the last 20 years now
[00:57.500 --> 01:04.400]  the system is coming in like gangbusters through a Kellogg Brown and Root
[01:04.400 --> 01:10.060]  Halliburton contract and in all 50 states preparing to get people to man the
[01:10.060 --> 01:15.660]  camps the jail guards the people to run the barricades the checkpoints to to
[01:15.660 --> 01:20.020]  expand and upkeep the barbed wire the laundry service the food service
[01:20.020 --> 01:27.100]  everything and of course these are all multi-use for the illegal immigrants for
[01:27.100 --> 01:34.320]  financial collapse and for political dissidents and we have the emergency
[01:34.320 --> 01:42.660]  centers establishment act that of course gives us a blueprint of how all of
[01:42.660 --> 01:47.340]  this is going to operate but learning that they're now giving out the bids to
[01:47.340 --> 01:54.300]  have all these companies subcontractors ready to man the camps within 72 hours
[01:54.300 --> 01:58.660]  now the mainstream media will pick up what I just said and spin it and go oh
[01:58.660 --> 02:03.340]  72 hours past where's the camps that's not what we're saying the contract you
[02:03.340 --> 02:09.060]  can go read them with the names of the people involved and Halliburton and KBR
[02:09.060 --> 02:13.700]  and all of it is saying the companies are now going to be on standby to when
[02:13.700 --> 02:19.060]  they're given the order within 72 hours to deploy and have the camps ready for
[02:19.060 --> 02:24.900]  business so they're being paid to be on standby waiting to take the full
[02:24.900 --> 02:30.740]  contract and this is the first time in our research that they've ever under the
[02:30.740 --> 02:37.860]  COG emergency system prepared the contracts to actually staff these they
[02:37.860 --> 02:42.580]  got some auxiliary ones at military bases and prisons that they keep empty
[02:42.580 --> 02:45.860]  that are at the ready that's in the emergency centers establishment act but
[02:45.860 --> 02:53.060]  now this is preparing for the full staffing across the United States and
[02:53.060 --> 02:59.540]  so that is coming up after the break today John Corzine to tell House panel
[02:59.540 --> 03:02.780]  getting ready to testify right now that he doesn't know where customers money
[03:02.780 --> 03:06.580]  went it's been about a week and a half since we got an update from good old
[03:06.580 --> 03:11.060]  Gerald Salente who had more than six figures snatched out of his segregated
[03:11.060 --> 03:13.980]  private account by them because they bought up a company that he was
[03:13.980 --> 03:20.100]  brokering with since the 1970s Gerald Salente joining us a T minus one hour
[03:20.100 --> 03:24.260]  and then you want him you got him I was waiting to get him back on we got a lot
[03:24.260 --> 03:28.300]  of new intel and he's got from his source and I know who his one living source
[03:28.300 --> 03:38.420]  is now the other one can from died Mr. L. I'll just say who Lindsey Williams has
[03:38.420 --> 03:42.740]  well gotten people like Stan Monty from contact with has confirmed all of this
[03:42.740 --> 03:49.940]  the other big former or a big three oil company head actual CEO likes to leak
[03:49.940 --> 03:53.460]  this stuff out through Lindsey and most of it ends up basically being accurate
[03:53.460 --> 03:57.420]  sometimes oil prices haven't gone up quite as much as Lindsay said they would
[03:57.420 --> 04:01.500]  last time but he certainly called what four years ago that it would go up to
[04:01.500 --> 04:05.340]  a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel and then plunge back down to below 40
[04:05.340 --> 04:08.340]  everybody laughed at that when he said that but he's got some interesting
[04:08.340 --> 04:13.220]  intel on the Iran situation the global economy his sources did tell him what a
[04:13.220 --> 04:16.260]  year and a half ago look for the Middle East implode into revolution and then
[04:16.260 --> 04:22.660]  invasions that's now happening so about 95% of what Mr. Fromm told him it was
[04:22.660 --> 04:26.340]  very accurate because the globalist change their plans occasionally and Mr.
[04:26.340 --> 04:30.540]  L is even more high-powered I'll just leave it at that Mr. L his initial is
[04:30.540 --> 04:37.380]  L but that's coming up today with Lindsey Williams always informative coming up
[04:37.380 --> 04:40.860]  and we've got some incredible second amendment news as well I'll get to in

[08:05.940 --> 08:13.420]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:14.940 --> 08:20.940]  welcome my friends welcome here we are live it is the eighth day of December
[08:20.940 --> 08:29.780]  2011 on this Thursday edition I had the Austin police chief in studio with me
[08:29.780 --> 08:33.860]  yesterday and I appreciate him having the courage to come in here and get
[08:33.860 --> 08:38.700]  grilled and when I brought up fast and furious he said well yes when it's
[08:38.700 --> 08:43.740]  killing police officers it's probably not a very good idea and I don't like it
[08:43.740 --> 08:50.060]  we need stronger statements against Eric Holder and the Justice Department who
[08:50.060 --> 08:54.540]  been caught perjuring themselves and who were caught shipping tens of thousands
[08:54.540 --> 08:59.700]  of guns directly to cartels in Mexico to knock out their competition and allow
[08:59.700 --> 09:03.980]  them to ship drugs into the United States I told you about this back in
[09:03.980 --> 09:08.580]  February at prisonplanet.com Paul Watson was the first to write on it out of
[09:08.580 --> 09:12.660]  federal filings and federal court cases where national security was declared in
[09:12.660 --> 09:19.020]  Sinaloa drug cartel cases in Chicago Illinois and El Paso Texas months after
[09:19.020 --> 09:24.660]  that the El Paso Times Chicago Tribune had blurbs buried in just boring
[09:24.660 --> 09:30.300]  headlines about Sinaloa drug cases it would well the US government declared
[09:30.300 --> 09:33.300]  national security and did admit that they'd allowed cocaine to be brought in
[09:33.300 --> 09:38.500]  and didn't allow money to be laundered by Sinaloa fast and furious was just one
[09:38.500 --> 09:47.220]  section of that but the main caveat that is the the key to it all the cherry on
[09:47.220 --> 09:52.820]  top was that it was clearly to blame the Second Amendment now I've told all the
[09:52.820 --> 09:55.700]  journalists out there if you go to the research and we've done the newscast we've
[09:55.700 --> 09:59.580]  written reports ourselves you can go get your Pulitzer Prize for it if you
[09:59.580 --> 10:06.380]  want we told you two years ago that they were having stings on gun shows and
[10:06.380 --> 10:10.300]  staged events we got documents leaked to us they were using illegal aliens for
[10:10.300 --> 10:14.860]  that they did here in Austin we blow the whistle on that setting people up even
[10:14.860 --> 10:18.580]  at fake licenses somebody buys one in a private sale they still throw the book
[10:18.580 --> 10:24.620]  at you we went over all that here on air and we also noticed that there were
[10:24.620 --> 10:32.260]  other speeches given by Eric Holder in Texas in Arizona and in other states
[10:32.260 --> 10:37.540]  where he said we've got guns from the US coming back in we've got a ban assault
[10:37.540 --> 10:42.340]  weapons again and banned more than one firearm being sold and get licensing for
[10:42.340 --> 10:47.740]  everybody and they talked about their gun tracking programs that's how I knew
[10:47.740 --> 10:52.220]  when they got caught doing all this in the first months of 2011 that they'd
[10:52.220 --> 10:55.540]  already been involved that he knew because there were the stinking press
[10:55.540 --> 11:00.500]  conferences and we went and dug up the press conferences and played them here
[11:00.500 --> 11:05.580]  with the deputy attorney general the attorney general and mr. Napolitano I
[11:05.580 --> 11:13.060]  mean miss Napolitano all of them all of them I mean right there perjury perjury
[11:13.060 --> 11:17.500]  and I said you watch they're gonna go into Congress and tell us to stop trying
[11:17.500 --> 11:21.340]  to make political points Bush was doing the same program because I knew about
[11:21.340 --> 11:26.180]  this program six years ago from silly Castile and others former DEA agent big
[11:26.180 --> 11:30.060]  when they tried to recruit him to train Los Zetas near Kingsville at one of
[11:30.060 --> 11:34.860]  those big ranches and I knew selling who they shut up and put in prison he said
[11:34.860 --> 11:39.540]  to get out soon for selling somebody some shotguns at a gun show I know you
[11:39.540 --> 11:43.700]  wasn't the guy that made stuff up and we had other intel on that so we were six
[11:43.700 --> 11:48.060]  years I guess technically about five years because this is broken last year or
[11:48.060 --> 11:53.700]  so we were five years ahead of the curve as usual because we live in the real
[11:53.700 --> 11:57.700]  world well once you know the government's gun running drug running child
[11:57.700 --> 12:03.260]  kidnap running sex slave running factory slave running you watch congressional
[12:03.260 --> 12:07.820]  hearings about it nobody gets in trouble once you aren't naive anymore you know
[12:07.820 --> 12:11.100]  what's going on and you know I raised that because the police chiefs in here
[12:11.100 --> 12:14.820]  and I'm going what about fashion furious and he was doing the sergeant
[12:14.820 --> 12:17.980]  Schultz thing of I know nothing I know nothing but he knows that's so big he's
[12:17.980 --> 12:21.140]  like by the way that guy's real smart he knows about all this stuff he says he
[12:21.140 --> 12:24.780]  listens to the show of course he knows and I quizzed him he does listen a lot
[12:24.780 --> 12:30.580]  but the point is that he said well that is too bad no it's not too bad it's
[12:30.580 --> 12:35.100]  criminal and it's a window into false flag it's a window into government
[12:35.100 --> 12:38.740]  staging things got cornered the police chief after the show and I said listen
[12:38.740 --> 12:43.700]  here's this film about Oklahoma City and I said you know Eric Holder got caught
[12:43.700 --> 12:47.660]  his emails got released in lawsuits where he was you know sending emails about
[12:47.660 --> 12:52.780]  covering up what really happened and it's a d-day emergency for the Justice
[12:52.780 --> 12:56.740]  Department job number one to cover up what happened in Oklahoma City well we
[12:56.740 --> 13:01.140]  know what the cover up was the ATF went in there and blew that building up and
[13:01.140 --> 13:05.100]  set up their own military Patsy who was involved with them we got all the
[13:05.100 --> 13:10.220]  witnesses the cops that saw it the the head of the HUD department who saw it
[13:10.220 --> 13:17.580]  all of them those they haven't killed okay so so when I sit here and tell
[13:17.580 --> 13:21.700]  somebody the government criminal elements of it bombed Oklahoma City I'm
[13:21.700 --> 13:25.700]  not just saying that when I tell you the government shipping guns into Mexico and
[13:25.700 --> 13:30.020]  drugs back in I'm not just saying that okay when I tell you they're going to
[13:30.020 --> 13:33.060]  implode the world market through derivatives and take over country by
[13:33.060 --> 13:36.340]  country and I list which country they're gonna go after first and then the
[13:36.340 --> 13:40.140]  next and the next and the next it's because it's all public if you will
[13:40.140 --> 13:46.900]  only open your eyeballs up you be like if you looked over your neighbors fence
[13:46.900 --> 13:51.620]  and look they were putting a body bag in a hole they dug six feet long six feet
[13:51.620 --> 13:54.500]  deep and it looks like they're picking up a heavy body dropping and then you
[13:54.500 --> 13:59.900]  say oh that couldn't be I'm sure they're just burying something else no if it
[13:59.900 --> 14:04.100]  looks like a body it might not be but you've got to go investigate you got to
[14:04.100 --> 14:08.220]  go hey Fred what are you burying there are you got to wait till Fred leaves town
[14:08.220 --> 14:12.060]  and go dig into there and find out or you've got to call the police it's the
[14:12.060 --> 14:15.980]  same thing oh I just don't want to believe that Alex Art Aceveta was telling
[14:15.980 --> 14:19.100]  me in the hall that just couldn't be true couldn't be true they've been caught
[14:19.100 --> 14:23.820]  red-handed and it's the same with people all over this country none of us and not
[14:23.820 --> 14:29.780]  not not Art Aceveta not his family not me not my family not Ron Paul no one
[14:29.780 --> 14:33.780]  no one as Ron Paul said a few months ago in debate there's a secret arrest and
[14:33.780 --> 14:38.860]  killing of American citizens without warrants anything it's one thing to say
[14:38.860 --> 14:42.620]  go out and get somebody dead or alive they resist kill them but bring them back
[14:42.620 --> 14:46.100]  and we want them to face trial we want intelligence you don't want trial or
[14:46.100 --> 14:51.260]  intelligence when you're involved in a fraud and Ron Paul said any of you could
[14:51.260 --> 14:55.620]  be next any of you politicians and media people this can be used on you and
[14:55.620 --> 15:00.060]  now they're saying it will be used against the general public none of us are
[15:00.060 --> 15:03.860]  safe let me say it again no one is safe
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.620]  Horsesign set any minute to take the stand before Congress he says he's gonna
[15:08.620 --> 15:11.580]  take the fifth that's in the Washington Post and it's gonna say he doesn't know
[15:11.580 --> 15:16.980]  where the now three billion dollars went the head of the company doesn't know
[15:16.980 --> 15:21.900]  that's what America's turned into they take people's private accounts they go
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.300]  gobble up and buy companies and then take people's private brokerage bank
[15:26.300 --> 15:30.940]  account a lot of people have bank accounts in those and have credit cards on
[15:30.940 --> 15:37.020]  them they take your money and then say I don't know where it is listen this is a
[15:37.020 --> 15:41.180]  trial balloon to see if they can get away with this but you know what don't
[15:41.180 --> 15:46.980]  believe me just just just watch the next five phases come into place so all of
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.500]  this comes out I knew they were blaming the Second Amendment I knew they were
[15:50.500 --> 15:54.300]  setting this up two years ago I knew really six years ago but I was sure
[15:54.300 --> 15:58.540]  two years ago and I've been beating the drum ever since and here it is
[15:58.540 --> 16:04.300]  confirmed ATF plotted to use fast and furious to demonize second amendment
[16:04.300 --> 16:07.740]  prisonplanet.com now this went up yesterday afternoon it's already
[16:07.740 --> 16:11.540]  scrolled off the main page it's in the archive area I think I'm gonna ask Kirk
[16:11.540 --> 16:15.780]  to repost it in the main area but Paul Watson has this article ATF created the
[16:15.780 --> 16:24.180]  problem so they could be the solution to it that is a quote out of CBS News or
[16:24.180 --> 16:28.860]  something weirds going on CBS News had a article two days ago of why Ron Paul is
[16:28.860 --> 16:35.780]  right on 10 points I'm what's going on here I mean as the mainstream media
[16:35.780 --> 16:38.380]  figured out they've lost all credibility so they're desperately trying to get
[16:38.380 --> 16:41.900]  some of the back I don't know or maybe even people in the power structure have
[16:41.900 --> 16:47.900]  figured out do we really want a kind of like Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia style
[16:47.900 --> 16:53.500]  tyranny I mean is that good for anybody no it's not good for anybody even the
[16:53.500 --> 16:57.820]  elites are creating a system that's going to destabilize their control
[16:57.820 --> 17:01.980]  because once you have a total tyranny the people under you always know they
[17:01.980 --> 17:07.380]  can knock you off freedom and due process protects everyone even the
[17:07.380 --> 17:14.580]  criminals now continuing as we postulated when the scandal broke wasn't
[17:14.580 --> 17:19.380]  postulation the fast and furious program that saw the ATF deliver guns
[17:19.380 --> 17:24.780]  into the hands of Mexican drug gangs was admittedly exploited to demonize the
[17:24.780 --> 17:31.500]  Second Amendment and push new gun control regulations documents obtained by CBS
[17:31.500 --> 17:37.700]  News show that the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives discuss
[17:37.700 --> 17:41.620]  using the covered operation fast and furious to argue for controversial new
[17:41.620 --> 17:47.460]  rules on gun sales that's a quote emails obtained by the network show ATF agents
[17:47.460 --> 17:51.540]  discussing how they could tie guns involved in Mexican violence to gun
[17:51.540 --> 17:56.340]  deals and gun dealers based in the US to justify the implementation of the
[17:56.340 --> 18:00.260]  demand letter 3 a regulation required guns towards report the sale of multiple
[18:00.260 --> 18:04.340]  rifers which they went ahead and did outside law they tried to pass the law
[18:04.340 --> 18:07.860]  this year they couldn't so they just we don't need laws anymore by the way they've
[18:07.860 --> 18:12.260]  already got long rifle shotgun or handgun how many you're getting through
[18:12.260 --> 18:19.700]  the FBI instant background registrations what it is okay gun dealers
[18:19.700 --> 18:22.140]  don't like you didn't you know that because then you won't buy from them
[18:22.140 --> 18:27.900]  you'll go out and do a private sale but that's what's going on here and so when
[18:27.900 --> 18:30.780]  they say oh we just want to know if you're selling you know more than one
[18:30.780 --> 18:35.780]  rifle or handgun of its semi-auto we just want to know they already know it's
[18:35.780 --> 18:42.140]  about telling them what to do outside of law shedding that precedent because
[18:42.140 --> 18:46.380]  that's the essence of tyranny just do whatever you want and they will do what
[18:46.380 --> 18:50.260]  they want they are taking the death benefits of all US military personnel
[18:50.260 --> 18:54.780]  Bloomberg reported it almost a year ago no one seems to care when you die and
[18:54.780 --> 18:57.980]  you're supposed to get your life insurance you're not gonna get it it's been
[18:57.980 --> 19:02.300]  announced and all you cops that serve the system you're just like in Europe

[19:09.300 --> 19:13.620]  don't deserve their own money they paid into okay well in Portugal and in Spain
[19:13.620 --> 19:18.660]  they're now gonna take private pension funds and have begun it not not even the
[19:18.660 --> 19:22.140]  old trick of a company creating a new subsidiary moving the assets into that
[19:22.140 --> 19:26.060]  and bankrupt in the old subsidiary and saying sorry that subsidiaries bankrupt
[19:26.060 --> 19:30.700]  you don't get the pension you paid into for 10 15 20 30 years no no no not just

[19:40.700 --> 19:45.060]  freak that likes to beat people up and all because we want to be a bunch of
[19:45.060 --> 19:49.780]  little children and won't wake up to how criminal the government is all because
[19:49.780 --> 19:55.260]  we insist on being naive all because we insist on being suckers and schmucks

[24:30.060 --> 24:34.980]  all right I need to get into the incredible police state developments
[24:34.980 --> 24:39.060]  with the FEMA camps being activated unbelievable globalist crime syndicate
[24:39.060 --> 24:46.660]  activity we've got so much more that we need to be breaking down here today and
[24:46.660 --> 24:50.180]  I know that we're jam-packed with Gerald Salente coming up and Lindsey Williams
[24:50.180 --> 24:54.340]  but I do want to open the phones up again for police and military now that on
[24:54.340 --> 25:00.020]  top of the NDAA passing secret arrest of citizens troops on the streets and
[25:00.020 --> 25:05.020]  definite detention now they're activating the camps and by the way this broke a day
[25:05.020 --> 25:11.420]  and a half ago this broke Tuesday night it's Thursday morning now and no
[25:11.420 --> 25:18.340]  mainstream coverage I mean here's Halliburton it's subsidiary KBR saying
[25:18.340 --> 25:23.660]  get ready with FEMA camps for collapse emergency economic you name it barricades
[25:23.660 --> 25:29.260]  barbed wire internment specialist the military announcing they're preparing
[25:29.260 --> 25:32.580]  for it the government admitting that it's coordinating the arrest of Occupy
[25:32.580 --> 25:35.740]  Wall Street the federal government is what are they doing well what's the
[25:35.740 --> 25:40.100]  White House doing in dozens of cities coordinating arrest of people that's
[25:40.100 --> 25:43.340]  your jurisdiction because you don't want a central government saying arrest
[25:43.340 --> 25:47.900]  people that's the stop a fascistic takeover the founders knew what they
[25:47.900 --> 25:50.380]  were doing
[25:51.420 --> 25:55.220]  you know the Austin police chief said the sky would literally have to fall to
[25:55.220 --> 25:59.780]  have military on the streets of Austin you're already paramilitary police and
[25:59.780 --> 26:03.180]  you're already taking federal marching orders I meant to bring up an article of
[26:03.180 --> 26:07.500]  that because Austin hasn't arrested a bunch of people except in one case and
[26:07.500 --> 26:16.260]  I meant to ask him hey when you did have some of those arrest because the
[26:16.260 --> 26:20.340]  permit wasn't right or whatever was that federally driven and I guess it
[26:20.340 --> 26:23.100]  happened the same weekend that the first coordinated arrest happened I guess it
[26:23.100 --> 26:28.620]  probably was I mean that's that's just wrong man I should have it brought that
[26:28.620 --> 26:32.140]  up I mean you realize how creepy that is regardless of what you think of Occupy
[26:32.140 --> 26:38.380]  Wall Street how creepy and out of control it is have the feds coordinating
[26:38.380 --> 26:44.980]  the arrest of people for not having the right permits locally or or sanitation
[26:44.980 --> 26:50.500]  issues that's a local issue that's makes me sick people we have these checks and
[26:50.500 --> 26:56.100]  balances for a reason our founders went through tyranny and look at all the
[26:56.100 --> 27:00.580]  other examples in history and look at this look at this is that is not going
[27:00.580 --> 27:05.940]  to go forward with any type of impeachment and they can against the head of
[27:05.940 --> 27:10.140]  the Justice Department he says it's up to Obama oh Obama completely Chicago
[27:10.140 --> 27:18.020]  Mafia run with Resco and Blagojevich and and and 500 million here and 600
[27:18.020 --> 27:21.940]  million there to energy companies that don't build anything just a total rip
[27:21.940 --> 27:27.700]  off total theft and General Electric heading up their their economic
[27:27.700 --> 27:30.780]  council openly shutting power plants down all over the country that they don't
[27:30.780 --> 27:34.300]  own because they run the program and have been given a waiver I mean just
[27:34.300 --> 27:39.100]  just just bald-faced criminality power prices going up blackouts being
[27:39.100 --> 27:45.140]  announced I mean a three-year-old could figure this out and then this criminal
[27:45.140 --> 27:49.220]  Obama with that criminal attorney general people like well I'm scared of
[27:49.220 --> 27:53.060]  the attorney general yeah I don't like him either he was the one running
[27:53.060 --> 27:57.780]  Oklahoma City you think it's fun to stand up to a murderer like this but you
[27:57.780 --> 28:03.420]  got to do it don't you get it they're going to ruin everything they're going
[28:03.420 --> 28:08.780]  to steal everything they like it he shipped tens of thousands of firearms
[28:08.780 --> 28:12.260]  directly into Mexico and when it started to break they spun it like they were
[28:12.260 --> 28:16.300]  just tracking some guns out of some gun shops turns out there were fistfights at
[28:16.300 --> 28:21.380]  ATF locations in multiple areas of the United States including Phoenix because
[28:21.380 --> 28:24.500]  some of them weren't total criminals and they're like you've got to stop
[28:24.500 --> 28:32.860]  shipping guns in to Mexico and drugs in I mean how much criminality will you
[28:32.860 --> 28:36.860]  accept how much is there a line in the sand is there any moral connection
[28:36.860 --> 28:39.820]  reality and those of you out there that aren't directly involved in all of this
[28:39.820 --> 28:44.780]  you know this is going on now this is all public there's no excuses there's no

[29:15.060 --> 29:18.220]  government said I want those Texans to turn their guns in who would become

[33:37.260 --> 33:43.820]  banks publicly who've signed us on to 1.5 quadrillion that's 1500 trillion
[33:43.820 --> 33:48.940]  conservatively that we do not owe and that the bought and paid for media is
[33:48.940 --> 33:52.860]  playing along with this fraud and that it's impossible to even pay back if we
[33:52.860 --> 33:56.580]  wanted to be part of the fraud you understand it's a debt bondage do you
[33:56.580 --> 33:59.940]  understand they've built FEMA camps do you understand they've trained the
[33:59.940 --> 34:03.420]  military to go down the street and set up checkpoints and take you to a FEMA
[34:03.420 --> 34:09.020]  camp do you understand they've trained and worked with 15 other nations in LE09
[34:09.020 --> 34:14.260]  it's public with FEMA to come into America and bring UN troops in that's
[34:14.260 --> 34:18.860]  even the Washington Post now to use Canadian and Mexican troops quote against
[34:18.860 --> 34:24.900]  domestic terrorist and to use North com against us do you understand me that they
[34:24.900 --> 34:30.100]  teach at West Point and the Army War College that foreign troops will have
[34:30.100 --> 34:34.740]  to be used in America do you understand it's public five years ago it was
[34:34.740 --> 34:41.780]  secret this is a global takeover plan America has been taken over just like
[34:41.780 --> 34:49.340]  Iraq just like Afghanistan you think you're fighting Al Qaeda oh yes the
[34:49.340 --> 34:53.780]  people over there fighting are fighting and dying and do have courage but the
[34:53.780 --> 34:57.660]  Al Qaeda they're fighting most of them are goat herders who've been ordered to
[34:57.660 --> 35:02.180]  go fight and it turns out their leadership on record is paid by the
[35:02.180 --> 35:06.180]  big banks you're like well doesn't make sense it makes perfect sense if you're
[35:06.180 --> 35:10.340]  in three-dimensional wargaming by the way it goes above three dimensions but if
[35:10.340 --> 35:13.980]  you can just grasp this if you're a new listener everything can really start to
[35:13.980 --> 35:17.740]  move forward in your understanding and I'm not trying to be condescending but
[35:17.740 --> 35:21.540]  we don't have time to play games here if you're big mega banks that want to get
[35:21.540 --> 35:25.500]  rid of people sovereignty and you know that the population historically will
[35:25.500 --> 35:29.140]  give up its freedom if they see an outside threat you go finance the
[35:29.140 --> 35:34.020]  outside threat and you have giant no bid contract wars and make trillions of
[35:34.020 --> 35:38.940]  dollars out of it and you secure the opium and run it up to 13 or 14 times
[35:38.940 --> 35:42.540]  what it was a decade ago and then when the troops speak out against it you
[35:42.540 --> 35:45.660]  kill them like Pat Tillman and then when that doesn't work you just have the
[35:45.660 --> 35:50.420]  troops go yeah we grow the opium it's patriotic Fox News CNN BBC people go
[35:50.420 --> 35:55.980]  okay well okay we grow the opium I mean come on come on the ATF ships guns into
[35:55.980 --> 36:00.660]  Mexico and then blames the Second Amendment confirmed release documents
[36:00.660 --> 36:09.300]  Congress has them public quote CBS News ATF created the problem so they could be
[36:09.300 --> 36:15.900]  the solution to it oh I think I've heard that before a galeon dialectic
[36:15.900 --> 36:24.900]  problem reaction solution look listen this stuff's all starting to come out
[36:24.900 --> 36:29.020]  because there's good people in the government I wouldn't be alive right
[36:29.020 --> 36:34.140]  now if most people in the government are good they are they're misguided like
[36:34.140 --> 36:37.660]  everybody else good apples bad apples whatever but there are people who were
[36:37.660 --> 36:41.860]  compartmentalized and and the media would say oh Alex Jones or Ron Paul or
[36:41.860 --> 36:44.940]  whoever they're just kooks but now they've seen everything start coming true
[36:44.940 --> 36:48.420]  and now they're going wow this makes sense and they're investigating and
[36:48.420 --> 36:52.860]  getting past the little the little divider of compartmentalization and
[36:52.860 --> 37:00.300]  finding out finding out what's going on right next door to them and let me tell
[37:00.300 --> 37:04.220]  you it didn't pretty I mean you think I just get up here on air and say the
[37:04.220 --> 37:09.900]  government runs white slavery rings a sex slavery including children there've
[37:09.900 --> 37:12.500]  been congressional hearings on it just type it into YouTube type it into
[37:12.500 --> 37:15.300]  Google and they have hearings where they go yeah
[37:15.300 --> 37:18.420]  Dinecourt Halliburton were caught running giant kidnapping rings and slave
[37:18.420 --> 37:21.780]  camps and the Congress person says well they're gonna get in trouble and the
[37:21.780 --> 37:26.780]  Secretary of Defense says no I mean just great faith no they're not going to they
[37:26.780 --> 37:30.500]  get in a penalty box they weren't allowed to have contracts in that region for a
[37:30.500 --> 37:34.220]  few months and the Congress person says that's all you that's the only trouble
[37:34.220 --> 37:45.460]  you have mm-hmm it's like Corzine the New Jersey Governor former head of the
[37:45.460 --> 37:50.140]  main enemy Goldman Sachs the main JP Morgan Chase makes the most of the
[37:50.140 --> 37:55.980]  money but they're very enforcer like like Goldman Sachs is like Darth Vader to
[37:55.980 --> 38:00.780]  Emperor Palpatine that is JP Morgan Chase literally but it's Darth Vader
[38:00.780 --> 38:03.860]  out there hacking everyone up around the galaxy in all these different
[38:03.860 --> 38:07.820]  countries running things you know releasing the financial hit men the
[38:07.820 --> 38:13.180]  jackals the Pentagon factual hit men and contractors and these countries you
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.420]  don't take their business deals they murder you and your family I've
[38:17.420 --> 38:23.180]  interviewed the economic hit men and others here on the show and they tell
[38:23.180 --> 38:26.620]  these leaders you will do this or bad things are about to happen you don't do
[38:26.620 --> 38:31.700]  it okay oh your your child died of an illness last week I'm sorry about that
[38:31.700 --> 38:37.980]  what the doctors say it was I mean that's who runs things we've got to say
[38:37.980 --> 38:42.420]  no to them at some point because they're not going to stop they're not going to
[38:42.420 --> 38:47.540]  back off no one is safe until we recognize them and face them and I'm not
[38:47.540 --> 38:50.460]  worried about myself and I've even said it I'm not even worried about my family
[38:50.460 --> 38:53.580]  I just put them in God's hands because nobody's got a future if we don't stop
[38:53.580 --> 38:59.860]  these people it's all in you got a fully commit to it ladies and gentlemen and
[38:59.860 --> 39:05.380]  that means going and researching so it's now admitted that the government has
[39:05.380 --> 39:12.940]  been caught shipping drugs in that was New York Times Sunday AFP Monday but no
[39:12.940 --> 39:18.460]  other news that they're shipping the guns in to blind the Second Amendment there
[39:18.460 --> 39:27.820]  you go and yes us says that it's up to Obama to fire holder fire him he's not
[39:27.820 --> 39:32.380]  going to fire him I told you holder came out was going to come out and said
[39:32.380 --> 39:38.460]  Bush was involved and it's a literally basically you needed a diaper break and
[39:38.460 --> 39:41.620]  and then that was the end of it
[39:42.220 --> 39:45.380]  holder walked in there and said I'm not gonna apologize I'm not gonna say
[39:45.380 --> 39:49.460]  anything we could have maybe handled things a little better but Bush was
[39:49.460 --> 39:55.700]  involved the Republicans all just went well we're gonna go ahead and stop the
[39:55.700 --> 40:05.700]  testimony now thank you I mean you reach this corruption level and then the
[40:05.700 --> 40:09.380]  other corrupt groups can get even more corrupt because they've always got dirt
[40:09.380 --> 40:14.140]  on the other group and then it's just everybody goes to town and what good
[40:14.140 --> 40:17.820]  old boys wouldn't do 50 years ago
[40:19.220 --> 40:24.380]  I mean they'd bid rig and military profiteer on bad parts and aircraft and
[40:24.380 --> 40:29.100]  you know run scams and give each other contracts that's all child's play in
[40:29.100 --> 40:32.660]  this world it's like well you're not gonna run why slaves you're not with the
[40:32.660 --> 40:38.060]  program but it doesn't matter we got all the dirt on you all your narcotics
[40:38.060 --> 40:42.460]  dirt all your other dirt and if you that's why the movie The Godfather is so
[40:42.460 --> 40:45.420]  good part one when you really get knowledge about the world then you
[40:45.420 --> 40:48.380]  learn that Mario Puzo was actually writing about real people and real
[40:48.380 --> 40:53.300]  things that happened just changing the names Frank Sinatra all of it where the
[40:53.300 --> 40:56.980]  old godfather you know who's got all the political power biggest mob dawn in the
[40:56.980 --> 41:01.980]  US he just runs whores gambling and had run liquor and they come to him and
[41:01.980 --> 41:04.940]  they say we're gonna sell heroin he says I'm not gonna do that that kills
[41:04.940 --> 41:11.220]  people and so they try to kill him and that's actually a true story just it
[41:11.220 --> 41:16.140]  was the last name wasn't Carleoni there is a mafia family in Carleon over there
[41:16.140 --> 41:21.580]  in the Mediterranean what they're in Sicily but the point is is that that's
[41:21.580 --> 41:26.860]  how this works you see that's the thing about corruption okay run hookers
[41:26.860 --> 41:30.980]  because everybody wants that anyways alcohol everybody wants that gambling
[41:30.980 --> 41:35.020]  you know it's a vice whatever run it make money off of it well next it's
[41:35.020 --> 41:40.460]  well let's bring some drugs in let's sell heroin to school kids and then after
[41:40.460 --> 41:44.140]  that it's let's go ahead and run hookers worldwide you know young girls we
[41:44.140 --> 41:47.020]  trick into working for us and then it's let's actually just kidnap the young
[41:47.020 --> 41:50.980]  14 year old girls and then it's let's just kill them when they get pregnant too
[41:50.980 --> 41:54.420]  many times are you know what let's just go ahead and run little kids get a lot of
[41:54.420 --> 41:57.900]  money for those hey you know what let's go ahead and snuff film little kids oh
[41:57.900 --> 42:01.060]  you're not gonna do that we're already involved in all of this so you're going
[42:01.060 --> 42:05.860]  along with it what comes next let's just go ahead and take the veterans debt
[42:05.860 --> 42:10.220]  benefits you know what we'll just confuse them with some procedure and we on
[42:10.220 --> 42:17.940]  the media it'll be all right you know the public are animals anyways let us lose
[42:17.940 --> 42:23.460]  our souls we're profane we're not enlightened like the globalist you know
[42:23.460 --> 42:32.940]  we're just a bunch of idiots we deserve it we're cattle and here we are and well
[42:32.940 --> 42:38.820]  here's old newsflash I'm not evil I'm smart to a certain extent got common
[42:38.820 --> 42:43.020]  sense street smart survival instinct most importantly I could have joined the
[42:43.020 --> 42:46.900]  dark side there are a lot of people that figure this stuff out who decide to join
[42:46.900 --> 42:52.860]  with the evil they decide to say well it's the winning team and they join with
[42:52.860 --> 43:01.300]  it I physically cannot join it I physically am repulsed by it I am
[43:01.300 --> 43:07.060]  physically repulsed by bullies and cheats and thugs and sickos and perverts
[43:07.060 --> 43:13.260]  and scammers and abusers and they are my eternal enemy now I'm gonna go to a clip
[43:13.260 --> 43:18.220]  here in a moment that ties into this whole ATF situation but here's the
[43:18.220 --> 43:23.900]  other angle confirmed ATF plotted to use fast and furious to demonize the
[43:23.900 --> 43:29.140]  Second Amendment and it goes on ATF created the problem so they could be
[43:29.140 --> 43:35.660]  the solution to it and CBS obtained the documents showing the ATF at the highest
[43:35.660 --> 43:43.220]  level setting up the Second Amendment to blame it on gun shops in America let's
[43:43.220 --> 43:48.260]  continue the Daily Bell has an excellent article all linked and bibliographed in a
[43:48.260 --> 43:58.980]  move for global governance where groups that they're not sure who but it's
[43:58.980 --> 44:03.540]  companies that is believed George Soros is behind go like we thought he was
[44:03.540 --> 44:07.660]  behind media matters and it turned out he was they would deny it and it turned
[44:07.660 --> 44:13.380]  out that he was that there's a multi-billion dollar hedge fund buying up
[44:13.380 --> 44:19.900]  for two three times what it's worth gun companies and then shutting them down and
[44:19.900 --> 44:23.900]  they go out and get all the liberals to sucker in and buy into it then to go buy
[44:23.900 --> 44:28.660]  up companies and shut them down and that also can get control of companies so
[44:28.660 --> 44:33.660]  they'll then agree and bespoke people for gun control there's no end to the
[44:33.660 --> 44:36.900]  victim disarmament nastiness that's going on I'm gonna cover this more on the
[44:36.900 --> 44:42.340]  nightly news tonight but I wanted to get to this right now chilling 911 tapes
[44:42.340 --> 44:47.340]  illustrate woman shooting home invasion suspect and I turned on local talk radio
[44:47.340 --> 44:51.260]  this morning they were playing these clips and it turned out it wasn't
[44:51.260 --> 44:54.420]  someone she knew but at the end she could see some bleeding to death there and
[44:54.420 --> 45:00.660]  says or shooting the guys on the ground she says oh gosh I hope somebody I don't
[45:00.660 --> 45:04.740]  know it wasn't somebody she didn't know they're busted in she's telling them go
[45:04.740 --> 45:09.140]  away they don't stop and the 911 operators like well well you know maybe

[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:44.940]  out of their league there are this is one cat that asked the question and it
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:52.900]  was a good question by the way of the meeting that the CFTC had the Commodity
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.420]  Future Trading Commission the group that's supposed to be overseeing this and
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:03.420]  what happened at that meeting and as he's asking the question he said and you
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:11.180]  know I didn't know that Gary Gensler Gary Gensler is the head of the CFTC was
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:19.740]  a also worked with John Don Corzine the Don Corzine the Don Corzine that was

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.700]  take the blame for the bailouts when he was just a mid-level frontman and and
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.820]  you're right that they'll have a bunch of Indians up there because they kind of
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.060]  look like Arabs I guess so you just blame them and there's no end to it the
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.900]  way they play the public it's just unbelievable oh look Koshkari he's a
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.700]  ball headed guy looks like Dr. Evil and he's got an Indian last name it's all

[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.140]  mr. Lucas let's just listen to the first first couple of remarks members of the
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:27.700]  committee like all of you I am devastated by the enormous impact on many
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.460]  people's lives resulting from the events surrounding the mfglobal
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:37.700]  bankruptcy of course my distress and sadness pale in comparison to the losses
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:43.420]  and hardships that customers farmers and ranchers and others employees and
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:49.340]  investors have suffered their plight weighs on my mind every day as a chief
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.620]  executive officer of mfglobal at the time of its bankruptcy I truly
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.540]  apologize to all those affected before I address what happened I must make it
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.780]  clear that since my departure from mfglobal on November 3rd this year I
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:09.140]  have not had access to many of the relevant documents which are essential
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.540]  to my being able to testify accurately unbelievable about the chaotic days
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:18.900]  proceeding the declaration oh the members should also understand that
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:24.860]  committee turned down my request to testify voluntarily in January I had
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.940]  hoped that by that time I would have had tamed and reviewed relevant records
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:35.100]  I could be more helpful to the committee while I intend to be responsive to the
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:40.740]  best of my ability today without adequate time and materials to prepare I may be
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:46.260]  able may be unable to respond to various questions members might pose other
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:50.060]  questions given my specific role in the company will be questions for which I
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:55.380]  simply have no personal knowledge make it very clear many of your questions may
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:02.580]  well be ones I myself have when I joined the company in late March 2010 mfglobal
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:07.380]  was primarily a voice-based broker that provides execution and clearing
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:12.060]  services traded in derivative markets I like to comment on what he's already
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.340]  said the firm had reported losses in five consecutive what he said before I
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:21.740]  arrived he's what he's doing is he's already pleading the fifth isn't it
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:27.460]  wonderful he was going to wait until January oh yes everything got further
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:33.720]  and further away from the news then he could slime in yeah cause line could
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.300]  slime in with in January after this thing blows over a little bit and oh
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.260]  how sorry he is yeah his heart is bleeding he's worked what a half a
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:51.100]  billion dollars yes how about coming up with the money to cover the losses that
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.260]  the rest of us took Gerald Salente is our guest we just came back live as we
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:03.540]  were going live at eight after they brought a core sign in and he has
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.900]  basically taken the fifth now right as Gerald we invited Gerald to you know
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.900]  speak over him and give us some live coverage and so core sign basically has
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:17.020]  come in and taken the fifth as the Washington Post reported that he would
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.740]  take the fifth and he told the Washington Post that his lawyers did they
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:24.340]  don't know where the money is so how convenient the money is taken out of the
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:30.340]  accounts in early November he leaves and now he doesn't know anything because he
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.540]  left the company and he's the one that made the 40 to one bet this is
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:39.740]  unbelievable Gerald Salente is our guest breaking this down I mean so this is our
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:43.100]  worst fears they're trying to set the precedent Gerald and of course for those
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:47.100]  that just joined us you lost over six figures from your own private account
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:55.260]  that the large Chicago Mafia exchange of the CMT the Chicago you know trading
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.100]  group had the Chicago Mercantile had come out and said oh we're always gonna
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:03.340]  cover everything it's all insured now you're being told it's not insured it's
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:09.100]  your money what type of precedent does this set where does this go from here we
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:13.020]  haven't talked to you in a week and a half what have you learned well I learned
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.660]  what I learned before and that's what I'm telling everybody your money isn't
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.860]  safe if all you jerks out there shooting a mouth off that don't know what you're
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:24.940]  talking about they've never had a seller like this in the history of the
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:31.860]  commodity exchange in 150 years and I wasn't speculating I made a deal to pick
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:37.060]  up delivery and all those jerks out there that say I should have known better
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:44.860]  yeah how about this one all those jerks in in New Jersey that voted in this Don
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:50.220]  Corsign as senator-in-governor you should have known better too and all you
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:55.380]  other jerks out there like the Obama administration that welcomes Corsign
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.580]  into the White House and has them throw $35,000 a plate dinners yeah they
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:04.780]  should have known better too yeah everybody but me should have known I
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.140]  should have known nobody else should have known that Corsign was given us the
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.900]  chef so let's go back and play this over so these committee hearings begin with
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:21.020]  a guy asking a question a congressman who said he didn't know until today that
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:26.140]  Gary Gensler the head of the Commodities Future Trading Commission was a
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:31.820]  lieutenant of Don Corsign when Corsign ran the Goldman Sachs gang back in the
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:37.180]  90s he didn't know that the guy asking questions then the question he asks was
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:43.140]  well you had a meeting back with the Gary Gensler and John Corsign several
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:48.300]  months ago do you have notes of that meeting and here's what the woman who
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.860]  they're questioning and you know why they're questioning this woman and not
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:59.660]  questioning Gary Gensler Gary's gone Gary had to go on an important trip oh
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:06.260]  well that's like asking a soldier from the Don what the Don was thinking so
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:11.340]  they don't even have Gensler there today here's what she said no substantive
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:18.020]  issues were discussed hey sweetie pie what are you talking about no substantive
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:23.060]  issues were discussed what was this meeting about what the Yankees were
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.660]  going to do in spring training I mean come on you don't get the two people
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:32.100]  together the head of the Chicago Futures to the head of the Commodities
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:38.620]  Future Trading Commission and one of the top guys of the biggest trading firms in
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:43.140]  the world together to talk about nothing let's put this in layman terms though
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:47.580]  Gerald why this is so big to explain this and then this was out a month ago
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:53.540]  the head of the CFTC who is there to regulate this is the former Lieutenant
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:15:02.940]  of Don John Corsign the the Obama money bag man who sets up MF global grabs a
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:07.140]  bunch of other companies buys them and steals private bank accounts which they
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:11.020]  admit is totally illegal and was supposedly insured now they say they
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.460]  don't know where the money is they're talking to his lieutenants and they're
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.860]  saying oh what was it this meeting oh I don't know nothing substantive he gets
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:22.740]  there and says I know nothing I left the company a month ago and all this
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:27.140]  imploded so I know nothing when he's the one who was heading it up and takes the
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:33.740]  fifth I mean this is so incredibly ridiculous and it goes further the head
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:39.820]  of the CFTC who's disappeared maybe he's in Paraguay the head of the CFTC maybe
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:44.340]  he's the boys of Brazil down there with the old Nazis I don't know it now turns
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:50.820]  out Reuters reports that he was invested in MF global so this is Gerald this is
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.900]  like you said 150 years of the mercantile this has never been done what's
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.540]  going on here what's happening and they got the trolls attacking you of course
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:04.300]  they're attacking us they're saying it's good the ATF now admits that they did
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.540]  ship guns into Mexico to blame the second amendment they're like the second
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.460]  amendments who's bad because the government ship guns into Mexico to blame
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:16.020]  it on it so that's always blame the messenger Gerald this is huge yes it is
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:20.060]  so you know what they were talking about at this meeting they were talking
[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:27.940]  about whether Don John the governor cause line could raid segregated accounts
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:32.780]  like mine that's what they were talking about and they don't they don't think
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:37.620]  they have any notes because well it was according to that woman you know just a
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:43.260]  little idle chitchat don't this whole thing is a scam the whole system is
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:49.580]  collapsing it's collapsing in front of us so what I'm telling people your money
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:54.900]  is not safe anywhere unless you got it in your pocket or under your mattress
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.580]  because they're going to rob it from us and here's what these clowns that in
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.580]  this commission that are asking these questions you know they're saying things
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:09.860]  like well you know we've learned a valuable lesson from this so how could
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:15.380]  we put better locks on the bond door so the horse doesn't escape and they're
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:20.740]  not even talking about hanging the horse feet oh no that's off let me know
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.780]  no here's Corzine who ran out with the money in front of everybody saying I
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:31.140]  know nothing and they don't even grill him it is unbelievable it's not
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:36.540]  unbelievable it's what's happened fascism has come to America it's the
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:42.100]  merger of state and corporate powers and you have no greater power than the
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:50.220]  money power during this time of Christmas let us all remember that the only time
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:57.540]  Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace became angry and violent is when he picked up a
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:04.020]  whip and drove the money changers out of the temple and that's a fact and that's
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:09.500]  what's going on now the money changers are in control of the temple of
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:16.020]  Washington DC they're controlling everybody's lives and they're driving
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:23.660]  this country into ruin and everybody is afraid to look at who's behind this the
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:28.740]  Rothschilds as I've said before would have been jealous to see what the

[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:16.900]  societies follow this path it only gets crazier till everything collapses think
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.020]  about history think about all the other governments and the corruption and the
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.980]  out-of-control behavior till Chesky would just turn the power off of the whole
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.700]  country to train everybody to accept being charged more and he basically owned
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.380]  and control the power company and then only the lights would be on in his
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:35.300]  palace this is a way to control people they're now doing that here with the same
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:40.300]  mafia shutting down all the power plants that General Electric doesn't own so that
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.860]  they then make double triple quadruple the profits just like Enron did in
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:48.900]  California using the the environmentalist these are criminals
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:53.180]  Gerald Salente's whether still 40 after then the one the only Lindsey Williams
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.300]  joins us with some incredible breaking news Gerald you're right the collapse is
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:02.400]  on I wanted to bring this point to your attention you know they pass the NDA use
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.060]  the military on the streets and definite attention of citizens North Korea style
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.140]  legislation now I got secretive documents that have been confirmed that
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:16.020]  Halliburton subsidiary KBR is preparing to activate the emergency camps for
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:20.060]  financial collapse around the U.S. so for the first time ever they're now
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:26.380]  putting the contracts out to begin manning the FEMA camps Gerald Salente
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:32.820]  what's your view on that Gerald we dropped off a little bit I heard part of
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:37.780]  it about them activating the emergency camps I totally believe that's the
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:42.100]  reason why they passed that legislation which is going to be one of our top
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:47.780]  trends of 2020 2012 economic martial law I've been talking about this before
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:52.740]  it's happened and what they're going to do is the European systems collapsing
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:57.140]  it's collapsing there's no way of saving it the entire financial economic
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:02.100]  system is under collapse in China look pick up yesterday's paper check out
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:07.380]  what's going on in Brazil they were growing Alex at about 7.5% they're
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.540]  down to zero it's going to happen around the world you look what's going on in
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:18.780]  China housing three months slump and it's declining like wildfire empty
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:25.820]  buildings all over the bubble is bursted there's no way of salvaging this what
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:31.460]  I've said is that after the holidays after they get the people to spend the
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:37.060]  money that they don't have on Christmas junk they're going to pull the plug in
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:43.980]  the first quarter of 2012 when that happens they are going to institute
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:50.380]  some form of martial law economic martial law and what that means is that
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.860]  you're going to see bank holidays possibly dollar devaluations some kind
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:02.260]  of draconian measures as that takes place remember now all of these movements
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:07.620]  are heating up already the Occupy movements people are getting angry they
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:13.700]  are go and look what the goon squads do you can see the perfect picture of the
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:21.940]  future by looking at that guy pike you know the fat boy over there spraying
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.340]  little kids with pepper spray as he's shaking it up with enough body armor on
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:33.860]  there you know to protect them from you know the Hulk and by the way he lost his
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.940]  house to the banker scams but he doesn't even care obviously but it's worse
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:43.020]  than that in Oakland and in LA they're taking them to the local in the case of
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:49.220]  LA the Dodgers Stadium they're actually doing the martial law drills and it's
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:53.300]  worse than that the Russians are saying get ready for war the Pakistanis have
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:57.380]  thrown the US down there's nuclear warships cruising around threatening
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.500]  all bedlam is breaking loose that the the Iranians are threatening to block
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:06.100]  the Strait of Hormuz just like you said in your trends for 2011 a year ago the
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:12.260]  next great war they always start a war they always start a war after the
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:18.500]  financial collapse and after they milk the system and grab every dollar out of
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.060]  it and squeeze it out of the people when there's nothing left to squeeze they
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:28.580]  take it a war they get you killed and the Iranian one that's the flashpoint look
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:36.660]  at what's going on ended up Syria it's collapsing they have a huge amount of
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.660]  problems over there the United States is supporting the the anti-government
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:47.860]  movement as is other European countries and now Turkey's moving into that who
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:55.420]  is Syria's greatest ally Iran look at the sanctions they're pushing on in Iran
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:00.300]  this is a replay of World War two with Japan remember when they cut off Japan
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:05.580]  from getting oil supplies the same thing is happening now in another scenario
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:13.860]  Iran is the third anybody that has these many fingers could count that high they're
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:21.900]  the third largest world oil supplier behind Russia and Saudi Arabia now it's
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.420]  making it impossible for Iran to sell their oil stay there let's get your
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.980]  forecast right ahead by the way it's in Reuters it's admitted Western back
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:34.660]  rebels have blown up the main gas and oil pipeline into Damascus Syria so there
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.660]  I mean the war is on they admit the West and Israel is bombing Iran blowing up
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:45.060]  bases right now I mean it is on this war has already started and it's run by

[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.360]  all right it's our final segment with Gerald Salente who I really appreciate
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.000]  his busy schedule giving us an update on MF club will now that core sign has gone
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.480]  up and taken the fifth because he knows nothing about what happened in the
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.320]  collapse he was just the head of the company who had all the key federal
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.960]  regulators were his former employees and who were invested with him so Gerald
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.480]  Salente you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars missing now they're
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.120]  talking about three billion missing and they're just saying Congress is like gee
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:59.000]  how do we not have this happen again there's no discussion of how dare you
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.360]  steal this money how dare you destabilize everything so here's my
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.280]  question and you're getting in all the global destabilization I ran I want you
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.200]  to finish with that Gerald then we've got the one the only Lindsey Williams
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.920]  coming up with information that dovetails with all this from his inside
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.200]  well-company sources that are proven to be very accurate my question for you is
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.920]  what's the end game what's the method of the madness why do they think they can
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.280]  get away with this I mean this points towards they are just gonna start a
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.600]  giant war and as you said they don't care because they run all the regulators
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.700]  and they know the war is gonna be so bad that people will just rally around the
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:41.880]  crooks instinctively as they always do I mean this really signifies how
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.720]  incredibly reckless these guys are Gerald Salente well all you have to do and
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:54.320]  I'm sure you've seen it is that that clip of Lindsey Graham the cracker down
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:01.200]  there from South Carolina and called comb over Levin from Michigan I believe
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:10.200]  and John McCain debating was it Senate Bill 1867 that robs us as all of our
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.720]  rights all you have to do is watch a video clip of these clowns blabbing their
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:22.160]  mouth off they could only get away with that in their Senate chamber and a lot
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.520]  of guards around them because if they came around me or any of my the people
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:32.040]  that I associate with we would lay these guys out verbally to stop their
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:38.720]  baloney but what they're doing Alex again in this Iran look what happened as
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:44.800]  you mentioned Iran lost a missile testing site a uranium testing site and
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:51.120]  they shot down an American drone over Iranian territory could you imagine if
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:36:00.480]  an Iranian drone was over American territory oh wow oh Bomba would be
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:07.280]  sending those missiles over there the place would be blowing up oh but it's
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.160]  okay for us to do it because I'll tell you why to answer your question you have
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.960]  psychopaths in power it's as simple as that these people are out of their
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:27.760]  minds you know how you say you can tell the attitude of a person by who they
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:34.040]  are if you go down to the ghetto and you see some loser out there that shot up in
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:40.120]  out of his mind walking around like this with the pants down today and the hat
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.760]  back there you know where the cats coming from if you watch Lindsey the
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.680]  cracker Graham over there in South Carolina talking as he's weaving back
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:57.680]  and forth like this with his hands in his pocket or comb over Levin telling us
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:02.800]  the jive or McCain that stiff is a board and you're one that he has a brain
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.800]  left in his head you can see who's taking us down the crapper you get it you
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:16.120]  have crazy people running the country they're psychopaths well you're right
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.760]  and so that's where they're taking us war destruction death and they love the
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.800]  big crises they've got the FEMA camps ready they're publicly saying I mean
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.280]  Graham said you bet we'll arrest citizens in America you bet we'll kill
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:34.000]  whoever we want we're a lad I mean he is crazy I mean some little weird oily guy
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.680]  who's reportedly blackmailed because of his homosexuality just weaving around
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.760]  sweating going we bet we'll kill Americans and then I mean you're right
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:49.120]  and then Levin creeping around like Igor or something and then McCain looks
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.720]  completely insane these people are telling us what to do it's beyond the
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.600]  belief they're telling us what to do they're telling us that dig you know
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:04.920]  that the Graham cracker over there he said America's a battlefield he's
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.880]  saying this is a battlefield look I know commuting to work back and forth
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:15.680]  every day isn't a lot of fun but this is no battlefield there's been no attacks
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.880]  he's talking about Al Qaeda what Al Qaeda you even hear portray us knows now
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.880]  the head of the CIA saying that in Afghanistan there's lucky to be a hundred
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.160]  Al Qaeda left what are they talking about they're there for the opium but in
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:36.600]  closing in closing Gerald clearly they're capable of staging events clearly
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.160]  now the Justice Department documents CBS got them confirming that they did plan
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.800]  to ship the guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment in the words of the
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.560]  CBS ATF created the problem so they could be the solution to it and the memos
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.840]  shed that they could use this to ban semi-automatics I mean I mean right
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.680]  there right there these guns have killed conservatively hundreds of people
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.520]  including three police officers here in the US and Border Patrol I mean this is
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:08.320]  an example of the mindset of these people Gerald yes it is and everyone if
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:14.680]  you wake up one day you never hear again from Alex Jones or Gerald Salenti it's
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:21.520]  because now it's law the senators past it codified the military could come in
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:28.520]  crash into your studio and our officers grab us take us away send us to do
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:34.720]  whatever they want with us we have no trial we have no jury we have no rights
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:40.880]  and everyone out there better find the moral courage within them to stand up
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.480]  speak out and take action because you're only gonna become a slave the
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:52.600]  slavery laws are in place you will become a slave for Walmart target
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:59.440]  federated stores con agra go down the list you're there in control and they're
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:05.880]  gonna take away everything the economic martial law will be imposed there's
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.640]  going to be a bank holiday a very high probability of it in the new year the
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:17.000]  system is collapsing and now they're putting the goon squads in place to
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.120]  lock you up and throw you away wait Gerald in closing even Greece now admits
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.480]  there's bank runs going on up there more people are getting their money out
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:35.040]  here I mean this is really really creepy what's going on yes it is and that's
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:40.520]  one of the reasons why I'm warning everyone your money is not safe with
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:46.400]  anybody but yourself that's why they came up with all of these stories over
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.880]  the years how people took their money out of the bank and put it in their
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.800]  mattress and then when you look at all these derivatives that you talk about
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.520]  that now take precedent by the way that these banks have tens of trillions of
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:06.920]  rather than depositors insurance the derivatives play no no no wait a minute
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:12.160]  in in Portugal it's mainstream news they took private pension funds but it's
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.960]  only a one-time hit Gerald and gave them to the mega banks to pay off derivatives
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.000]  two days ago they actually the government took control to protect them and
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.080]  took 30% off the top to give the bankers private ones not even some cops
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.720]  pension which I hear on the media selling well they have that they got two
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.920]  big opinions that's not their money either the cops paid into it the firemen
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.560]  paid into it I mean they're really maneuvering everyone to steal everything
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.840]  and in closing as we're going to our next case and I know you've got to go we
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.120]  appreciate your time friends research comm will get another update from you
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.000]  next week if you can be gracious enough to do it Gerald in closing I get these
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.400]  emails saying we had a man on the street last week about it hey the
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.400]  government's passing laws to secretly arrest you disappear into a black hole
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.720]  like Hitler or North Korea and they would say well I have nothing to hide I'm a
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.480]  good person they don't seem to get that it's not about you being a good person
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.600]  it's about criminals running government that want to rob you can you explain in
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:16.560]  60 seconds to people that think oh I'm nice so they're gonna be core signs gonna
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.720]  be nice to me yes the Stockholm syndrome it's when they beat you and beat you when

[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.800]  gracious and kind and loving and caring we're nice people but we speak out for
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.080]  our rights and our self-respect all you people out there that think because you
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.800]  keep your mouth shut and you don't say anything to do anything or have a spine
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  a backbone to stand up for yourself it's the Warsaw Warsaw ghetto syndrome
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:56.440]  don't speak out be nice the Germans have taken over the country the Gestapo is
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:03.880]  here don't resist them God will provide said the rabbis who were telling the
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:12.440]  people not to resist bye bye get on that cattle car everything will be okay and
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.920]  that's what people have to face it's the Warsaw ghetto syndrome that's happening
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:23.360]  in America the people are afraid to speak out they think that by turning the
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.320]  other way or maybe oming for a couple of hours a day are going to keep the
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.480]  fascist from taking over your life it's not gonna happen and I'm here to say it
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.000]  I am not going off on any cattle car or army truck somewhere and and the good
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  news is gun cells are at record pace if even a few percentage of people this
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.760]  keeps going defend themselves as Alexander Schultz and Ethan said the secret
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.360]  police system will grind to a halt I'm telling you this is not Nazi Germany or
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.440]  Soviet Russia Gerald and you talked to a lot of folks who've been getting ready
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.760]  people I don't think these these corezine type crooks realize I think

[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.280]  the grace of God 30 years ago worked for a long time the trans Alaska pipeline
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:03.320]  met a lot of big top CEOs became their inner boardroom chaplain as a liaison to
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:10.680]  the workers that's a popular thing that's done and he joins us because Ken
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.480]  from data cancer last year now it's been almost a year and of course I know who
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:21.200]  he knew about it behind the scenes Dr. Stan Montee for talk to him and confirm
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.160]  what he told Lindsay off record the other gentleman is even more high-powered
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:30.320]  former CEO of a big three oil company and gives him similar intel and remember
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.360]  Lindsay over a year ago said you watch the Middle East can be engulfed in flame
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.000]  and fake revolution but then watch China now China president two days ago said
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.080]  we're preparing for war with the US they've never talked like that since the
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:47.480]  60s Nixon went in the 70s that stopped the Russians are threatening stuff
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.360]  openly attacking the US government folks it's on Lindsay Williams has
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.440]  incredible intel on Iran and what's really happening there only about three
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.040]  or four minutes for the break give us a preface of what's coming up and the in
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.160]  the new Intel you've learned from your source because it fits in perfectly with
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.920]  the full spectrum analysis we've got Lindsay Williams thanks for coming on
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:11.640]  a lot of times that I've ever had the privilege Alex so being on your show I
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.640]  have never felt such an urgency and an honor as today because what the elite
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.600]  have told me within the past five months since I had the privilege of being on
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.320]  your show last is going to be so startling that you're going to say
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:31.240]  Lindsay Williams is crazy you don't change that dial today I know a number of
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:36.000]  years ago when mr. prom called me on the phone and said chaplain would you like
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.680]  the world to think you're a prophet and he told me that price of crude oil was
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.720]  going from 147 dollars a barrel to $50 a barrel and you thought I was crazy I
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.240]  got laughed out on radio shows well if you think that was prophetic or crazy
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.240]  you've heard nothing compared to what you're going to hear today because I
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:58.040]  want to give you exactly what they have told me and it's not necessarily that
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.960]  there has not been a crash yet it's why they have not let the crash take place
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:08.160]  yet it's not necessarily that we have not had a war with Iran yet even though
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.320]  the drums have been beating for a long time but it's why they have told me that
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.960]  they haven't had war with Iran yet and when they do expect to have it which I've
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.840]  been given within the past week's time all of this I plan to give today on your
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.600]  show Alex and I do not give it to glorify Lindsay Williams I give all of the
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.200]  credit to God he allowed me by his profit it's years ago to rub shoulders
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.400]  with these people keep in touch with them over the past 35 years and now they
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:46.480]  are in their 70s and 80s and folks please old men talk when they know they're
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.240]  facing eternity they know that I was probably the only chaplain of my kind
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:56.760]  at the avenue they're telling me things today because of their conscience and as
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.440]  a result I'm going to pass it on to you so I can save your dinner table so that
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.320]  you can say that you heard it on the Alex show and show and on Genesis Network
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:10.720]  and Alex it's a privilege to be with you today to tell you every single agenda
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:16.120]  I feel leaders through the year 2012 because 2012 is without a doubt
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.880]  according to what I'm hearing from these people going to be 2012 will be the
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:29.040]  most sparkling the most unusual the most eventful year in 2,000 years and I say
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:36.440]  that on a good way is as positive as I can and you will hear all of their

[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.520]  we're cutting the feed go to the internet and then we went to the internet

[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:15.480]  gonna get a blurb out on that just absolutely incredible that all of this
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.800]  is unfolding right now going back to Lindsay Williams Lindsay give us a
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.880]  synopsis of what your source told you this former oil company executive the
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:27.440]  same one that told you last year all this stuff would happen when the air up
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.480]  spring it did happen first place we ever heard it what's going on with Iran
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:36.840]  specifically let's start getting into it please everyone out there listening
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:40.840]  audience will you get a pencil and piece of paper and write these things down I
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.320]  want you to put them beside your calendar and as you see them take place
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:50.800]  one after the other between now and the end of 2012 I want you to remember back
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:55.840]  on this program the eighth day of December here on the Alex Jones show and I
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.960]  want you to check them off each time you see one happen you will not find this
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:06.160]  information in any newsletter anywhere in the country you'll not find it on a
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:11.560]  single website some of the things I'm going to say today will completely be
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.520]  the opposite and in 180 degree difference what then what you're seeing on
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:23.200]  99% of all the newsletters I am sticking my neck out today further than I have
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.520]  ever stuck it out in my life these people have never been wrong in the 35
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.240]  years that they've given me information before Mr. Fromm died he had never told
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:39.120]  me anything that it did not happen exactly like he said it and now the one
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:44.880]  source that I have left who is still alive retired I will say in seven years
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.920]  or eight years old men talk and the things that they have told me will save
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:57.560]  you a dinner table they are so startling and I'll begin exactly where Alex has
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.280]  requested that I began even though I had decided before we again began to show
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:07.920]  today I had decided to give you all five of the elites okay we'll start I mean
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:12.760]  sure start wherever you want Lindsey just just go well okay let's start first of
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:18.000]  all that I ran because this is the most startling first of all let me say that
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.320]  about five months ago my elitist friend gave me some things it startled me so
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:28.240]  much it scared the daylights out of me and Alex you wondered why I had not been
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:33.040]  anywhere nobody had heard me anywhere for over two months because I did not do a
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.000]  single radio show abroad or in America anywhere for too much time I was so
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.360]  scared I finally decided I have a moral obligation to give it out and I did and
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:49.640]  there are five agendas of the elite then within the past one week now folks
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.840]  please those five agendas were given to me five or six months ago they told me
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.080]  everything they were going to do in 2012 within the past one week I received a
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:06.840]  communicate an email from my elitist friend the one that is still left and he
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:15.520]  told me about Iran and I'm gonna have to admit to you I shared I was scared
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.200]  more so than I was when they gave me the five agendas back earlier I'm gonna give
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:23.640]  it to you right now hold on Lindsay we got to go to break it okay and I want

[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:26.520]  Alex Jones okay this is a short five-minute segment I'm gonna really
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:29.720]  attempt to give Lindsey the floor here when we come back from break but some
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:36.080]  stations don't carry this Lindsey let's let's get into all of it after the
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:41.720]  break but continuing with what you were alluding to this is a short five-minute
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:45.960]  segment you were bringing up the fact that this flies 180 degrees from what
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.480]  most people are saying or being told can you elaborate on that and you said
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:55.520]  that your other source Mr. X who of course is known to myself and Dr. Montee
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:01.720]  if I can confirm it that you're basically implying he's now spilling his guts
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.360]  their conscience so you're wondering why they were giving you this info over the
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:12.400]  years now do they seem concerned first of all let me apologize to all of the
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.440]  newsletters whom this may completely disagree with and the only reason it'll
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.640]  disagree with them is because it came directly from behind closed doors from
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:27.440]  the Mr. X who still gives me information so I'm not doing this in order to cause
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:32.960]  you problems nor the internet sites that may necessarily disagree with this but
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:38.800]  you keep in mind that it was 35 years ago when I lived literally lived with the
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.920]  elite of the world for three years time and these men now in their 70s and 80s
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.360]  and before Mr. Fromm died he basically said to me he said chaplain I'm too old
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:51.880]  to care just go ahead and tell the world everything well my present the
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:56.600]  elitist friend is doing the identical same thing he tells me things that he
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.760]  would not have said five years ago he positively would never have divulged this
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:07.920]  ten years ago he's saying it now because well listen Alex I'm 75 years of age I
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:12.960]  ministered the gospel for 55 years when you get to be my age when you get to be
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.280]  their age you'd say things that you would never say before because you know
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.360]  good and well that you're about to face eternity you're going to face your
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.840]  maker and it becomes very real that you don't want to stand there with any
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.200]  problems when you get ready to cross that river and as a result these people
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.560]  are saying some things about what is going to take place in the next year
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:38.760]  they're talking more about the devil's Messiah program and this is what is
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:43.440]  literally amazing to me how that they're talking about what they're going to do
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:47.760]  more and more about this and they also divulging what's going to happen in
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:54.160]  Iran and why the financial crash has not taken place yet there is a reason why
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.360]  it should have taken place during the last year of the administration of
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:03.960]  George W. Bush but it did not why haven't they allowed the Euro to already crash
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.640]  there is a reason why they haven't done it and it's not necessarily the fact
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:15.440]  that they haven't allowed the crash or the financial burst to take place that's
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.880]  not the issue the important issue is why they're not letting it take place yet
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:23.520]  and this is what the news letter writers haven't picked up on because unless you
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:27.560]  know the elite and they're willing to divulge some things to you you'd never
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.640]  know the reason why the price is not going to take place this month it's not
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:36.120]  going to take place next month it's not going to take place until well up into
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.560]  2012 and it's not necessarily that they're going to hold it off until then
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.760]  it's a reason why they're holding it off until then the same thing with Iran
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:50.000]  why is it okay Iran is saying that everybody is angry
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.080]  America's warships are sitting there right off of
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.760]  well Lindsay I hate to interrupt because I'm actually going to shut up today and
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:01.600]  try to give you the floor the full most stations XM and others do care
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.040]  this this little five-minute segment years ago I decided to do it in case
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.840]  some stations wanted to carry more radio show instead of news so-called news but
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:14.000]  our full audience WWCR is picking it up internet's picking it up TV's picking it
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.840]  up but some AM and FM's don't so I want to come back and just have you get right
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:22.760]  into the five points right into Iran in whatever order you want to get to it
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:26.720]  because I know this is real I know this is a big three former well company
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.240]  executive that does have these tie-ins so we're gonna go to break come back and
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:34.680]  you get into it how you want to and then let's just run through for the next
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:39.120]  hour but I'd like to get the five points out and then the Iran situation and then
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.840]  get into them in more detail with you straight ahead and then also haven't
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.840]  even asked you if you've had a chance yet to make an audio or video CD break
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:48.800]  them this down but I imagine you probably have and so we'll also tell
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:52.800]  people about that as well after you go over the points Lindsay Williams is our

[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:05.840]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:11.880]  because there's a war on for your mind all right Pastor Lindsey Williams is our
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:19.520]  guest and I knew who Ken Fromm was I knew that other talk shows great Patriot
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:26.240]  author had interviewed this gentleman off record and confirmed what he was
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:33.600]  telling Mr. Williams and of course that individuals Dr. Stan Monteef talking to
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:42.000]  Ken Fromm I know the name of the other former big three oil company CEO and I
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.720]  know that Monteef separately confirmed it I could call the person up and
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:55.120]  confirm it but I don't need to I know Monteef has done it and again this is
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.440]  important information we're getting from Lindsey Williams right now try to make
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.120]  sense of what's happening out there so you were given five things that took you
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.720]  months to decide what to do with lately you were given the Iran situation give us
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.520]  a boil down and then go through it Lindsey Williams you've got the floor go
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:17.880]  ahead 2012 will be the most eventful year in 2000 years don't take that for
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.400]  granted that you're going to see it happen Alex you probably won't have me
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.600]  on your show at least once a month during the year 2012 just to interpret what
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:31.760]  these elite have already told me that they had planned to do I'm going to
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.560]  begin with the most controversial first I had planned on using those five items of
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:40.960]  agenda but I'm going to do the opposite I want to begin where you suggest that I
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.480]  begin with Iran this is more on anyone else's mind right now than any other
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:51.240]  one thing so quickly three years ago Dr. Stan Monteef called me on the phone one
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:56.000]  day our army our Navy our Air Force everybody was sitting over there in
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.880]  the Persian Gulf all ready for an invasion of Iran I was even saying it
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:06.320]  looks like we're going to have an invasion a war with Iran Dr. Stan Monteef
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.480]  called me and said chaplain would you please call your elitist friend and
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.080]  ask him if there's going to be a war with Iran folks I'm saying this to prove to
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:18.200]  you that they start war they end war nothing ever happens except that they
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:22.040]  have already planned it behind closed doors and you'll see this because you
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:26.120]  watched it on phone before your eyes I called Mr. Fromm who was alive at that
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.800]  time and I said Ken is there going to be a war with Iran I'll never forget his
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.640]  response he actually chuckled over the telephone and he said chaplain no there
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:41.200]  is not going to be any war with Iran for at least two and one half years from
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.880]  now and he he said that is nothing but safer rattling over there and you said
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.480]  that at the time you said that at the time it's in your archives Alex I came
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:55.880]  on your show and I said it and folk you have lived it for three years there has
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:03.320]  not been war with Iran exactly as Dr. as Mr. Ken Fromm said it now there is going
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.280]  to be war with Iran are you ready here it is I was given it less than seven days
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:13.360]  ago I did not ask for this this time I did not call my elitist friend who's
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:19.240]  still alive and say what about Iran I did not do this instead he sent me of
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:24.280]  his own will and email and you won't find it because it's not out there in a
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.240]  place that you can pick it up but he sent it to me and he told me exactly
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.400]  what's going to happen now they are going to have war with Iran please put
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.480]  this down it is going to happen it's going to be horrifying I'll tell you
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:41.480]  what his opinion is as we go along through it it is not going to happen
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:46.960]  this month nor next month nor probably the next month it is going to happen and
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:52.360]  they have an approximate time date for it the reason why they are going to let
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.400]  it happen well first of all let me tell you what they want now keep in mind the
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:02.000]  elite are not God they just think they are and they don't always get their way
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.560]  but if they get their way here's what's going to happen Israel will not fire the
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:13.320]  first shot no I know again use a lot of writers please forgive me all I can do is
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:17.200]  just tell you what the elite tell me Israel will not file the first shot if
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:20.840]  the elite have their way America will not file the first shot if the elite have
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:26.760]  their way instead Iran is going to be intimidated they're going to be harassed
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:31.920]  they are going to have every kind of thing imaginable imposed on them and
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:37.120]  they won't Iran to make the first fire they want it to be the shot heard
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:42.040]  around the world and to come from Iran itself and they want it to take place
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:47.200]  for a very definite reason and Alex you put it on your website I picked it up
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:51.760]  also but I got it off with your website folks please listen Alex Jones every day
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.440]  he's telling you things you're not getting any place else the Genesis
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:59.400]  Network they're giving out information you won't get any other place you've got
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.480]  to listen to it so Alex I got on your website and I picked this up you had it
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:09.400]  there I'm going to repeat it because this goes along with what my elitist friend
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:15.120]  told me and here it is a subscriber only report the debacle file a Israeli
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.400]  intelligence outfit which is proven to be accurate in the past revealed what
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:26.280]  recently at the end of the NATO operations in Libya the president Barack
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:33.640]  Obama stated to America's senior allies Britain France Germany Italy Saudi
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:41.200]  Arabia and he stated what with their notice of his plan to attack Iran no
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:47.880]  later please put these days down put them beside your calendar okay with like
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:54.600]  attack Iran no later than September of October of 2012 unless Tehran
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:59.440]  all his nuclear weaponization program but you know they aren't going to halt it
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:03.760]  he knows they're not going to halt it he's doing this intentionally for a reason
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.800]  now my elitist friend did not point me to the debacle files you had it on your
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:13.760]  website Alex I am saying what my elitist and told me was there's not going to be
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.600]  a war with Iran this month next month I know America's warships are over there
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:23.280]  besides Syria Russia has already moved in their armada of warships over there by
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:31.000]  Syria you surely must know that there are 30 yacht hunt missiles that Russia has
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  moved into Syria you are aware of this I hope that you understand what this
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.120]  missile is you've got to go on the website and look at what it does it
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.160]  travels three times the speed of sound there is no way that America's warships
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.160]  that are in their Syria are going to be able to stop it before they get wiped
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.360]  out and that 30 of them already they've been moved in there when the Russians
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:56.840]  went in with our shipships recently every boot of this is in preparation for
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.400]  what they know is going to be inevitable it will not take this place this month
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:08.080]  nor next next month the elite wanted to take place later on up into 2012 it is
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:13.920]  all a part of their program and I'll give you now the personal opinion of my
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.880]  elitist friend he went on to say what they want they do not want America to
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.760]  have first strike they don't want Israel to have first strike they want Iran to
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:26.320]  have it because they're going to be so intimidated but then he said Lindsay I
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:31.560]  believe this will be and that these is his words he didn't hear this behind
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:37.280]  closed doors he he believes this personally himself he said Lindsay I
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.960]  believe this is going to be the beginning of a war war three that that was
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:45.080]  his personal opinion off the cuff from what he heard behind close the Rand
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:48.480]  corporation said two years ago they want something bigger than a regional war to
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:54.960]  distract the global implosion and the banking takeover they need that and it
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:58.920]  actually then leaked out after Debkin others reported it that you know there
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.320]  may be a strike but the Pentagon thinks it's a year till they get a nuke or
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:06.440]  whatever but then yet and yahoo wants it earlier because of political elections
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:10.880]  and things but certainly they've got special forces and others blowing stuff
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:17.960]  up killing people all over Iran that's now confirmed they've got spy planes I've
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:21.120]  been told not just surveilling but dropping bombs bombs are being dropped
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:24.760]  there's satellite photos of giant craters at these sites the missile site
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:29.480]  and others so they are trying to actually they tried to kill Ahmed
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:32.560]  energy he was scheduled to be there last week when that happened a week and a
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:36.920]  half ago at that missile base that's been confirmed now he'll drive over to
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.320]  bridge and the bridge blows up behind him or right in front of him they're
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:44.160]  moving his schedule around to stop it but the point is they're trying to get
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:49.440]  him to attack and the moolahs to attack because yes they want to be able to say
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:53.600]  that but they could that's your elitist source anything about them staging
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:57.440]  something to blame it on Iran and say Iran did something first because Iran
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:00.040]  certainly getting mad they're now saying okay well block the straight or
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.440]  mousse what was indicated to me is that they're going to intimidate they're
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.080]  going to harass they'll do anything in their power in order to get Iran so
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.660]  angry that they will shoot the first shot now keep in mind that 40% of the
[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:15.920]  world's oil supply on any day travels through the straight of our moves and
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:20.880]  the moment that there is a conflict with Iran between Iran and anybody else
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:26.080]  whether it be Syria or America or Israel or whatever it may be the straight of
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.560]  our moves is cut off now let me go back a moment and clarify something I have not
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:33.720]  been on your show for five months Alex so there's a number of things I haven't
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:38.360]  had an opportunity to say the last time I appeared on your show on June the 22nd
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:45.080]  2011 I made the statement that crude oil prices were going to $150 to $200 a
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.560]  barrel it has not happened yet I went back to my elitist friend a lot of part
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.440]  of June since I have last been on your show I think it's maybe the first of
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.160]  July and I called him my name and I said you're not helping my credibility very
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:04.000]  much you told me that the price of crude oil was going from $150 to $200 a
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.640]  barrel and he said a chaplain that's exactly right I said well it hasn't
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:12.960]  what's the matter he said no and I'm sorry to have to tell you it's not going
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.800]  to during the summer and up into the barrel I said well you know what that's
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:20.960]  doing to my credibility he said I'm sorry that's just the way it is well he
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.640]  was right and so was from before I have to be careful not to say his name that's
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:30.800]  in my mind he I mean they said when it was $60 to go to $150 everybody laughed
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:34.600]  it did do that the exact time frame then you said now it's going to 40 it went
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.960]  below 40 everybody laughed at you till it happened so that's why I'm saying
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.680]  about 95% of what they've told you has been accurate but they do change plans
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.600]  I mean if we expose this Iran plan enough Iran may just keep taking it and it may
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:51.960]  not happen well and the thing is the reason why they didn't do this and so I
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.280]  asked him I said well why didn't you take the price of crude oil before the
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:58.280]  summer is over that was a beginning of the summer I said why aren't you going
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:01.080]  to take the price to hundred fifty dollars a barrel like you told me it was
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:05.680]  going to Alex here is something that will start again it could only come from
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:09.960]  the elite it'll even start with you I think I found out that the reason they
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:13.760]  didn't let it keep calling up is because too many Americans were waking up I
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.480]  know this sounds strange but you remember when I live with the elite I came to the
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:21.800]  conclusion that there's only one thing on the face of this earth that they fear
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:26.160]  they fear the masses waking up there's only a few of them as a whole bunch of
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.240]  us and they do stay there this is fascinating you know why because I
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.920]  trust but verify I have from Jim Tucker Estlund and one other source that do
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:38.840]  have Bilderberg sources Tucker's got the hard-core ones actual Bilderberg not
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:43.320]  just an assistant they that's one of the main things they talked about back
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:47.080]  whenever they ran it up to 160 then they said we're gonna run it back down to 40
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.680]  or so that she said 60 in the meeting because it's it's making people too
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.920]  angry and they're waking up they discuss Ron Paul in these meetings they
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:58.320]  discuss the patriot movement so I you know they are watching it see they're
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.240]  worried about the American people because we've got guns folks what

[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:21.840]  signpost coming in we're trying to confirm it right now I hope it's not
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:25.760]  true I hoped it wasn't true the ATF ship the guns in a Mexico to blend the
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.400]  Second Amendment they're now internal memorandums have been made public they
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.800]  did it was all set up I wish Corzine wouldn't have stolen the 3 billion but
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:37.560]  now he just says it know where it is that's the end of it I wish that they
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  hadn't passed the NDAA saying they can arrest citizens for no reason and put
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:45.040]  you in a black hole and use the Army I wish that the Stars and Stripes magazine
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:48.960]  didn't say that three years ago but they are getting ready for it Oathkeepers has
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:53.160]  the report it's coming up on info wars.com right now Oathkeepers receives tip
[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:56.720]  of National Guard units stand down refusing to answer questionnaire we
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:59.960]  know these have been asked in the past asking if they would use lethal force
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:04.440]  against the American people they reportedly dropped their arms before
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:07.440]  taking part in the exercise which I've kept I've been in drills where they
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:12.920]  practice taking on the American people regular Army and Marines and ROTC I've
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:16.400]  never seen guard well I saw guard and gun confiscation drill in Iowa that's
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:21.200]  right but they reportedly dropped their firearms and walked off so we're not
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:24.160]  even we're not taking the questionnaire and we're not taking part in this
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:29.840]  exercise and Stuart Rhodes is totally confirming it right now but it looks
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:35.160]  like it's coming from a good source one of so we're gonna just it's this
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:38.520]  government is so criminal Lindsay it's a short segment going right back to you
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:43.400]  okay when we went up to the break you were bringing up the point of the fact
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:49.560]  that they're concerned about the American people if they raise the gasoline
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:53.760]  prices too much and I've gotten that from Bilderberg as well previously please
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:59.480]  continue so those of you who have just turned in tuned into Alex Jones showing to Genesis
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:04.520]  up may I say that number of years ago the reason I know this material is
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.240]  because I was invited to be the chaplain of the elite of the world for a
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.920]  three-year period I kept in touch with some of those people who are now in the
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:16.960]  70s and 80s and they have personally given me this information is the only
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:21.440]  way I have any access to it and Alex do exactly right they even talk about you
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.080]  by the way in those meetings Alex I could tell you some things I will off the
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:32.320]  air someday but they they took the price of gasoline that they saw that to
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:37.120]  fill up an SUV and it cost $100 too many people were waking up and it kind of
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.320]  hurt my credibility a little bit when he told me he said well chaplain I'm sorry
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:45.680]  but you'll just have to take it now I'll tell you this though it is going to go
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:50.320]  up to $150 to $200 a barrel and when it does it is going to take place
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:56.600]  literally overnight they will do it at a point that will be most unexpected why
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:03.040]  please why do they not want war with Iran till September October of 2012 there's a
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:08.080]  reason why I will president now our president president Barack Hussein
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:15.000]  Obama Mr. Obama is in trouble he's their man he's doing everything that they
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.040]  won't done even though you know earlier they said McCain was their man but they've
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:23.760]  gotten Obama in line with everything they wanted to do with him and now he's in
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.720]  trouble the economy is in trouble the unemployment rate is horrifying people
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.000]  are mad as can be they must find a way to get him back in office now do you
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:39.320]  realize that the election is in November of 2012 September October how close are
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:44.240]  you to it you undoubtedly know from history if you're a history student no
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:49.960]  sitting president has ever lost an election in a time of a declared war or
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:55.080]  an emergency October surprise that's exactly what they want and they're
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:58.120]  doing it intentionally well that makes sense it's always hiding in plain view
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.560]  they want an October surprise for Obama who will look tough and the neocons have
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.680]  said strike Iran you'll be reelected he strikes two months before then we go
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.680]  into the Great Depression it's the Iranians fault yes I'm going to stick
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:16.400]  my neck way well we will not have one with Iran this month or next month even
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:21.800]  our warships are all the way over there Russia is mad as can be you've got a
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:28.360]  problem because of Syria it is not going to happen if they have their way until
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:34.680]  later up into 2012 folks please please please please I beg you don't let your
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:40.240]  guard down don't stop making preparation it is going to happen just because I've
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:44.320]  said it's not going to happen this month or next or the elite don't want it this
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:48.000]  month so that you have a window of opportunity right now to get that

[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.400]  place around this whole situation we've just got two statements number one a
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:13.160]  ram was not going to take place right now if the elite have their way it is
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.680]  going to take place next year it will happen they already put three years I've
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:21.080]  been telling you it would not happen because mr. prom said that before he
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:26.160]  died it's changed now they're ready to bring it on secondly the crash the
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:30.880]  financial crash both with the euro and the American dollar is not going to take
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:34.960]  place this month nor next month nor the next month and when we come back to the

[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:42.080]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video

[02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:29.440]  now remember the fact that we're exposing all of this and the fact that
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:34.960]  we're discussing this does have the ability to change the future to a
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:39.280]  certain extent the globalist are brazen they are arrogant they are hubris
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.640]  filled and unfortunately more and more they just go ahead and do what they were
[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:48.120]  planning to do even if it isn't going to work but one thing is history shown is
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:54.040]  that elites get filled with arrogance and megalomania type of hyper confidence
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:59.960]  criminals of all types do this and just go crazy an orgy of corruption and
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:02.720]  that's that's happening right now but look at all this crazy stuff that's
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:07.960]  going on the nukes being moved around the armies the threats because the
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:14.280]  veneer is peeling away and they are manning the FEMA camps right now now
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:21.600]  does that mean they're going to pull the trigger absolutely that's up to us and
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.840]  I was just talking to Stuart Rhodes and doing some more research they're trying
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:27.240]  to confirm this you know we know there was some National Guard stand-downs
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.680]  at Katrina for gun confiscation we even know the units now years later we found
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:34.240]  out they reportedly with this new group they were gonna have to do
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:38.520]  questionnaires then do a drill they arrested the first guy to say no I mean
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:43.000]  what if this is true it just it just shows how and I've talked to the military
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.280]  it's on record they've been trained to fight the American people Stars and
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.960]  Stripes three years ago yes we're trained to pull triggers on Americans but

[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:43.320]  Lindsay you haven't raised this and I didn't check with you when I called you
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.680]  but I know that you put all this stuff always in an even more focused way on
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:52.880]  DVDs and audio CDs and things like that so I wanted to before you get into the
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:59.080]  other five points now as you covered the Iran situation I wanted to ask you have
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:04.320]  you had a chance since you got this seven days ago to put out an audio CD
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:09.240]  through the prophecy club that you work with or or is that coming out five or
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.680]  six months ago when I was given the five agendas of the elite through the year
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:18.200]  2012 that's right now you have the Iran stuff that's right yeah yeah and a
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.600]  little of that is in there but not everything that was told me within the
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:27.240]  past seven days and I was so startled that I said there's no way I'm gonna say
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:31.280]  this before I record it first because if I do people say that I said it after it
[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:38.680]  happened so we produce a three hour professionally done in studio DVD entitled
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:44.680]  2012 the beginning of the end and Alex I really believe that the reason I
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:48.760]  named it the beginning of the end because I believe that 2012 is going to
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:53.080]  be the beginning of the end of the new world order and when you see what the
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:58.640]  elite think is going to happen in the way of divine things taking place in the
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:03.560]  years 2012 you know most of the elite today at the inner core of the elite
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:07.520]  they're better Bible scholars than some preachers are and I think that being a
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:11.680]  pastor of the church for 12 years it's amazing how much they know through their
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:16.240]  think tanks and they know that they're going to be some very unusual divine
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:20.880]  events are going to take place in 2012 along with what they're going to do with
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:24.860]  that devil's Messiah program I want to get into all this people go to what
[02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:28.840]  prophecyclub.com and find the Lindsey Williams sector it's a huge area there
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.760]  and they can also is there a number that can call to get that report they can

[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:53.440]  all right now let's continue because we've only got thank you only got 20
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:57.120]  minutes left okay you got into the new Iran stuff and then and then the other
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:00.640]  stuff he was telling you that ties into the other five points but you were
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:04.880]  getting into the next point about when the accelerated collapse coming we've
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:08.200]  been going downhill for a while gradually but there's some bigger drop-off
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:14.640]  points give us what your former big three oil company CEO of course known to
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:20.840]  me folks but we're not gonna say his name here obviously what he told you well
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:25.000]  quickly let me finish up with Iran this is so important I'm so startled over
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:29.120]  what I heard a week ago Russia for the first time since the Cold War is
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.160]  flexing its muscles this is the first time it has ever seen its warships and
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.480]  they've sent them right over there by Syria they cannot move they cannot take
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:45.160]  them back home Russia is in a Russian roulette standoff if they do they've
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.880]  lost their credibility totally mr. Putin is just up for election they cannot move
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:55.000]  them America our president he's in such so much trouble he can't pull our
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:01.960]  warships out this is a standoff that is horrifying right around Syria China has
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:06.200]  just made a statement that they will come to the to the aid of Iran if any
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:10.400]  problems take place Iran has said we will come to the aid of Syria if any
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:14.920]  NATO forces go in folks you don't have the slightest idea I almost still wait
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:18.320]  at night I had some dreams about this last night scared the daylights out of
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:22.120]  me they were just because I'm so fearful knowing what's taking place over there
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.960]  no everybody's having anybody with discernments having the dreams right
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:29.600]  now Lindsay you notice in the last three years all the saber-rattling you
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:33.200]  didn't hear China and Russia weighing in now they're deploying troops they're
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:36.960]  moving ships in they're deploying their nukes they're threatening Hillary
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:41.560]  Clinton I mean they know this is entering the danger zone can you imagine
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  where my target without a single product on its ships mark made in China folks you
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.840]  are going to see it mr. prom told me this before we ever passed away he said
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:54.760]  watch China and he told me some of the things that he said first the Middle
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:57.840]  East is going to be in turmoil and revolution staged but that's a
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.800]  diversion watch China but watch China let's continue here let's continue here
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:06.360]  though with with the Iran situation and then the other five points let's go
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:13.160]  through okay five points first of all number one please jot this down on your
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:18.680]  paper the elite have intentionally not allowed the European Union euro to crash
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:24.360]  the American dollar should have long since have gone with a 15 trillion dollar
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:28.480]  indebtedness and the Federal Reserve buying back our T bills from said
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:32.960]  before you die you said the day that the Federal Reserve buys back its own it is
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:37.160]  T bills he said it's all over for the American dollar now I'm finding out for
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.240]  my elitist friends that they are intentionally holding off the crash it
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:44.680]  will not take place this month it'll not take place next month it will not take
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.520]  place for a number of months don't let you guard down and why they're not
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:55.120]  letting it happen here it is the elite wish to create massive like you have
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:01.400]  never seen before massive debt before they allow the crash to take place so
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:05.560]  that when they do let it take place they can step in and say grease we on all of
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.640]  your paper America through the Federal Reserve we hold your debt they can step
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.760]  into every city every county every state in the United States of America they'll
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:20.200]  say California after all we've bailed you out we hold your paper you don't have
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:24.160]  a chance you have to accept our new world order and our new currency never
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:29.560]  mind your Constitution every bit of this folks is being done you must not fall
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:34.680]  into the debt trap they are intentionally holding off on the crash
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:40.000]  until later on up into 2012 mark my words I know most news literators have
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.600]  been saying it won't take place next week gonna happen tomorrow gonna happen
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.840]  1111 gonna happen on 1212 none of them it didn't happen the way any of them
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:54.040]  said the elite said to me is going to create massive debt like the world has
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:58.280]  never seen so that the world will be in such a condition they can step in and
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:01.560]  say what we have the answer to it all yeah it's a world government they've
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:04.800]  already announced that as a solution they want to milk and suck each country
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:08.800]  with a new bailout always promising to fix it first they've got a lot of
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.200]  squeezing and milking to do first so I asked one of my financial friends here
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:18.160]  just the other day I said who in their right mind would possibly buy a single
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:22.520]  piece of Greek paper over in Europe I said that no way they'll ever get paid
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:26.800]  back he said chaplain you don't understand and I'll admit to you but
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:29.960]  some of the things that these people have told me I don't understand it's a
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:33.680]  chaplain you don't understand he said the elite are the ones that are buying the
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:39.240]  Greek paper I said but why they'll never get paid back he said chaplain come on
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:45.080]  he said get with it he said no they won't get paid back he said that's what
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.520]  we want I said what are you talking about he said we can step in the Greek
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:53.520]  France Italy I don't care what those countries are over there every one of
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:57.880]  them they're buying it with the valued fiat dollars anyways and loan
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:02.920]  guarantees show they buy it with fiat Ponzi they took the country down by
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:07.400]  setting them up to fiat Ponzi and then they get all the real stuff for nothing
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:13.000]  that's exactly right Alex you hit the nail on the head that's exactly what
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.880]  you said you said chaplain whenever we allow the euro to crash oh by the way
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:23.760]  whenever you whenever you see the euro crash you've got a maximum of three
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:29.240]  weeks and if you don't get out of paper of every kind your 401k your IRA your
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:34.080]  Federal Reserve note any paper that you in within you've got to get out of it
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:37.480]  within three weeks or you've lost it after you see the euro crash I'm just
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:40.840]  giving you a time frame that you work now he told you three weeks but once
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:44.120]  everybody starts rushing they're gonna try to shut it down even quicker than
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:49.760]  that and they want to buy every bit of the debt of all of these countries over
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:53.280]  there they know they'll never get paid back then they can step in when they
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:57.720]  finally allow the crash to take place and they can say you don't have a chance
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.440]  you've got to accept all of your world order you don't have your own currency
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.280]  we have a new currency backed by gold and silver please both don't sell your
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.720]  gold and silver it's going gold going to 3000 plus an ounce of that stuff well
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:12.160]  let's go through everything you told you them okay I mean go through it
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:17.520]  specifically go ahead massive debt before they allow the crash take advantage
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.440]  of the window of opportunity to make all your preparation secondly please
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:29.160]  listen to this one as carefully as you can by the end of 2012 all private
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:34.600]  fortunes will be lost that are secured with paper they already have it planned
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:40.760]  now keep in mind during the 1929 and 1933 depressions there were people who
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:44.720]  made great fortunes they knew it was coming they knew it was going to happen
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:51.520]  Lehman Brothers is not going I'm sorry the Goldman Sachs is not going to lose
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:56.080]  one single penny in this depression they know it's they know what to do now

[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.000]  going to bring about the loss of please let me say it again by the end of 2012
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:54.760]  all private fortunes will be lost that are not secured by paper and you've
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:47:00.400]  got to get into okay now the next one welfare recipients of this cover they
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:03.880]  covered so many things with me about five or six months ago his peers that they
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.160]  like sound up like welfare recipients food stamps people who are getting them
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:14.320]  those who are on social security you will not are you listening folks you will
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:19.280]  not have your checks cut off you will continue to get them you'll get them
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:24.040]  right on through 2012 and probably up through 2013 and you will continue to
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:27.720]  get them and I'm going to give you the date when you quit getting them they
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:32.920]  know that the day that the food stamp recipients the foods and the welfare
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:36.520]  recipients and the social security people to cut off that I will sit is
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:41.840]  will burn they want the new world order brought in their way and they will
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.920]  continue to give you your checks until the day that the American government
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:50.080]  defaults on this national debt and I'm saying it I said it before I gave it on
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.600]  Alex Jones show I think last time I was here the national debt will be defaulted
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:59.920]  on not necessarily this year nor next it may take a few years they want to do
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:03.520]  everything else first in the way of the loss of what they're going to bring
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:07.440]  everything down before they then do that but but they will they are freezing
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.400]  colas so you still get the check it just doesn't buy as much it won't buy as much
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.760]  and I have had some innovations which I can't talk about today maybe after the
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:21.760]  first of the year as to some time frame and what will be happening to the
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.360]  American dollar because mister they said to me that the American dollar will be
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:28.880]  dead by the end of 2012 the next one very quickly because I know we're giving
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:35.000]  out a time here if you own a farm and it's paid for if you own a house
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  you're beginning to realize why scared the daylight side of me when I got all
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.040]  this and are you understanding why you won't find this and any newsletter you
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:47.920]  haven't heard anybody talk about this one I guarantee you if you own a farm and
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:50.960]  it's paid for you own a house and it's paid for you have a business and you've
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:57.600]  been wise enough not to get a small business along you must immediately go
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:02.360]  and get enough gold and silver to pay your taxes for three to five years if the
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:06.200]  elite cannot confiscate your property because you can't pay your mortgage and
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.480]  they will they'll confiscate that house if there's a mortgage on it that both the
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:15.080]  that and they'll let millions of houses sit empty just because that's what they
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:18.640]  want to do they're already doing it I mean they want to wreck things they say
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:22.200]  they want to wreck things yeah they want to turn around and read it back to you
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.400]  and the the Federal Reserve is nothing but the elite it is not federal and
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:29.720]  you're right just like the Great Depression that they engineered the
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.160]  whole thing that was declassified they're gonna want it you this is you've got
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.040]  to be ready for up to five years to pay for everything you're gonna have to be
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:40.520]  able to pay those taxes down the line even though the states and the counties
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.480]  have been bailed out by the Federal Reserve and they will control them and
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:48.800]  own them at that point but if you can't pay your taxes this will be the next
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:53.240]  method that they will use to confiscate and get everything that is left you
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:56.880]  must go and get enough gold and silver which you say wait a minute the county
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:02.000]  and the state they won't accept the gold and silver you cash it in for whatever
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:06.320]  the paper currency is yeah cash it in for whatever the currency is that they
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:11.600]  issue at that time and you are not going to lose one thing you pay $1,700 for
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:15.680]  an ounce of gold right now you'll be worth three and four I'm predicting at
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:19.440]  least three because you have to pack the world currency with it and you'll be
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.320]  able to go and pay your taxes keep you form you can live a successful life
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:29.960]  under the new world order program if you don't want to do right now and you
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:34.720]  take the time to do it Alex knowledge is power people perish for lack of
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:38.080]  knowledge I know I've known this information and it's been nothing but a
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.120]  boon to myself and the listeners when gold was 260 bucks we told them now it's
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:46.680]  1700 1800 and they could move it up and down but if they're devaluing currencies
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.440]  worldwide there's only a matter of time till it goes up incredible so tell us

[02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:19.600]  we've been so jam-packed with news I haven't gotten a lot of calls the last few days but
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:26.400]  I'm going to tomorrow and then on Sunday 4 to 6 but wow I wish this stuff
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:29.840]  wasn't true I wish this wasn't happening I mean they're admitting a bank of the
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:33.360]  world world government run by Goldman Sachs you'll pay your taxes to when
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:37.760]  they're the ones engaged in all the fraud and I know Lindsay Williams has these
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:41.720]  sources we have some similar ones through our connections that basically we get
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:46.520]  the same information but Lindsay knows these guys well well the one that's
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:52.480]  alive now and it can really you know get a lot of stuff out of them and it's
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:56.960]  it's disgusting that it's gotten to this point but this is their plan and I've
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:59.920]  seen them do it in third world countries I've interviewed their economic hitmen
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:04.400]  like John Perkins a lot of this stuff's been declassified I've read state
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:11.120]  department training manuals that's what tragedy and hope is and it's almost a
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:15.680]  thousand pages or is it over a thousand with a bibliography that was only for
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:18.840]  government people to read but the plates got out and it got printed and the
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:22.520]  government admits it sits there and so here here's an 1100 page book or
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:29.000]  whatever I guess yes some verses of the bibliography you know here it is and
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.920]  this is what we're doing so they can understand well wait the
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:38.520]  banks run communism and fascism and again it's complex but once you see it
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:42.400]  it's like well that makes total sense they get everybody in fake debt and they
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:45.880]  get him in more fake debt for more fiat garbage and then they get all the real
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:50.920]  assets this is how they operate it's the power of saying I control the money as
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:57.080]  Lord Rothschild said Lindsay other points that he made to you when you
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:03.240]  talked to him seven days ago other other things he raised yes I've only given
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:10.680]  three the elite have a think tank and I say this with respect for all of my
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:14.960]  pastor friends in some instances the elite no more than most preachers do
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:21.800]  why did things not take place in the year 2000 there's a reason why why things
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.680]  not taking place until the year 2012 that now there's a reason why and they
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:29.960]  have thought this through and when I found this out I was so startled I went
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:34.320]  to my scriptures I began to look every way I could and I found out that the
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:37.520]  Bible is in perfect agreement with what these people are thinking is going to
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:42.400]  happen in 2012 there are going to be some divine manifestations I did not say
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:47.960]  divine intervention I said divine manifestations in 2012 I give them
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:52.240]  all and I will use series 2012 the beginning of the end also one other
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:55.960]  thing I know we've got seconds here so I'm gonna give us one more one of the
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:01.920]  agendas I'll be elite in 2012 is such a simple word but it is so profound it's
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:09.120]  almost unbelievable it's the word fear F-E-F-E-A-R fear there has not been a
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:14.360]  single terrorist to Texas 9-11 yet they've got you scared to death you go
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:17.600]  to the airport and they make you think you're a criminal you're shaking your
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:21.080]  shoes as you give them your identification you go to the courthouse
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:25.160]  you don't you take off everything that's metal from beginning to end then they
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:30.400]  gave you L&N and Planet X and every bit of it was a method of instilling fear and
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:35.320]  so I contacted two of my medical friends I mean one of you to recognize and
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:41.440]  immediately because he has a nationwide radio show every week on medicine and I
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:46.600]  said what does fear do when it's there in when the human body is object is put
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:51.680]  into presence of fear and he said Catholic very simple it shuts off the
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:57.880]  brain oh my gracious that's exactly what they're doing folks do not allow
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:03.120]  yourself to fall into the trap of the agenda of the elite and one of their
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:08.920]  agendas is to make you scared to death quit looking behind bushes sleep well
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:13.880]  at night know the issues that you're hearing it on Alex Jones show from week
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:17.760]  to week and then take action and do something about well Lindsay there's one
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:20.800]  more point you got to make so let's can you do five minutes overdrive or do you
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:25.040]  have to go oh I'm in no hurry Alex I'll stay with you the longer you are well

[02:58:57.160 --> 02:59:01.360]  you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:05.040]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:09.240]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:14.120]  and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with

[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:01.680]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:10.480]  all right it's a little overdrive here a little addendum with Lindsay Williams
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:13.160]  will obviously have to get back up next week if you can do it to flesh more of
[03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:17.520]  this out and take calls want to point out there's another shooting at least two
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:22.120]  shot hours ago at Virginia Tech same place where they had shooting before a
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:25.920]  lot of suspicious stuff in the last one we'll see what's happening here you know
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.960]  as Blagojevich gets 14 years in prison when compared to the rest of the Obama
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:37.280]  mafia he's nothing core sign and others just incredible that that happened but
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:42.480]  I certainly won't cry my milk at night about it but Lindsay there was one other
[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:45.000]  point you were going to get to and anything else he told you seven days
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:51.040]  ago paper can you afford to lose it any paper you've got anything that you've
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.480]  gotten away of assets that's in paper if you can't afford to lose it you've got
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:01:00.320]  to get out of it immediately there is going to be a financial crash but it'll
[03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:05.440]  take place down the line when you least expect it same thing with Iran when you
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:09.160]  least expect that you're going to have gasoline at the gas pump eight nine and
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:12.280]  ten dollars a gallon and they'll probably go there overnight when the
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:16.320]  conflict starts with Iran they will take the price where they want it to go
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:20.680]  many of you remember that about nine months ago I went to them after the
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:25.560]  Egyptian conflict and I said to my leadest friend what in this world are
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:28.800]  you doing I said you told me what you'll be with Iran but there would be a
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:34.480]  conflict at the Middle East and he said yeah and I said but what are you doing
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:38.600]  over here why is this happening and he gave me and I appeared on your show and
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:42.840]  told it Alex and this dawdled you I said everything that they're going to do in
[03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:46.680]  the Middle East and have you noticed that each nation has been taken in the
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:50.840]  exact order that I gave it right here you'll find it the archives of the
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:54.640]  Alex Jones show not because I gave it but because my leadest friend gave it to
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:02:00.520]  me it first of all was there was Egypt and then it went down to Qaddafi and
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:06.040]  then each one of these nations one after the other everything has happened
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:10.720]  exactly as they said Egypt, Libya, Kuwait, Yemen and now they're right down to
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:14.840]  Syria and next will be Saudi Arabia even though most people the most use letter
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:18.360]  writers don't think there's going to be a crisis there it will happen they're
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:23.200]  getting the Bakken feel that the Boston South Dakota and Montana ready the you
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:27.360]  must see the largest oil rig that has ever been produced on the face of the
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:31.840]  earth you'll see it in our new presentation 2012 the beginning of the
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:36.280]  end it's on Gull Island they're going down eight miles they know that there's
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:41.440]  the mother loa with all oil fields there and it'll be brought in just about the
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:45.480]  time that the Middle East situation gets so hot that they produce it from
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:51.160]  America's own oil fields at $150 to $200 a barrel if you can even get it at the
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:57.280]  gas pump and by that time you'll be begging for gasoline you'll be begging
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:01.240]  for the new world currency you'll be begging for the new world order okay one
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:04.480]  thing Alex said I do need to touch on though that I just barely touched on
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:09.920]  the earliest segment I was so fascinated when I found out what the ethnic
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:18.760]  tank has found out 2012 they know the elite no good will that in 2012 there's
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:22.680]  going to be some things take place that they have never seen take place on the
[03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:29.160]  face of the earth before and when I was given this I had to go do some studying
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:34.920]  on my own even though for many many years I have tried to give out the word of
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:40.000]  God the best I could why didn't things happen in the year 2000 they were
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:44.200]  supposed to have I and nearly every other Christian that I know I've thought
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:49.080]  that something was going to happen on the year 2000 and it did nothing took
[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:52.320]  place and I must admit to me I was on this point am I talking about the coming
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.760]  of Jesus Christ that is not my subject matter here at all I'm talking about
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:04:03.400]  some sort of divine affestation intervention something taking place
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:10.920]  nothing happened in the year 2000 it took the elite to find out why 2012 now
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:16.440]  please let me give it to you quickly if I can from the in the book of in the
