[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.280 --> 00:18.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.840 --> 00:22.780]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.780 --> 00:28.260]  hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alex Jones show on this August 12
[00:28.260 --> 00:34.760]  2010 edition Alex is away today working on a project so I'll be sitting in for
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.480]  the first hour some of you may know me I'm Paul Joseph Watson the writer and
[00:39.480 --> 00:45.480]  editor for prismplanet.com and we will be going to your calls at the bottom of
[00:45.480 --> 00:57.720]  the hour so get ready and the number is 800 259 9231 that's 800 259 9231 but in
[00:57.720 --> 01:01.920]  the meantime we're going to hit on a number of topics primarily of course
[01:01.920 --> 01:10.080]  the financial meltdown the double dip recession slash depression and more
[01:10.080 --> 01:17.200]  importantly how the collapse of the political dynasty of Barack H Obama and
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.120]  the build-up of tensions with Iran are all intersecting at the same time
[01:22.120 --> 01:28.880]  leading to the same ominous conclusion that we'll discuss shortly now we're
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.120]  gonna start obviously with the financial picture the Dow Jones is down again
[01:33.120 --> 01:41.480]  today it lost no less than 265 points yesterday and the latest job news which
[01:41.480 --> 01:48.120]  came out today is that jobless claims are unexpectedly rising this is out the
[01:48.120 --> 01:54.200]  Associated Press jobs picture dims as unemployment claims rise the employment
[01:54.200 --> 01:58.120]  picture is looking bleaker as applications for jobless benefits rose
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.280]  last week to the highest level in almost six months it's a sign that hiring is
[02:03.280 --> 02:07.920]  weak and employers are still cutting their staffs now of course this is being
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.560]  billed as a surprise that it was unexpected that jobless claims would
[02:12.560 --> 02:18.680]  rise again and of course that was all coming from the happy-clappy you know
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.560]  robust recovery crowd who told us that everything was hunky-dory when in fact
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.840]  as Alex Jones Gerald Salente all of us here at prisonplanet.com and
[02:29.840 --> 02:36.320]  infowars.com have predicted from the very start this was a suckers rally you
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.080]  know if you put your money in to the stock market ten years ago it was at
[02:41.080 --> 02:46.720]  10,000 now it's a little bit over 10,000 so if you account for inflation then
[02:46.720 --> 02:52.560]  you've lost money and once again this so-called robust recovery has turned out
[02:52.560 --> 02:58.480]  to be nothing of the kind GDP figures are being revised downward on an almost
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.880]  daily basis the jobs picture is getting worse the housing picture is getting
[03:03.880 --> 03:10.040]  worse and people like Alex Jones and Salente again proven right from the very
[03:10.040 --> 03:16.200]  beginning when they said that this was a fake recovery and now CNN has followed
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.560]  in the footsteps of the New York Times in calling this what it is I mean it's
[03:22.560 --> 03:26.440]  becoming so brazenly obvious that they're having to stay exactly what it is
[03:26.440 --> 03:33.480]  and it's the onset of another collapse CNN article today is this finally the
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.200]  economic collapse and following on from the New York Times as David Krugman who
[03:39.200 --> 03:43.920]  back in June wrote that the United States was entering quote the third great
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.840]  depression which would be similar to the long depression of the 19th century
[03:48.840 --> 03:54.120]  today CNN and Keith McCullough warns that the Federal Reserve's announcement
[03:54.120 --> 03:59.480]  yesterday that it will start buying Treasury debt is a crossing the Rubicon
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.560]  moment for the economic decline of America and in this article he calls he
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.640]  says that this action by the Federal Reserve basically printing more money
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.280]  out of thin air QE2 as it were quote could lead the country to the brink of
[04:14.280 --> 04:21.080]  collapse and that's not Salente that's not Mark Faber that's not Alex Jones
[04:21.080 --> 04:25.800]  that's out of CNN saying that the Federal Reserve is bringing America to the
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.880]  point of collapse and the jobs numbers out today I only back that up further
[04:30.880 --> 04:38.520]  the more now of course rather the sodium fluoride heads who get angry about the
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.560]  fact that they can't have chicken McNuggets for their breakfast we'll
[04:41.560 --> 04:46.080]  finally start to realize what's going on now that CNN and the New York Times
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.680]  the same things as us remains to be seen and we'll explore this further after
[04:50.680 --> 04:55.920]  the break on the Alex Jones show stay with us
[04:55.920 --> 05:03.880]  listen up friends this is Alex Jones with key information the mainstream media

[08:19.440 --> 08:28.760]  Alex Jones it's the Alex Jones show on August the 12th 2010 Paul Joseph Watson
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.320]  sitting in for Alex for the first hour your calls coming up at the bottom of
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.640]  the hour so get lined up on the boards now we're talking about the economy
[08:37.640 --> 08:43.680]  jobless claims are the highest since February the robust recovery is doubt to
[08:43.680 --> 08:50.000]  be exactly as we said it would be a long which was complete hot air the stock
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.960]  market rise was a suckers rally and now that the phony life support system of
[08:55.960 --> 09:01.920]  quantitative easing is being switched off the very same problems that cause the
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.720]  economic crisis in the first place and coming back with the vengeance and so
[09:06.720 --> 09:12.400]  what's the solution from the Federal Reserve of course QE2 more printing
[09:12.400 --> 09:18.040]  money out of fresh air helicopter Ben simply going to turn the printing
[09:18.040 --> 09:23.720]  presses back on and lend the money back to the U.S. my interest and you the
[09:23.720 --> 09:29.000]  taxpayer you're gonna pay for it the debt increases the underlying problems
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.160]  remain but the Federal Reserve continues to make record profits and that's
[09:33.160 --> 09:39.800]  really what matters isn't it 20 billion dollars in interest and that's your tax
[09:39.800 --> 09:46.160]  money just last month alone the U.S. government in July alone paid 20 billion
[09:46.160 --> 09:50.920]  dollars in interest on the U.S. debt and of course that goes straight to the
[09:50.920 --> 09:56.480]  Federal Reserve only 20% of which they give back to the Treasury so where's
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.880]  the motivation to fix the economy the Federal Reserve has hijacked the crisis
[10:00.880 --> 10:07.240]  they're making vast profits record profits off the money they print which
[10:07.240 --> 10:11.440]  they then get the interest back from the U.S. government and lo and behold
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.400]  they're now proposing to do more of the same we're talking about QE2 and of
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.080]  course as the Associated Press reports today the majority of that bailout money
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.960]  goes straight to foreign banks in France and Germany it doesn't go to your local
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.720]  bank it doesn't even go to massive American banks the majority of it goes
[10:31.720 --> 10:37.920]  to offshore banks which of course is the central bankers looking after each other
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.640]  slapping each other on the back as they exploit this economic crisis that they
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.440]  created to look after each other's interests as they loot trillions from
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.280]  the taxpayer and now with QE2 as the Federal Reserve announced yesterday
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.680]  we're set for a new fresh round of raping even as the austerity measures
[10:58.680 --> 11:04.360]  come in even as the income tax goes up the sales tax goes up it's going up to
[11:04.360 --> 11:11.400]  20% VAT here in the UK after January 1st that's 20% extra on every purchase you
[11:11.400 --> 11:18.320]  make in most items the council tax is going up the property tax is going up
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.400]  we're being forced to pay for this and all the money is going directly to
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.320]  France and German banks so now the Federal Reserve say is that the initial
[11:29.320 --> 11:32.920]  700 billion which of course with the rest of the commitments afterwards
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.920]  amount to do over 23 trillion is not enough and we're going to need some more
[11:38.920 --> 11:45.400]  to save America from this economic crisis but of course as CNN admits today
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.400]  the Federal Reserve's own policies are what is bringing America quote to the
[11:50.400 --> 11:56.240]  brink of collapse and what will all this collapse look like in its aftermath
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.920]  I'll just listen to what people like Mark Farber have to say about where all
[12:00.920 --> 12:07.080]  this is heading you know never mind civil unrest and food riots Farber is
[12:07.080 --> 12:13.720]  talking about a Mad Max type scenario you know every man for himself and I
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.960]  mean we can learn from this because within implicit within the warnings of
[12:17.960 --> 12:23.200]  what we need to do as solutions to protect ourselves from what could happen
[12:23.200 --> 12:29.240]  if the very worst comes to pass which is what Farber is saying and this is what
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.840]  he said in an interview just a couple of days ago he says by a farm you can
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.960]  tend to yourself out in the boondocks and protect it with high voltage fences
[12:40.960 --> 12:49.080]  barbed wire booby traps military weapons and dobermans and of course that's the
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.080]  same rhetoric as another investment advisor Anthony Fry told TBC back in
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.520]  June he said people should concern themselves with buying guns land and
[12:58.520 --> 13:04.600]  barbed wire now these people are on CNBC and CNN saying this this isn't some
[13:04.600 --> 13:11.120]  obscure late-night radio talk show saying this so why are they telling us to buy land
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.560]  well it's because the US dollar is being devalued out of existence just look at
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.280]  the chart since the beginning of June against the euro and the pound the US
[13:21.280 --> 13:26.680]  dollar is going to strike down it's heading south in a hurry and that's
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.000]  because the globalists of course are trying to undermine confidence in the
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.480]  dollar because they want to replace it with a new world reserve currency which
[13:34.480 --> 13:41.040]  is this banker IMF global monetary unit that we've documented and they've
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.320]  publicly pronounced they aim to bring into existence so to do so they need to
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.360]  undermine the US dollar which of course is being done through Bernacke again
[13:51.360 --> 13:56.080]  announcing that the printing presses are going to be turned back on QE2 we're
[13:56.080 --> 14:01.400]  going to have hyperinflation of the US dollar and that spells food inflation and
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.080]  of course when food becomes too expensive people are going to go hungry
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.200]  unless they have their own self-sufficient sustainable source of
[14:10.200 --> 14:17.280]  food which is why we encourage people to buy storeable food but not only that you
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.760]  need land for growing food which is why Farber and Anthony Fry and all these
[14:22.760 --> 14:27.400]  top investment analysts are saying you know the wisest investment to make in
[14:27.400 --> 14:34.880]  these times is land which of course can be used for both growing food via you
[14:34.880 --> 14:39.760]  know allotments and vegetable patches as well as keeping livestock so if the
[14:39.760 --> 14:45.880]  food riots begin which London independent last week reported that food
[14:45.880 --> 14:53.880]  riots could be a consequence of spiraling food inflation then you're
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.160]  going to need to protect this land so that's why they're saying not only do
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.680]  you need land you need barbed wire you need force you need guns you need dogs
[15:01.680 --> 15:07.000]  to protect it and I'm aware of how apocalyptic this all sounds and ten
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.280]  years ago this kind of run for the hills rhetoric you know was confined to these
[15:12.280 --> 15:15.960]  obscure late-night talk shows as I said before well I only have the world's
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.440]  leading investment experts along with the New York Times and CNN saying the
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.520]  same thing then you know it's time to prick up our ears and start to take
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.840]  notice of what they're saying because food inflation is already skyrocketing
[15:31.840 --> 15:38.040]  we have the situation in Russia and Ukraine as well threatening to do the
[15:38.040 --> 15:46.080]  same with these fires blocking exports of wheat which caused in Russia food
[15:46.080 --> 15:52.920]  inflation to skyrocket by 19% in just one week because they blocked exports of
[15:52.920 --> 16:00.640]  wheat and remember Lenin said that you know grain was the go-to currency this
[16:00.640 --> 16:06.040]  is going to cause food prices to skyrocket the London independent wrote
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.720]  that this allied with other drastic weather conditions across the world the
[16:10.720 --> 16:17.160]  floods in Pakistan similar conditions in Brazil and Colombia which is stopping
[16:17.160 --> 16:24.000]  them from exporting the cocoa beans and the coffee was leading towards quote an
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.800]  inflationary time bomb that threatens to further devastate Western economies
[16:29.800 --> 16:35.720]  reduce our living standards while threatening the very lives of those in
[16:35.720 --> 16:42.160]  the third world because in places like Haiti and Pakistan and places like that
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.040]  people are you know the veneer of civilization is very thin people are
[16:47.040 --> 16:55.160]  very close to death if food so much as rises by 19% has happened in Russia this
[16:55.160 --> 17:00.680]  week so the threat of food inflation is obviously something we need to be aware
[17:00.680 --> 17:07.080]  of but obviously most people can't afford to follow the advice of these
[17:07.080 --> 17:12.800]  investment analysts most people can't afford to buy a farm they can't afford
[17:12.800 --> 17:18.840]  to buy it being rent and allotment to grow vegetables on so the solution is you
[17:18.840 --> 17:23.960]  know to do it in a group whether that be to invest in land with your family or in
[17:23.960 --> 17:27.560]  an in a group with your friends and neighbors as a kind of old-fashioned
[17:27.560 --> 17:33.560]  cooperative but being independent in terms of food and self-sufficiency is
[17:33.560 --> 17:39.160]  going to be a major advantage in the coming years if the situation gets
[17:39.160 --> 17:45.040]  anywhere near as bad as what these people are predicting and you know even
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.360]  if everything's hunky-dory then at least you'll learn some new skills and
[17:49.360 --> 17:54.960]  you'll become more independent which is never a bad thing so I think is a good
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.520]  idea to follow the advice of Mark Farber and Anthony Frye and people like
[18:00.520 --> 18:06.360]  this Gerald Salent today because even if things aren't as bad as we're told could
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.800]  happen and bear in mind that now CNN and New York Times is saying this then at
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.000]  least you'll become more self-sufficient and you'll learn more skills so
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.120]  educating yourself about you know growing vegetables investing in
[18:21.120 --> 18:26.640]  storeable food things like this it can only be beneficial even if the crisis
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.280]  doesn't get out of hand which many are predicting it now well you know even
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.800]  just get a chicken coop and have your own chickens and eggs I mean even that's
[18:35.800 --> 18:40.120]  going to be a help and it's going to save you money anyway so you know where's
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.560]  the downside all you need is a little parcel of land so I say follow the
[18:45.560 --> 18:51.080]  advice by land and become self-sufficient become independent especially with
[18:51.080 --> 18:56.480]  your food because that's going to be key in the coming years if this inflationary
[18:56.480 --> 19:02.920]  holocaust as many are predicting occurs as a result of the economic
[19:02.920 --> 19:09.200]  depression the third depression as New York Times as Paul Krugman characterizes
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.600]  it so I mentioned at the start the show that we have these three major issues
[19:15.600 --> 19:21.760]  intersecting and pointing to the same ominous conclusion we have the economic
[19:21.760 --> 19:26.520]  meltdown with it now pretty clear that we're entering this double depression
[19:26.520 --> 19:32.360]  and even a third you know this Krugman's has something similar to the long
[19:32.360 --> 19:36.920]  depression of the 19th century we have tensions building with Iran we have the
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.640]  political dynasty of various terror are crashing and burning so after the break
[19:41.640 --> 19:44.760]  we'll talk about how these three issues intersect and lead to the same
[19:44.760 --> 19:50.160]  ominous conclusion this is the Alex Jones show I'm Paul Joseph Watson stay tuned

[24:20.080 --> 24:24.840]  Alex Paul Joseph Watson your calls coming up soon now we were talking about
[24:24.840 --> 24:29.320]  the declining economic picture and how it intersects with the build-up of
[24:29.320 --> 24:36.520]  tensions with Iran which are now reaching a crescendo as well as the failure
[24:36.520 --> 24:42.400]  of the political dynasty of Barry Citero as his approval numbers slipped to new
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.720]  lows almost on a weekly basis and of course we had the public meltdown of
[24:47.720 --> 24:53.800]  Robert Gibbs the White House spokesman telling the Hill newspaper that left
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.760]  wing critics of Obama are quote crazy and ought to be drug tested because they
[25:00.760 --> 25:06.000]  criticized Obama for not fulfilling the very promises he made during the
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.440]  election campaign specifically with regard to pulling out of Iraq and
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.920]  Afghanistan the wars under Obama are expanding more US troops deployed under
[25:15.920 --> 25:21.680]  Obama than ever were under Bush and now even people on the left who voted for
[25:21.680 --> 25:28.960]  Obama are screaming bloody murder and finally Gibbs cracked and said that they
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.360]  were crazy and ought to be drug tested and so this goes to show that the
[25:33.360 --> 25:39.640]  corporate marketing tool of Brando Obama which hoodwinks millions of
[25:39.640 --> 25:46.400]  Americans in voting for him in 2008 is officially dead and buried now what is
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.480]  Brando Obama it's the artificially manufactured marketing strategy that
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.600]  made millions of people vote for a man who represents the precise opposite of
[25:56.600 --> 26:02.080]  what he's billed as and what people voted for him on the issues that he
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.160]  promised them during the election campaign and nowhere is this better
[26:06.160 --> 26:13.180]  explained than in a clip by John Pilger who remembers a leftist himself and what
[26:13.180 --> 26:18.840]  Pilger talked about and this occurred shortly after Obama's inauguration was
[26:18.840 --> 26:24.680]  basically similar to what Alex Jones told you in the Obama deception and now
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.280]  we'll listen to John Pilger's description of quote Brando Obama and the fact
[26:30.280 --> 26:35.560]  that the public are finally realizing that this is what Obama represents is
[26:35.560 --> 26:41.120]  a major turning point in the death of the political career of Barack Obama so
[26:41.120 --> 26:49.360]  we'll play out into the break with this clip from John Pilger the clever young
[26:49.360 --> 26:55.080]  man who recently made it to the White House is a very fine hypnotist partly
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.840]  because it is indeed extraordinary to see an African-American at the pinnacle of
[26:59.840 --> 27:07.640]  power in the land of slavery however this is the 21st century and race together
[27:07.640 --> 27:14.480]  with gender and even class can be very seductive tools of propaganda for what
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.680]  is so often overlooked and what matters I believe above all is the class one
[27:19.680 --> 27:25.920]  serves George Bush is in a circle from the State Department to the Supreme
[27:25.920 --> 27:32.560]  Court was perhaps the most multi-racial in presidential history it was PC par
[27:32.560 --> 27:40.120]  excellence think Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell it was also the most reactionary
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.280]  Obama's very presence in the White House appears to reaffirm the moral
[27:45.280 --> 27:52.600]  nation he's a marketing dream but like Calvin Klein or Benetton is a brand that
[27:52.600 --> 27:58.360]  promises something special something exciting almost risque as if he might
[27:58.360 --> 28:05.600]  be radical as if he might enact change he makes people feel good he's a post
[28:05.600 --> 28:13.080]  modern man with no political baggage and all that's fake in his book dreams from
[28:13.080 --> 28:18.160]  my father Obama refers to the job he took after he graduated from Columbia in
[28:18.160 --> 28:24.920]  1983 he describes his employer as an I quote a consulting house to multinational
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.960]  corporations unquote
[28:28.960 --> 28:48.600]  so that's John Pilger talking about Brando Obama and how this corporate
[28:48.600 --> 28:53.320]  marketing strategy was what sold the American people to vote for him in the
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.920]  2008 election but the problem now for the Obama administration and the globalist
[28:59.920 --> 29:05.600]  as a whole is the fact that with his approval ratings going through the
[29:05.600 --> 29:12.480]  floor even leftist now and the aftermath of Robert Gibbs outburst are coming to
[29:12.480 --> 29:16.320]  the understanding that they've been completely hoodwinked into voting for
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.160]  somebody who supposedly represented change but who in fact has proven to be
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.880]  the ultimate servant of the elite and this is going to cost the Democrats big
[29:25.880 --> 29:32.920]  in 2012 and after the break we'll talk about how they may try to pull off a
[29:32.920 --> 29:38.560]  desperate last gas blunge to keep Obama in power and keep their stranglehold over
[29:38.560 --> 29:45.240]  power and then we'll go to your calls stay tuned this is the Alex Jones show

[33:20.080 --> 33:25.920]  It's the Alex Chum Show August 12th 2010 people watching live on prisonplanet.tv
[33:25.920 --> 33:31.680]  with the live video stream we encourage you to sign up and subscribe today now
[33:31.680 --> 33:36.320]  we're talking about these three issues that are intersecting at the moment with
[33:36.320 --> 33:41.120]  the double dip recession slash depression the buildup of tensions with
[33:41.120 --> 33:47.680]  Iran and the crash and burn of the political dynasty of Barack H Obama now
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.520]  the big question is as these three issues accelerate towards each other with
[33:53.520 --> 33:58.800]  the same consequence the question that will be answered over the next three
[33:58.800 --> 34:04.240]  months is this will the new world order merely hand the baton on to a neocon in
[34:04.240 --> 34:10.000]  2012 in the hope that the American people fall for the same left right scam
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.720]  yet again or in light of the success of anti incumbent political candidates will
[34:16.720 --> 34:22.480]  they make a last gasp desperate lunge to restore the political credibility of
[34:22.480 --> 34:28.240]  Barack Hussein Obama and how will that manifest itself now if you listen to
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.600]  people like Robert Shapiro who wrote an article for the Financial Times a couple
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.160]  of months ago he says that the only way to
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.520]  reinstall faith in Obama as a leader is a terror attack on the
[34:41.520 --> 34:47.760]  scale of Oklahoma City or 9 11 so they've got that option to
[34:47.760 --> 34:53.280]  exploit if they choose to go down that route but with the worsening economic
[34:53.280 --> 34:59.920]  picture as it is and bearing in mind that the great depression of 1929 was only
[34:59.920 --> 35:06.640]  really neutralized with America's entry into the second world war in 1941 added
[35:06.640 --> 35:12.000]  to the build-up of tensions with Iran will Barack Obama and the globalist who
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.840]  control him turn to the ultimate weapon of control which is war will the
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.440]  united states support an Israeli attack on Iran as a means of bolstering the
[35:23.440 --> 35:30.160]  economy and providing the perfect opportunity for the globalist to rebuild
[35:30.160 --> 35:36.080]  the world in their image from the ashes of what could potentially become
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.880]  world war three these three issues are coming to a head
[35:40.880 --> 35:44.960]  right now and i'm sure before the end of the year
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.800]  we will have a relatively clear and distinct answer
[35:48.800 --> 35:55.680]  to that question will the democrats pull a political stun or engineer a crisis
[35:55.680 --> 35:59.760]  to stay in power or will they merely hand the baton on
[35:59.760 --> 36:04.960]  back to the republican side of the two-party monopoly
[36:04.960 --> 36:09.120]  that question remains to be answered and will Obama seek
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.280]  to restore his political credibility by launching
[36:13.280 --> 36:18.640]  a war or supporting war on Iran as a means of rallying the american people
[36:18.640 --> 36:26.640]  around his white house those questions are going to be vital
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.560]  in the coming months and we'll see how it pans out i think we'll get the answer
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.480]  before the end of the year so i want to know what you've got to
[36:34.480 --> 36:37.920]  say about this and we're going to go to your calls
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.680]  and the first caller is ernie in california ernie you're on the air
[36:41.680 --> 36:45.760]  what's on your mind today hey not much guy um i have a couple
[36:45.760 --> 36:48.640]  things just real quick uh yeah they're gonna pull they're either
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.480]  going to pull the false flag and let the uh volcano um oil well
[36:52.480 --> 36:55.920]  explode and then they'll pull their game some way they're going to try to pull
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.320]  off these uh these elections now the second thing is i just
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.240]  accidentally got put in jail for a couple days for about 16 days
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.080]  i want to let you know something the biggest corporation the biggest scam
[37:08.080 --> 37:11.920]  in this united states is our prison and jujutsu
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.240]  jujutsu system it is amazingly unreal
[37:18.240 --> 37:22.080]  okay what are you right and what i've learned is the first prisoners and
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.440]  there's a domestic if there's any kind of like martial law
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.600]  they're immediately the the criminal the real bad prisoners are immediately to
[37:29.600 --> 37:34.320]  be shot the rest will be used as slaves i see obama
[37:34.320 --> 37:37.280]  basically they're going to pull whatever they can pull
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.800]  to keep his little berry tutorial butt in there
[37:40.800 --> 37:44.960]  and it doesn't matter who else they put in because they're all belong to the
[37:44.960 --> 37:48.240]  trilateral commission council formulations and we're never going to
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.440]  see iran paul get elected
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.000]  well the positive thing we have to hold on to though is the fact that
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.920]  all these um anti incumbent candidates are having big
[37:59.920 --> 38:03.120]  successes over establishment candidates for example
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.400]  sharon angle in uh i think it's nevada she's got a very good chance of
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.080]  kicking out harry reid and sharon angles this big
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.440]  conservative obviously she's affiliated with the teapot
[38:15.440 --> 38:18.960]  well on the issue she's good because she supports
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.280]  ending fluoridated fluoridation of the water supply
[38:23.280 --> 38:28.560]  so there are lots of these candidates ran paul's another one of them
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.640]  the in many areas represent the true populist
[38:32.640 --> 38:38.080]  sentiment of america so even though some of them are controlled by the
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.720]  republican arm of the tea party i think that's a very positive development
[38:42.720 --> 38:46.800]  and it shows us why the establishment is getting so desperate in trying to
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.000]  demonize these tea party candidates because they do
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.720]  really threaten the status quo and that's a big success that we've had
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.080]  in recent months thanks for your call now we're going to go to
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.240]  julio in illinois julio you're on the air go ahead
[39:02.240 --> 39:06.560]  hey paul it's great to talk with uh someone who was informed as you from
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.760]  across the pond uh i have i have a feeling you know how
[39:11.760 --> 39:15.920]  the aluminists and uh those in the new world order they like to uh
[39:15.920 --> 39:18.640]  go by the number card like the numbers just so like
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.520]  seven seven down in the uk or nine eleven or eight eight eight eight
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.920]  it's 2010 in october that's the tenth month of the year
[39:27.920 --> 39:32.480]  for some reason i think 10 10 10 they may possibly pull something
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.280]  out with uh trying to save theories to toro in terms of a false flag but
[39:37.280 --> 39:40.720]  my question to you is is about uh the uh
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.520]  cia mockingbird media i'm sure you're well informed on you know uh the
[39:45.520 --> 39:49.680]  operation mockingbird how it got started with press cat bush during world war
[39:49.680 --> 39:54.080]  two how is the mockingbird media over across the pond with you in terms of
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.640]  you know the bdc and sky news compared to our mockingbirds here in the state
[39:58.640 --> 40:05.280]  with murdoch fox news uh cnn and msnbc
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.440]  well the situation with the uk media and how it's controlled by the government
[40:09.440 --> 40:13.760]  is basically you had a situation after the
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.400]  murder of dr david kelly and after 2003 invasion of iraq
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.440]  where the bbc was completely overtaken by the labor government and in fact you
[40:23.440 --> 40:27.760]  had a story where labor party officials are actually
[40:27.760 --> 40:31.280]  hacked into the computer systems of the bbc the british
[40:31.280 --> 40:37.360]  broadcasting corporation which is the main um media outlet in britain
[40:37.360 --> 40:41.200]  so it's completely controlled by the government in that sense then on the flip
[40:41.200 --> 40:45.680]  side of the equation the supposed you know alternative to bbc you have sky
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.760]  news which is owned by rupert murdoch who owns fox news
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.760]  and the wall street journal and so on so whatever
[40:53.760 --> 40:57.600]  side you go to whether it be the supposed liberal bbc
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.800]  or the conservative sky news it's the same as cnn and fox news in america
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.000]  they're both owned by globalist interest um which is why the internet's become so
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.680]  much more important in recent years and why they're
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.280]  trying to control it and stifles free speech becoming because it's
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.520]  becoming the true outlet the last outpost of free speech
[41:19.520 --> 41:23.840]  for the individual to use and that's why liberman is trying to move america
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.680]  towards this chinese system of internet policing and
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.080]  regulation under his cyber security bill which we're
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.240]  trying to vigorously oppose at the moment so thanks for your call we're
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.800]  going to go to jeff in virginia jeff you're on the air
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.160]  hello yeah what's in your mind today jeff
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.920]  hi yeah just a couple of points i'd like to make and then um a couple of
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.640]  questions that i had um as far as uh terrorist attacks or something of that
[41:52.640 --> 41:55.520]  nature i don't think we'll see anything like that
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.520]  um probably until next year just thinking that they would probably put that
[41:59.520 --> 42:03.040]  closer to the election than than farther away from the election
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.960]  um also um i had another point on that
[42:08.960 --> 42:11.440]  seem to have lost it all right let me go to my first question maybe i'll come
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.760]  back to that other one oh no i remember what it was
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.560]  um i wouldn't be surprised i think that what we'll probably see is
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.800]  uh the globalist uh agenda get handed off to
[42:22.800 --> 42:28.240]  uh some sort of an in pocket republican type um i just i think that i think
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.240]  obama's credit credibility is is way far shot way more
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.960]  way more shot than uh than uh than anything that you can recover from it
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.200]  that at this point um one question that i had was kind of
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.600]  regard regarding the bohemian grove i know that alex jones exposed that i'm
[42:45.600 --> 42:48.640]  not i don't know if you were involved in that
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.320]  um all that much but what i what i my question was
[42:52.320 --> 42:59.200]  if uh these globalists are as satanic as uh as they seem to be and as i've heard
[42:59.200 --> 43:04.080]  people state that they are what is there any any indication that that wasn't
[43:04.080 --> 43:09.360]  uh an effigy that was burned but actually a real human being
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.000]  actually on an altar of sacrifice there and then my second question you can
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.920]  address that i'll not get off the phone um my second question was kind of to
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.920]  the effect of uh a rumor going around now about dr
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.480]  horowitz and the uh oxy silver scandal i don't know if you guys
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.080]  know anything about that but i was kind of hoping that maybe we we uh the
[43:30.080 --> 43:34.080]  listeners of ox jones could get a statement from you guys on on that
[43:34.080 --> 43:37.920]  and uh i'll take my answers offline thank you
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.200]  yeah regarding bohemian grove um what the caller
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.520]  talks about is uh of course bohemian grove is the annual
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.920]  get-together in the redwood forest there in california of the world's elite
[43:53.920 --> 43:58.400]  um and what he's talking about is the fact that during this ceremony cremation
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.480]  of care which is documented in alex jones's dark secrets
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.160]  bohemian grove movie they bring in an effigy
[44:06.160 --> 44:10.400]  um on a boat with death bringing it in on the boat
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.800]  and they uh burn it in a mock sacrifice to molek which is this
[44:14.800 --> 44:18.640]  you know a cult pagan owl god and this is all on film
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.040]  i mean it's documented up one side and down the other and the caller asks
[44:23.040 --> 44:26.240]  um is is there any evidence that this is a real
[44:26.240 --> 44:30.960]  um sacrifice and not something that's done in mock
[44:30.960 --> 44:36.080]  well of course alex jones the ceremony that alex jones attended the
[44:36.080 --> 44:38.800]  sacrifice that they made was obviously a kind of
[44:38.800 --> 44:44.480]  paper mache mock child because it didn't move and the sounds of it screaming
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.280]  when they sacrificed it were you know played out over a loud speaker and
[44:49.280 --> 44:53.120]  voiced by an actor but what is interesting is
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.520]  in um the franklin cover-up which is a book written by a senator which talks
[44:57.520 --> 45:02.000]  about child abuse and prostitution allegations
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.240]  in regard to uh people holding high office in the united states
[45:06.240 --> 45:10.560]  they do talk about taking their victims to bohemian grove
[45:10.560 --> 45:15.920]  and uh doing their sordid practices their child abuse pedophilia practices
[45:15.920 --> 45:21.120]  under the owl god molek now of course again that sounds completely crazy
[45:21.120 --> 45:25.520]  but it's in the book and the bohemian grove ceremony is real
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.320]  george w bosch henry kissinger david rockefeller do venture out to this
[45:30.320 --> 45:36.320]  ceremony each year and they do burn a mock sacrifice uh as kind of an idol
[45:36.320 --> 45:41.120]  worship to the pagan god molek now would you let
[45:41.120 --> 45:44.880]  people who do that kind of thing even babysit your children
[45:44.880 --> 45:48.160]  well no but these people are custodians of the world
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.360]  they're the elite they're the new world order so the practices that they uh
[45:53.360 --> 45:56.960]  enjoy in private are certainly of massive concern
[45:56.960 --> 46:03.600]  and shock as alex jones's 2000 film dark secrets inside bohemian grove
[46:03.600 --> 46:07.360]  documented so we're going to go on to our next call now which is
[46:07.360 --> 46:11.920]  francis in canada francis you're on the air what's on your mind today
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.560]  hi paul i've been talking to you i wanted to give the uh the whole issue of the
[46:16.560 --> 46:20.160]  gaza flotilla and the murders that took places
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.520]  receded into the past now and people are forgetting about it
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.360]  but it's been bothering me because there's certain facts about it
[46:27.360 --> 46:30.560]  that haven't come to light and the mainstream press
[46:30.560 --> 46:34.160]  as much as they should i'm going to go to the next call sorry
[46:34.160 --> 46:39.040]  your phone's cutting out but you were talking about the the gaza flotilla
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.440]  attack um and we covered that at the time
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.640]  and uh obviously there was propaganda on both sides with the uh
[46:48.640 --> 46:53.680]  release of the videos which showed the israeli paratroops you know gliding down
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.520]  and then we had other videos where um they were
[46:57.520 --> 47:02.320]  shown shooting on innocent civilians so it's still up in the air at the moment
[47:02.320 --> 47:06.240]  of course israel routinely commits these kind of atrocities
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.600]  and we cover them when they do but try calling back in tomorrow because if
[47:11.600 --> 47:13.920]  your phone was broken up so we couldn't quite
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.680]  hear what you were saying apologies for that but we're going to go to the next
[47:17.680 --> 47:21.520]  call which is sunny in ohio sunny you're on the air
[47:21.520 --> 47:24.240]  it's the same from the springboardteparty.com
[47:24.240 --> 47:27.520]  two things i want to bring up to you in the front page of the Dayton Daily news
[47:27.520 --> 47:33.840]  today right state university is in bids for trying to do a bone scanning
[47:33.840 --> 47:37.920]  method to replace fingerprinting for the CIA
[47:37.920 --> 47:41.920]  i thought that was very interesting it's on page one uh you can't miss it
[47:41.920 --> 47:43.680]  actually if you get on there you see a chica
[47:43.680 --> 47:48.000]  stand in front of a skeleton that's supported obviously like in a
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.920]  typical medical lab and it goes in some detail about that i find it to be quite
[47:51.920 --> 47:54.320]  disturbing because obviously biometrics and
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.160]  fingerprints can be altered or disguised but uh it just kind of goes on
[48:00.160 --> 48:03.760]  so this is just like the next level for the naked body scan or is it what so
[48:03.760 --> 48:08.320]  i find to be quite disturbing um second point i wanted to bring up to is
[48:08.320 --> 48:11.440]  i want to piggyback on the gentleman earlier from california talking about
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.960]  the uh jail and judicial system it is a complete racket
[48:16.960 --> 48:20.640]  and and i i've seen so much stuff i mean it's
[48:20.640 --> 48:24.480]  it's a joke i mean first of all they may charge you with multiple charges
[48:24.480 --> 48:27.520]  then dwindle them down to a couple and the bottom line is they just want to
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.320]  hurt to get money from you and uh that's one thing and two is if you're
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.720]  remotely politically affiliated you are bound to be crucified if you go in
[48:36.720 --> 48:39.680]  front of a judge so i mean it's just uh completely
[48:39.680 --> 48:44.640]  despicable but i like to hear your comments about those off the air
[48:44.640 --> 48:49.520]  yeah i've just found the story wsu tries for cia contract with skeletal
[48:49.520 --> 48:54.880]  identification technology could help identify terrorists so now
[48:54.880 --> 48:59.040]  apparently the fingerprints not good enough remember the uh total information
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.680]  awareness DARPA gait analysis with those supposed to
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.080]  identify terrorists by the way they walked well now they're bringing it to
[49:08.080 --> 49:12.000]  a uh internal level and trying to identify
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.880]  terrorists by their skeletal identification and it says right
[49:16.880 --> 49:20.960]  state university research institute is one of a dozen groups chosen from a
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.640]  field of 500 applicants to submit plans to the
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.640]  cia for cutting-edge technology to identify potential terrorists
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.760]  and other suspects university research is working to develop what they believe
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.240]  is the nation's first bone scanning identification system
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.640]  should know next year whether the cia will opt to use their biometric
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.360]  identifier so now uh with the onset of body
[49:47.360 --> 49:51.600]  scanners in airports and of course the uh tsa was caught
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.240]  storing the images as they said they wouldn't now we're going to a deeper
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.200]  level which is bone scanning identification um so
[50:01.200 --> 50:04.800]  big brother is not satisfied with your fingerprints
[50:04.800 --> 50:10.400]  he wants your very skeletal records as part of the database that they're
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.240]  going to have on american citizens of course this is all to fight
[50:14.240 --> 50:22.000]  terrorism and to find other suspects so i'm sure we can trust them with that
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.280]  and we're going to go to darrell in tennessee darrell you're on the air go ahead
[50:27.280 --> 50:30.560]  yep all um here's a couple of quick
[50:30.560 --> 50:35.200]  questions um in terms of the political situation
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.120]  where you guys have stayed over and over again that
[50:39.120 --> 50:46.000]  you know the the voting system is rigged basically and they're gonna put
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.800]  there because they want to put there so you know what's what's the real point
[50:50.800 --> 50:55.040]  you know i'm going out from voting and okay we'll answer that after the break
[50:55.040 --> 50:57.680]  we're going to the break now but we'll come back and answer that question
[50:57.680 --> 51:00.880]  stay tuned it's the alex joneshow live
[51:00.880 --> 51:03.760]  we all know that berkey water purification systems are the most
[51:03.760 --> 51:07.360]  trusted name in water filtration as an authorized berkey dealer for over
[51:07.360 --> 51:10.320]  five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers
[51:10.320 --> 51:14.480]  the berkey guy offers amazing specials for berkey water filtration systems
[51:14.480 --> 51:18.000]  the berkey light systems include a set of self sterilizing and recleanable
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.440]  black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine

[54:15.600 --> 54:19.520]  and we're going to your calls the caller previous caller before the break was asking
[54:19.520 --> 54:23.760]  about electronic voting machines you know what's the point in voting if it's all rigged anyway
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.320]  well the good news is a lot of these machines are being kicked out for example you know
[54:28.320 --> 54:32.960]  hayo the state authorities have got rid of some of the
[54:32.960 --> 54:37.440]  machines and now daibold is trying to sue them for breach of contract
[54:37.440 --> 54:43.440]  and that's caused the local authorities to sue daibold back for irregularities in
[54:43.440 --> 54:47.760]  these voting machines so i think we're starting to turn the tide on that and
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.560]  many states are starting to go back to paper ballots but obviously
[54:52.560 --> 54:56.960]  it's a long battle but we're seeing some progress in that
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.240]  but we're short on time so we're going to go to george in kinetica george you're on the air what's
[55:02.240 --> 55:09.040]  in your mind today hi watson i think we're gaining ground on court should we not consistently i was
[55:09.040 --> 55:14.080]  listening to a different show called gary knoll i don't know if you know of him but uh they are
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.080]  literally going after this guy and uh he had a person from one of the organizations that basically
[55:20.080 --> 55:24.640]  was investigating they were trying to target him but he investigated and found out he had such a
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.080]  good he was such a good guy that he was tipping him off that they were targeting him with with
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.040]  black ops groups and also trying to find something to blackmailing and the thing is he's been going
[55:35.040 --> 55:41.360]  around to all these groups for inoculation he has scientific knowledge and he has the papers
[55:41.360 --> 55:48.160]  and every time they bring up a point he literally uh brought up a hundred pages worth of documentation
[55:48.160 --> 55:54.080]  to prove that molly's inoculations had no basis in scientific fact and there was no reason or
[55:54.080 --> 55:59.120]  reason to inoculate anybody and they didn't even have a legal right to push this thing forward
[55:59.120 --> 56:05.040]  so they've been targeting him but another thing he's been a big man on on the gmo foods and uh
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.640]  there's been uh groups that have been popping up because of his his work and they've had some
[56:10.640 --> 56:16.640]  successes and they are they people are starting to boycott foods of gmo foods in some supermarket
[56:16.640 --> 56:22.960]  markets and some people of yank gmo foods out and promise not to and also label them uh
[56:22.960 --> 56:29.280]  uh without uh government approval so it seems like we're making some headway there one question
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.200]  from you uh you since you can give a broader knowledge of that what's happening in europe
[56:33.200 --> 56:39.440]  how is that how is the this uh uh i don't know just not just alex jones but this type of thing of
[56:39.440 --> 56:45.200]  the of the world type of government uh trying to uh take over in the bank or some things like that
[56:45.200 --> 56:50.880]  how is the europeans in general not just england uh starting to uh awaken or not awaken what's going
[56:50.880 --> 56:59.520]  on there well the world government in europe is being pushed by means of this uh tax that will
[56:59.520 --> 57:05.040]  go to bankroll the world government similar to how the united nations is uh proposing the carbon
[57:05.040 --> 57:11.840]  tax which will go as we learned directly to the world bank now the european union is proposing
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.920]  that for example british citizens pay a tax that will go directly to bankroll the e you and the
[57:17.920 --> 57:25.200]  expansion of of that federally super state so the primary primary offensive is uh on the tax
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.960]  front and getting us to pay for our own enslavement um but people are wise to it and uh people are
[57:30.960 --> 57:36.720]  already being taxed to death with these austerity measures so it's very doubtful um that they're
[57:36.720 --> 57:43.840]  going to go ahead and go along with it especially as opposition to the e you uh in the uk routinely
[57:43.840 --> 57:49.360]  runs at about 70 percent oppose um anything proposed by the e you so there's very strong
[57:49.360 --> 57:55.520]  resistance against the e you uh uh in the uk sorry against the e you and there always has been
[57:56.160 --> 58:05.120]  last caller is lex in ohio lex you're on the air go ahead thanks for uh taking my call i just
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.880]  wanted to ask i'm going to follow suit from some other callers uh and get the european perspective
[58:10.880 --> 58:16.640]  since russia and china china's mentioned but they're basically ignored how do you think they're
[58:16.640 --> 58:24.640]  going to react to an invasion of iran either unsuccessful or successful uh america is ultimately
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.880]  headed for a conflict with china it could come from iran it could come from north korea but that's
[58:28.880 --> 58:33.920]  the ultimate goal for the globalist we're out of time um topping of use coming up with max
[58:33.920 --> 58:42.080]  kaiser and the governor says the alex jones show um stay tuned we'll be back tomorrow you are

[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.920]  we are now into hour number three rama govern it was one of the chief uh morning
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:37.040]  bravers an analyst of course in george erbert walker bush's administration also a army veteran
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.600]  is our guest i i wanted to get him on to talk about wiki leaks because i've seen him saying
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.840]  look this is a big deal the media is spinning it often to you know why do wiki leaks do this
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.640]  should they get in trouble instead of looking at what's in these documents and how afghanistan
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.800]  is unwinnable at least from the public perspective of of what the system claims the war is for and
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.000]  then we're going to get into iran uh more and more it looks like they're greenlighting an attack
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.920]  sometime as an october surprise we'll talk to reama govern about that as well ray it's always
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.400]  great to have you thanks for coming on you're most welcome uh wiki leaks give us your breakdown on it
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.320]  well there are a lot of interesting things about it uh substantively it shows that the war is
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:29.360]  clearly a misbegotten effort largely because uh pakistan their security services the isi
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.160]  are supporting the taliban uh funding them training them leading them in battle it's quite
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:43.200]  remarkable these uh these army uh documents you know these are official documents uh
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.200]  they're recognized as authentic by the administration now uh they paint a picture of the uh the uh
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:57.840]  interservice uh uh intelligence unit there and in pakistan taking the billion of dollars that
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:03.840]  we give them every year and turn it around and making sure that the insurgency uh uh
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:10.720]  uh prospers really uh and so you know this whole business about the you know the border areas and
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.240]  we need to get the pakistanis to realize that they need to throw their lot in with us well
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.880]  what really strikes me as bizarre is you get people like uh our secretary of state illy
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:29.920]  quinton goes down to his mama bot and says now uh to the pakistani leaders she said you
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.280]  you really shouldn't be afraid of india andy i just came from india they're very nice people
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.680]  there and they they they told me they wish you no harm and so don't beware about india be worry
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:49.040]  about terrorists beware about taliban and i'll hide it that's what you should worry about it now i
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.080]  like anybody who knows anything about the history of the subcontinent it knows that you're not going
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.680]  to be able to persuade the pakistanis to worry about anybody else but india and vice versa
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.880]  and so how does this impact on afghanistan well the way that the pakistanis insure or try to insure
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:14.240]  that india no longer has a preeminent influence in Kabul and the rest of afghanistan
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.280]  is to have their own assets and those assets are ones that they recreated on our behalf many years
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.640]  ago they called it taliban and they're going to play that card forever and uh it's just a matter
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.680]  of time before uh before the the feckless counterinsurgency tactic to realize that there's an
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.440]  external supply of people and weapons and everything else just as there was in vietnam by the way
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.920]  you know when the north kept supplying the troops in the south so we were going to
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.800]  intake this interdict the the supply right and and we couldn't do that then what do we do
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:54.000]  we bomb the north so what do we do in pakistan we're bombing pakistan this time with fancy fancy
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.200]  drone stuff where nobody gets shot down it gets killed give me a break it's the most feckless
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.160]  exercise that i've ever seen and these documents prove it beyond reasonable belief now uh beyond
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:14.720]  beyond reasonable doubt let's say now uh the uh the white house three days ago uh dictated to the
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.760]  stenographers they they call themselves the white house press corps and they all took the dictation
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.960]  namely nothing new here you know i said oh we know all that stuff we took that into account
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.200]  when we made our big decisions late last year and all this stuff and so that goes up on the
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.720]  headlines in the washington post and the other papers it's ridiculous uh they should read the
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.000]  documents for beat sake but they're being discouraged to do that you know it reminds me of it reminds
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:48.240]  me of back in uh 2005 when the downing street memo was released that sounded like we have to break
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.840]  here uh if we do yes sir stay there we're gonna come right back i just want to interrupt you
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.720]  to continue uh with uh your view of wiki leaks how the media is trying to spin it what do you

[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.640]  pakistan you know that's a lie that there's no black water there now these documents confirm
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.720]  that but just in the last week i guess ahead of these they came out and admit it okay days before
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.000]  this came out we do have advisors in pakistan and it does seem the way they spun this is to
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.520]  pointed at hameed gul the former head of pakistani intelligence and say
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.240]  see we kind of need to be there but i don't think that's the fault of wiki leaks so much of the
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:21.280]  media just just spinning it but i know rey mcgovern can comment on that and are there big connections
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.240]  from pakistani intelligence to the taliban and why and then i want to get into iran and the war
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.800]  drums really getting more and more intense on that front but uh you were you were cut off by
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:38.000]  the break rey please continue sure i was just trying to raise a comparison here between the
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.360]  wiki leaks treatment by the fawning corporate media and the way the same fawning corporate
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:51.920]  media treated the revelations in the after downing street minutes you'll recall that
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:59.680]  those were minutes recording the chief british spy telling tony blair that george bush had
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:06.720]  decided to go to war with the rock for regime change that this war would be quote justified in
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:14.240]  quote by the conjunction of weapons of military of mass destruction and terrorism translation
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.840]  from the british will say that he has all kinds of mass weapons of mass destruction and that he's
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.880]  going to use them give them to terrorists and finally that crowning sentence for us intelligence
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.240]  specialists they went this way quote but the intelligence in facts are being fixed around
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:37.280]  the policy period and quote so that was a manifest information documentary information the minutes
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.320]  of the meeting written by a participant the same day and it showed that the intelligence
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.520]  was being fixed and that was july the middle of july 2002 some eight or nine months before the war
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.200]  now in this case well in that case the new york times avoided even mentioning it until
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:02.400]  representative conures held that hearing at which i testified in two mornings before the
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.200]  hearing he and i were both on a me goodman and uh... at that very morning the washington post
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.680]  that published that editorial saying oh yes and there are these after downing street minutes
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:20.480]  uh... they have are there are no consequence we knew that all the time they had a laugh because
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.840]  what i would you know if the washington post knew the intelligence was being fixed all the time
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.960]  yeah it really i don't know exactly why they didn't tell us can you get it can you hazard
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:37.360]  against that that alex so uh... so the the situation here is the same they don't want anybody
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:44.000]  to read them they don't want anybody to analyze them and even the new york times which was forced to
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.320]  to publish this because they know that the guardian in london and the dash people in humboldt uh...
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.800]  that they both had them and they would be scooped and it would be very embarrassing for people to
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.760]  realize that the new york times had these documents that hadn't published them so what did they do
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.480]  they went to the white house and said you know we're in this bind we don't want to be scooped and
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.520]  is it okay if we can and and the white house was very understanding so oh shucks i guess this time
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:17.440]  you can and uh... robert gives the president spokesman later complimented the responsible
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.440]  way that the new york times conduct themselves i tell you i tell you alex if it if the press
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.320]  has to go to the white house to receive permission to publish things and that's the responsible way
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.960]  to act we've come one heck of a long way in the free press of this country
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:41.200]  do you think this is going to have as much as an effect on the afghan slash pakistan conflict
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.440]  as the pentagon papers with daniel ellsberg and the ram corporation
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:53.280]  did to the vietnam war alex i've often said that the biggest sea change that i witnessed
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.640]  in this town of washington in the forty seven years i've been here is that there's no longer in
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.960]  any real sense of free press there was back in the seventies there was in the sixties
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.880]  we got rid of a president because of a free press there is none now and so it all depends
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:18.160]  on whether the defunct fourth estate has been replaced by a vibrant fifth estate and that's
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:25.360]  the good news folks there's a fifth estate out there a free media uh... the medium is the ether
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.280]  there it's not susceptible of controlled by governments or advertisers or corporations
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.760]  which don't own it and we have the wiki leaks phenomenon and many other uh... phenomena that
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:45.680]  that feed on on the availability of this this wonderful resource and so even though the fourth
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.280]  estate is dead and that we should duly mourn it because it's a travesty to have those folks
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:57.440]  denigrafing and they're in a whiteout uh... the fifth estate is vibrant and so i think that if
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.600]  people are given enough information you know it's impossible for everybody to read all these
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:12.000]  army documents but if uh... if there's a uh... if people know where to look for real information
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.360]  on this and that's the missing link uh... in speaking around town here i've been referring
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:24.480]  often to the wiki links exposure of that turkey shoot that god awful turkey shoot that
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.320]  that are soldiers there and that the patchy helicopter gunship uh... the gun barrel photography
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:36.720]  the video on that with sound showing our young people just gloating over the turkey shoot of
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:43.600]  about a dozen iraqi civilians mining their own business uh... severely injuring two children
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:51.760]  uh... now when i ask people about that nobody knows about it maybe out of a very progressive
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.560]  audience of a hundred people five people say oh yeah i read something about that and only two
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.600]  of those had taken the trouble to go up onto their url line and put in collateral murder that's all
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.560]  you need collateral murder now right well we're running out of time this is key info you've been
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.040]  covering but we've only got this segment what's left and the short segment coming up with you
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.360]  today and i appreciate the time uh... but going back to something you just mentioned briefly
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.640]  now we see cyber security we read about top secret u s a eight hundred fifty four thousand
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.040]  private individuals with the highest security level uh... we know they're training the military
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.600]  for domestic operations the white house admits they want to start censoring the internet cast
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.240]  sunstein does and it looks like the system realizes it's not going to get away with all this
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.400]  corruption if they don't start return uh... curtailing the web are you concerned about that
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.440]  i am and specifically because the general now for star general keith alexander
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.600]  the same folk is the same fellow who lied to uh... congressman rush halt
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:06.880]  who's on the house intelligence committee and went out there to nsa uh... in december of 2007
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.280]  and asked alexander you're not eavesdropping on american citizens are you
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.840]  i don't know where that's against the against our first commandment
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.240]  and james ryzen's article came out just a week later
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:25.280]  so alexander you know in my day we used to think that army officers shouldn't lie well
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.800]  well he lied to his congressional overseer that that's a crime okay and now he is in
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:38.000]  charge of all this cyberspace stuff security offensive stuff and still ahead of nsa and now
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.920]  the washington post says obama wants to search everybody's computers and isps without warrants
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.800]  now something they're already doing so we've gone from bush lying three years ago and saying
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.600]  we're not spying on you without warrants that's illegal and this general doing it to him now
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.200]  being the head of it and saying yeah we're listening to everything you're doing and google
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.880]  is in wired magazine today saying we're with the cia watching all of you in real time so they've
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.680]  gone from saying oh we would never do that to yeah yeah we're watching everything you know
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:15.760]  what the saving grace is here alex the saving grace is that the by adding more straw or more hay to
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:22.400]  the haystack it makes it even more difficult to find the needles now maybe you and i are getting
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.960]  special treatment but if you deluge if you deluge the system with more and more intercepted covers
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.000]  you just think of the billions and billions of things that they collect every day in nsa
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.480]  it's funny in terms of them running down patriots like us it's not so funny when there are real
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:46.960]  terrorists out there and they can't find this natal in the haystack or corporate criminals
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:54.080]  and we've seen that under bush senior clinton right through to obama where they've cut almost all
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.280]  of the government corporate fraud investigators uh you know 11 years ago they knew what made
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.320]  off was doing but blocked it now the federal trade commission has been given total anonymity
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:11.360]  and immunity for covering up crimes i mean this is this is wild yeah alex said those folks all
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.440]  look like us though you know if you're a little darker in color and have a beard or wear some
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.800]  we consider funny on the top of your head well that's a big big difference but i don't know how
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:29.680]  you sort out at nsa how you sort for uh funny looking things on top of people's heads you can
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:36.320]  and so the state of the art as it was two decades ago is that you can collect immense amounts of
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:43.120]  information from satellites from intercepted whatever okay you can't find what you need
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:49.600]  unless you get really smart programs and really experienced analysts to guide the retrieval
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.720]  unless just like torture doesn't work unless you want fake confessions and to scare people
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.880]  unless they know none of this really works they can just claim their intel shows it
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:07.760]  yeah you know important it's uh what i consider to be the the biggest corporate welfare program
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.960]  in our country since the strategic defense initiative you know the anti-ballistic missile
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:21.440]  thing star wars star wars yeah what what you got here is that is uh uh two and a half times as big
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:31.600]  a intelligence budget now as was the case before 9 11 now that's that's 75 billion dollars alex
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:37.200]  and what we could do in this country was 75 billion dollars i hate to tell you how many
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.920]  schools we could build how many teachers we could train and and retain and all the other
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.440]  use how many bridges we could fix we got a short five-minute segment coming up and then
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.800]  ray's got to go let's get into iran and the green lighting for that attack is it on we're

[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.200]  looks like uh they're lining up an attack on iran we're seeing all these different government
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.160]  leaders say that it's on in the next three months is that saber rattling i think it's more than
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:23.360]  saber rattling let me give you a little background alex um iran's alleged attempt to build a nuclear
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:31.520]  bomb a red herring folks a red herring the cia and 15 other intelligence agencies decided
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:38.080]  made a judgment at the end of 2007 that iran had stopped working on a nuclear weapon not on the whole
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.520]  nuclear program but on the nuclear weapon and that judgment holds okay it holds till today
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.520]  a new estimate is being updating is updating that but so far that judgment holds now number two
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:59.280]  um iran has agreed to ship half of its low enriched uranium out of country half wow you would think
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.760]  that the israelis and the u.s those who are afraid of a nuclear weapon import in iran they jump up
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:12.800]  and down and say wow that lessens the chances of about by about 50 percent instead they go into
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:20.240]  sanctions they're going to other things that are likely to provoke iran number three a few uh a recent
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:28.640]  pew poll shows that in 16 advanced countries most people believe that it's necessary to attack iran
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:34.160]  because of its alleged nuclear weapon okay what's the most important thing the most important thing
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:41.520]  is what israeli prime minister netanyahu thinks of our president uh the recent encounter that they
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.920]  had in the white house where where uh uh obama formed all over him didn't mention the settlements
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:54.720]  didn't mention the american citizen that netanyahu's forces killed just two weeks before uh netanyahu
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.640]  has the impression of our president as a wuss i'm from the bronx that's a combination between
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:08.080]  a wimp and a pussycat and if that's his his judgment which i'm convinced it is uh he he's
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:14.720]  about ready to use what he considers to be his ace in the hole the israeli lobby in this country
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.320]  and uh do what he wishes to do with respect to iran how would it work it send his fighter bombers
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.960]  just up to iraqi airspace which we still control for one more month he would say he'd call that
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:34.480]  there'd be the four four a.m telephone call to obama mr obama i just want to let you know
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.640]  we discovered some some really bad stuff about nuclear weapons in iran so our planes are going
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.480]  through your airspace now uh make sure you tell mike mullen not to shoot any of them down now
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.880]  there's a one person in washington alex that thinks that obama would have the courage to say no no
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:58.000]  no you don't we're going to shoot him down we are not going to shoot any israeli planes down
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  netanyahu knows that he knows he can attack iran and iran will retaliate and will be in
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.560]  in the mix big time okay the other thing that he looks at netanyahu does is the election uh our
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.760]  president has showed himself allergic to do anything that would possibly put any jewish or
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:22.720]  israeli knows is that enjoyed before the election and so this is the time i will predict that the
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:28.880]  chances are better than even that israel will start a war with iran next month that's august
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:36.000]  2010 so it's it's definitely going into the green light phase and what about false flags we saw
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.720]  robert superior in the financial times say obama has to have an oklahoma city or 9 11
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.280]  to look strong to the public for us to win the elections i mean that was an amazing statement
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.920]  yeah i you know it's just a little trifle more cynical than i'm willing to to go i see obama as
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:59.920]  first and foremost 90 of politician not a constitutional lawyer not a guy that cares
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.120]  about our troops and it's on that basis that i judge that he considers it just not a politically
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:11.520]  feasible thing to put the reins on netanyahu given the strength of the liqud lobby in this
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.040]  country well what do you at your gut think you say more than 50 percent i mean i know you're
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.520]  you're hedging there but i mean clearly they're moving towards it we've had the former head of
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.040]  the cia hayden say it's inexorable it's going to happen we hear you know all these noises coming out
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.960]  akhmet denigide believes it's going to happen in the next three months you're saying august
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.920]  well the thing the thing is alex that you can never be real definitive in these predictions
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:42.800]  because it still is in obama's power to prevent this and indeed we veteran intelligence professionals
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.880]  for sanity are drafting a memorandum to the president right now like tonight okay and what
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:56.080]  we're going to say is you better publicly say you better publicly tell netanyahu don't do it
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.480]  we're not going to support you if you do and that's enough to turn it off and that's going to be a
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:06.720]  consortium news dot com yes it will be probably about three days consortium news dot com we need
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.160]  to get this public statement with all of your expert analysis and bombard the white house in

[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.080]  oh we got about 30 seconds left anything else we can do to try to avert world war three
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.320]  well i think you call your congresspeople you call your senators and tell them that you know
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.200]  we're past the point where we're going to be diddled by a country that pretends to be our ally

[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:13.360]  great introduction this is now my 29th year being a volunteer uh fire police and uh we all have to
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:19.440]  give back to our community and i'm giving back to our country right now this is now my 23rd month
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:26.400]  in pursuing obama who is in my new name for me today a complete imposter he's a phony of fraud
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.920]  but he's an imposter and we have to do something about it i'll get into the latest and it's still
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.240]  pending in the court how i got involved in this someone called me up and said had you heard the
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:41.280]  rumor that obama is not natural born i said a little bit and i did some checking and i filed
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:48.080]  the first lawsuit against obama august 21st 2008 before the democrat national convention
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:52.400]  and at that time i sued obama in the democrat national committee and i figured that there's
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.120]  democrat national committee would question obama and therefore you know either produce
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:02.960]  documentation that he's natural born or not nominate him but uh there was collusion there
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.440]  between the democrat national committee because they didn't do anything and they actually have
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.960]  joined forces in fighting my lawsuit i ended up filing three lawsuits and about another hundred
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.240]  lawsuits have been filed around the country most of them the dismissed on the area of standing the
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.280]  court has said that no one has the right to challenge the constitution unbelievable but
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:28.320]  that's the court has been now and if the national media had done what they should have done and that
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:34.640]  is properly uh vet obama he never would have been nominated what the uh national media did to uh
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:39.760]  serapelon is what they should have done to obama and he would not be where he is and the national
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:45.040]  media is shaking a little but they're still covering for obama the the biggest thing is two
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:51.280]  months before i got involved to quell the rumors on the obama campaign website they put a document
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.600]  up there called a cope certification of live birth trying to indicate that obama was born in hawaii
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:03.280]  the document by experts have been proven we have experts that have said it's a phony it's been
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:09.200]  ordered at the very bottom it says if there's any alteration of this document that the document is
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:17.120]  invalid and significant a code is different than a birth certificate a birth certificate has on it
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:21.760]  the weight of the baby the length of the baby the hospital name the doctor's name the doctor's
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:27.040]  signature none of which appeared on this phony document which they produced which they continue
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.440]  to refer back to as a birth certificate and the feet i mean it normally has the uh ink stamp feet
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.400]  i mean i have a copy of that with myself so it's this receipt and they've act very very
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.800]  secretive and will never release it but then you brought out even more important intel and that's
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:48.800]  why i was neutral on this in the last two and a half years but leaning towards it being true and i
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.000]  respect you and others but then when we learned that he did give up his citizenship that his real
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.800]  name is berry sitaro uh that that when you give up your citizenship to that nation you then are not
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:07.360]  eligible to be president anyway you slice this he's ineligible and then the cover-up just adds to the
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.720]  fact of where there's smoke there's fire right and you gave a great analysis there and let me just
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:18.480]  explain that it's hard for obama to get out of it because in the two books that he has had about his
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:24.480]  life so young one of them says he found his birth certificate so he had so he has his birth certificate
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.760]  so you know why he hasn't he uh why hasn't he produced the birth certificate at this time and
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.280]  the other thing is he states that his parents were uh divorced and he mentioned that his uh
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.800]  mother bought his mother remarried because he mentioned in his book that his stepfather returned
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.880]  to indonesia before his mother and he did and that's significant because indonesia he mentioned
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.280]  his stepfather and we have the school record which you are very correct out his name's barry
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.200]  sitaro so if he hasn't legally changed his name since then and there's no evidence he did his
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.160]  name's barry sitaro so every time he signs his name is broncus and obama and each of the 50 states
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.040]  in territories when he ran for president was fraud but he was sworn in as fraud and everything
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.600]  he signs now is fraud and and he was known in college as barry barry right he's even called
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.760]  into radio shows in the last year saying hey this is barry yep i mean the guy is he's such an
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:24.960]  imposter it's unbelievable what about the new videos uh two of them of his wife saying you know he
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.920]  was born in kenya and and and and you know he we went back to kenya the place of you know the place
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.160]  of his birth i mean she's she's just out there like it's a sick joke right now that that has been
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:41.760]  released lately at the past few months but that's from 2008 i mean the overwhelming evidence and
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:47.040]  the overwhelming actual evidence and circumstantial evidence is overwhelming that obama was born in
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:54.320]  africa that he is not natural born and because of his status over in indonesia i believe that he
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:59.520]  came back to the united states so why at age 10 and i believe they came back on his indonesia
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.560]  passport and then believe it or not he didn't go through immigration and therefore he's not only
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.560]  not natural born he's not naturalized but he's an illegal alien all right philberg let's expand on
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:17.840]  that because the media always says hey why would his family put a birth announcement in the newspaper
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.040]  if that isn't true well if you've got a daughter who's overseas she's going to write she's going
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.920]  to call i mean they're going to want him to be a citizen they're going to want to cover their bases
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:32.480]  and carry out this fraud they're they were high powered foundation people you know tied into
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:37.600]  intelligence the the evidence is clear i mean that that's happened many times where people
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.560]  have dummied up that their kid was really born uh you know in the united states when they weren't
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.320]  well it doesn't really even say he was born in the united states he said he was born
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.240]  my my children live in different states uh one of my uh my daughter-in-law is expecting
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.680]  as last year when one of my grandchildren was born i put an announcement in a paper here locally
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:03.280]  where i live that doesn't mean they live here because they don't live here and then also hawaii
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.920]  permitted the uh a cold being given for someone up to a year after birth so you know they hang
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.840]  their head on this cold and they hang on this uh two newspaper announcements of a birth on a street
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.480]  address which people checked out and people there said there was never a black child living there
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:26.800]  so that to me is not evident or like on our website we have the tape of sarah obama that's his step
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.400]  grandmother in swahili and we have the translation stating that she was in the hospital when he was
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:39.920]  born in babasa kenya on august 4 1961 and they act suspicious or grabbing and detaining um
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:48.560]  reporters that go over there uh time and time again so very suspicious absolutely man may she
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.680]  rest in peace but his white grandmother hawaii he never saw the press near her she would have
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.240]  known where he was born she would have known facts about but but she's never got to the press
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.640]  and also is you know this is the woman that meant so much to him during his lifetime yet when she
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.680]  died he didn't even fly back for her funeral you know he he did it like a month later but also
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.840]  two weeks before that he said she's definitely ill and i'm going to fly out in a half hour
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:17.440]  to uh see her then he changed his mind and flew out two days later and if she's such an important
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.000]  person why didn't he take his wife with him and maybe the kids but definitely his wife
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.720]  he didn't take his wife with him i mean the whole thing nothing makes sense with obama about this
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.840]  but but what is that and let me go back on the thing where i think he's not natural born and
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:36.960]  not naturalized that's one of the cases i have pending now in the dc circuit court of appeals
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:43.520]  at the washington dc uh court of appeals which affirmed recently the decision to not let my case
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.920]  go forward but i've now asked for a court in bonka bit for the entire court to hear my case
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:54.080]  there i'm alleged that obama is not natural born not naturalized but he's an illegal alien and
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.800]  therefore his term of the united states center from illinois was fraud therefore the salary and
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.080]  benefits he received excuse me should be returned to the u.s treasury which is about a million dollars
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:09.360]  the those type cases are sealed that when i had a seal that people wondered why all those
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.560]  type cases which are called false playing factor quee tem cases are sealed they're you
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.600]  mainly used in medicaid and medicare fraud cases and they're sealed because the person you're
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.800]  bringing against is not notified of the case it goes to the justice department and the attorney
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.600]  general's office for them to review the case in 60 days and make a decision of one are they
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.720]  going to prosecute the case two are going to let the person who bought the case in this case the
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:41.280]  what's called a relager or three dismissed the case very few cases are dismissed they decided
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:48.000]  to dismiss my case against obama and i raised the issue of conflict of interest and alex if this
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.480]  scenario is not conflict of interest we should take those words out of the dictionary and have
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.240]  legal dictionary that have legal system i mean the fact that the decision is made by the department
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.800]  justice and the attorney general's office who's the head of that the attorney general of the united
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:08.240]  states who's the attorney general the united states eric holder well eric holder number one was a
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:14.000]  senior member of obama's campaign staff number two he was one of three individuals selected by
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.160]  obama to select a vice president who eventually selected by and number three he was nominated
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.960]  appointed confirmed as attorney general the highest law enforcement officer in the country
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.280]  who reports to the president so if that person is not a conflict of interest i don't know what is
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.840]  so that's where i'm at now with the dc court of appeals hopefully they'll have a court in
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.800]  bond if not we're going to take that case of the u.s supreme court well let me say this
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.160]  you've definitely won in the court of public opinion a lot of congress people and others will
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.320]  come out and say that they think the birth certificate issue is legitimate there's no
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:55.840]  doubt the indonesian citizenship we've got a president with a fake made-up name that's confirmed
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.640]  i mean that that's why the controlled corporate media keeps getting so mad that we won't shut
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.680]  up about this and that it just keeps gaining ground at national polls because when somebody
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:11.840]  looks at the actual evidence it is overwhelming that there's a massive cover-up and he's ineligible
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:17.600]  just on the indonesian citizenship and and and name issue and that's why they've got all of his
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:24.320]  college records so sealed and so his approval ratings gone from 85 percent down to 40 he's at
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:29.760]  the lowest approval rating of any president this far into their you know situation but but then
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:34.800]  there's the issue you raised years ago on this show he's compromised the establishment knows
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.240]  he's indonesian citizen bare minimum almost certainly born in kenya uh you know kenyan
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:46.000]  citizen born they know that so imagine how they're able to blackmail him with this information
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.560]  oh i definitely think he's blackmailed i think that that's why most of the speeches he gives
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.680]  are on tele teleprompter he's reading them he's great to deliver a speech off a teleprompter
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:00.640]  not as good elsewhere but he's told what to say and i think our whole country is in jeopardy
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:05.920]  because of it this healthcare bill is blatantly as far as i'm concerned unconstitutional and many
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:11.440]  other things he's doing but and that's why um and through your help we had scheduled to recall
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.240]  march back more that we had to cancel that for certain reasons excuse me we haven't rescheduled
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.120]  yet but looks like we're gonna have it in october getting near election time because i think people's
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.680]  interest will be up why did you have to reschedule well because more and more several groups want
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.600]  to join in with me and we didn't have enough time to plan it right i want to have this march
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:34.640]  since we're working on a date now for october and i wanted to be the largest march in washington
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.280]  dc history because this upfront to our u.s constitution is the biggest hoax against the
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:48.080]  constitution against our country against our citizens in 324 years i'm sorry 234 years
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.280]  since our constitution came into effect you know the the comparison has to be for people out there
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.120]  their question or short snaker people have talked in for 10 15 years about running for president
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:05.440]  and he constantly says amend the constitution i was born in austria amend the constitution i was
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:10.480]  born but you know he could just change his name though to like billy bob and say i am for born
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:17.840]  in california that's the he could run on the obama theory from now on obama is destroying
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:24.320]  the constitution obama has basically said i don't care about the constitution he's basically walking
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:31.120]  all over the country it is a conspiracy theory that i was born in austria i was born in california
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.800]  right right habit obama is when he was i think back in the spring of 2008 when everyone else
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:42.160]  was polluting the flag uh he was standing there with his arm down the side how about when he would
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:48.560]  never wear a a american flag with peltan you know he's changed that but his and then the biggest
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.440]  thing that's why i'm concerned he goes around the world apologizing to the i'd say then he
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:58.640]  bows down to the sortie king he bows down to the japanese emperor he bows down to the uh and then
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:05.200]  they lie each time and say that he's dropped something i mean he just oh your majesty oh
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:12.080]  oh you're so great and they're like oh he was picking up something yeah he was picking up you
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:18.400]  know but but just what he has done has destroyed the image of the united states around the world
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.160]  your majesty i'm sorry go ahead no and that's why we're going to get a date here i'm going to be
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.720]  back on your show and we're going to ask people to come because this is the biggest i don't care
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:33.920]  what your issue is with obama if but think about it if your issue is taxation if your issue is
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:39.920]  education if your issue is medical whatever your issue is it all falls back and then i'm appealing
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:45.120]  in a way to all the party people you have different issues out there but the main controlling issue
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:51.600]  is the fact he's a usurper he's a phony he's a fraud he's an impostor if i am right and i know i am
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  if the courts won't handle this we the american people getting together can demand and if we can
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.960]  bring in one to two million people to washington dc and we can have them there bring a copy of
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.520]  your birth certificate and everyone hold over their head their copy the national media will have to
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:13.040]  cover this and i really believe we can force obama out of office because once the american
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.040]  people stand from c i believe that not enough american public knows about this because remember
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.400]  you need a real live birth certificate to register your child for a little while i mean i mean listen
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:31.520]  listen if he had it he would have released it he's been very suspicious about this and but regardless
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.680]  let's say we're wrong and he was born in hawaii which the evidence shows is not the case he's
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:43.280]  born in kenya his real name is barry sataro he is an indonesian citizen and went to an islamic school
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:48.160]  and i'm not saying it's bad that he went to islamic school the point is the guy is as phony
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:56.720]  as a three dollar bill who he says he is his name is barry sataro barry sataro we've got him
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:02.560]  that guy's an impostor philberger right final segment stay with us hounded by debt collectors

[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.200]  do you think about states moving to pass laws to force him to give him the birth certificate
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.800]  didn't arizona pass that now it was introduced and uh this the house passed it i think in the
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:36.560]  senate didn't pass it um but you can know there's a phony here because a representative posie in
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:42.160]  florida u.s congressman republican introduced legislation that all presidential candidates
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:48.480]  as of 2012 must show that their natural born status can be qualified about eight other republicans

[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:05.520]  gonna dupe the obama deceptive and stuff it into sleeves with a little info wars dot com stamp on
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:13.200]  it and uh stuff it in all my neighbors mailboxes i just thought of a pun we're going to undoop
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:22.640]  the dupes with the dupes right i'm bro anyway i love austin texas haven't been here in about 25
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:28.480]  years but uh uh everybody was really nice down there used to be a musician till i messed up my
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:34.880]  left arm anyway i still play music anyway i was just gonna i i just wanted to ask like why hasn't
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.920]  anybody arrested this obama puke yet you know i mean it's like he's already using a false
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:45.360]  social security number so i mean like isn't that like identity theft right there you know well
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:52.000]  obama is terrible and a globalist and a teleprompter reading lawyer but he himself is just a puppet
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.960]  and is in free fall now so they'll bring a new puppet in you know why haven't we arrested the heads
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.520]  of the major banks that openly sold the derivatives knowing it was fraud and why did the federal
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:06.160]  government just say oh you didn't engage in any fraud last week and let goldman sacks off you know
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:12.240]  that's the bigger issue i mean obama is just a birdcage dropping uh compared to the bird that's
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.200]  the new world order yeah but you know it's like all those executive orders he's signed since he
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.960]  uh since the uh phony inauguration i mean like all all of that would go away if we could just you
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:29.200]  know like like haul haul them into into jail i mean it's just you know he he was first i mean
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:33.280]  he's not a citizen he's ineligible to be president he does need to be impeached freeman good to hear
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:38.960]  from you um look clearly he was born in kenyan they're covering it up the evidence is overwhelming
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.880]  but what we know 100 percent is he gave up a citizenship to be an indonesian citizen
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:49.840]  that is on record and right there he's illegitimate so done case closed right there uh let's talk to
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.520]  paul in new hampshire paul you're on the air i feel like you're my brother you are my brother my

[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.240]  what i wanted to get to was uh i i i really liked uh cloney sweet movies for a long time
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.880]  in the uh josey wales movie goes into the corruption that was started back during the civil war
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.680]  uh i really i really kind of like the way that they put that across you know you get an idea
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.560]  well no that's what happened for five years or more during reconstruction just bands of criminals
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:33.040]  ran around murdering people in mass we have family cemeteries with tombstones uh with people
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:39.440]  and it says on the tombstone you know killed by uh northern trips after the war raping murdering
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:46.960]  killing it was just so enjoyable right well my my my my my my main concern is where in heck are the
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.400]  white hats in the united states i mean i i would for a long time before i i came involved with you
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:56.560]  i was looking for the the senator or somebody to come up in in the middle of front of tv

[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.960]  the positive and negative of everything the good and evil and i thank god you get the christian
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.160]  values that you expel every day the the fact that every little molecule of every every atom of every
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:24.560]  molecule is a positive and negative uh pulling and tugging on each other a good and evil is a
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.800]  positive and negative pulling on each other this whole world is made up of a positive and negative
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.120]  and for the life of me i can't believe that this has gone on this long and we've got to learn to
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:38.080]  recognize evil and and stand up against it or it will take over god bless you good to hear from you

[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.880]  any video that had been removed for terms of use his whole account going back five years he's had
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.800]  one over five years he's got a director's account a founder account it's even more than a director
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.360]  account it's one of the first people on youtube because again we don't have a director account
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:10.400]  somebody gave us one youtube wouldn't let us have it last year so this fellow uh you know this great
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.200]  guy he uploaded it there's thousands of other versions on youtube and google but it's they're
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.160]  broken up in 10 minute pieces a million here in her thousand there half a million here 400 thousand
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:25.200]  there this one though was the top link when you search the name obama not just the top of the
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:29.760]  trends with my listeners putting that in to make up the top of google trends no no it was on its own
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.560]  the number one thing in the world when you said president obama barack obama or obama
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:39.280]  it knocked us out of the top searches when they did this but today when they put it back up it's
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:44.000]  already number five when you'd say barack obama president obama or obama and you bet it's going
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.120]  to be number one the next week i predict you go in there you click on it in the in the search
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:53.600]  engine put obama deception in you see the link to the full length video you click on that drive
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:00.640]  it to number one max i mean this is crazy that this is going on what's your take on it okay well
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.600]  washington post just came out with their big report they spent two years with this report
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:12.240]  they've got a website called top secret america 850 000 people in america are on the highest
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:18.720]  clearance for secrecy and they cobble together all the companies that are working together
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:24.720]  to create a what they call a fourth branch of government the top secret branch and prominent
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.560]  on the list is google you know google is prominent in top secret america so i'm not surprised
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:37.120]  with the obama deception and the key here is that the the military industrial complex that
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:42.800]  people used to talk about is given away purely to the information industrial complex and so
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:48.160]  obviously info wars that you know you correctly predicted this years ago that information would
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:53.840]  be the battleground and you're fighting the info wars and you've been fighting really against
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:12:02.800]  this clandestine multi hundred billion dollar uh secret uh part of the american government
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:08.640]  and obviously when you put something up like the obama deception and you've got folks who
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.840]  are pushing that up and dominating the search results and skewing the public's perception in
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:20.800]  the very carefully crafted publicity and propaganda to keep people away from thinking
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:25.760]  intelligently about some of the wrongs being done they have to act and they act in the way
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.080]  that we've just seen them act but you're getting so big now that you apparently you got them to
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:35.840]  reverse themselves so kudos to you well i have to tell you max my sixth sense my spidey sense is
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.600]  off the charts this is not fun getting this much attention but i've i've set out to mobilize the
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:46.240]  people to defeat these globalists and what you hit on and what the washington post admits in
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:52.000]  this top secret america two-year report this is them coming out in the open the washington post
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.080]  is the top bill berger paper the grams have been attending for 50 plus years of the owners uh they
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:03.600]  are the ones that are there to whitewash everything and they basically claim they're reporting on it
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:08.080]  but they're really just selling it to people when i read the spp documents that judicial
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.520]  watch suden got three years ago that i talked so much about there is the fortune 100 it's a little
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.240]  over 100 companies the top ones there at this vamp canada meeting and they'd had others and the
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:23.680]  first item of agenda was this is under international corporate government security all of you were
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.400]  sworn to secrecy we need a carbon tax to fund the world government we're going to shut down
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:34.720]  all the industries and uh this corporate body is going to vote and then the head of the mexican
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.920]  us and canadian state departments will implement through the agencies this is the highest security
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.200]  level and it's it's been released and so the corporations have meetings they give orders
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:50.400]  and it is carried out and that's what this is they have they're merging the four branches of the
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.480]  military with google with youtube with yahoo uh with oracle with a handful of others and they
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:01.280]  all admit they're going to take the web all over block everybody else they'll get all the business
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.360]  there's a revolving door between government these corporations so the people in government will
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.360]  then get jobs with them and then go back into government and around and around and this is a
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:16.080]  total global corporate coup over everything with 800 plus thousand private corporate spies
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:21.840]  part of infregard where they are all government agents with license to kill powers according to
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:27.520]  mainstream news two years ago via infregard they are being trained to literally kill employees if
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  they ever try to save the country they are i mean this this is hell world this makes the nazis look
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:40.400]  tame in organizational skill max well i i agree to that major media mainstream media including
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:46.480]  the washington post are totally compromised by what you call the globalist what are now
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:53.920]  being referred to openly as top secret america but i think that occasionally some truth manages to
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:02.400]  get through and if it becomes a big enough problem then move to position b which of course is your
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:08.000]  false flag attack so in other words i don't doubt the credibility of this report but what i think
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:14.640]  it came through uh now the 11th hour apparently insiders that the paper and the media uh wanted
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.480]  to block this publication or wanted to find out more about what was in the publication but now
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:24.480]  it's out it's on the web people are seeing it so now i believe the timing for the false flag is here
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:29.840]  because this is a bombshell report this is going to really send shockwaves throughout washington
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.040]  i want you to elaborate but i want to interject here if one three hundredth of the nation
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:42.160]  and that's counting men women and children so it's even higher if one one three hundredth or one
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:48.560]  three hundredth one out of 300 is a top secret spy and they admittedly for every top secret spy
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:54.160]  they probably have as many as 10 auxiliaries uh i mean you're talking about a stasi level number
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:59.440]  where probably 10 of the people in the country are now spies at one level or another uh for this
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:04.880]  corporate takeover i mean and and they're funding themselves with tax money this is a takeover this
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:10.800]  is a criminal enterprise just like goldman sacks for 30 years but their people in every management
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:16.720]  and regulatory position before they rob the country this has been a long-term strategic plan and of
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  course they were profiting the whole time taking over the infrastructure while they did it i mean
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:28.320]  this is diabolical well the idea of spying and spies going back a few decades it usually gets back
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:36.480]  to corporations seeking intelligence on other corporations and this is really the cia and
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.840]  these organizations that came out of world war two and a lot of the corporate work that was done
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:47.600]  in world war two transformed into this intelligent network of corporate espionage and it's an
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:55.680]  unfair trade advantage yeah and this is but today because of the economy collapsing what we're
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:01.840]  seeing is something different a little different in that folks who want to run the global game
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:11.200]  are trying to come up with new ways to um to to let's say replace the current system where people
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:18.240]  are working for a salary and that salary goes toward consumption we're seeing a migration toward a
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.600]  system where people are going to be working more for credit and these credits are are being controlled
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:29.040]  by the same group of companies like a google or a facebook or these two social networking sites
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:33.680]  you know this is a theme i've explored with you before on your show that currency is being replaced
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:40.000]  with credits and debits and if you go to alex jones info wars dot com you will find your online
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.720]  accounts filled with debits but if you go to uh goldman sacks propaganda dot com you find your
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:53.360]  online account filled with credit and this is a new virtual currency that's coming online and it's
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:59.120]  already a multi-billion dollar industry a company called zinga which makes the virtual
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:05.840]  currency for online games is already a multi-billion dollar industry people are swapping their time
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:11.200]  for virtual credit and effectively working for 30 or 40 cents a day and they're happy to do it
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:17.040]  because they think they're winning something and it's the combination of these online social networks
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:21.680]  the banking system looking for a new form of virtual currency and the casino industry and
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.160]  all their technology to get people to gamble away their lives have come together and so this
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.800]  is part of what we're seeing also they need all this intelligence gathering in order to create
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:38.160]  this incredible new society of people who are basically just on the web but only in in ways
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:44.640]  that are approved by by the google that's right now stop there stop there because this is so key
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.720]  if you read george or george arwell's 1984 and of course he worked for british intelligence
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:55.840]  at bbc in black ops his character is winston smith he said the public won't rise up because of the
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:02.000]  lottery and he talks about how people believing they have a chance to win within that fake paradigm
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.920]  is why they would never rise up because they've been trained to only care about issues of little
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:12.400]  or no significance and fake pop icons that big brother produced and pornography and that's because
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:18.320]  they understood psychology 50 something years ago when he wrote that in 48 now we see the high tech
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:23.040]  version of this where everything is about that chance to win and oh i better not get out of
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.280]  the federal reserve system because then i'll get none of my retirement when you're not going to get
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:32.800]  it to begin with right now you lose all of your chances to win at the lottery so dollar bills are
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:38.960]  replaced with virtual lottery tickets and people will be happy to spend hours their entire life
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.920]  clicking away online for more of these virtual lottery tickets in the hopes that someday day
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:51.520]  two will graduate through the higher level in the game stay there max this is so profound what you
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:59.440]  just talked about they create a false reality of sports movies icons fake credits and you sell
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.480]  your soul for it if the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control you want to listen

[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:26.480]  years if you had had 100 000 in cash and 100 000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both

[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:32.400]  making you pay money to them for my film my film and they are one of them i told you i had a feeling
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:37.360]  they were going to strike back i knew there was something chicanery going on here google never
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:43.120]  when they bring a video down put it back up this is unprecedented max keiser max keiser this is
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.520]  exactly what you're talking about how they use everybody's content make you pay for it this
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:55.040]  is insane max now on the yeah you are on the copyright right yes okay so they're violating
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:59.280]  copyright law they've taken the court immediately well these are people that say they own every
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:04.000]  book in the world they're going to publish it now uh online in charge and give no one money
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.080]  because it's the government they know other corporations don't get away with this there's
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.240]  a reason they let youtube and google be the biggest and again we're on there because that's where the
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.600]  fight's happening i can't believe this all right go to do if you do search video games
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:24.480]  ceo chairs digital tyranny let me read you this little bit he says as more power is taken from
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.800]  the hands of ordinary people and they find themselves working harder and harder for fewer
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:34.400]  and fewer real reward they're seeking escape and a sense of personal achievement by building make
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:41.200]  belief farms and creating pretend empires through fake mafia family because similar to our federal
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:46.880]  reserve note the objects obtained from these games are made out of thin air but without any need for
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:52.720]  physical resources to create them there's no scarcity of reward to be handed out people pay real
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:58.480]  money real defined as credit obtained from labor in the real world for the chance to one up their
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:04.640]  friends in what is ultimately just a game now as the uh the games are just the beginning the future
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:09.520]  the outlines will bring the structure of these games into the real world where our lives will be
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:15.200]  controlled by a similar point system to replace our currency he speaks of the potential for a
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:21.360]  government awarding credits through youtube and through google to people who walk to work take
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:27.840]  public transportation uh they brush their teeth uh so it's total social control through the web
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:34.080]  and then and then it's a controlled web you talked about this five years ago and it's a casino
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.680]  gulag but can you believe that first they go in clearly youtube they've got our account number
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:44.800]  and now we change the passcode they they're the only ones that have it nobody could hack it in this
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.320]  time and they go in and disable all the millions of links around the web where other news websites
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:55.920]  and people have posted it so it's going mega viral and their new sabotage is to make it a rental
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:02.000]  i mean my i cannot believe this man i can folks do not pay for it do not give them a red stinking
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.640]  cent it's still free and a lot of other news websites and places but send the links to

[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:29.120]  then the us hit uh with a doubting of some some kind of surveillance technology so now you've

[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:37.440]  leaving my post they've also disabled police stayed for the rise of fema they've also disabled
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:42.240]  that on all of the search engines when you click on it it tells you better go to youtube to watch
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:49.280]  it they're trying to charge people money when we give this film out for free as a way to keep
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:56.480]  people from watching it this is outrageous ladies and gentlemen don't give youtube or google any
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.360]  money do not pay to watch it they're still free versions but once they do this i've read about
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:05.360]  this they're going to try to knock out all the other free versions that are out there and then
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:09.520]  they'll shut down this version we can now see their plan they do not want you to see the obama
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.040]  deception for a limited time until they run out i've got the obama deception four copies for
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:20.960]  1995 and the hardcover dvd with the expanded extras in the highest quality get it make physical
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:25.360]  copies and hand them out on the street but you can really see how they get everything hooked into
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.960]  google and youtube it's really an nsa front it takes over the web it publishes books doesn't
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:36.800]  care of publishers sue them uh the courts always rule for google they are allowed to do things that
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:41.680]  nobody else is ever allowed to do and you can see the strategic plan i saw this years ago
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.240]  but now it's very clear they are meant to absorb the web in fact that's come out in major news
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:54.320]  headlines that google is to be the web and it is a pentagon operation with the select corporations
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:35:00.960]  it is it is nsa keyword software that google was built on 11 years ago when it first launched out
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:07.360]  of nowhere it is using nsa keyword software that's its base search function and it's to
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:14.560]  understand society it's to track us it's to go out and wage cyber war and that's why our headline
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:21.600]  google spies is so key to make that the number one search term so that people understand this
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:25.520]  and i'll have steve watson let's call him update the fact that they're now trying to charge people
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:31.600]  for it and this is not us if you want to support us by the dvds at info wars dot com you can get
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:38.240]  10 of them for $39.95 that's about four bucks a piece you can get four of them for $19.95
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:45.280]  at info wars dot com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 we're going into overdrive in the
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.400]  next hour it'll be live it'll be on the network the stations all of it but right now we're talking
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:53.440]  to max kaiser then we're gonna start going to your phone calls i want to get in some other
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:59.360]  financial news but max has agreed to stay with us 30 minutes to the next hour max this is insane i
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:06.320]  mean what's your breakdown of what we see happening well first of all i just want to point out that
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:13.920]  the max kaiser youtube channel on youtube has a very paltry 10 000 subscribers the next time
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.960]  i come on your show alex if that number's not a 20 000 i'm going to recite the entire obama
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:28.720]  deception in sanskrit uh for a captive audience uh and make them listen to me do it i mean this is
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.480]  this is pitiful i only have 10 000 subscribers it's gotta be at least 20 000 subscribers but
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:39.520]  anyway let's continue talking about the financial news well no going back to this obama situation
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:44.320]  i don't think people realize how big this is and that we're literally battling with youtube and
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:50.080]  google in real time how arrogant are they to take it down then put it back up and i said i smell a rat
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:54.000]  i think they're gonna counter strike and their way of doing it is to disable it all over the web
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.400]  except for youtube and then you go there and they want money well i think what we're seeing also is
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:07.040]  the inter interplay between how computers are programmed to do different things and i think
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:12.240]  that certainly on wall street the computers are programmed it's called program trading and they
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:17.440]  can program computers to do all kinds of market manipulation and this is how most of wall street
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:22.800]  makes their money these days they simply program computers to steal and uh this is exactly what
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:28.560]  they do but computers are also programmed to sniff out like you say that the obama deception is
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:34.400]  rising quickly on the trend list that in fact it was uh trending higher than it had been recently
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.120]  well the computers see that and they make the calculations and they see that the words associated
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:45.120]  with obama and then the deception is untenable so then the computer simply kick in and start to
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:50.720]  delete videos or change videos and they figure they can always mop up the legal mess later
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.920]  but the computers have dominion the computers run the show they will change the programming
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.160]  tomorrow or the next day and what we see today is that they're trying to catch up with what's
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:05.600]  going on in your situation you've basically broken the computers for today just like when
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:10.080]  you uh flood a website with too much traffic it goes crazy and they can't catch up but they will
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:15.600]  learn more next time we've got to learn more next time this is humans interfacing with machines
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:21.920]  to battle the artificial intelligence of the nsa well it's info wars and so what you're you are
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.560]  winning a battle here you're winning a battle in the info wars and i think that to build on the
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:33.280]  success uh there's got to be more strategies and more tactics based on the fact that the
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:38.960]  current propaganda wars are made entirely of information and as this report called top secret
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:43.920]  america points out the industrials military industrial complex doesn't really care so much
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:49.280]  about the hardware anymore the planes the bomb the tanks they're focused now all of their budget
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:55.520]  is focused on information technology and information wars and propaganda wars and so clearly uh
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:00.640]  moving into this new century if you look at your site i mean your site is aggregating huge
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:05.440]  popularity it's referenced now by the biggest sites i mean i see you reference on drug report
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:11.680]  all the time i even see you i talked about on hoffington post which is you know perceptibly
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:16.800]  on the other side of the political aisle but you're becoming a force to be reckoned with so
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:25.040]  the computers are have isolated you and are trying to combat you with algorithms and programs to try
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:31.680]  to over over over over over read you overwrite you with additional information and we see the
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:36.160]  same thing it's interesting because we see the exact same thing on on the wall street the flash
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.600]  crash of may six the one thousand point drop that was a computer glitch you know the computers are
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:46.640]  programmed to steal money slowly not in one thousand point grabs you know when i was working on
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:52.880]  a wall street we had a saying that went like this we used to say shear don't slaughter and what that
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.760]  means is you take a little bit from your clients every single day but don't kill your clients
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.720]  because you want to keep them alive long enough to shear them the next day and this is exactly
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:06.640]  the way we're going to talk about that more in a moment max is going to be with us into the next
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.280]  hour but kenneth webb runs the director channel and people get confused he's not the director
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:14.960]  of the obama deception though he's directed his own great films like debunk this
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:21.120]  but he's a guy who has an account that can upload more than 10 minute chunks so he uploaded the
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:26.640]  number one version of the obama deception back in march of last year it's had 6.5 million views
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:31.360]  it was surging and growing even faster it was somebody hacked in deleted it and he's i guess
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:38.960]  out on the road because the cell phone's cutting out kenneth uh uh they are in there now inside
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:44.960]  making people pay to see the obama deception on all our computers uh in the office uh this is
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:48.960]  outrageous you you you haven't implemented that because i've i've i haven't talked to you yet
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:55.280]  but i know google has to offer that and we're not asking for it so so i mean this is amazing yeah
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.480]  it was it was actually and how's it going actually um i was just throwing and i've seen some people
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:06.800]  from the uk saying that they were unable to access the video so i went in to see what the problem was
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:14.560]  was and um it it had some kind of rental thing on all it specifically all three of those videos
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:21.200]  that were taken down they were all for rent and you know it wasn't like that you know an hour ago
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:28.000]  and then all of a sudden it's like that i don't know it's kind of crazy it's mind boggling because
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:35.520]  they you know when they reinstated those three videos they reinstated videos that have been down
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:42.400]  for years now the ones they took down um the first few videos they took down that i actually put up
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.680]  were from military dot com and they you know they said you know copyright infringed they took it down
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.480]  and everything and those were backed up so i had to get to all the videos i was about and i called
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:57.280]  you this morning and i said i believe that's a false flag by putting videos up to get more strikes
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:02.480]  against your account and now they've thrown this pay thing on it and and the thousands of sites
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:06.960]  that's conservative that it's linked to around the web where people embed the video to obama
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:11.360]  deception police state for the rise of fema and your film debunk this which is about government
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:16.480]  sponsored terror and fluoride and other issues now they're trying to make you pay for those this is
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.400]  i guess you've got to turn google ads off i think that's how they're able to claim they can do this
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:28.880]  can you turn that off oh yeah i could turn that off actually when i went in they had added the whole
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:33.920]  rentable button and this is called sluice stuff when they when they reinstated all these videos
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:40.320]  they put all this new stuff up i don't even know where that came from and you know i went through
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:47.840]  and i found the the rentable part where it says rentable videos which is new to me and i disabled
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:53.920]  them and then what it did is took all of those videos and it made them private so i had to go
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:43:00.720]  back in to the actual video and edit that and make them uh not private anymore for everybody
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:06.160]  and if they're back up now kenneth kenneth this could be another hack too probably an insider
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:14.000]  change your passcode instantly i mean undelay let let change it now change it now don't you agree
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.240]  oh definitely definitely already done how it's already done well don't lose that passcode my
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:25.600]  god this is getting insane stay there kenneth well uh max keiser's in the wings uh now we've
[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:31.280]  got more intel from the man that runs the channel uh kenneth web this does sound like an automatic
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:36.480]  computer system or that somebody's using those systems uh to to keep this from being all over the
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:42.960]  web uh max keiser what's your take well you're heading into the november election the obama
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:48.640]  team is nervous because their programs have been a failure because for the very reasons that you
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:56.240]  talk about in your film the obama deception and so um it's a simple conversation with the webmasters
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:03.360]  at google uh try to do what you can to shape the information and to shape these words so that we
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:08.640]  can move beyond the idea that obama and the obama deception so the computers do all the heavy
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:13.680]  listing and occasionally when there's a traffic anomaly like you're talking about leading up to
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:20.240]  this the catastrophe um you know the computers show their hand as being basically running the show
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.440]  let me ask you this question uh max because i mean max invented the hollywood stock exchange system
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:32.160]  that they admittedly use in many modern stock exchange computer systems now uh looking at this
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:36.560]  do you think obama and his people like the fact that when you typed his name in in the last month
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:41.360]  the top link was this link to this particular version of the obama deception there's no way
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:47.280]  going into an election that that that they wanted when somebody searched the name obama in any variation
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:53.680]  it was my film i mean clearly they have shown their hand by doing this because the attention span of
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:45:01.520]  them the average american is so short that even just the one second um kind of connection of obama
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:08.560]  with the word deception is a problem because people in their subconscious mind as equate obama
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:14.320]  with deception and if this is a huge result of searching obama and you get deception whether
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.840]  you even consciously admitted or not or recognize it when you go to the voting booth you equate obama
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:25.760]  with deception this is all part of the propaganda that was invented by uh you know the national
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:31.040]  socialist of germany and then picked up by um the brand eyes in in this country when they started
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:36.720]  the public relations firm uh back after world war two and this is what's used and understood
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:43.040]  is that the it's the Freudian um psychology that unconsciously people see i didn't name it that
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:48.240]  out of manipulation i just try to tell the truth and i know he's deceiving and i know that obama
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:54.720]  is a front and it is and himself is a deception you know the whole persona of obama is a manufactured
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:02.160]  madison avenue system and so if you just organically tell the truth it trumps all their lies and spin
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:07.440]  and manipulation let's go back to kenneth webb yeah and then come back to you keiser kenneth i mean
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:13.280]  what was it like for you to find out saturday that they had taken this video down oh it's horrible
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:21.280]  it was horrible i i got really got sick at the stomach um you know my mom you know pretty pretty
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:26.800]  simple said that you know if if if business happened i mean you're actually you know that you guys are
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:33.120]  really doing something so there was a good side to it and i had to focus on that and then trying to
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:39.280]  you know get it back up and everything and um but i know i know we're stomping on some toes there's no
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:44.720]  doubt about it you know they've they've hacked my website by with his news dot org uh we've had
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:51.040]  problems with these these videos uh a couple of times we've had people actually hacked the youtube
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:56.640]  page for obama deception putting all kinds of coding and it was having an effect on the page
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:04.320]  that happened for like a day something about a month ago um and it's just crazy it's crazy but
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:08.880]  like i said i believe that you know we're really having an effect else why would they even mess
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:15.040]  around with anything like that i mean even if it's small time hackers or big time hackers
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:20.000]  they're they're definitely feeling it yeah but small time hackers can't shut it down all over the
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.640]  web and make people pay for it only google and youtube can do it and i say they're the number one
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:30.240]  prime suspects uh in all of this but notice if we would have just laid down to this they would have
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:36.240]  won but by fighting back now we have an even bigger victory and we show people these crooks
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:42.000]  aren't invincible and so now it's an even bigger disaster for them and this is all i mean this is
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:47.760]  the biggest thing we've ever done uh our response to this our resistance to them the idea to promote
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:53.600]  the obama deception last week this has turned into the biggest event of anything i've ever done
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:58.160]  and it's only growing faster i'm telling you folks i feel like we've got lightning in a bottle here
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.080]  i think they've miscalculated i think they're going to go ahead and just take it down again
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:05.840]  i believe that they've done this because i've read their rules to start purging the thousands of
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.800]  other copies on youtube and other places claiming it's theirs because when they uh i've written they
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:15.200]  enable this rental thing they don't allow other versions i believe they're about to start purging
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:20.160]  it so folks you better spread the word about the obama deception now can the stay there kaiser your
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:25.680]  your take on this we're trying to say something well everybody who has a blog in bed in the header
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:31.040]  of their blog obama equals deception you know you then you're fighting info wars you don't even have
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:36.800]  to link to the film or or uh you can just have that link in the heading of your blog so that with
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.840]  the search search engines will equate obama with deception remember obama won because if you did
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:47.680]  a search in 2008 for the word hope you would get results obama america obama and that's why he's
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:53.200]  the president of the united states he essentially commandeered the word hope okay now you've equated
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:58.640]  obama with deception let's keep pushing that theme if you keep pushing that theme and you uh
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:03.280]  did institute a major political overturn in the next six to seven months you will have accomplished
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:07.840]  a major battle in the info wars and i guess they're propagandist and they recognize this
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.320]  i mean max i'm just a regular guy who just swings with the truth and i guess it trumps them over
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:17.120]  and over again but the more i think about it it was the top link obama deception they don't like
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:21.840]  that this was this is this is important they wouldn't have censored this and revealed themselves
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.000]  unless they knew it was important well what is it washington post just released today and top
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:32.800]  secret america there's 800 000 people in a fourth branch of government in the united states who are
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:38.800]  fighting the info wars who have allegiances with the information technology firms in america including
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:44.880]  google and this is now out in the washington post this isn't this is now it's up but the war is on
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:50.080]  and the battle lines have been drawn they this tyranny is here well i agree i agree we've seen
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:56.400]  massive increases 73 000 blogs taken down last week no court order no nothing just department
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:59.920]  just ordered it saying they didn't like their speech because they were talking about sharing
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:05.680]  files and talking about stuff online now your speech is illegal we're seeing other sites being
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:10.400]  hacked they've they've tried to take down the alex jones channel with hacks last week and and and
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:14.960]  dav who runs it hadn't even told me that when i called him saturday said yeah they're trying it here too
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:20.880]  so it looks like the green light was given in the last week or two max to launch a major cyber
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.840]  attack against us and everybody else for that matter well the program the computer's a program
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:32.080]  and your film hit the traffic anomaly it started to go in the direction that the computers couldn't
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:39.440]  figure out why because it didn't fit into any of their template logic and so they shut down or
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:43.680]  dismantle their hacked or took it offline and this is what their program stay there stay there
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:48.000]  because that's what obama says i've got to shut the web down to save it they mean their globalist
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:54.240]  web they always speak in you know triple meanings and so you you've got to know their fail safes
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:58.640]  built in to shut down things on the web when everything goes to hell in a handbasket this is a

[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:24.720]  and your phone calls going into the next hour and overdrive max keiser dot com his great youtube channel
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:30.000]  stunning information max keiser dot com max do you think my analysis is accurate or do you have
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:37.200]  anything to add to that i wouldn't say it's a computer glitch um in other words um it's like
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:43.920]  you were at the playing 21 in las vegas and you started to win too many ants the eye in the sky
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:49.440]  picks it up and then you get a visit from the pit boss so there's no way you can beat the house
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:56.480]  now your video started to impinge on obama's game and their ability to control the propaganda wars
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:00.560]  and the interval wars so you're getting a visit from the equivalent the equivalent of the pit
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:05.680]  boss in the virtual world they need to remove you from the table because you're winning too many
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.440]  ants and and this computer picks it up that's why i call the casino gulag because a lot of
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:16.560]  technology used to keep people in line is the same as the casino they know how to incentivize you
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:21.920]  to keep you gambling but they know how to discipline you from winning too much and they also keep you
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:27.760]  unemployed and low wages so you're there in the gulag so you alex john we're winning too many
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:32.240]  views with this video and you got a visit from the virtual pit boss to have to shut you down
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.880]  because you're winning too many hands it's a casino gulag and now we're pointing out that
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:43.040]  the house is fixed so they're backing off because it's revealing who they really are well it's not
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:51.360]  necessarily fixed per se it's that human uh the human being is easily manipulated and they manipulate
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:56.800]  the the the humans you see the point of the half starting a country like america to begin with was
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:03.360]  to try to tease out the greatest part of humanity to create something that's better and bigger than
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:09.200]  the sum of this part but now you've got bankers in control they're breaking it down so it's less
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:13.920]  than the sum of its part and it's just a bunch of greedy people trying to win off of each other
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:19.840]  in a less than zero outcome and the bankers can set the rules so they game everything and they get
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:26.000]  the world out of fiat currency they just make up out of nothing as thomas jefferson said they were
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.240]  facing it then he said if you let private banks issue currency and credit uh your children will
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:35.440]  wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered it doesn't have to be rigged it just
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:41.520]  has to be marginally uh successful because and get the majority of people to give up their
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:46.960]  self-respect and you end up with a casino gulag and you you've now had a direct interaction with
[02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:50.560]  the pit boss in the virtual world who's come over to you and said sorry you're winning too many
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.600]  hands you're getting too many views you're co-opting the word uh obama which needs to be associated
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:01.680]  only with the word hope we cannot tolerate the word obama to be associated with the word deception
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:06.960]  that's intolerable it cannot happen and we'll do whatever it takes we'll we'll stick our computer
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:11.600]  algorithms on you they'll do all the dirty work and i'm sorry but that's just the way it is you
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:17.680]  have to leave the casino now i'm so glad we had max keiser on today because he just brought out
