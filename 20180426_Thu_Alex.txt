[00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:23.539]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.741]  Well, we've got a very special broadcast for you lined up today.
[00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:35.948]  We're going to have Ben Garrison, the most prolific popular political cartoonist of the last decade, in studio along with the most prolific
[00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:53.228]  Dangerous to the establishment, street artists, SABO, both in studio, because the censorship massively intensifies online against libertarians, nationalists, populists, conservatives, and just free thinkers, period.
[00:00:53.228 --> 00:01:00.090]  We have to hit the streets now, everybody, myself included, with street art.
[00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.671]  And that means
[00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:11.359]  I want to develop a plan to try to have art that people can print off in HD for free, print off at Kinko's, print off on their own printer, and then put up around town.
[00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:24.462]  Or we can post other people's activist art, but also have a plan to then sell nice prints of the art to support the artist, and then hang that up in your shops, your businesses, as kind of a free-thinking outpost.
[00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:29.943]  So they're going to be with us in studio, coming up in the second hour, Sabo of Unsavory
[00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:32.312]  Let's put that back up on screen.
[00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:39.978]  Acebo of Unsavory Agents, and of course Ben Garrison of Ben Garrison Graphics.
[00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:41.099]  So that is going to be in studio.
[00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.200]  Very, very excited about that.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.421]  They're here until Saturday.
[00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.082]  I want to go out and shoot some videos with them on the street.
[00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.304]  I want to talk about some plans.
[00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:54.550]  Not to even centralize something, but just to try to really sell the public on this being the next level of resistance, which it clearly is.
[00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.154]  We've got to fight for web freedom, fight to break up the monopolies, fight online harder than ever.
[00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:04.008]  But we've got to expand out everywhere else we can as well onto the actual streets.
[00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:05.289]  The globals are so scared of that.
[00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.052]  Okay, that said, let's just go through these headlines.
[00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:14.935]  Judge bars conservatives from any business they want.
[00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:15.955]  That's basically what's happening.
[00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:20.238]  Judge bars are allowed to throw out Trump supporters.
[00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:25.661]  White House Dr. Ronny Jackson withdraws as Trump nominee to head the Veterans Affairs Department.
[00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:31.334]  We had the number one story in the country yesterday on DreadReport.com.
[00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:32.555]  Kanye doubles down.
[00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:34.916]  Mob can't make me not love Trump.
[00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.056]  We're going to get into that.
[00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:40.597]  500 million Africans could invade Europe under ISIS plan.
[00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:44.439]  Dan Lyman for Infowars Europe.
[00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.659]  That's at NewsWars.com.
[00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.940]  And this ties into The Guardian.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.261]  ISIS trying to foment a wave of migrants to Europe, says U.N.
[00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:51.861]  official.
[00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:52.501]  But the U.N.'
[00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.521]  's working with them.
[00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:54.742]  The rest of the story is coming up.
[00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:57.099]  Just like the same U.N.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:08.107]  refugee program with George Soros, is honchoing, quarterbacking, commanding, Central American asylum-seeking caravan set to arrive in California by Friday.
[00:03:10.185 --> 00:03:11.425]  Bloodbath in Cancun.
[00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.086]  Five dead.
[00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:12.946]  It's almost every day now.
[00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:13.986]  I like Cancun.
[00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.087]  Too bad you really can't go there now.
[00:03:15.087 --> 00:03:15.967]  It's too dangerous.
[00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:21.949]  Are found in car at the vacation hotspot, a drug cartel, or spills on the beaches of the Mexican resort town.
[00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:22.829]  And it gets worse than that.
[00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:30.091]  They're having deaths every week now in that area, and many other areas of Mexico for that matter, where they drug you.
[00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:37.234]  So they can rob you, but, you know, they drug your drink, but then it ends up killing a lot of people, including children.
[00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:38.314]  They just drug the whole family.
[00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:40.081]  Very, very sad.
[00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:46.262]  German police invited to erotic bondage session after responding to complaint are invited to join in.
[00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:47.622]  That's DW.com.
[00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:49.183]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:54.384]  74-year-old Swedish woman prosecuted for criticizing mass migration.
[00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:58.184]  That ties in to how the UN is allied with the Islamicist.
[00:03:58.184 --> 00:04:01.125]  Pig brains are kept alive without a body for the first time, we're told.
[00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.245]  It's all 30-year-old technology.
[00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:08.866]  And are implanted human brains in pigs, pig brains in human bodies, and of course human brains in mice.
[00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:17.639]  And they're creating human-animal hybrids for 30-plus years in the literature, but they don't want you to know that until the last month.
[00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.180]  Suddenly, they're announcing it everywhere.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.501]  But I don't get any calls saying, oh, we're sorry, Alex.
[00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:23.942]  You'll tell everybody this first.
[00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:26.002]  No, they just say, no, you're dangerous.
[00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:26.743]  You'll be taken off air.
[00:04:27.864 --> 00:04:31.669]  Macron says he thinks Trump will pull out of Iran nuclear deal.
[00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.572]  And I think the evidence is there.
[00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:41.584]  The supreme Iranian dictator threatens Trump and Iran's naval commander threatens to sink US ships, create catastrophic situation if Trump kills the deal.
[00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:46.081]  Iran is out of control.
[00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:48.183]  We will return on the other side.
[00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:54.149]  University offers cry closets for stressed out snowflakes with stuffed animals inside.
[00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:55.171]  Yes, I'm not joking.
[00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:57.833]  They're teaching mental illness and arrested development.
[00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:58.594]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.594 --> 00:04:58.975]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:04.611]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:12.717]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:18.001]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.523]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:24.746]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:27.188]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:35.111]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:43.174]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:05:43.174 --> 00:05:50.357]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:05:50.357 --> 00:05:51.817]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:53.638]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.922]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:05:57.922 --> 00:06:06.490]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:14.878]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:17.700]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:26.769]  Alex Jones!
[00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:27.429]  Scum!
[00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:31.311]  Russian scum!
[00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:36.153]  The Taurus comes to mind.
[00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:42.696]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:44.237]  I will not let you down.
[00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.038]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:53.987]  Okay, last time.
[00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.267]  This is cell phone radiation.
[00:06:56.267 --> 00:07:00.169]  This is your brain on cell phone and wireless radiation.
[00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.990]  Any questions?
[00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.532]  This message is brought to you by InfoWars.com in the hopes that if you're gonna fry your brain and body with radiation, that's your business.
[00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:10.613]  But for God's sake, let's protect our children.
[00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:25.620]  The United States tested a powerful ICBM, intercontinental ballistic missile, ahead of negotiations for Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:35.623]  The president of South Korea is set to meet in the next week with the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, as well, showing major signs that we're going to get a huge...
[00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:40.669]  Real peace deal and an end to the Korean War after 60 plus years.
[00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.632]  So that is a big deal.
[00:07:42.632 --> 00:07:43.974]  Let's pray for that.
[00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:47.539]  The Iranian dictator, supreme leader.
[00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:53.550]  Rouhani insults Trump as Iran nuclear deal hangs in the balance.
[00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.412]  Meanwhile, Iranian naval commander threatens to sink U.S.
[00:07:56.412 --> 00:08:00.516]  ships to create catastrophic situation if Trump kills deal.
[00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:04.679]  That video and the article is up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:08.222]  But again, South Korea's Moon set to meet North Korea's Kim at border summit.
[00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.823]  That is good news.
[00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:14.507]  With all that other bad news, Iran is completely out of control.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:27.448]  I don't want a war with Iran, but their behavior, their rhetoric, what they do to our ships there in the Persian Gulf is really asking for it.
[00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:35.514]  They're asking for another Operation Praying Mantis when their whole major fleet got blown up.
[00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:38.776]  All their ships that could be blue water went to the bottom.
[00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:41.638]  Operation Praying Mantis.
[00:08:41.638 --> 00:08:43.500]  So they're looking for that.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.121]  They might be looking in the right spot.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.781]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:51.643]  We've got important things going on here in America.
[00:08:51.643 --> 00:08:57.067]  Judge says businesses are allowed to throw out Trump supporters.
[00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:02.071]  They said there's no protection for political views.
[00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:09.716]  Now, if you're a gay couple and somebody doesn't want to bake your cake, well, you shouldn't just go somewhere else.
[00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:10.357]  No, you should get $500,000.
[00:09:10.357 --> 00:09:10.717]  But if you're a
[00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.451]  Conservative?
[00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:20.633]  Well, there's no protections on politics.
[00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:20.933]  Really?
[00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:25.175]  Hmm, okay.
[00:09:25.175 --> 00:09:41.666]  And that's how political correctness works, is that you've got all these protected groups that are, quote, protected, so you can turn them into a victim mentality and get them in your little cult with the supposed fringe benefits of being in a group.
[00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:48.624]  But if you're a white male or a white gay guy or whatever, well, you need not apply.
[00:09:48.624 --> 00:10:05.708]  Just like Milo in that bar over the weekend, a gay libertarian conservative who's Jewish and has nothing to do with Nazis, except leftist groups were reportedly paid to have people howl Hitler and stuff and get that on tape, and that's admitted trolling.
[00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:07.449]  Or troll groups have trolled him.
[00:10:09.948 --> 00:10:20.592]  And he's there paying his bill.
[00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:30.776]  And about, I don't know, a dozen or so people chant, Nazi scum get out.
[00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:32.137]  Yay!
[00:10:32.137 --> 00:10:38.059]  We lied about somebody and we violated their right to come eat at a lunch counter, like they were black people.
[00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:40.109]  In the 50s.
[00:10:40.109 --> 00:10:41.711]  Or the 40s.
[00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:43.092]  So authoritarian.
[00:10:43.092 --> 00:10:45.154]  The very Nazi-like behavior they're talking about.
[00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:48.517]  But let me just get back into the larger news here.
[00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:50.479]  We've got that article.
[00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:58.546]  White House doctor Ronny Jackson withdraws as Trump's nominee to head Veterans Affairs Department.
[00:10:58.546 --> 00:10:59.507]  He worked for Obama.
[00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:13.505]  For eight years in the White House, was friends with everybody, is nonpartisan, and then they had more than 20 Democrats go without substantiation, claim he got drunk, had a fender bender with no evidence.
[00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:18.030]  And so he's had to step down from that.
[00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.575]  When Trump's friends with him, the guys have decorated combat medic.
[00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:26.106]  Who actually cares about the troops?
[00:11:26.106 --> 00:11:29.569]  We've had plenty of bureaucrats and plenty of hospital heads doing a horrible job.
[00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:46.404]  You know, the scandal is Obama let IBM have the Watson computers over the VA with secret death lists that came out six years ago, where the computers decided, just like they do at the National Health Service in England, who got health care and who didn't.
[00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:47.445]  Well, Trump's killed that.
[00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:55.839]  He's trying to fix it, but many VAs, even a year later, will not put up the President's photo.
[00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:00.122]  They're in total bureaucratic mutiny.
[00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:12.692]  And they make people wait for simple surgeries that are 100% operable, certain cancers, you name it, that are 100%, 98%, but you don't get the surgery because they don't feel like it.
[00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:16.345]  And they put you in a database of people not to treat.
[00:12:16.345 --> 00:12:18.346]  It's well known.
[00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:36.496]  And when the hack of the Office of Personnel Management files 20 million veterans and intelligence operatives and their spouses and their connections, the left all over has access to that database and they punch into it and they decide.
[00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:39.378]  The Communist Chinese that run UT publicly, they have that database.
[00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:48.046]  And there's investigations going on they know full well about, they don't even care, where they run you through that database and they have your secret data and they decide.
[00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:53.871]  They've been given the keys to the entire NSA file on you and your family.
[00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:55.512]  If you're in the government.
[00:12:55.512 --> 00:12:57.174]  How do you like that?
[00:12:57.174 --> 00:12:59.276]  That's total penetration!
[00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:06.562]  Trump is just death throes of this country, trying to battle back from final destruction.
[00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:09.986]  And all the programmed leftists and people are like, NO!
[00:13:09.986 --> 00:13:12.528]  AMERICA'S GOING DOWN!
[00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:13.850]  We hate flyover country!
[00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.211]  We hate bitter clingers!
[00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.934]  We hate capitalism!
[00:13:17.934 --> 00:13:20.056]  There's an excellent article if I have time to get into it.
[00:13:21.883 --> 00:13:38.749]  About how Coachella and all these big giant festivals are giant corporate brainwashing scams where people pose in front of signs like Hollywood in front of designer brands and people take photos of themselves imagining that they're celebrities and how everything is total corporate fascism.
[00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:45.412]  But the average millennial question there in a survey said, I'm a communist or a socialist, 53%.
[00:13:45.412 --> 00:13:50.974]  I don't like capitalism when it is the most disgusting, twisted, consumerist,
[00:13:51.574 --> 00:13:58.358]  Empty, mindless, hellish, 110 degrees drug orgy.
[00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:05.042]  Spoiled brats in designer clothes pretending they're Hollywood stars.
[00:14:05.042 --> 00:14:09.084]  There's the headline, the online, the outline.
[00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:14.288]  Music festivals are the corporate dystopia we deserve.
[00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:18.390]  But they identify as communist with smartphones, $200 skinny jeans,
[00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.957]  Doing the duck lips.
[00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:24.337]  Doing selfies.
[00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:27.258]  And wearing gold chains.
[00:14:27.258 --> 00:14:29.058]  And taking molly.
[00:14:29.058 --> 00:14:31.379]  And having sex orgies.
[00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:33.919]  You think that's going on in North Korea?
[00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:37.600]  They execute homosexuals in China and North Korea.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.701]  Oh, but you all wear mouse shirts and think it's sexy and cool.
[00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:42.962]  Idiots.
[00:14:42.962 --> 00:14:47.483]  Your little Islamic buddies throw you off roofs and cut your genitals off.
[00:14:47.483 --> 00:14:48.143]  But you like it.
[00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:52.525]  Because you think of it as millennials as getting back at daddy.
[00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:54.587]  Daddy worked 60 hours a week.
[00:14:54.587 --> 00:14:56.208]  Daddy played golf.
[00:14:56.208 --> 00:15:03.993]  Daddy was nice and spoiled you, and you're cucked now, and you want somebody like all these liberal women that are into bondage.
[00:15:03.993 --> 00:15:11.598]  Statistically, liberal women are three times more likely, I saw a study last week, to be into bondage, to be into being pimped.
[00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:17.162]  They want a man to slap them, maybe loosen the teeth a bit, maybe give them a taste of blood in their mouth.
[00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:19.463]  They like their Islamic husbands.
[00:15:19.463 --> 00:15:20.063]  Oh, liberal.
[00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:21.844]  In fact, I forgot to cover it on Monday.
[00:15:21.844 --> 00:15:27.687]  Swedish women go to the refugee centers saying they want to prove they're not racist.
[00:15:27.687 --> 00:15:29.208]  The woman actually said this.
[00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:33.510]  The headline was, Swedish woman went to prove she wasn't racist, was anally gang-raped.
[00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.291]  And then she said, I'm still not mad at them.
[00:15:36.898 --> 00:15:37.558]  Oh, yes.
[00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:38.419]  Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:39.419]  In fact, it was in Sweden.
[00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:40.699]  It was in Stockholm.
[00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:44.861]  Funny, it's Stockholm Syndrome in Stockholm, where it got its name.
[00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.021]  I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:15:46.021 --> 00:15:46.961]  I'm digressing.
[00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:50.182]  It's all coming up today.
[00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:55.844]  And 500 million Africans are set to invade Europe under UN plan.
[00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:56.885]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:02.024]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[00:16:37.918 --> 00:16:38.738]  You have been lied to.
[00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:02.848]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[00:17:02.848 --> 00:17:05.530]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.874]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:16.558]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:20.000]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:39.098]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[00:17:39.098 --> 00:17:47.144]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.230]  Woo!
[00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.271]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:39.019]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:47.066]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:52.029]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:05.636]  I'm good.
[00:19:23.275 --> 00:19:32.620]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:40.464]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:46.868]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:19:47.128 --> 00:19:48.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:25.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, right here on the InfoWars Network.
[00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:27.207]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:27.207 --> 00:20:29.247]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:29.247 --> 00:20:45.452]  By the way, as we speak, diamonds and silk, or diamond and silk, to frequent guests of this broadcast, ladies that have reached hundreds of millions of people on YouTube alone, who helped get Trump elected, who are funny, who are smart, who are witty, but very sweet, very, very nice, very, very positive.
[00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:46.513]  Because, hey, we can even protect
[00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:49.817]  Unpositive or nasty speech.
[00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:53.641]  An unpopular speech, but their speech was just two sweet, smart ladies.
[00:20:53.641 --> 00:20:55.663]  Two black ladies.
[00:20:55.663 --> 00:20:56.704]  They're on Capitol Hill.
[00:20:56.704 --> 00:20:58.025]  We can punch up YouTube if you want.
[00:20:58.025 --> 00:20:59.667]  It's got a live stream on it.
[00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:04.812]  Today, Congress investigates whether social media hates conservatives.
[00:21:04.812 --> 00:21:07.635]  The Verge is reporting.
[00:21:08.629 --> 00:21:11.153]  And what an interesting question.
[00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:13.997]  Today, Congress investigates, is the sky blue?
[00:21:13.997 --> 00:21:16.461]  Do ducks quack?
[00:21:16.461 --> 00:21:19.206]  Do babies cry?
[00:21:19.206 --> 00:21:21.669]  I mean, this is ra-donkulous.
[00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:24.826]  It is total war.
[00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:28.307]  The head of Twitter says, we have a revolution against conservatives.
[00:21:28.307 --> 00:21:29.368]  We're censoring them.
[00:21:29.368 --> 00:21:30.808]  We're going to destroy them.
[00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:31.888]  That's a quote.
[00:21:31.888 --> 00:21:39.251]  We have all the internal videos of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter saying, our main job is to stop Alex Jones.
[00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:45.912]  We have congressional hearings from four months ago with Congressman Quigley going, Paul Watson of Infowars was number one at lunch.
[00:21:45.912 --> 00:21:48.693]  They said, sir, we saw it and stopped it.
[00:21:48.693 --> 00:21:51.054]  The CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google.
[00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.810]  Yes, sir!
[00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.770]  We saw it!
[00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.691]  We stopped him and it's fake news!
[00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:57.531]  It was that a Muslim did a truck attack!
[00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:00.472]  It was confirmed!
[00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:02.972]  We'll stop them from being number one, sir!
[00:22:02.972 --> 00:22:04.652]  Yes, sir!
[00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:12.594]  So now Congress is having hearings if bears go to the bathroom in the woods.
[00:22:12.594 --> 00:22:14.494]  In fact, McBrain made a little 10-second promo of that.
[00:22:14.494 --> 00:22:15.435]  I've never seen it on the show.
[00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.195]  Can we?
[00:22:16.195 --> 00:22:17.115]  I want to get McBrain's promo.
[00:22:17.115 --> 00:22:18.855]  I want to come back with that promo.
[00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:21.416]  It's just that it's a non-audible.
[00:22:21.416 --> 00:22:21.936]  It's video.
[00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:25.067]  It just talks about our Democrats tyrants.
[00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:26.669]  We'll do bears, you know.
[00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:30.672]  Do Democrats try to steal elections and have dead people vote?
[00:22:30.672 --> 00:22:32.873]  Do bears go potty in the woods?
[00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:37.977]  But let's go to, let's go to the committee hearing right now with Diamond and Silk.
[00:22:37.977 --> 00:22:39.258]  Here it is.
[00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:42.561]  Being targeted and censored on social media platforms.
[00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:57.995]  Facebook along with other social media sites have taken aggressive actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves by deliberately restricting and weaponizing our page with algorithms that censor and suppress our free speech.
[00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:20.566]  These biased algorithms are tactics designed to pick up on key words, thus telling the pages how to behave in ways that repress and stifle express ideas, including shadowbanding, which block our content from being seen by our followers while depriving our brand through the demonetization of our videos.
[00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:26.228]  Followers stopped receiving notification when we posted videos and content.
[00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:30.269]  Followers was also mysteriously unlike from our page.
[00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:44.853]  Subtle and slowly, Facebook used one mechanism at a time to diminish our reach by restricting our page so that our 1.2 million followers would not see our content, thus silencing our conservative voices.
[00:23:44.853 --> 00:23:49.275]  When we reached out to Facebook for an explanation, they gave us the runaround.
[00:23:50.367 --> 00:24:00.774]  Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress and stated that the most important thing he cared about was making sure no one interferes in the 2018 elections.
[00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:17.805]  But after doing our research, we wondered if Mark Zuckerberg was using Facebook to interfere in the 2018 elections by labeling users' accounts as either liberal, very liberal, moderate, conservative... Well, he admitted he was for the Democrats.
[00:24:17.805 --> 00:24:18.546]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:38.068]  So, if I'm labeled as very liberal without the option to edit it, update, and correct the settings, then algorithms are already put in place which allows advertisers... They label you just like the Nazis put stars on Jews in pink.
[00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:39.910]  Triangles on gage.
[00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.110]  This is super dangerous, but they know that.
[00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.573]  You can search engine Wikileaks, where Obama and Hillary go, we own Facebook.
[00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:49.053]  We own Twitter.
[00:24:49.053 --> 00:24:52.815]  Guys, gals, pull up the headline just two weeks ago.
[00:24:52.815 --> 00:24:57.377]  CEO of Twitter says we're going to have a revolution against conservatives and crush them.
[00:24:57.377 --> 00:25:03.920]  I mean, they're like declaring the war, and then conservatives are like, we think maybe they're doing this to us.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.041]  Keep going.
[00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:06.561]  Diamonds and silk.
[00:25:08.797 --> 00:25:09.598]  We're good to go.
[00:25:28.394 --> 00:25:33.979]  Diamond and Silk's personal Facebook page has been labeled by Facebook as very liberal.
[00:25:33.979 --> 00:25:48.031]  Even though we are not very liberal, Facebook do not give us the option to change this label to conservative, making it less likely for us to see advertisement, news stories, and services for a conservative point of view.
[00:25:48.031 --> 00:25:53.596]  If Facebook labeled our user account as very liberal and got it wrong, how many more... Alright, that's good.
[00:25:53.596 --> 00:25:54.657]  We're going to come back to more of this.
[00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:55.118]  It's live.
[00:25:56.372 --> 00:25:57.293]  It's more sophisticated.
[00:25:57.293 --> 00:26:02.718]  It's part of the Chinese global system that's being adopted of the World Social Score.
[00:26:02.718 --> 00:26:06.341]  To where they just hit a button and you're banned from the web.
[00:26:06.341 --> 00:26:08.282]  It's called Internet ID.
[00:26:08.282 --> 00:26:11.966]  It's the holy grail of censorship and control.
[00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:17.430]  So we'll get into more of this and how it ties into NBC's failing bet on Megyn Kelly.
[00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.634]  Wall Street Journal, her ratings continue to plunge.
[00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:29.835]  Continue to fall because people know she's a fraud and they're sick of her.
[00:26:29.835 --> 00:26:34.076]  Meanwhile, they have a new hatred of journalism index being reported on.
[00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:37.937]  And of course, Acosta of CNN talked about it's so dangerous.
[00:26:37.937 --> 00:26:41.558]  Trump's going to get people killed attacking free speech.
[00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:45.459]  Now saying fake journalists like Jim Acosta and Megyn Kelly.
[00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:48.746]  Are frauds.
[00:26:48.746 --> 00:26:52.708]  Saying that they're full of lies and disinfo is not attacking the press.
[00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.428]  It's saying, you are a liar.
[00:26:54.428 --> 00:26:56.029]  You're attacking us.
[00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:57.090]  You're misrepresenting us.
[00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.831]  You're saying, go after libertarians, go after nationalists.
[00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:06.614]  You're calling us Nazis.
[00:27:06.614 --> 00:27:11.616]  Tom Arnold's telling Candace Owens to suck the racist you-know-what.
[00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:13.357]  You're the ones that are completely out of control.
[00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:19.570]  Then you point your finger at us, and you say we're going to cause violence.
[00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:20.791]  It's what my sources have told me.
[00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:33.139]  They're getting ready, the globalists, to stage attacks against universities, against media institutions, against the UN, against the Federal Reserve, to then say anybody that criticizes those things are on the side of the terrorists.
[00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:34.701]  Get ready for it!
[00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:37.302]  It's their next move!
[00:27:37.302 --> 00:27:37.763]  Amazing.
[00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:43.007]  If you want to counter this, we're going into the storm.
[00:27:43.007 --> 00:27:51.149]  And the storm's going to knock down the globalists, but it's going to hurt a lot of us on the front lines as well.
[00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:58.331]  So more than ever, InfoWars needs you to hand-share the articles, the videos, the information via your email, in person.
[00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:14.113]  To go to the URLs, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, to put the bumper stickers on your car, to put up a billboard on the side of your barn, to reach out, but also financially support, and we make it easy, with amazing products.
[00:28:14.113 --> 00:28:26.436]  You know, if you don't know about the iodine conspiracy and how the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, and other things fill up your glands and really hurt you, and how IQs drop, and all the cancer, and all the rest of it, it's well known you die without iodine.
[00:28:26.436 --> 00:28:27.816]  And most iodine's bound
[00:28:28.536 --> 00:28:28.676]  Yeah.
[00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:51.668]  But we have the only one that's 999999 pure, and your body actually absorbs.

[00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:02.575]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:10.520]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.020]  I think so.
[00:29:29.594 --> 00:29:30.414]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:30.414 --> 00:29:32.195]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:32.195 --> 00:29:33.856]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:30:58.736 --> 00:31:06.659]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:12.901]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:12.901 --> 00:31:17.383]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:23.285]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.285 --> 00:31:27.026]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:29.727]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.727 --> 00:31:35.530]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.491]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:42.032]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.032 --> 00:31:44.253]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:44.613]  I love it.
[00:31:44.773 --> 00:31:47.575]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:48.595]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:48.595 --> 00:31:54.259]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.

[00:32:00.228 --> 00:32:03.650]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.612]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:10.953]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:32:10.953 --> 00:32:13.475]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:17.857]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:32:18.217 --> 00:32:27.582]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:27.582 --> 00:32:34.746]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:40.828]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:32:40.828 --> 00:32:48.470]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.371]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:56.292]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:02.754 --> 00:33:11.018]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.018 --> 00:33:19.422]  Are the Clintons corrupt?
[00:33:19.422 --> 00:33:23.324]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.911]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:32.892]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:33.612]  Let me do this.
[00:33:33.612 --> 00:33:53.840]  I've mentioned some of the headlines and I've drilled down into Congress finally having investigations into water being wet, 2 plus 2 equals 4, do liberal tech giants censor conservatives, nationalists, free market folks, patriots, anybody popular they don't control?
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.302]  Again, does a bear
[00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.391]  Live in the woods.
[00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:04.793]  Does a bear have brown fur?
[00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:10.255]  Well, I guess if it's a polar bear, that's white fur.
[00:34:10.255 --> 00:34:13.617]  And of course, the answer is yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:16.218]  Bears do live in the woods.
[00:34:16.218 --> 00:34:18.740]  Hillary Clinton is corrupt.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.801]  And the Santa Claus is not real.
[00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:23.042]  And Obamacare is not free.
[00:34:23.042 --> 00:34:25.303]  And you did build your business, but Obama said you didn't.
[00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:37.009]  So let me just hit a few of these little tidbits for you that we're going to be getting into.
[00:34:37.009 --> 00:34:47.157]  Germany, about six years ago, banned the construction of single-family homes, saying the family's bad.
[00:34:47.157 --> 00:34:51.540]  They want to encourage not having children.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:56.884]  USA Today has come out and called for getting rid of the single-family home.
[00:34:56.884 --> 00:34:57.185]  Right here.
[00:34:58.322 --> 00:35:02.485]  The single family house, an American icon faces an uncertain future.
[00:35:02.485 --> 00:35:05.948]  And the article basically says it's bad, get rid of it.
[00:35:05.948 --> 00:35:07.569]  This is a global plan.
[00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:14.775]  So what you see in China and what you see in Germany is the plan here.
[00:35:14.775 --> 00:35:24.882]  They want you in big Jeff Bezos owned, Bloomberg owned coffin apartments where you pay more for a 250 square foot than you pay for a 2,000.
[00:35:24.882 --> 00:35:26.784]  More money and more taxes to them.
[00:35:27.537 --> 00:35:28.858]  We were tax exempt.
[00:35:28.858 --> 00:35:36.541]  By the way, The Guardian has an article about how Jeff Bezos never pays taxes, so even the liberals admit it.
[00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:47.986]  But he's liberal, so he'll live in a 40,000 square foot house and have helicopters and private jets and mistresses.
[00:35:47.986 --> 00:35:49.787]  He's liberal, though.
[00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:54.916]  Like all the communist liberals.
[00:35:54.916 --> 00:36:01.839]  They're rich parents and pulling up their Mercedes and wearing pacifiers around their necks with big bags of ecstasy.
[00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:13.545]  The police let them into Coachella and they dance around and party and pose in front of corporate logos pretending they're movie stars and then are questioned by a major publication and more than half identify as socialist and communist.
[00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.711]  They're the ruling class.
[00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:18.092]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:20.012]  They take drugs all day.
[00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.354]  They suck on pacifiers.
[00:36:22.354 --> 00:36:27.816]  And then they hate farmers that aren't paying more.
[00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:32.258]  And people that work in factories and truck drivers.
[00:36:32.258 --> 00:36:35.060]  They're petty capitalists over there.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.721]  We're communists with our smartphones and $200 skinny jeans.
[00:36:43.624 --> 00:36:47.746]  So we're going to break all of that down here in just a moment.
[00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:50.228]  And of course, exclusive!
[00:36:50.228 --> 00:36:55.411]  National Geographic, exclusive!
[00:36:55.411 --> 00:37:00.634]  Ancient mass child sacrifice, maybe world's largest.
[00:37:00.634 --> 00:37:10.000]  But I remember sitting there for the few years I went to college, as I was realizing how worthless it was, in all the different sociology, anthropology classes I took,
[00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.362]  Archaeology.
[00:37:12.362 --> 00:37:15.083]  They would be real politically correct, because that was the political correctness at the time.
[00:37:15.083 --> 00:37:22.945]  They'd say, you know, there weren't really human sacrifices in Mesoamerica.
[00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:28.826]  That's a lie of the conquistadors.
[00:37:28.826 --> 00:37:39.849]  And I'm sitting there, and I'd been to Central America, I'd been to Mexico, I'd been to Tulum, and Acomal, and Chichen Itza, and amazing sites, and they had the Mayan guides there.
[00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:50.610]  Explaining, here we are at the Well of Souls, where there are tens of thousands of skeletons, mainly of children at the bottom, but also women.
[00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:58.553]  They were bound, their heads bashed in, and then thrown into the water goddess.
[00:37:58.553 --> 00:38:06.715]  And then they take you to the next place, but illiberal Austin, oh no, no.
[00:38:06.715 --> 00:38:08.716]  Notice the children have their heads bashed out.
[00:38:10.769 --> 00:38:12.150]  Let's just go ahead and cover this one now.
[00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:17.573]  I think we'll start here first because every culture ends up with a central government and enough corruption.
[00:38:17.573 --> 00:38:19.114]  They get a priest class finally.
[00:38:19.114 --> 00:38:21.155]  It may take a thousand years.
[00:38:21.155 --> 00:38:26.938]  It ends in child sacrifice because it's the ultimate thing to make the population submit.
[00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:38.765]  If you'll give your three-year-old up to have their throat slit and shoved into a peat bog crying for mommy with blood spraying out of their mouth, that's Scotland, Ireland, England, Germany.
[00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:44.017]  Folks lived then.
[00:38:44.017 --> 00:38:45.918]  The Germanic people did the same stuff.
[00:38:45.918 --> 00:38:51.100]  They had bonfires, bone fires.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.522]  A lot of times the priest class would demand the king's son or daughter to be burned.
[00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:58.904]  It was an act of the priest class dominance.
[00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:03.966]  It usually happened during societal collapse that the priest class totally took over, even from the warrior class.
[00:39:05.626 --> 00:39:14.908]  And you see that with the Aztecs and their decline even before Cortez got there with a few hundred men and conquered over 10,000 people in Mexico City today, known as Mexico City today.
[00:39:14.908 --> 00:39:18.709]  They're in the Chalupas, that's where the word Chalupa comes from, was the floating gardens.
[00:39:18.709 --> 00:39:27.371]  When he conquered the Chalupas down there, he just said they were all begging for us to kill them.
[00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:37.263]  Because the insanity had been going on so long, and the hallucinating, and the drugs, and the occultic behavior.
[00:39:37.263 --> 00:39:45.988]  But now, exclusive old National Geographic's ready to tell us, ancient mass child sacrifice may be world's largest.
[00:39:47.463 --> 00:40:00.192]  Evidence for the largest single incident of child mass sacrifice in the Americas, and likely in world history, has been discovered in Peru's north eastern coast, archaeologists tell National Geographic.
[00:40:00.192 --> 00:40:00.933]  More than 140 children and 200 young.
[00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:24.802]  Llamas appear to have been ritually sacrificed in an event that took place 550 years ago, right when Cortez was showing up, on a windswept bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the shadow of what was then the sprawling capital of the empire.
[00:40:26.044 --> 00:40:38.153]  Scientific investigations by the International Interdisciplinary Team, led by Gabriel Praetio of the Université Nationale, and then it goes into what they found.
[00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:42.489]  The work is supported by grants from the National Geographic Society.
[00:40:42.489 --> 00:41:03.064]  While incidents of human sacrifice among the Aztec Mayan Inca have been recorded in colonial-era Spanish chronicles and documented in modern scientific excavations, the discovery of a large-scale child sacrifice event in the little-known pre-Columbian civilization is unprecedented in the Americas, if not in the entire world!
[00:41:03.064 --> 00:41:03.505]  Really?
[00:41:03.505 --> 00:41:05.506]  The Babylonians?
[00:41:05.506 --> 00:41:06.067]  Uh, the...
[00:41:08.536 --> 00:41:15.884]  The Hittites, the Sumerians, the... I mean, they were all worshiping Baal, Baal.
[00:41:15.884 --> 00:41:18.768]  The Bible says, give not your children the fires of Baal.
[00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:28.398]  There are biblical accounts of, in one night, 500 children put on a hot burning grill to Molech.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:38.807]  Just type in ancient carvings of Moloch, and they're throwing children onto the arms of Moloch, but the people didn't get the meat.
[00:41:38.807 --> 00:41:44.430]  It was all left there to burn through the night, and the fat of the children boiled up into the sky.
[00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:55.178]  Of course, Baal's got nice little horns and looks like your archetypal devil, but it's no big deal.
[00:41:55.178 --> 00:41:56.659]  Doesn't exist.
[00:41:56.659 --> 00:41:57.319]  Go back to sleep.
[00:41:58.274 --> 00:41:58.894]  Show folks!
[00:41:58.894 --> 00:41:59.834]  Mole!
[00:41:59.834 --> 00:42:01.195]  Can be an owl, can be a bull.
[00:42:01.195 --> 00:42:02.775]  It's a bull in Samaria.
[00:42:02.775 --> 00:42:03.675]  A bull in Tyre.
[00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:10.576]  And I, of course, is the first person ever successfully and the only person to infiltrate and get it all on video.
[00:42:10.576 --> 00:42:12.017]  But it's no big deal.
[00:42:12.017 --> 00:42:13.017]  Just world leaders doing it.
[00:42:13.017 --> 00:42:13.537]  No big deal.
[00:42:13.537 --> 00:42:18.458]  Doing a mock sacrifice though to the children.
[00:42:18.458 --> 00:42:20.178]  Different ovens.
[00:42:20.178 --> 00:42:23.179]  The Canaanite God associated with child sacrifice.
[00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:25.499]  But all the liberals say, oh it doesn't exist.
[00:42:25.499 --> 00:42:27.800]  There's no ancient forms of earth worship.
[00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:29.833]  Or children are burned.
[00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:32.515]  It's all a lie of the Christian Church.
[00:42:32.515 --> 00:42:33.556]  Yes.
[00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:34.437]  Yes, of course.
[00:42:34.437 --> 00:42:36.939]  Ha ha!
[00:42:36.939 --> 00:42:38.840]  So, there you go.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.804]  When we come back, I'm going to get into the United Nations plan.
[00:42:43.804 --> 00:42:45.826]  You heard Macron said 200 million Africans.
[00:42:45.826 --> 00:42:47.548]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:47.548 --> 00:42:48.348]  500 million.
[00:42:48.348 --> 00:42:51.210]  And to settle Europe in the next 20 years.
[00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:51.711]  It says less.
[00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:52.171]  Yeah, less.
[00:42:52.171 --> 00:42:53.993]  25, 30 years.
[00:42:53.993 --> 00:42:56.495]  And you better accept it.
[00:42:59.884 --> 00:43:00.665]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.665 --> 00:43:10.811]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:16.335]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:19.337]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.337 --> 00:43:28.123]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.224 --> 00:43:40.473]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:49.821]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:52.484]  It is amazing!
[00:43:52.484 --> 00:43:57.468]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[00:43:59.585 --> 00:44:05.169]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in 4's life.
[00:44:05.169 --> 00:44:06.049]  It'd take hours.
[00:44:06.049 --> 00:44:08.471]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.471 --> 00:44:09.652]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.652 --> 00:44:11.273]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:44:11.273 --> 00:44:14.495]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:15.616]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:15.616 --> 00:44:18.798]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:44:18.798 --> 00:44:22.120]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:22.780]  That's
[00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:43.288]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[00:44:43.288 --> 00:44:44.669]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:44:44.669 --> 00:44:54.599]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:44:54.599 --> 00:45:00.245]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:45:00.245 --> 00:45:02.146]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:02.447]  Go ahead.
[00:45:03.374 --> 00:45:05.296]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:45:05.296 --> 00:45:15.825]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:45:15.825 --> 00:45:19.168]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:45:19.648 --> 00:45:19.908]  Absolutely.
[00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:55.326]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:45:59.958 --> 00:46:02.761]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:46:02.761 --> 00:46:13.231]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:14.032]  Scalability.
[00:46:14.032 --> 00:46:16.374]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:18.516]  So there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient in MycoZX.
[00:46:23.561 --> 00:46:34.529]  The other side of the equation, everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[00:46:34.529 --> 00:46:43.396]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:46:43.396 --> 00:46:49.361]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:52.182]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:46:52.182 --> 00:47:03.724]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:47:03.724 --> 00:47:06.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.124 --> 00:47:36.210]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:44.453]  Well, there's a new chapter in the whole Kanye West battle against the thought police, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:44.453 --> 00:47:48.075]  Yesterday, we had the top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:47:49.332 --> 00:47:51.434]  Where he was standing up to the Thought Police.
[00:47:51.434 --> 00:47:55.417]  I tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones, Kanye Unleashed.
[00:47:55.417 --> 00:48:00.020]  And he said, listen, quit trying to intimidate me, quit trying to bully me.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.524]  I'm going to continue to stand up for free thought and free speech.
[00:48:04.524 --> 00:48:05.705]  I don't dislike anybody.
[00:48:05.705 --> 00:48:07.386]  I don't dislike the Democrats.
[00:48:07.386 --> 00:48:10.589]  But I have a right to my thoughts and my views.
[00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:17.934]  Well, now he just tweeted out, we're retweeting it at Real Alex Jones, as we speak, a conversation he had with one of his friends.
[00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:29.294]  This morning, trying to basically intimidate him and he said, listen, I love you, my friend, but don't try to use fear on me to shut down my free thought.
[00:48:29.294 --> 00:48:29.795]  Exactly.
[00:48:29.795 --> 00:48:31.536]  That is so authoritarian.
[00:48:31.536 --> 00:48:34.838]  That's what's dangerous.
[00:48:34.838 --> 00:48:35.899]  That's what's out of control.
[00:48:35.899 --> 00:48:40.702]  So we're going to get to that here in just a moment and then get to this huge news about the U.N.
[00:48:40.702 --> 00:48:46.947]  warning of 500 million Islamists coming into Europe, opening the borders, but spinning it like
[00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:51.952]  It's a ISIS plan when ISIS is working with the globalists.
[00:48:51.952 --> 00:48:56.397]  We're going to look at all of that right now.
[00:48:56.397 --> 00:49:05.846]  Now before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, Survival Field X2 is, from our research, the purest true atomic iodine.
[00:49:05.846 --> 00:49:12.072]  And that just means it's atomic, periodical table system.
[00:49:12.072 --> 00:49:12.533]  The others
[00:49:14.858 --> 00:49:29.069]  The other forms of iodine are bound to other substances and go through your body and can even have some unpleasurable effects in the stomach, in my experience.
[00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:30.971]  Because we knew how good iodine was a decade ago.
[00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:39.397]  We were looking into putting it into a supplement, but every company I went to, scores of them had it bound to types in alcohol, saying it was atomic, it was pure crud.
[00:49:40.731 --> 00:49:41.751]  Try to eat the stuff at the store.
[00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:42.792]  It'll eat a hole in your stomach.
[00:49:42.792 --> 00:49:43.972]  Don't do it.
[00:49:43.972 --> 00:49:49.274]  This is the only iodine that myself and my family can take with no problems or side effects.
[00:49:49.274 --> 00:49:50.194]  Consult your physician.
[00:49:50.194 --> 00:49:51.735]  But you die without iodine.
[00:49:51.735 --> 00:49:55.596]  But there's less and less of it in the soil, in the plants, in the meat, in the food.
[00:49:55.596 --> 00:49:58.837]  Most of it's bound.
[00:49:58.837 --> 00:50:00.017]  But we're running out of X2.
[00:50:00.017 --> 00:50:05.459]  We're probably going to be able to get more, but the places we get it are increasing the price of the atomic iodine.
[00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:09.644]  Obviously, a lot of it, I think, is industrial sabotage.
[00:50:09.644 --> 00:50:10.365]  People try to block us.
[00:50:10.365 --> 00:50:13.489]  They try to stop us at every front, but we got an extra shipment in.
[00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:17.134]  We can keep it discounted for a few more days, then it's got to go back to regular price.
[00:50:17.134 --> 00:50:20.219]  Survival Shield X2, exclusively available in FullWorksStore.com.
[00:50:21.471 --> 00:50:22.872]  Or 888-253-3139.

[00:50:44.316 --> 00:50:45.256]  They're amazing.

[00:50:50.218 --> 00:50:50.898]  Get them together though.
[00:50:50.898 --> 00:50:55.140]  Get free shipping on the combo.

[00:50:59.702 --> 00:51:01.082]  The ultimate game changer.
[00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:02.563]  Super Mel Vitality 50% off.
[00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:04.283]  A lot of folks taking advantage of that.
[00:51:04.283 --> 00:51:05.564]  We've got the Pollen Block.
[00:51:06.693 --> 00:51:09.535]  Amazing for all the pollen and seasonal discomfort out there.
[00:51:09.535 --> 00:51:12.217]  Very proprietary, documented, patented.
[00:51:12.217 --> 00:51:12.817]  Look into that.
[00:51:12.817 --> 00:51:14.498]  We've got BrainForce.
[00:51:14.498 --> 00:51:16.240]  We've got so many other great products.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.781]  So be sure and peruse through everything.
[00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:19.802]  TheInfoWarStore.com.
[00:51:19.802 --> 00:51:21.463]  Okay.
[00:51:21.463 --> 00:51:23.565]  Let me get back to Kanye West.
[00:51:23.565 --> 00:51:30.109]  People sit there and they point out Kanye West has been with Lebronavich, the Alter Crowley witch.
[00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:32.871]  And he said he liked Obama.
[00:51:34.443 --> 00:51:35.984]  And, you know, there's Kim Kardashian with her.
[00:51:35.984 --> 00:51:40.207]  Yes, that witch woman is the god of Hollywood, an Alistair Crowley witch.
[00:51:40.207 --> 00:51:43.008]  In her own Reddit, ask me anything.
[00:51:43.008 --> 00:51:44.449]  She's tied into the Podesta email.
[00:51:44.449 --> 00:51:47.171]  She's super uber bad news.
[00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:52.674]  Who do you think's at these parties, these narcissist parties in Hollywood and New York?
[00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:53.795]  This woman is worshipped.
[00:51:53.795 --> 00:51:56.136]  She's everywhere.
[00:51:56.136 --> 00:52:02.220]  And you got the thief and the murderer hanging on the cross by Christ.
[00:52:04.135 --> 00:52:25.945]  on the hill of Golgotha on the Skull Hill at Calvary and that's Jay-Z on screen of your radio listener with her and one of them repents one of them doesn't and Christ says the one that repents you'll be with me today in paradise and the point is
[00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:29.458]  I judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:52:29.458 --> 00:52:40.166]  Even hanging around Hollywood scum, all that soulless empty garbage where they're all looking to be fulfilled because they're so empty so they get deeper into the evil, deeper into the darkness trying to find it.
[00:52:40.166 --> 00:52:42.688]  I can't even be around Hollywood, be around these people.
[00:52:42.688 --> 00:52:44.809]  They feel so empty, so weak.
[00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:50.273]  I feel so bad around them that you couldn't pay me a trillion dollars to hang out with these people.
[00:52:50.273 --> 00:52:52.115]  They are spiritually dead.
[00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:56.653]  Now you don't have photos of Kanye West with her.
[00:52:56.653 --> 00:53:00.977]  You can sit there and put photos of them next to each other, but it doesn't matter.
[00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:05.241]  What matters is what he's doing now and the courage he's got to stand against this.
[00:53:05.241 --> 00:53:06.823]  We're not making him an idol.
[00:53:06.823 --> 00:53:10.846]  We're saying we support free speech.
[00:53:10.846 --> 00:53:11.947]  We support free thinking.
[00:53:11.947 --> 00:53:19.154]  So here's his latest private message on his phone he put out on his Twitter that we just retweeted at Real Alex Jones.
[00:53:20.885 --> 00:53:24.066]  Yo, thank you so much, in an earlier message then.
[00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:25.427]  Hey, it's JL.
[00:53:25.427 --> 00:53:27.487]  I hope you reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.
[00:53:27.487 --> 00:53:32.789]  You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for.
[00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:35.950]  As you know, what you say really means something to our fans.
[00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.211]  They are loyal to you and respect your opinion.
[00:53:38.211 --> 00:53:45.594]  So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump policies cause, especially to people of color.
[00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.751]  Don't let this be part of your legacy.
[00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:50.772]  You're the greatest artist of our generation.
[00:53:50.772 --> 00:53:53.873]  I love you, John, and I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:53:53.873 --> 00:53:59.636]  You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.
[00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:01.797]  Total truth.
[00:54:01.797 --> 00:54:04.598]  He's not even... He said, I don't agree with a lot of what Trump does.
[00:54:04.598 --> 00:54:06.619]  He says, I've known the guy 10 plus years.
[00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:07.379]  He's my friend.
[00:54:07.379 --> 00:54:08.579]  I know he's a good guy.
[00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:13.542]  I like to support him because he's under attack to say I support free thought.
[00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:14.002]  And there's another...
[00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:22.844]  Rapper, Chicago rapper, well known, has come out and said, yeah, you don't have to be a Democrat if you're black.
[00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:25.324]  You don't have to be anything if you're black or white.
[00:54:25.324 --> 00:54:28.225]  You could be apolitical.
[00:54:28.225 --> 00:54:31.646]  But meanwhile, celebs attack Kanye West over pro-Trump tweets.
[00:54:31.646 --> 00:54:36.268]  Complete freaking lunatic.
[00:54:36.268 --> 00:54:38.889]  All these talentless losers have to say about him.
[00:54:38.889 --> 00:54:41.550]  I'm not going to even give these people any attention.
[00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:42.590]  But Rosie O'Donnell,
[00:54:46.448 --> 00:54:47.928]  The director of Guardians of the Galaxy?
[00:54:47.928 --> 00:54:50.549]  Who cares?
[00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:52.710]  So, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:54.410]  It's about courage.
[00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:56.671]  And it's about not being cowards.
[00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:59.632]  And it's about standing up when you've got everything to lose.
[00:54:59.632 --> 00:55:05.293]  But see, he realizes we've got everything to lose if we let this tyranny take over and run the entire planet.
[00:55:05.293 --> 00:55:07.594]  Now, I mentioned this earlier, so I thought I'd show it to you.
[00:55:07.594 --> 00:55:09.054]  It's from Infowars.com.
[00:55:09.054 --> 00:55:10.375]  It's also in the Daily Mail.
[00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:15.056]  Open borders advocate anally raped by migrant, but raped by others as well.
[00:55:16.308 --> 00:55:25.655]  A Swedish woman said she hung out with suspects to prove she wasn't xenophobic, went to the refugee center, got raped to prove she wasn't a racist.
[00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:28.276]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:55:28.276 --> 00:55:30.038]  So I mentioned that, I thought I'd show it to you.
[00:55:30.038 --> 00:55:30.758]  Here it is.
[00:55:30.758 --> 00:55:37.163]  500 million Africans, that's North Africans, Islamicists, could invade Europe under ISIS plan, UN official says.
[00:55:37.163 --> 00:55:41.546]  It was the UN, it was the globalists, it was their whole program.
[00:55:43.064 --> 00:55:57.767]  On record, to invite the Islamists in and then ISIS said it was part of their plan too, and to give them housing and to give them free welfare and to give them all this garbage to incentivize and then Macron and the UN even admitted in the last month
[00:56:03.297 --> 00:56:19.571]  They keep pushing this whole plan to incentivize, and Europe advertises it, and now the UN, two weeks after Macron, said we're going to take in 200 million North Africans and kick people out of their hotels, kick people out of their own apartments, kick people out of their own Section 8 homes in Italy and Germany.
[00:56:20.171 --> 00:56:23.752]  Put a thousand migrants in a town of 76 Germans.
[00:56:23.752 --> 00:56:34.935]  We're showing footage on here a year ago of a little Italian innkeeper on the coast having his tenants thrown out, no pay, and North Africans that Soros shipped in on big old rubber boats.
[00:56:34.935 --> 00:56:37.055]  So that story's on NewsWars.com.
[00:56:37.055 --> 00:56:39.536]  We've also launched Europe.InfoWars.com.
[00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:46.523]  We're going to be telling you more about that in the near future with our whole European Bureau we're setting up.
[00:56:46.523 --> 00:56:47.825]  So check that out.
[00:56:47.825 --> 00:56:50.808]  Meanwhile, here's the London Guardian telling you what we just told you.
[00:56:50.808 --> 00:56:54.733]  ISIS trying to foment a wave of migration to Europe, says UN official.
[00:56:54.733 --> 00:56:57.075]  Yeah, and you're rolling out the red carpet.
[00:56:57.075 --> 00:57:01.961]  Meanwhile, the very same UN group, Central American asylum seeker caravan reaches US border.
[00:57:03.339 --> 00:57:06.140]  Thousands set to hit over the weekend.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.362]  Set to come across the Tijuana Bridge and try to force their way in.
[00:57:09.362 --> 00:57:13.404]  But Mexico's telling us take them, but nobody's saying Mexico should take them.
[00:57:13.404 --> 00:57:26.109]  See, only the evil El Norte must take these giant third world populations that'll drive down the wages and help no one but the globalists further foment the collapse of civilization.
[00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:29.131]  And we too can live in the bloodbath that is Latin America.
[00:57:31.149 --> 00:57:40.313]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side with several special guests at the 6 After in studio and a ton of other news.
[00:57:40.313 --> 00:57:42.234]  It's a revolutionary act to tell the truth.
[00:57:42.234 --> 00:57:44.755]  To quote George Orwell, we're doing it.
[00:57:44.755 --> 00:57:46.555]  Please spread the live video feeds.
[00:57:46.555 --> 00:57:47.996]  Please spread the articles and videos.
[00:57:50.037 --> 00:57:54.741]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:55.952]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in full war's life.
[00:58:55.952 --> 00:58:56.812]  It'd take hours.
[00:58:56.812 --> 00:58:59.253]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:58:59.253 --> 00:59:00.433]  It's stronger.
[00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:02.054]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:59:02.054 --> 00:59:05.275]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.395]  It's back in stock.
[00:59:06.395 --> 00:59:09.556]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:59:09.556 --> 00:59:12.877]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:59:13.477 --> 00:59:13.557]  It's
[00:59:32.131 --> 00:59:33.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:03.676 --> 01:00:07.217]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:07.217 --> 01:00:10.518]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.518 --> 01:00:14.199]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:00:14.199 --> 01:00:16.480]  Run on for a long time.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.320]  Run on for a long time.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.062]  Alright, Ben Garrison is in studio along with Sabo, two amazing artists, because I'm telling you...
[01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:34.491]  All of us going out, whether it's sticking a bumper sticker on a light pole, or on our car, or painting our barn up with Infowars.com, or your own local news site, that's even more powerful.
[01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:39.234]  Have your own liberty, truth-based site that's just little stories you do, things you post.
[01:00:39.234 --> 01:00:40.796]  Maybe a blog you do.
[01:00:40.796 --> 01:00:42.197]  Think little, think big, whatever.
[01:00:42.197 --> 01:00:43.898]  Little becomes big.
[01:00:43.898 --> 01:00:47.440]  And then small towns, you name it, are even easier to wake folks up in.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.283]  And then you just put them on the side of the barn, your website.
[01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:53.285]  We're going to talk about how we fight back.
[01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:56.923]  I don't play enough of Paul Watson's reports.
[01:00:56.923 --> 01:01:02.986]  He's got some new, really powerful ones that I'm going to play in that next hour, and then we've got
[01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:36.620]  Matt Bracken on because he concurs they're getting ready to launch massive false flags against their own liberal targets in a big, big way so that they can try to play the sympathy card and say, see, we've got to ban the conservatives, libertarians.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.601]  See, Trump's going to cause us to get attacked.
[01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:39.822]  We told you that a few weeks ago.
[01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.363]  We told you that this weekend.
[01:01:41.363 --> 01:01:47.647]  Now, CNN, MSNBC, AP, the Democrats say you're going to cause violence when they're the ones fomenting it.
[01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:51.261]  And they have ISIS coming out saying they're going to attack leftist targets.
[01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:54.144]  And there's been the whole left funding ISIS in the whole Arab Spring.
[01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:57.387]  This is as transparent as a $3 bill.
[01:01:57.387 --> 01:01:59.649]  This is as fake as a $3 bill.
[01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:09.017]  But before we go to break, I want to just go out to break, playing Jim Acosta, Trump supporters don't have all their faculties and talk about how they're going to cause violence.
[01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.118]  And I just want to play another clip.
[01:02:10.118 --> 01:02:12.700]  Macron tells, beset nationalism.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.682]  You know, he's a little globalist selling that program, a Trojan horse.
[01:02:16.403 --> 01:02:23.106]  And then I want to get into a Belgian TV crew pelted with rocks in Brussels, Belgium, because there are no go zones.
[01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:27.468]  And that ties into a Sweden, an old man being beaten up.
[01:02:27.468 --> 01:02:30.129]  These are so many of these videos, I can't keep track of them.
[01:02:30.129 --> 01:02:42.534]  So let's just play those videos, going out to break, and we'll come back with Ooh That Smell, a great piece Rob Dew and I put together, tying it into the true war crimes and true demonic behavior of Obama and Hillary.
[01:02:42.534 --> 01:02:45.595]  So here is all those clips together, and we'll be back.
[01:02:47.977 --> 01:02:53.301]  But the problem is that people around the country don't know it's an act.
[01:02:53.301 --> 01:02:54.642]  They're not in on the act.
[01:02:54.642 --> 01:02:57.103]  And they take what he says very seriously.
[01:02:57.103 --> 01:03:04.149]  And they take attacks from Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders and what they do to us on a daily basis very seriously.
[01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.310]  They don't have all their faculties in some cases.
[01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:09.370]  Their elevator might not hit all floors.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:14.072]  My concern is that a journalist is going to be hurt one of these days.
[01:03:14.072 --> 01:03:15.792]  Somebody's going to get hurt.
[01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:25.194]  And at that point, you know, the White House, the President of the United States, they're going to have to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves whether or not they played a role in this.
[01:03:25.194 --> 01:03:29.575]  Whether they created this toxic environment that resulted in a journalist getting hurt.
[01:03:29.575 --> 01:03:31.396]  And the moment that a journalist gets hurt,
[01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:40.105]  In the United States of America because of rhetoric coming from the President of the United States, we have suddenly become something less than the United States.
[01:03:40.105 --> 01:03:47.733]  We're starting to join at that moment a different group of countries around the world where the press is not safe.
[01:03:47.733 --> 01:03:53.659]  And I hope and I'd like to see the White House and the President pay more attention to that.
[01:03:56.075 --> 01:04:04.041]  It is together that we can resist the rise of aggressive nationalisms that deny our history and divide the world.
[01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:14.448]  It is together that we will build a new strong multilateralism that defends pluralism and democracy in the face of ill winds.
[01:04:14.448 --> 01:04:22.254]  Because our culture, our identity has always been true for our countries while inspiring the universal.
[01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:28.434]  For our culture, our identity has always been to work for our countries, while aspiring to universality.
[01:04:28.434 --> 01:04:29.114]  They're coming!
[01:04:29.114 --> 01:04:29.434]  They're coming!
[01:04:29.434 --> 01:04:30.155]  They're coming!
[01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:30.735]  They're coming!

[01:04:34.816 --> 01:04:35.156]  They're coming!
[01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:35.476]  They're coming!
[01:04:35.476 --> 01:04:35.776]  They're coming!
[01:04:35.776 --> 01:04:36.156]  They're coming!
[01:04:36.156 --> 01:04:36.516]  They're coming!
[01:04:36.516 --> 01:04:36.856]  They're coming!
[01:04:36.856 --> 01:04:37.156]  They're coming!
[01:04:37.156 --> 01:04:37.456]  They're coming!
[01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:37.776]  They're coming!
[01:04:37.776 --> 01:04:38.156]  They're coming!
[01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:38.517]  They're coming!
[01:04:38.517 --> 01:04:38.857]  They're coming!
[01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:39.157]  They're coming!
[01:04:39.157 --> 01:04:39.557]  They're coming!
[01:04:39.557 --> 01:04:41.037]  They're coming!
[01:04:41.037 --> 01:04:41.357]  They're coming!
[01:04:41.357 --> 01:04:41.657]  They're coming!
[01:04:41.657 --> 01:04:41.957]  They're coming!
[01:04:41.957 --> 01:04:42.257]  They're coming!
[01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:42.557]  They're coming!
[01:04:42.557 --> 01:04:42.858]  They're coming!
[01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:43.158]  They're coming!
[01:04:43.158 --> 01:04:43.458]  They're coming!
[01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:43.758]  They're coming!
[01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:44.058]  They're coming!
[01:04:44.058 --> 01:04:44.358]  They're coming!
[01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:44.658]  They're coming!
[01:04:44.658 --> 01:04:44.958]  They're coming!
[01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:45.258]  They're coming!
[01:04:45.258 --> 01:04:45.598]  They're coming!
[01:04:45.598 --> 01:04:45.938]  They're coming!
[01:04:45.938 --> 01:04:46.238]  They're coming!
[01:04:46.238 --> 01:04:46.538]  They're coming!
[01:04:46.538 --> 01:04:46.838]  They're coming!
[01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:47.139]  They're coming!
[01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:47.439]  They're coming!
[01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:47.739]  They're coming!
[01:04:47.739 --> 01:04:48.059]  They're coming!
[01:04:48.059 --> 01:04:48.359]  They're coming!
[01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:48.739]  They're coming
[01:04:58.182 --> 01:05:03.585]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:03.585 --> 01:05:06.446]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:05:06.446 --> 01:05:08.427]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:05:08.427 --> 01:05:13.449]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:05:13.449 --> 01:05:15.549]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:16.830]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:21.732]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:05:21.932 --> 01:05:28.815]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:31.716]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:05:31.716 --> 01:05:35.518]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:05:35.518 --> 01:05:42.421]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:48.304]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[01:05:48.484 --> 01:05:49.406]  Good evening, everybody.
[01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.691]  She's not even the same universe.
[01:06:03.691 --> 01:06:07.513]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:14.936]  People around her say she's so dark now, and so evil, and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:15.996]  They're freaking out.
[01:06:15.996 --> 01:06:19.578]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:31.840]  That's different at this point, doesn't it?
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.623]  I have two words for you.
[01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.144]  Let her go drunk.
[01:06:51.429 --> 01:06:54.092]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:06:54.092 --> 01:06:55.853]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:06:55.853 --> 01:06:58.336]  He said we smell like something.
[01:06:58.336 --> 01:06:59.117]  Ain't that something?
[01:06:59.117 --> 01:07:02.360]  I'm not just being tacky.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.244]  Call me Margaret Mead and Samoa.
[01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:11.529]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like her.
[01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:34.713]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:07:34.713 --> 01:07:36.354]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.354 --> 01:07:52.141]  Still mad?
[01:07:52.141 --> 01:07:52.641]  Nervous.
[01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:58.395]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[01:08:07.952 --> 01:08:08.793]  Well, what a treat!
[01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:19.781]  Ben Garrison and Sabo, two of the most prolific, successful, Americana, libertarian, free-thinking, I wouldn't even call them liberal or conservative, because I know both you guys.
[01:08:19.781 --> 01:08:23.723]  Garrison really well, probably interviewed him 20 times, very familiar with Sabo's work.
[01:08:23.723 --> 01:08:29.768]  He was on with us last week, and I remember saying, man, we've got to get you guys to town, and so you're here.
[01:08:29.768 --> 01:08:30.568]  Thanks for coming.
[01:08:30.568 --> 01:08:31.529]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.651]  Good to have you.
[01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.232]  Let's just get right into it right now.
[01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:50.606]  We're here to talk about the power of art, and how it's under attack, and the power of communication, Kanye West, all this, the power of expression, and how that's being demonized, and how we're seeing the biggest push in modern history to eradicate it in the West.
[01:08:50.606 --> 01:08:54.409]  So, Ben Garrison, Sabo, get on up to the microphone.
[01:08:54.409 --> 01:08:58.472]  Tell us your declaration of independence against this, and the time and space you think we're in right now.
[01:09:00.168 --> 01:09:07.010]  Well, as for me, I come from a newspaper background, and I'm very familiar with editorial cartoons.
[01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:11.732]  And for far too long, the left has dominated that field.
[01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:21.616]  And what they do in their cartoons, they always end up calling for more big government and more taxes.
[01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:26.337]  And so I want to take a different tack, and big government, to me,
[01:09:28.839 --> 01:09:30.721]  They create more problems than they solve.
[01:09:30.721 --> 01:09:40.829]  I mean, I'm reminded of a quote by Milton Friedman who said, if the federal government was in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand.
[01:09:42.377 --> 01:10:00.524]  I want to draw in my cartoons, I mean, there are very few conservative cartoonists, and I was telling Sabo, who's from L.A., the famous cartoonist there was Paul Conrad, and he says, he said conservatives cannot be funny, they cannot be editorial cartoonists because they support the status quo.
[01:10:00.524 --> 01:10:01.944]  What's the status quo now?
[01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:02.865]  It's the deep state?
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:12.543]  And it's the corrupt situation in Washington, so there's plenty, there's plenty to go after, a conservative cartoonist can go after.
[01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:15.424]  And let me reverse that.
[01:10:15.424 --> 01:10:19.805]  Let me reverse that, I think it's Fabo's take on it, and his declaration of why he's here and what he's standing up for.
[01:10:19.805 --> 01:10:23.686]  Of course, we'll introduce who he is and who you are, but most folks don't need that.
[01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:26.347]  But for folks that don't, they need to go check out your work, because it's amazing.
[01:10:28.004 --> 01:10:42.766]  If Milton Friedman could turn the Sahara Desert green in five years, to show the power of capitalism, it's a metaphor, then communists, people like Kim Jong-un, they could turn the Brazilian rainforest to the Sahara in five years.
[01:10:43.957 --> 01:10:45.338]  Sure you could.
[01:10:45.338 --> 01:10:46.880]  Well, what's my take on it?
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.441]  We're in the midst of the battle, man.
[01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:49.942]  I'm loving it.
[01:10:49.942 --> 01:10:51.884]  People always tell me, why don't you move to Texas, man?
[01:10:51.884 --> 01:10:53.205]  They'll love you in Texas.
[01:10:53.205 --> 01:10:54.826]  I'm like, why would I want to do that?
[01:10:54.826 --> 01:10:58.769]  I like being right in the middle of the thick of it in L.A.
[01:10:58.769 --> 01:11:02.713]  And I'm excited.
[01:11:02.713 --> 01:11:04.714]  It's going to be a very interesting two years.
[01:11:04.714 --> 01:11:07.196]  I'm sure we're all going to be nice and tired when it's done.
[01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:12.601]  I don't know what more to say.
[01:11:13.183 --> 01:11:19.788]  There's a quickening right now, and of course you should probably... Ben Garrison's probably well known as Ben Garrison because he's more public.
[01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:32.419]  You are just as well known for your viral street art, where you, you know, for the Oscars, put up huge signs saying, and the award goes to the number one pedophile, and it goes totally viral.
[01:11:32.419 --> 01:11:37.243]  So, for radio listeners, not just for TV viewers, describe some of your most viral work and why you got into it.
[01:11:38.118 --> 01:11:42.003]  Well I would say Ted Cruz, helping out Ted Cruz with his campaign.
[01:11:42.003 --> 01:11:46.108]  Not directly, that helped out, that opened a few doors.
[01:11:46.108 --> 01:11:51.394]  It seems with every hit it's got to get a little bigger and bigger, a little more involved.
[01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:54.478]  But just learning how to
[01:11:56.307 --> 01:11:57.248]  I'm not sure.
[01:11:57.248 --> 01:11:59.169]  I can't believe I'm drawing a damn blank here.
[01:11:59.169 --> 01:11:59.930]  You're doing great.
[01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:00.691]  You were on last week.
[01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:01.471]  We're on fire.
[01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:06.976]  In fact, let's show some of Sabo's incredible art from his amazing website unsavoryagents.com.
[01:12:06.976 --> 01:12:08.277]  Let's keep rolling through these guys' art.
[01:12:08.277 --> 01:12:08.838]  There it is.
[01:12:08.838 --> 01:12:13.602]  And the Oscar for biggest pedophile goes to... I mean, that reached over a billion people.
[01:12:13.602 --> 01:12:22.570]  That was all over the news and reminded us, hey, all these sanctimonious people with the fake Me Too movement is a smoke screen for their giant pedophile devil worship command base.
[01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:24.892]  I love living in Hollywood because of it.
[01:12:24.892 --> 01:12:28.975]  I'm waiting for those doors to open up and the whole place to just melt.
[01:12:28.975 --> 01:12:30.236]  I'd love to be a part of it.
[01:12:30.236 --> 01:12:41.445]  I was telling someone the other day, when I die, I want people to say that that guy, like another issue, it's like he helped to turn a lot of black people away from the Democrat plantation.
[01:12:41.445 --> 01:12:45.408]  And we're starting to see that now with Candace Owens and P. Diddy.
[01:12:46.374 --> 01:12:48.355]  And these are exciting times.
[01:12:48.355 --> 01:12:56.278]  I tell rock musicians in Hollywood, it's like these are the days Bob Dylan came from.
[01:12:56.278 --> 01:12:58.679]  These are the times that heroes are made.
[01:12:58.679 --> 01:13:01.239]  For God's sakes, drop your nuts.
[01:13:01.239 --> 01:13:03.340]  Start writing the songs that need to be heard.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.121]  But there's so many people out there that are just scared.
[01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:08.282]  And you can't be half-hearted about this.
[01:13:08.282 --> 01:13:10.363]  Just go all in.
[01:13:10.363 --> 01:13:11.783]  And become a hero, man.
[01:13:11.783 --> 01:13:12.864]  I love this!
[01:13:14.036 --> 01:13:25.226]  Street benches where you had Bernie and it says free on one bench and Bernie and then on the other one it says a cuss word deals with bull hockey or Bravo Sierra.
[01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:31.992]  I mean it's just incredible how you can with just simple words illustrate the truth and it's so true on its face we understand.
[01:13:31.992 --> 01:13:33.974]  I'm glad you raised that Sabo because
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:43.588]  They're having congressional hearings live right now with Diamonds and Silk, who are just positive, libertarian, pro-free market ladies that want change.
[01:13:43.588 --> 01:13:45.650]  And they've got hundreds of millions of views on YouTube.
[01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:46.711]  They're all over Fox News.
[01:13:46.711 --> 01:13:48.212]  They're all over this show.
[01:13:48.212 --> 01:13:51.475]  And they're getting shadow banned on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook.
[01:13:51.475 --> 01:13:52.456]  And it's all admitted.
[01:13:52.456 --> 01:13:58.382]  And Congress is having live hearings asking, are tech giants censoring conservatives?
[01:13:58.382 --> 01:13:59.923]  Well, again, we're not really conservatives in my view.
[01:14:01.044 --> 01:14:03.907]  People that want to have Americana and free market.
[01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.629]  That's been the punk.
[01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:08.311]  That's been the rock and roll for the last 500 years.
[01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:19.142]  That's been what's given us space travel and medicine and science and longer lives, was getting away from feudalism, but communism and socialism and liberalism, it's just forms of control.
[01:14:19.142 --> 01:14:21.464]  And so they had a big Comedy Central show attacking Paul Watson.
[01:14:21.464 --> 01:14:22.365]  We're going to play it next hour.
[01:14:23.346 --> 01:14:26.249]  Saying, hey, you're not the new punk rock conservative.
[01:14:26.249 --> 01:14:28.851]  You know, look, the Republicans control the central government.
[01:14:28.851 --> 01:14:30.132]  That's not who we're talking about.
[01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.494]  We're talking about the universities, the media.
[01:14:32.494 --> 01:14:34.115]  We're talking about academia.
[01:14:34.115 --> 01:14:44.664]  We're talking about the big corporations, almost to a company, are anti-freedom, anti-free market, because that gives you individual freedom, and that is the real avant-garde.
[01:14:44.664 --> 01:14:44.825]  Ben?
[01:14:46.192 --> 01:14:56.577]  Well, you mentioned the word sanctimonious, Alex, and I had a chance to talk with Sabo in some depth today, and we're really in alignment.
[01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:57.658]  We're comrades in arms.
[01:14:57.658 --> 01:15:03.521]  Now, you might be in L.A., and I might be up in the boonies of Montana, surrounded by deer and wild turkey, but we both agree.
[01:15:03.521 --> 01:15:08.584]  I'm just amazed at how we're such in alignment, even though we come from totally different environments.
[01:15:08.584 --> 01:15:10.184]  Well, that's why I wanted to get you guys together.
[01:15:10.184 --> 01:15:14.487]  But what you do so well, and what I try to do in a different manner, but what you do so well
[01:15:15.487 --> 01:15:17.989]  Is Alex Fincher worth sanctimonious?
[01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:35.823]  You're mocking their sanctimony, and they can't stand that, because these people, these virtue-signalers, they think they have a moral high ground, and when they see, when you show these images that crystallize the satire into this devastating image of them that tears them down, they cannot stand that.
[01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:37.124]  And so they try to silence us!
[01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:40.187]  And when they get mad, you know you're effective.
[01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:44.591]  When I draw a cartoon that makes a lot of people mad, I say, yeah, because that's what I want to do.
[01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:47.093]  I want to sock them in the gut visually with a cartoon.
[01:15:47.093 --> 01:15:47.453]  That's right.
[01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:50.136]  Because when you get socked in the gut, you remember.
[01:15:50.136 --> 01:15:51.117]  You remember that.
[01:15:51.117 --> 01:15:53.799]  Ben Garrison, Sabo, stay there.
[01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:56.722]  Couple of the top artists in the world right now in studio with us.
[01:15:57.662 --> 01:16:02.745]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:16:08.088 --> 01:16:16.133]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[01:16:57.274 --> 01:16:58.494]  Hear that?
[01:16:58.494 --> 01:17:03.875]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:06.776]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:06.776 --> 01:17:10.357]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:19:36.914 --> 01:19:51.558]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:19:54.158 --> 01:19:55.719]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:07.621 --> 01:20:12.784]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[01:20:12.784 --> 01:20:27.654]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:28.794]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.863]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:20:50.863 --> 01:21:03.471]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:21:03.471 --> 01:21:12.638]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[01:21:12.638 --> 01:21:14.259]  Demand truth.
[01:21:14.259 --> 01:21:15.920]  Demand InfoWars.
[01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:25.765]  And we've got two great artists here in studio with us.
[01:21:25.765 --> 01:21:36.570]  I'm going to make this point because it's critical and it's that if we don't all engage in our free speech right now
[01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:42.376]  We're not going to have to wait for future generations to lose their speech.
[01:21:42.376 --> 01:21:47.143]  Everyone is basically going to end up losing their free speech.
[01:21:47.143 --> 01:21:47.704]  This is it?
[01:21:48.522 --> 01:21:50.343]  It's premeditated.
[01:21:50.343 --> 01:21:51.003]  It's happening.
[01:21:51.003 --> 01:21:54.025]  But we've got congressional hearings going today.
[01:21:54.025 --> 01:21:56.206]  We've got the president talking about it.
[01:21:56.206 --> 01:21:59.588]  The universities being these anti-free speech command bases.
[01:21:59.588 --> 01:22:01.569]  The corporations funding anti-free speech.
[01:22:01.569 --> 01:22:06.291]  The communist Chinese government funding every major public school in the country.
[01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:08.632]  Many of them the number one funder.
[01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:11.033]  We forced that out in the news.
[01:22:11.033 --> 01:22:16.596]  And they teach at UT that Falun Gong should not be allowed on campus.
[01:22:16.596 --> 01:22:17.837]  That's in the news this week!
[01:22:19.121 --> 01:22:20.981]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:23.982]  They kill those Buddhists and take their organs.
[01:22:23.982 --> 01:22:28.303]  We're talking body snatching is being taught at UT.
[01:22:28.303 --> 01:22:32.103]  But again, we have no immune system to communism in this country because we haven't gone through it.
[01:22:32.103 --> 01:22:38.884]  And so we're now facing real authoritarianism, big mega rich funding communism as a way to bring down society.
[01:22:38.884 --> 01:22:41.125]  So now, let's go to camera two.
[01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:46.206]  I want to just thank these guys for being here in studio with us and coming here.
[01:22:46.206 --> 01:22:46.946]  And I want to thank
[01:22:48.206 --> 01:22:51.849]  Ben Garrison, who is the number one editorial cartoonist in the world.
[01:22:51.849 --> 01:22:54.051]  Because I've been in news for 23 years.
[01:22:54.051 --> 01:22:55.132]  I've followed it all.
[01:22:55.132 --> 01:22:55.953]  I look at it all.
[01:22:55.953 --> 01:23:00.137]  His stuff is more prolific than anybody out there times three or four.
[01:23:00.137 --> 01:23:01.999]  And there's some other amazing people.
[01:23:01.999 --> 01:23:03.600]  But he is more prolific.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.621]  It's more powerful.
[01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:05.662]  It's more continuous.
[01:23:05.662 --> 01:23:06.403]  It's amazing.
[01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:08.425]  And the number one street artist in the world.
[01:23:08.905 --> 01:23:18.043]  When it comes to real freedom of expression is Sabo and the amazing, dangerous, cutting-edge, true avant-garde, true punk rock.
[01:23:18.043 --> 01:23:19.946]  And again, next hour we're going to air a report.
[01:23:21.004 --> 01:23:29.230]  From Paul Watson, where he got attacked by Comedy Central, Sumner Redstone, saying, oh, you say conservatism is avant-garde and punk rock.
[01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:34.594]  When we say punk rock, we mean how it was banned in the 60s and 70s, how it was blocked, the sex pistols.
[01:23:34.594 --> 01:23:37.596]  We don't mean literally, we're saying we're punk rock.
[01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:42.259]  We're saying we're being suppressed, we're being deplatformed, we're being censored, we're being attacked.
[01:23:42.259 --> 01:23:43.800]  And you call us all conservatives.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.602]  They call me extremely conservative on Facebook.
[01:23:46.602 --> 01:23:47.063]  They list me.
[01:23:48.283 --> 01:23:50.385]  I'm really a lay historian.
[01:23:50.385 --> 01:23:52.827]  I've read more history books than most historians out there.
[01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:56.470]  And I'm a classical liberal in the Thomas Jeffersonian vein.
[01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.972]  I am, in many ways, socially liberal.
[01:23:58.972 --> 01:24:00.793]  But I'm pro-Second Amendment, pro-life.
[01:24:00.793 --> 01:24:04.156]  I'm just a nationalist populist that likes America, that likes Americana.
[01:24:04.696 --> 01:24:06.597]  You can call me a conservative, paleoconservative.
[01:24:06.597 --> 01:24:08.058]  These names mean nothing.
[01:24:08.058 --> 01:24:12.241]  But the modern liberals, by every definition, are the opposite of a classical liberal.
[01:24:12.241 --> 01:24:13.602]  They're anti-free speech.
[01:24:13.602 --> 01:24:14.643]  They're anti-free market.
[01:24:14.643 --> 01:24:15.703]  They're anti-choice.
[01:24:15.703 --> 01:24:16.484]  They're monsters.
[01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:20.086]  And it's good to have in the arsenal Sabo and Ben Garrison.
[01:24:20.086 --> 01:24:22.188]  But here's why I've got them here for the next few days when we're going to be meeting.
[01:24:23.462 --> 01:24:38.211]  Just to brainstorm, and I'm going to ask them about this now, about how do we get people excited out there to do their own street art in a continuum of what's totally legal versus what you've got to do in an emergency resistance move in case they really take our speech online.
[01:24:38.211 --> 01:24:39.992]  And the fact that they fear us getting on the street.
[01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:42.133]  That's in the WikiLeaks, it's in Google documents.
[01:24:42.133 --> 01:24:43.474]  They fear that final equation.
[01:24:43.474 --> 01:24:45.275]  That's what they've got Antifa trying to intimidate us.
[01:24:45.935 --> 01:24:50.939]  And how do we ignite that engine of the millions of listeners out there to do it?
[01:24:50.939 --> 01:25:02.646]  Whether it's one little sign on a pole, or whether it's a billboard on the side of their barn, or a bumper sticker on their car, or them starting their own website, or their own podcast, or putting up their own street art.
[01:25:02.646 --> 01:25:08.630]  That continuum, I've already been ranting in the segment, Ben Garrison and then again Sabo, what are your ideas?
[01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:15.255]  What is your grassroots initiative to give them, the listeners, the Promethean fire that both of you have when it comes to amazing art?
[01:25:15.775 --> 01:25:18.358]  I just have to say, just start.
[01:25:18.358 --> 01:25:26.166]  You're going to suck at first, and you're going to suck again, but trust me, after a while, you're going to produce something and you're going to go, wow, that's good.
[01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:34.114]  And the reason it's important to start now is because this is going to be a generational fight, a multi-generational fight.
[01:25:34.935 --> 01:25:40.597]  And it's nice being on the ground level, but we have a long fight ahead of us.
[01:25:40.597 --> 01:25:46.040]  We're taking on the magazines, we're taking on Hollywood, we're taking on the social networking, everything.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.802]  So, like I said, it's going to suck at first, but for God's sakes, take that first step.
[01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:56.175]  Well, I've been trying to get young people to start drawing cartoons, too.
[01:25:56.175 --> 01:25:59.958]  I mean, especially female conservative cartoonists.
[01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:02.801]  There are no female conservative cartoonists out there.
[01:26:02.801 --> 01:26:09.446]  Finally, and Alex Jones showed my wife Tina's cartoon of the Slimer one.
[01:26:09.446 --> 01:26:11.147]  That was something my wife Tina did.
[01:26:11.147 --> 01:26:11.908]  That's really good.
[01:26:11.908 --> 01:26:14.170]  She's a cartoonist, too, and I finally got her
[01:26:14.966 --> 01:26:15.046]  to
[01:26:45.206 --> 01:26:47.669]  I don't mind if you do something illegal.
[01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:48.569]  Just don't get caught.
[01:26:48.569 --> 01:26:49.430]  See, if you don't get caught...
[01:27:03.283 --> 01:27:04.123]  It's not illegal.
[01:27:04.123 --> 01:27:05.164]  By the way, we're in a war.
[01:27:05.164 --> 01:27:06.404]  They're trying to silence us.
[01:27:06.404 --> 01:27:09.745]  The French Resistance went up on billboards in World War II and put stuff up there.
[01:27:09.745 --> 01:27:11.505]  We're being occupied by the globalists.
[01:27:11.505 --> 01:27:14.506]  They're having antifa hit us in the head with bike locks to shut us up.
[01:27:14.506 --> 01:27:20.928]  So we can climb up at night and put a message out on one of these corporate billboards, especially an empty one.
[01:27:20.928 --> 01:27:22.628]  I don't see anything bad about that.
[01:27:22.628 --> 01:27:23.789]  You've got to cross the line.
[01:27:23.789 --> 01:27:24.689]  He's a line crosser.
[01:27:24.689 --> 01:27:27.009]  You've got to cross that line or you don't even know where the line is anymore.
[01:27:27.009 --> 01:27:27.350]  I'll say it.
[01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:30.951]  I've climbed up on billboards and I've just made a decision.
[01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:32.371]  I'm going to start tagging some stuff in Austin.
[01:27:33.084 --> 01:27:35.526]  Oh yeah, you know, I'm not happy with the job.
[01:27:35.526 --> 01:27:38.968]  I think I've got two things when I know I'm doing a good job.
[01:27:38.968 --> 01:27:41.089]  One, it scares the hell out of the client.
[01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.450]  And two, I know I'm going to go to hell for doing it.
[01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:46.072]  So it's like, I love crossing those lines.
[01:27:46.072 --> 01:27:50.634]  And I believe if you want to make a difference and if you want a good voice, you can't be half-hearted.
[01:27:50.634 --> 01:27:51.415]  You got to go all in.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.383]  The left isn't going to love you, so quit trying to get love from them.
[01:27:56.383 --> 01:28:09.636]  It came out three months ago that in 2015, Soros funded $15 million, $16 million, his son ran it, with Blue Cities, with the police, to go out and try to get the general public to riot and burn things down.
[01:28:09.636 --> 01:28:11.738]  And, I mean, so they're burning things down.
[01:28:11.738 --> 01:28:13.580]  We're just saying, okay, there's a bench.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.481]  Put something funny on it.
[01:28:14.966 --> 01:28:17.509]  Okay, where are our Soros's?
[01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:18.551]  That's what I want to know.
[01:28:18.551 --> 01:28:27.983]  You can't tell me that there's not one conservative in California that can't get me a three-car garage that I can't wreck havoc with on the West Coast.
[01:28:27.983 --> 01:28:29.305]  I'm no Soros, but that's the
[01:28:29.926 --> 01:28:30.906]  Yes, we're showing our hand right now.
[01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:32.007]  We're going into the Death Star.
[01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:32.747]  We're going to take it out.
[01:28:32.747 --> 01:28:33.087]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.136 --> 01:28:58.037]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.037 --> 01:29:00.458]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.458 --> 01:29:08.584]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:10.525]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.525 --> 01:29:14.227]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:14.227 --> 01:29:18.951]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.

[01:29:23.414 --> 01:29:24.054]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:27.616 --> 01:29:32.679]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:32.679 --> 01:29:38.042]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the outleft sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:38.042 --> 01:29:46.086]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:46.086 --> 01:29:51.529]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[01:29:51.529 --> 01:29:53.530]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:55.391]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:58.424 --> 01:30:01.446]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:01.446 --> 01:30:05.649]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:30:05.649 --> 01:30:12.353]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:30:12.353 --> 01:30:16.096]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:30:16.816 --> 01:30:36.329]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:30:36.869 --> 01:30:40.990]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:51.374]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:30:52.234 --> 01:30:58.042]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.

[01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:19.893]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:32:19.893 --> 01:32:21.013]  I don't feel good.
[01:32:21.013 --> 01:32:24.776]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:32:24.776 --> 01:32:27.457]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:32:27.457 --> 01:32:33.261]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:32:33.261 --> 01:32:36.222]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:32:36.222 --> 01:32:39.764]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:32:39.764 --> 01:32:42.006]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:32:42.006 --> 01:32:42.366]  I love it.
[01:32:42.506 --> 01:32:45.329]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:32:45.329 --> 01:32:46.330]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:52.316]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:52.316 --> 01:32:54.158]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:32:54.158 --> 01:32:55.399]  It's a win-win.
[01:32:55.399 --> 01:33:01.225]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:01.225 --> 01:33:03.868]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.237 --> 01:33:17.339]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.339 --> 01:33:20.141]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:22.743]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.743 --> 01:33:24.644]  You want answers?
[01:33:24.644 --> 01:33:26.565]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.565 --> 01:33:34.491]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.491 --> 01:33:42.057]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know my plan, which is just a basic historic plan that's already worked before, will take down the globalists.
[01:33:42.597 --> 01:33:44.718]  We're going to talk about that here in just a moment.
[01:33:44.718 --> 01:33:47.360]  Because if you support us, we're going to do it.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.623]  We've gotten over 100 new TV affiliates in just the last six months.
[01:33:51.623 --> 01:33:53.844]  We're on more satellites.
[01:33:53.844 --> 01:33:55.265]  We're reaching so many new people.
[01:33:55.265 --> 01:33:59.088]  They are blocking us more and more on the web, but thank God you're getting the information out.
[01:33:59.088 --> 01:34:08.674]  We're having congressional hearings about conservatives, populists, nationalists, Christians being censored, Christian churches being persecuted by the IRS.
[01:34:08.674 --> 01:34:10.275]  I mean, this is real tyranny we're facing.
[01:34:11.553 --> 01:34:25.449]  And so I am just beyond excited right now to have Sabo and Ben Garrison, two of the most successful, just pro-common sense activists, artists in the world, in studios.
[01:34:25.449 --> 01:34:27.552]  We're going to go back to them in just a moment.
[01:34:27.552 --> 01:34:30.155]  But talking about financing this operation.
[01:34:32.043 --> 01:34:35.346]  I want to boost what everybody's doing, just like we boosted Trump's campaign.
[01:34:35.346 --> 01:34:43.292]  You, the audience, are the engine, the brains, the guts, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the soul of this operation.
[01:34:43.292 --> 01:34:59.726]  And if you go to Infowarstore.com and look at the water filtration, the air filtration, the non-GMO heirloom seeds, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, all of it, hundreds of t-shirts, dozens of ball caps,
[01:35:01.587 --> 01:35:10.837]  When you buy those products, you support the information war, but plus, you're wearing an InfoWars shirt, you wear it in a deep blue state area, you might get hit in the head with a tire iron or something, but you wear it everywhere else.
[01:35:10.837 --> 01:35:13.840]  You eat your lunch bought for you, you might meet your wife, your husband, whatever.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.383]  This is how we just do these little things that move mountains.
[01:35:17.383 --> 01:35:18.705]  That's why the left wants to bully us.
[01:35:19.165 --> 01:35:26.269]  Even The Hill and Town Hall have articles out today about how the left is bullying and attacking and threatening, and people are starting to stand up and fight back.
[01:35:26.269 --> 01:35:31.131]  Well, you do it by wearing t-shirts, by wearing ball caps, you do it by having a bumper sticker.
[01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:34.693]  All the orders that come in to InfoWars have five bumper stickers.
[01:35:34.693 --> 01:35:37.374]  I'm doubling it to ten in every order.
[01:35:38.792 --> 01:35:44.376]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, takes you right to the supplement page, or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:44.376 --> 01:35:56.704]  Super Male Vitality is just well-known, concentrated, organic herbs that are cold-pressed, that's the key, for stamina, libido, energy, you name it, people love it.
[01:35:56.704 --> 01:35:58.345]  That's 50% off right now.
[01:35:58.345 --> 01:36:02.448]  You can also get the real red pill, read about it, I don't have time to get to it, it's amazing.
[01:36:02.448 --> 01:36:06.511]  That goes with the Super Male and Super Female Vitality like a horse and carriage.
[01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:07.471]  It is 50% off.
[01:36:09.301 --> 01:36:14.864]  Get the two together and get free shipping on the Real Red Pill and Supermelt Vitality.
[01:36:14.864 --> 01:36:16.504]  They both have thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:19.966]  The combo doesn't have any reviews yet because we just started the special on Monday.
[01:36:19.966 --> 01:36:21.867]  It's going to have to end in a week.
[01:36:21.867 --> 01:36:27.069]  The 25% off on the X2 has to end on Monday because we're very close to selling out.
[01:36:27.069 --> 01:36:28.970]  It'll be a month or so until we get more in.
[01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:31.411]  So I'm just going to let it go to full price until it sells out.
[01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.532]  So that sale is about to end.
[01:36:34.019 --> 01:36:37.121]  We also have a special on the super high quality MyPatriot Supply.
[01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:42.584]  Three month supply with a free Alexa Pure 200 plus dollar value free water filter.
[01:36:44.778 --> 01:36:46.879]  And yes, they had a C-SPAN thing with David Hogg a month ago.
[01:36:46.879 --> 01:36:50.100]  He goes, and Jones says the water's got toxins in it.
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.181]  And then in the same video, then he has an ad for water filters.
[01:36:53.181 --> 01:36:54.222]  Interesting.
[01:36:54.222 --> 01:36:56.923]  And they go, ooh, yeah, scam.
[01:36:56.923 --> 01:36:59.124]  No, the water table's full of poison.
[01:36:59.124 --> 01:37:00.004]  Everybody knows that.
[01:37:00.004 --> 01:37:00.905]  It's admitted.
[01:37:00.905 --> 01:37:02.765]  You need to filter your water, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:02.765 --> 01:37:04.306]  We have the best gravity-filled systems.
[01:37:04.306 --> 01:37:06.607]  So yes, I do a report on how the water's bad.
[01:37:06.607 --> 01:37:10.529]  And then I sell a water filter I use when I'm on the road or in my own home.
[01:37:10.529 --> 01:37:12.489]  Yeah!
[01:37:12.489 --> 01:37:13.670]  Exactly, like if I was gonna
[01:37:14.932 --> 01:37:17.833]  Open a franchise of a restaurant.
[01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:24.016]  If I was a franchisee, I would find a restaurant that I love, that was successful, and had really good food, that I would want to franchise.
[01:37:24.016 --> 01:37:26.157]  I'd say, can I franchise your great restaurant?
[01:37:26.157 --> 01:37:31.580]  A lot of people have gone in famously to good restaurants, and they've said, I want to franchise this.
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.460]  Exactly!
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.942]  I sell what I use, and I like, and I believe in.
[01:37:35.942 --> 01:37:38.623]  But it shows Hogg, and the media thinks it's like a scam.
[01:37:38.623 --> 01:37:42.905]  He had a water filter ad after he talked about atrocine in the water causing sterility.
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.561]  Oh my God, it's hidden!
[01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:47.022]  They always go, Jones said this on air.
[01:37:47.022 --> 01:37:47.682]  We caught it.
[01:37:47.682 --> 01:37:48.363]  Here it is.
[01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:49.903]  It was a big secret.
[01:37:49.903 --> 01:37:51.324]  Millions were watching it.
[01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:52.865]  So, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:37:52.865 --> 01:37:58.908]  Now let's talk about supporting these guys, because I'm going to try to work with them to do limited prints of their work and get it out to fund their operation.
[01:37:58.908 --> 01:38:00.409]  I want to get other artists involved.
[01:38:00.409 --> 01:38:01.410]  I want to do this for years.
[01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:01.970]  I haven't done it.
[01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:02.971]  I want to launch something big.
[01:38:02.971 --> 01:38:06.573]  They're here to brainstorm with me to be part of that and many others.
[01:38:06.573 --> 01:38:10.255]  But Ben Garrison, GRRRGraphics.com.
[01:38:10.255 --> 01:38:11.936]  Sabo, UnsavoryAgents.com.
[01:38:13.342 --> 01:38:16.305]  We sell one of his little coffee table books of some of his best art of the election.
[01:38:16.305 --> 01:38:17.606]  But man, the stuff is so good.
[01:38:17.606 --> 01:38:19.888]  I want to have big coffee table books.
[01:38:19.888 --> 01:38:24.652]  I want to put out limited prints of what Sabo's doing to put it on my walls of my office.
[01:38:24.652 --> 01:38:28.635]  We already got Ben Garrison's stuff here for six, seven years up on our walls.
[01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:29.937]  That's how big a fan I am.
[01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:34.400]  So let's just briefly talk about you guys and some of the great art you have.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.043]  Because if you read the Clinton Foundation, not their big
[01:38:37.543 --> 01:38:43.680]  Corporate one, but their private library foundation judicial watch the world net daily sued four years ago and got the documents
[01:38:44.943 --> 01:39:04.207]  They were saying in 2000 and... They were saying in 2000... No, no, in 1993, they were saying, we've got to shut down any libertarian conservative or any other liberal groups that are organic, that have their own economy, their own products, books, newspapers, magazines, films, because that'll create their new culture.
[01:39:04.207 --> 01:39:04.987]  They understood that.
[01:39:04.987 --> 01:39:10.328]  So doing this and creating economic systems and ecosystems is how we defeat them.
[01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:11.668]  So let's... I want to get your views on that.
[01:39:12.793 --> 01:39:22.180]  Well, you remember that Hillary famously said, I think it was in the 90s, about the time you alluded to, that the internet needed an editor.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.902]  Well, guess who the editor would be?
[01:39:24.902 --> 01:39:28.325]  It would be, well, of course, people like Hillary Clinton.
[01:39:28.325 --> 01:39:31.227]  And what they want is a Chinese-style censorship.
[01:39:32.259 --> 01:39:35.361]  In which conservative voices are shut down.
[01:39:35.361 --> 01:39:40.504]  Oh, well, that's offensive, that's bullying, that's this, that, and the other, and you're not, you know, they pull the plug on us.
[01:39:40.504 --> 01:39:46.428]  And WikiLeaks, she was in there with all the papers and TV, actually like an editor herself and her staff.
[01:39:46.428 --> 01:39:47.008]  And guess what?
[01:39:47.008 --> 01:39:52.812]  You've got Zuckerberg, you know, basically kissing the butt of the Chinese dragon.
[01:39:52.812 --> 01:39:53.993]  He wants that here, too.
[01:39:53.993 --> 01:39:59.576]  He was really trying to butter Xi up so he could get Facebook and China and get all kinds of
[01:40:01.758 --> 01:40:02.940]  They can get it limited.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:05.063]  And these guys, I mean, come on.
[01:40:05.063 --> 01:40:10.171]  He goes to Hawaii and buys up 100 acres or so, and then what does he do?
[01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:11.693]  He first puts a big wall on it.
[01:40:11.693 --> 01:40:12.955]  So he has his privacy.
[01:40:12.955 --> 01:40:13.856]  He grabbed 6,000 acres of native land.
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:23.263]  So he puts up, first thing he does, he wants to protect his privacy and he gets to put a big giant wall up around his property.
[01:40:23.263 --> 01:40:26.104]  But we get no privacy whatsoever.
[01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:28.205]  We're exposed and we're for sale.
[01:40:28.205 --> 01:40:29.905]  That's the hypocrisy.
[01:40:29.905 --> 01:40:30.546]  We gave them that.
[01:40:30.546 --> 01:40:32.106]  We're asleep at the switch.
[01:40:32.106 --> 01:40:36.808]  We're too busy camping out, having barbecues, and they were too busy taking over everything.
[01:40:36.808 --> 01:40:41.290]  I mean, we have to start infiltrating these schools and every other damn thing the way they do.
[01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:44.452]  Well, that's one of the reasons I'm drawing the cartoons.
[01:40:44.452 --> 01:40:46.494]  I want to shake people out of their apathy.
[01:40:46.494 --> 01:40:53.420]  Here's the advantage of art over written or spoken words.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:58.704]  The words tend to appeal to the left brain and the rationality of everything.
[01:40:59.785 --> 01:41:06.091]  Art has a strong irrational component to it.
[01:41:06.091 --> 01:41:11.136]  And when you combine rational with irrational, if you can do that and get it nicely balanced,
[01:41:12.361 --> 01:41:14.662]  Then you've got something that's memorable.
[01:41:14.662 --> 01:41:22.583]  And too many, you know, in this world today, we're just inundated with visual noise constantly, and information noise too.
[01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:33.145]  So if you could produce a work of art that is memorable, and I'm not talking about just illustrating a headline or just going for a cheap gag, you know, I don't want to do a cartoon like that.
[01:41:33.145 --> 01:41:35.226]  Not staunch, but really thought-provoking.
[01:41:35.646 --> 01:41:43.572]  Yeah, well, you have to use a lot of different components and have some mention to the work of art for it to be memorable.
[01:41:43.572 --> 01:41:46.694]  One of them is irony, for example.
[01:41:46.694 --> 01:41:48.195]  You mentioned David Hogg.
[01:41:48.195 --> 01:41:51.117]  Well, I did a cartoon of him, and I showed him.
[01:41:51.117 --> 01:41:56.301]  I decided to portray him as something that he hates, so-called assault weapons.
[01:41:56.301 --> 01:42:00.804]  So I drew him as an assault weapon, and instead of bang, bang, he's saying ban, ban.
[01:42:00.804 --> 01:42:02.425]  So that's the way you get at him.
[01:42:02.425 --> 01:42:03.646]  And then people remembered that.
[01:42:03.646 --> 01:42:04.367]  That was a big hit.
[01:42:05.368 --> 01:42:07.209]  That's on Ben Garrison's site right now.
[01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:09.931]  Let's pull that up or we can just search engine.
[01:42:09.931 --> 01:42:10.551]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:42:10.551 --> 01:42:11.232]  Boom.
[01:42:11.232 --> 01:42:15.755]  Yeah, so people wrote me and they thought this really just devastates him.
[01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:21.560]  Because, and the irony again, is you turn him... Well, he's been calling for our speech to be taken too, Sabo.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.261]  I love that kid, man.
[01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:29.923]  It's like he's in high school, and there's nothing I love more than remembering what I was like when I was in high school.
[01:42:29.923 --> 01:42:36.505]  He's got the whole rest of his life to look back on and realize how much of a douche he was when he was a kid.
[01:42:36.505 --> 01:42:37.746]  Look at, my God.
[01:42:37.746 --> 01:42:40.167]  You talk about sanctimonious, man.
[01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:43.548]  Him and Comey.
[01:42:43.548 --> 01:42:46.169]  My private parts are thicker than his arms.
[01:42:47.119 --> 01:42:48.901]  Something's going on there.
[01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:50.862]  He needs some red pills is what he needs.
[01:42:50.862 --> 01:42:51.303]  Damn right.
[01:42:51.303 --> 01:42:53.685]  Let's send him a free bottle of red pills.
[01:42:53.685 --> 01:42:54.446]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:54.446 --> 01:42:54.906]  Stay with us.

[01:44:57.992 --> 01:45:02.395]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:02.395 --> 01:45:10.480]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.764]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:45:15.764 --> 01:45:18.305]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:45:18.305 --> 01:45:22.528]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:45:22.528 --> 01:45:24.970]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:32.877]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:45:32.877 --> 01:45:40.964]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:45:40.964 --> 01:45:48.151]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:45:48.151 --> 01:45:49.612]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:45:49.612 --> 01:45:51.414]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:52.214 --> 01:45:55.698]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:45:55.698 --> 01:45:58.100]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:04.566]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have at Infowarslife, it'd take hours.
[01:46:04.566 --> 01:46:07.009]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.009 --> 01:46:08.190]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.190 --> 01:46:09.791]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:11.012]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold.
[01:46:11.893 --> 01:46:12.254]  I think so.
[01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:36.456]  Super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:41.801]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:41.801 --> 01:46:43.202]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.202 --> 01:46:53.111]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.111 --> 01:46:56.174]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:00.723 --> 01:47:15.958]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.958 --> 01:47:19.682]  Ben Garrison, Sabo, they're in studio and I'm telling you folks,
[01:47:20.788 --> 01:47:32.904]  We create whole sites with free downloads in HD to put posters up, how-to's, you know, support people's art, support other young artists, old artists, female artists, and just make it about
[01:47:33.971 --> 01:47:35.692]  Street art, like they did in ancient Rome.
[01:47:35.692 --> 01:47:38.094]  That was the internet of Rome, was street art.
[01:47:38.094 --> 01:47:42.637]  And the government was always trying to get rid of the graffiti, but that's how the people actually communicated.
[01:47:42.637 --> 01:47:46.760]  And I'm saying, under an authoritarian regime, you hit the streets.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.441]  And in this way, boom, it's up.
[01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:49.441]  Boom, people see it.
[01:47:49.441 --> 01:47:50.842]  Boom, it has an effect.
[01:47:50.842 --> 01:47:51.983]  Don't do it on somebody's business.
[01:47:51.983 --> 01:47:53.164]  Don't do it on, you know, whatever.
[01:47:53.164 --> 01:47:56.146]  There's all sorts of places to do it, or do it on your own car.
[01:47:56.146 --> 01:48:02.050]  It doesn't hurt anything to put up a nice printed sticker that fits right, that peels off onto a park bench.
[01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:03.691]  Didn't take photos, put it on the internet.
[01:48:04.272 --> 01:48:05.313]  It goes viral.
[01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:06.174]  People there see it.
[01:48:06.174 --> 01:48:11.601]  It's about interfacing the real third dimension with silicon.
[01:48:11.601 --> 01:48:15.406]  And so that's what Sabo and Ben Garrison are talking about.
[01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:19.631]  Sabo, you were making some key points during the break and then Ben was making some really key points.
[01:48:19.631 --> 01:48:20.212]  Go ahead, Sabo.
[01:48:20.865 --> 01:48:21.465]  I don't know.
[01:48:39.758 --> 01:48:40.978]  Don't touch both the power lines.
[01:48:40.978 --> 01:48:42.099]  Don't go up the power lines, folks.
[01:48:42.099 --> 01:48:43.560]  You're not messing the power lines.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.382]  But I can tell you, I grew up thinking that the left loved art.
[01:48:46.382 --> 01:48:47.862]  You're not supposed to censor art.
[01:48:47.862 --> 01:48:50.004]  You're supposed to appreciate all art.
[01:48:50.004 --> 01:48:53.746]  It's like, if that's the case, why does my stuff only stay up on the street for an hour?
[01:48:53.746 --> 01:48:56.548]  Well, that's when they were using art to take over.
[01:48:56.548 --> 01:48:58.189]  And now they're like, no, no, no, no.
[01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:59.690]  We're with the Communist Chinese now.
[01:48:59.690 --> 01:49:00.290]  You don't get art.
[01:49:04.141 --> 01:49:06.142]  This is becoming a big problem, isn't it?
[01:49:06.142 --> 01:49:18.630]  I mean, the left wants to suppress free speech, and they want to offset it by giving people this lure, and the lure is free stuff.
[01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:26.355]  But let me tell you, this free stuff comes at the expense of freedom, and they don't seem to realize this.
[01:49:26.355 --> 01:49:31.419]  This republic we have is a very rare thing in the history of the world.
[01:49:31.419 --> 01:49:36.122]  It's something that's very dear and needs to be protected, and we shouldn't just be
[01:49:37.441 --> 01:49:40.826]  Just be apathetic sitting on our hands and giving it up willy-nilly.
[01:49:40.826 --> 01:49:51.139]  I mean, we have to start fighting and using our free speech and speaking out against socialism in all of its pernicious forms.
[01:49:51.139 --> 01:49:52.221]  That's what I try to do.
[01:49:52.221 --> 01:49:53.202]  I just despise
[01:49:54.984 --> 01:50:03.987]  The things that Bernie Sanders says, I despise the people who want us to give up our liberty and exchange it for security.
[01:50:03.987 --> 01:50:07.248]  We have to stop being afraid of losing our stuff.
[01:50:07.248 --> 01:50:14.210]  I mean, I'm somebody that, you know, I had a house, I had savings, I made bad investments, and I ended up going haywire, and next thing you know, I lost it all.
[01:50:14.210 --> 01:50:14.730]  And you know what?
[01:50:14.730 --> 01:50:15.630]  It's not that bad.
[01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:18.651]  I started over, and I had help.
[01:50:18.651 --> 01:50:19.792]  I had a lot of help from people.
[01:50:19.792 --> 01:50:23.053]  When I showed my cartoons, we started getting supporters on Patreon.
[01:50:23.053 --> 01:50:23.373]  I was like,
[01:50:24.073 --> 01:50:27.136]  I was like humbled, but also just amazed and excited.
[01:50:27.136 --> 01:50:32.602]  And we got a guy who came to us and said, you know, let me do your website for you.
[01:50:32.602 --> 01:50:35.004]  So we got a man, our webmaster.
[01:50:35.004 --> 01:50:35.805]  That's beautiful.
[01:50:35.805 --> 01:50:37.467]  Eric in Ohio.
[01:50:37.467 --> 01:50:39.188]  And we're building a community.
[01:50:39.188 --> 01:50:40.309]  We're building a culture.
[01:50:40.309 --> 01:50:40.369]  Yes.
[01:50:43.012 --> 01:50:55.238]  An animator, Paco Labelle, in Montreal, who's animated my cartoons, and he's done such a fantastic job, and we got such a great response from that, so we're excited about doing more animation.
[01:50:55.238 --> 01:51:00.601]  They're shutting us down because we're popular, we're winning, and we are the future, our listeners are the future.
[01:51:00.601 --> 01:51:03.022]  You made a key point during the break, and I want Sabo to comment on this.
[01:51:03.022 --> 01:51:04.923]  You guys are on fire during the breaks.
[01:51:04.923 --> 01:51:09.386]  You're doing great on air, but you're a little more subdued, obviously, here under the lights, but you were talking about
[01:51:10.006 --> 01:51:12.407]  Tyranny worldwide, it's here, and your friend in Germany.
[01:51:12.407 --> 01:51:21.012]  Well, I have a friend in Germany who's about my age, and he and his family visited us in Montana about four years ago.
[01:51:21.012 --> 01:51:37.080]  But he has just lived this endless, and he just despises Merkel, but he's lived the endless immigration into his country that's changing the very fiber of what German culture used to be.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:44.304]  And we know that he's also afraid to speak out because you could be fined, you could be sent to jail.
[01:51:44.304 --> 01:51:46.766]  Look what they're doing to some people in England.
[01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:49.488]  They're fining them and jailing them just for having an opinion.
[01:51:49.488 --> 01:51:52.790]  We can't let that come to America because they want that to come here too.
[01:51:53.530 --> 01:52:06.639]  So, everybody can do something, and that's, you know, many years ago Alex Jones said that on air, and I was thinking, well, yeah, he's right, I'm, you know, my dad was a World War II veteran, he was in many battles, what have I done?
[01:52:06.639 --> 01:52:07.179]  Nothing!
[01:52:07.179 --> 01:52:08.740]  All I did was pay my taxes.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:16.845]  I'm very proud of the fact that you, when we first talked like six years ago, you said I inspired you, and I've been a little bit brask, I've had my issues, I'm not perfect.
[01:52:16.845 --> 01:52:17.546]  Oh, I'm not either.
[01:52:17.546 --> 01:52:20.348]  But it's kind of like the squeaky wheel and everything, I've been a train wreck,
[01:52:20.788 --> 01:52:24.511]  But the train wreck, so many people I've talked to said, you inspired me.
[01:52:24.511 --> 01:52:26.273]  You already knew more than I knew in many ways.
[01:52:26.273 --> 01:52:29.215]  But I inspired you and others to take action.
[01:52:29.215 --> 01:52:30.176]  I'm most proud of that.
[01:52:30.176 --> 01:52:32.898]  I got a little bit late started, but it doesn't matter.
[01:52:32.898 --> 01:52:34.119]  You've got to start.
[01:52:34.119 --> 01:52:36.281]  Everybody can do something.
[01:52:36.281 --> 01:52:40.364]  Even if you're just talking to your neighbor, just make everybody aware that
[01:52:41.385 --> 01:52:51.447]  You know, we've got something very special, and it needs to be protected, and that's our republic and our constitution, and I don't want to see that go away and be replaced by collectivism.
[01:52:51.447 --> 01:52:53.287]  Which always collapses!
[01:52:53.287 --> 01:52:54.468]  It's a nightmare!
[01:52:54.468 --> 01:53:01.469]  Well, right now they're trying to push naked democracy on us, and this really bothers me.
[01:53:01.469 --> 01:53:05.310]  I want everybody out there to start listening to what the left says, and they always say the same thing.
[01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:07.451]  They want direct democracy.
[01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:44.713]  Our whole republic was based on having the cities and the rural balanced and not having a dominant overpopulated state dominate a rural state.
[01:53:44.713 --> 01:53:44.933]  Right.
[01:53:44.933 --> 01:53:46.194]  We're in the United States.
[01:53:46.194 --> 01:53:49.075]  We're not the United blob of Washington, D.C.
[01:53:49.075 --> 01:53:51.736]  We're not the United Coastal Elites.
[01:53:51.736 --> 01:53:52.397]  Exactly.
[01:53:52.397 --> 01:53:55.738]  So the states should have say.
[01:53:55.738 --> 01:53:57.899]  But Bill Maher says, well, why does Montana have
[01:53:58.499 --> 01:54:02.862]  You know, they'd hardly have any people there at all, but they have two Senators, so why does California have two Senators?
[01:54:02.862 --> 01:54:04.883]  We should have a lot more Senators than Montana.
[01:54:04.883 --> 01:54:06.004]  And let's explain.
[01:54:06.004 --> 01:54:11.688]  They've all got more House members, but for the Senate there's that check and balance on population.
[01:54:11.688 --> 01:54:13.209]  This is all super smart.
[01:54:13.209 --> 01:54:19.273]  Why should people in some super far away area be controlled by some far off king of England?
[01:54:19.273 --> 01:54:20.574]  We don't want to have this happen again.
[01:54:20.894 --> 01:54:22.215]  I'm tripping out on Germany.
[01:54:22.215 --> 01:54:23.595]  They've gone full circle.
[01:54:23.595 --> 01:54:31.679]  They went from the whole Hitler thing to, you can't say Hitler anymore, and now they're inviting all these people who hate Jews and want to kill Jews.
[01:54:31.679 --> 01:54:35.560]  Yeah, they're telling Jews in Germany and Sweden and everywhere, don't wear your yarmulkes.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.261]  Yeah, so they've gone full circle.
[01:54:37.261 --> 01:54:41.183]  So welcome your new Nazis, Germany.
[01:54:41.183 --> 01:54:43.804]  I used to love, I was enamored by Europeans.
[01:54:43.804 --> 01:54:44.664]  I grew up in the country.
[01:54:44.664 --> 01:54:47.206]  I was like, you had a French or English accent.
[01:54:47.206 --> 01:54:48.206]  It was awesome.
[01:54:48.206 --> 01:54:50.367]  Now it's like, what happened to you people?
[01:54:50.447 --> 01:54:52.109]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:55.251]  They had wars in Europe in the last 300 years that killed most of the population.
[01:54:55.251 --> 01:54:57.473]  And I'm sorry, a lot of wimps got left.
[01:54:57.473 --> 01:55:00.015]  I'm not saying all the men are wimps in Europe.
[01:55:00.015 --> 01:55:01.837]  It's just people have been slapped down.
[01:55:01.837 --> 01:55:03.338]  It's just like they did what Hitler said.
[01:55:03.338 --> 01:55:08.323]  Look at this, a 74-year-old Swedish woman, prosecuted for criticizing mass immigration.
[01:55:08.323 --> 01:55:12.466]  Well, I'm sorry, every Muslim country sided with Hitler in World War II.
[01:55:12.466 --> 01:55:15.469]  So you say, wow, why is Germany siding with Islam?
[01:55:15.469 --> 01:55:16.710]  Hitler sided with Islam.
[01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:17.771]  He didn't like Christianity.
[01:55:18.433 --> 01:55:24.997]  Yeah, if I ever get a dog, I'm going to teach him to zeig heil, just like that guy in the UK.
[01:55:24.997 --> 01:55:34.222]  Oh yeah, Count Dankula is like a libertarian liberal doing a joke that Charlie Chaplin could do, or John Cleese could do, but he's facing years in prison.
[01:55:34.222 --> 01:55:38.104]  He's been convicted, sentencing's coming up, for having a pug say, Heil Hitler.
[01:55:39.577 --> 01:55:48.386]  And they want to throw you in jail too, or some of them want to, like Al Gore wants to make sure that you get prosecuted for questioning his climate change scheme.
[01:55:48.386 --> 01:55:50.167]  Or that he invented the damn internet!
[01:55:50.167 --> 01:55:53.270]  I had the Secret Service knock on my door for some tweets.
[01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:58.736]  It's like, I can't wait for them to bust my door down at 3 o'clock in the morning because I posted something on Facebook.
[01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:01.679]  It's incredible.
[01:56:01.679 --> 01:56:04.460]  But then Madonna can say, I'm gonna blow the White House up.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:05.060]  It's okay.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.502]  Yeah, you know, when I heard that the Secret Service came, they left a little door hanger.
[01:56:09.502 --> 01:56:11.602]  They said, oh, well, the Secret Service gives a call.
[01:56:11.602 --> 01:56:12.843]  I was scared at first.
[01:56:12.843 --> 01:56:14.823]  For like two seconds, I was scared.
[01:56:14.823 --> 01:56:17.264]  Then I said something about Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:56:17.264 --> 01:56:18.044]  I said, screw that.
[01:56:18.044 --> 01:56:20.305]  When they come back tomorrow, I went to Kinko's.
[01:56:20.305 --> 01:56:23.085]  I printed really big the word Oswald.
[01:56:23.085 --> 01:56:27.086]  And I literally papered my whole apartment with that word.
[01:56:27.086 --> 01:56:28.507]  I put my AR against the wall.
[01:56:29.427 --> 01:56:33.989]  And I opened the windows, I said, you guys can't come inside, but you can interview me from outside.
[01:56:33.989 --> 01:56:35.529]  And I had a blast.
[01:56:35.529 --> 01:56:37.390]  It was great.
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:38.310]  This is a good point, though.
[01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:39.771]  They want you to be in fear.
[01:56:39.771 --> 01:56:41.991]  I mean, this is the whole point of this.
[01:56:41.991 --> 01:56:43.872]  Yeah, they're trying to bully us.
[01:56:43.872 --> 01:56:46.173]  I don't know about everybody else.
[01:56:46.173 --> 01:56:46.933]  I'm not going to be bullied.
[01:56:48.761 --> 01:57:00.807]  Well, we started getting bullied in 1913 with the 16th Amendment when they started wanting to incriminate ourselves and sign our name to a form and give up direct taxes, which were unconstitutional.
[01:57:00.807 --> 01:57:06.130]  And this has gotten so bad now that we're working as slaves for the government one-third of the year.
[01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:16.677]  And people will fill it out, and they're afraid, because the IRS, they know the IRS can come and seize their goods at any time, and they've got to fill out all this stuff.
[01:57:16.677 --> 01:57:31.368]  But they want you, this is one of the reasons why we have that, because they want us to be, it's a form of mind control, and fear is a good... And that's what Kanye West is saying, he says, you're not going to use your threats of fear, you're not going to intimidate me to manipulate my free thought.
[01:57:31.368 --> 01:57:32.009]  That's his latest thing.
[01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:36.135]  Yo, I was here in Austin a couple weeks ago, and I was shocked.
[01:57:36.135 --> 01:57:37.818]  Three bars asked us to leave.
[01:57:37.818 --> 01:57:38.779]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:57:38.779 --> 01:57:43.366]  We were going to play this exclusive Kanye West UT interview we did with UT folks.
[01:57:43.366 --> 01:57:45.049]  We'll play that at the first five minutes of the next hour.
[01:57:45.049 --> 01:57:46.531]  We're going to come back and finish up in a moment.
[01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:57.837]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.898]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.898 --> 01:58:02.760]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.261]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.261 --> 01:58:07.383]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.623 --> 01:58:11.066]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.066 --> 01:58:13.147]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.147 --> 01:58:22.855]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.855 --> 01:58:35.384]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:58:35.424 --> 01:58:39.670]  To reignite those rush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:42.975]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.975 --> 01:58:46.580]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Shield, at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:58:48.157 --> 01:58:50.960]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:59:01.429]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:59:01.429 --> 01:59:02.230]  Scalability.
[01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:04.552]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:59:04.552 --> 01:59:06.213]  So there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:59:10.357 --> 01:59:13.139]  It's the other side of the equation.
[01:59:13.139 --> 01:59:22.745]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[01:59:22.745 --> 01:59:25.807]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[01:59:25.807 --> 01:59:31.591]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:59:31.591 --> 01:59:37.555]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:59:38.015 --> 01:59:40.836]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:59:40.836 --> 01:59:51.762]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[01:59:51.762 --> 01:59:54.343]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.922 --> 02:00:14.490]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:14.490 --> 02:00:16.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.632 --> 02:00:18.915]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:18.915 --> 02:00:23.380]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:00:27.381 --> 02:00:28.301]  Nazis come get out!
[02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:28.381]  Bye!
[02:00:52.339 --> 02:00:57.581]  That's Milo, a gay Jewish man who is a libertarian conservative that hates Nazis.
[02:00:57.581 --> 02:00:58.701]  He is not the alt-right.
[02:00:58.701 --> 02:01:01.783]  Well, they're not even really Nazis, but he's new right.
[02:01:01.783 --> 02:01:03.463]  A nice guy, a friend of mine.
[02:01:03.463 --> 02:01:08.565]  There's Milo being run out of a New York restaurant bar, which the federal judges ruled.
[02:01:08.565 --> 02:01:09.946]  You can kick conservatives out of your business.
[02:01:11.374 --> 02:01:13.175]  So, that's this discrimination.
[02:01:13.175 --> 02:01:15.255]  You just brought that up, Sabo.
[02:01:15.255 --> 02:01:16.415]  You were here in Austin two weeks ago.
[02:01:16.415 --> 02:01:17.255]  What happened to you?
[02:01:17.255 --> 02:01:19.276]  I almost want to go to some bars with you.
[02:01:19.276 --> 02:01:21.036]  We're already going to dinner tonight.
[02:01:21.036 --> 02:01:23.697]  I almost want to go to some places with you and like videotape this.
[02:01:23.697 --> 02:01:26.977]  Because, I mean, I want to just sit there and say, wow, we're just Nazi scum.
[02:01:26.977 --> 02:01:27.858]  Because you're with Alex Jones.
[02:01:27.858 --> 02:01:29.618]  You don't even know what I stand for.
[02:01:29.618 --> 02:01:31.978]  But the news says I'm a Nazi.
[02:01:31.978 --> 02:01:33.459]  And like you said, your dad, World War II.
[02:01:33.459 --> 02:01:36.179]  Both my grandfathers almost died in World War II.
[02:01:36.179 --> 02:01:37.499]  One crash landed.
[02:01:37.499 --> 02:01:39.200]  The other had heat stroke.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.765]  And didn't go up the next week as a pilot and the plane got blown up over France.
[02:01:44.765 --> 02:01:45.866]  I mean over Italy.
[02:01:45.866 --> 02:01:47.008]  They were out of North Africa.
[02:01:47.008 --> 02:01:48.629]  He was in the North African invasion.
[02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:50.231]  He was in the Italian invasion.
[02:01:50.231 --> 02:01:50.852]  Almost died.
[02:01:50.852 --> 02:01:52.734]  I almost don't exist because of Hitler.
[02:01:52.734 --> 02:01:57.499]  And then George Soros, an admitted Nazi collaborator, runs the movement trying to kill our free speech.
[02:01:57.499 --> 02:02:01.103]  And the EU run by Juncker, the grandson of the head of the Nazis under Hitler.
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:09.123]  Yeah, I grew up in Louisiana for a few years and I was called a wetback here and there, and now all of a sudden I'm a Nazi.
[02:02:09.123 --> 02:02:11.684]  When the hell did that happen?
[02:02:11.684 --> 02:02:21.328]  And what really bums me out is I flew into Texas a couple weeks ago, Texas of all places, here in Austin, and three bars said, we don't want your kind here.
[02:02:21.328 --> 02:02:23.889]  Because a guy had a MAGA hat on.
[02:02:24.289 --> 02:02:25.430]  We don't want your kind here!
[02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:27.251]  I'm like, what kind are you talking about?
[02:02:27.251 --> 02:02:29.253]  I have the death sentence on 12 systems!
[02:02:29.253 --> 02:02:43.003]  You know, there used to be a time when the left, you know, they were all about independence, they were all about all these, you know, about the individual, and now it's like, if you're not loving on the big government, you're, which doesn't even make sense, somehow you're a Nazi.
[02:02:43.543 --> 02:02:49.506]  They're the Nazis, a cult of aggressive people, because you're wearing Make America Great Again.
[02:02:49.506 --> 02:02:50.326]  It's insane.
[02:02:50.326 --> 02:02:52.887]  Even worse, they're communists.
[02:02:52.887 --> 02:02:54.448]  It's like, how many people do the communists wear?
[02:02:54.448 --> 02:02:56.049]  With smartphones.
[02:02:56.049 --> 02:02:58.670]  I notice that conservatives usually aren't wearing really fancy clothes.
[02:02:58.670 --> 02:03:01.511]  I mean, I'm on TV, so I'm wearing a jacket I've been wearing for five years.
[02:03:01.511 --> 02:03:02.431]  I love this baby.
[02:03:02.431 --> 02:03:03.792]  This is like a $400 jacket.
[02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:09.697]  The left is always wearing, like, super fancy everything, and the conservatives are just working in art.
[02:03:09.697 --> 02:03:15.261]  I mean, it's like they've got fancy phones, they've got all this crap that capitalism made, but they say they hate it.
[02:03:15.261 --> 02:03:17.963]  And look at all those people that were yelling at Milo.
[02:03:17.963 --> 02:03:19.064]  I mean, come on.
[02:03:19.064 --> 02:03:21.046]  They look like university professors.
[02:03:21.046 --> 02:03:23.288]  They look like these fat, blue-haired women.
[02:03:23.288 --> 02:03:26.310]  It's like, why are we allowing these nerds to push us around?
[02:03:27.091 --> 02:03:32.694]  Well, the universities are really nothing more than socialist indoctrination centers now.
[02:03:32.694 --> 02:03:33.635]  Yeah, they're the cancer.
[02:03:33.635 --> 02:03:42.020]  They're the cult of anti-free speech that's now like a virus takes over a cell, replicates, and so now the cells are busting and the viruses are coming out.
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:43.381]  Let's have fun with it, man.
[02:03:43.381 --> 02:03:46.483]  Milo should have ordered another beer and just stood there and flipped them off.
[02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:53.872]  Well, you know, I did a cartoon that's kind of in alignment with what we were just talking about.
[02:03:53.872 --> 02:04:03.920]  I drew a really fancy, you know, super expensive water fountain that's, you know, pumping out pure water, but it's for liberals only, left only.
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:10.306]  And then I drew a really kind of a downtrodden, rusted old, you know, water fountain conservatives.
[02:04:10.946 --> 02:04:12.187]  And that's how it was for blacks.
[02:04:12.187 --> 02:04:13.548]  Yeah.
[02:04:13.548 --> 02:04:17.232]  I used that liberal leftist meme and flipped it.
[02:04:17.232 --> 02:04:21.535]  So I like flipping their own stuff and then, hey, you're doing this to conservatives now.
[02:04:21.535 --> 02:04:22.136]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:04:22.136 --> 02:04:28.001]  You're going to be on The War Room coming up with, of course, Roger Stone and with Owen Schroyer.
[02:04:28.001 --> 02:04:29.022]  That's at 3 o'clock.
[02:04:29.782 --> 02:04:34.365]  We've got huge Paul Watson analysis of how we are the new counterculture.
[02:04:34.365 --> 02:04:36.186]  Restoring the Republic coming up.
[02:04:36.186 --> 02:04:39.308]  Shabo, Ben Garrison, amazing jobs.
[02:04:39.308 --> 02:04:41.910]  Again, unsavoryagents.com is Shabo.
[02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:44.932]  Graphics.com, grrgraphics.com.
[02:04:44.932 --> 02:04:46.152]  And I'm, that's Ben Garrison.
[02:04:46.152 --> 02:04:50.455]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[02:04:50.455 --> 02:04:52.156]  And of course we now launch InfoWars Europe.
[02:04:52.156 --> 02:04:53.797]  We'll tell you more about that in the near future.
[02:04:53.797 --> 02:04:55.218]  A Kit Daniels, Dan Lyman project.
[02:04:56.403 --> 02:04:59.825]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:03.786]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.786 --> 02:05:07.128]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:07.128 --> 02:05:09.669]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:14.391]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:14.391 --> 02:05:16.732]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:16.732 --> 02:05:23.135]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:23.755 --> 02:05:31.940]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:37.003]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:37.003 --> 02:05:43.988]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:05:44.628 --> 02:05:49.552]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[02:05:49.552 --> 02:05:52.455]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:57.657 --> 02:05:58.778]  You got it.
[02:05:58.778 --> 02:06:04.461]  The transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:04.461 --> 02:06:07.063]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.063 --> 02:06:10.024]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.024 --> 02:06:10.845]  I would just roll it.
[02:06:10.845 --> 02:06:14.487]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:18.840]  I think.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:41.183]  The old punk rock was a subculture of anti-establishment teenagers screaming into a microphone about being misunderstood and underrepresented.
[02:06:41.183 --> 02:06:45.125]  The new punk rock is just as cool and just as anti-establishment.
[02:06:45.125 --> 02:06:47.566]  And even the lamestream media agrees.
[02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:50.688]  Of course, technically the right controls, like the whole establishment.
[02:06:50.688 --> 02:06:51.568]  Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.
[02:06:51.568 --> 02:06:56.290]  My entire argument is that conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:58.831]  You just listed branches of government.
[02:06:58.831 --> 02:07:02.113]  Hate to break it to you, but none of those are cultural institutions.
[02:07:02.253 --> 02:07:05.855]  The government doesn't control the output of cultural institutions.
[02:07:05.855 --> 02:07:12.198]  God only knows what you're talking about, but I'm talking about Hollywood, the music industry, Silicon Valley, and academia.
[02:07:12.198 --> 02:07:14.559]  They're the high priests of pop culture.
[02:07:14.559 --> 02:07:22.323]  Not Mike Pence, not CPAC, which I specifically said was not representative of counterculture over a year ago.
[02:07:22.323 --> 02:07:27.286]  Then you imply that when I say counterculture or punk, I'm talking about the GOP establishment.
[02:07:27.386 --> 02:07:32.590]  When in another part of the very video you played, I say the exact opposite.
[02:07:32.590 --> 02:07:36.653]  And obviously I don't mean conservatism like Mitch McConnell conservatism.
[02:07:36.653 --> 02:07:39.295]  I'm not talking about old establishment Republicans.
[02:07:39.295 --> 02:07:45.619]  So in the very first 30 seconds, you've tried to spin it by falsely framing the entire argument.
[02:07:45.619 --> 02:07:52.044]  Conservatism is punk rock because, um, I think
[02:07:53.121 --> 02:07:57.845]  Oh, you edited some people together to make it look like they had no clue what they were talking about.
[02:07:57.845 --> 02:08:02.890]  Because Comedy Central doesn't do that to literally everyone they're trying to demonize, do they?
[02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:03.830]  How original.
[02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:07.474]  You wanna know why conservatism is the new counterculture?
[02:08:07.474 --> 02:08:08.534]  Well, listen up.
[02:08:08.534 --> 02:08:14.840]  Decades ago, it was the right who shut down offensive, edgy speech, music, comedy, movies, and art.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:18.383]  They were the ones who no-platformed controversial speech.
[02:08:18.383 --> 02:08:20.204]  Who are the new authoritarians?
[02:08:20.204 --> 02:08:21.885]  Who are the new Puritans?
[02:08:21.885 --> 02:08:28.270]  Who's trying to shut down offensive, edgy speech, music, comedy, movies and art today?
[02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:29.091]  The left.
[02:08:29.091 --> 02:08:30.732]  Who literally riots?
[02:08:31.132 --> 02:08:33.974]  To shut down controversial ideas now.
[02:08:33.974 --> 02:08:34.855]  The left.
[02:08:34.855 --> 02:08:36.957]  You control popular culture.
[02:08:36.957 --> 02:08:40.720]  You viciously police the boundaries of acceptable speech.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.564]  And anyone who dares express diversity of thought is ostracized and shunned.
[02:08:45.564 --> 02:08:47.285]  And that's not very punk.
[02:08:47.285 --> 02:08:53.450]  Why do you think contrarians like Jordan Peterson who rail against identity politics are the
[02:08:54.671 --> 02:09:02.815]  Why do you think my biggest demographic is 18-35 year olds, while CNN's average viewer is 60?
[02:09:02.815 --> 02:09:08.018]  Why do you think Generation Z is the most conservative generation since World War II?
[02:09:08.018 --> 02:09:14.302]  These kids are sick of being subjected to the endless, joyless guilt trip that is identity politics.
[02:09:14.302 --> 02:09:19.505]  The endless moralizing about the parameters of acceptable speech and what they can and can't say.
[02:09:19.665 --> 02:09:28.629]  I get messages every day from teenagers in schools and universities who tell me that the new edgy avant-garde thing to be is anti-left wing.
[02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:30.970]  It's seen as a form of rebellion.
[02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:35.372]  I speak to people who work inside universities who tell me exactly the same thing.
[02:09:35.372 --> 02:09:40.474]  Safe spaces, trigger warnings, literally being afraid of the discussion of new ideas.
[02:09:40.934 --> 02:09:42.655]  That's not very punk, is it?
[02:09:42.655 --> 02:09:46.517]  These kids tell me my content is the new counterculture.
[02:09:46.517 --> 02:09:49.719]  But Comedy Central says that's just not the case.
[02:09:49.719 --> 02:09:51.940]  Right, so who owns Comedy Central?
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:59.404]  Oh, look, it's Viacom, a multinational media conglomerate owned by lifetime Democratic donor Sumner Redstone.
[02:09:59.404 --> 02:10:07.209]  So a network owned by a giant global corporation, which in turn is owned by a 94-year-old billionaire.
[02:10:07.209 --> 02:10:09.670]  They're the final authority on what's cool.
[02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:13.033]  They get the final say on what's counterculture.
[02:10:13.033 --> 02:10:14.133]  Give me a break!
[02:10:14.133 --> 02:10:17.256]  You're an integral part of the establishment.
[02:10:17.256 --> 02:10:21.739]  So where do you get off lecturing your audience on what's anti-establishment?
[02:10:21.739 --> 02:10:26.523]  I mean, I'm no spring chicken, but your boss looks like he's really down with the kids, doesn't he?
[02:10:26.523 --> 02:10:29.345]  What's another defining aspect of counterculture?
[02:10:29.345 --> 02:10:30.826]  Political street art.
[02:10:30.826 --> 02:10:35.690]  What's the nature of the only noteworthy political street art that we see now?
[02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:36.531]  Oh!
[02:10:36.531 --> 02:10:36.611]  Oh!
[02:10:37.391 --> 02:10:38.192]  Oh!
[02:10:38.192 --> 02:10:38.992]  Oh!
[02:10:38.992 --> 02:10:39.933]  Oh!
[02:10:39.933 --> 02:10:40.173]  Oh!
[02:10:40.173 --> 02:10:48.137]  So then they drag out this rotund punk singer from a band that I've never heard of to lecture us all on what it means to be punk.
[02:10:48.137 --> 02:10:49.498]  You're not punks.
[02:10:49.498 --> 02:10:53.621]  You've co-opted the language from punk rock, but it doesn't make you punk.
[02:10:53.621 --> 02:11:06.228]  Meanwhile, the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten, you know, one of the true originators of punk, frames Brexit and Trump in the context of populism, in the context of true anti-establishment rebellion.
[02:11:06.288 --> 02:11:07.990]  Where do I stand on Brexit?
[02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:09.271]  Well, here it goes.
[02:11:09.271 --> 02:11:11.513]  The working class have spoke.
[02:11:11.513 --> 02:11:13.214]  And I'm one of them, and I'm with them.
[02:11:13.214 --> 02:11:14.075]  The Donald.
[02:11:14.075 --> 02:11:19.440]  As one journalist once said to me, is he the political sex pistol?
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:19.941]  In a way.
[02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:20.701]  In a way.
[02:11:20.701 --> 02:11:28.348]  But what I dislike is the left-wing media in America are trying to smear the bloke as a racist, and that's completely not true.
[02:11:28.348 --> 02:11:30.130]  He terrifies politicians.
[02:11:30.931 --> 02:11:32.552]  This is joy to behold.
[02:11:32.552 --> 02:11:35.794]  Right, I mean that very much is the Sex Pistols thing, anti-establishment.
[02:11:35.794 --> 02:11:40.017]  He is the absolutely archetypal anti-establishment character.
[02:11:40.017 --> 02:11:45.041]  I'm gonna take the opinion of Johnny Rotten over some obese nobody in a garage band.
[02:11:45.041 --> 02:11:49.044]  Again, the Sex Pistols were no-platformed for being offensive.
[02:11:51.175 --> 02:11:54.901]  Who's doing the no-platforming of offensive speech now?
[02:11:54.901 --> 02:11:55.802]  Yeah, that's you guys!
[02:11:55.802 --> 02:11:57.284]  And that's not very punk.
[02:12:06.237 --> 02:12:08.979]  You know, I've been listening to a lot of my favorite commentators on YouTube.
[02:12:08.979 --> 02:12:12.561]  They are saying that, like, our movement is punk.
[02:12:12.561 --> 02:12:14.722]  Can you name, like, a single punk band?
[02:12:14.722 --> 02:12:16.023]  Oh, I hate punk music.
[02:12:16.023 --> 02:12:18.665]  I just want to say controversial stuff that gets my attention.
[02:12:18.665 --> 02:12:24.749]  Right, so they're implying that I'm faking an interest in punk music, and I'm only saying this now to get attention.
[02:12:24.929 --> 02:12:26.430]  Oh, but what's this?
[02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:40.300]  The Daily Beast reports on my old school friends from over 20 years ago saying that I, as a 13-year-old, was into the Sex Pistols, alternative music, smoking, and generally being punk.
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:41.641]  Yeah, who's punk now, bitches?
[02:12:41.641 --> 02:12:44.183]  Punk has always been a fairly inclusive place.
[02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:48.264]  The clash you have, songs are talking about anti-racism, they're talking about anti-fascism.
[02:12:48.264 --> 02:12:56.566]  Well, you have bands like the Bad Brains, a group of black kids in DC, Riot Grrrl, women that felt underrepresented or not represented at all by people of different sexualities, trans people.
[02:12:56.566 --> 02:13:09.789]  Right, so because some punk bands decades ago pushed identity politics, which back then they did with, let's be fair, some merit and pure motivation, that means the modern counterculture should be about pushing identity politics.
[02:13:09.889 --> 02:13:17.054]  Literally every dominant establishment, cultural institution pushes identity politics.
[02:13:17.054 --> 02:13:22.577]  So how on earth can it be anti-establishment and punk to push identity politics?
[02:13:22.577 --> 02:13:30.723]  Again, Jordan Peterson, he's the antithesis of identity politics and he's treated like a rock star by young people.
[02:13:30.723 --> 02:13:31.644]  He's punk.
[02:13:31.644 --> 02:13:39.889]  The very reason the establishment is freaking out now about Kanye is that he's encouraging black people to get off the reservation of identity politics.
[02:13:40.409 --> 02:13:43.251]  Identity politics is the establishment.
[02:13:43.251 --> 02:13:46.093]  Identity politics is the dominant culture.
[02:13:46.093 --> 02:13:51.716]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture at the same time, idiots!
[02:13:51.716 --> 02:14:01.862]  All across Europe, the age group of voters powering populist parties, parties that reject identity politics, is getting younger and younger.
[02:14:06.643 --> 02:14:12.306]  So again, we see this attempt to portray the right as joyless Puritans who can't have fun.
[02:14:12.306 --> 02:14:18.269]  Yet it's the left who consistently act like joyless Puritans and literally try to ban fun.
[02:14:18.269 --> 02:14:22.872]  Whether it be cheerleaders, offensive songs, topless models, or free speech.
[02:14:22.872 --> 02:14:24.593]  You're the new censors.
[02:14:24.593 --> 02:14:26.374]  You're the new Puritans.
[02:14:26.954 --> 02:14:28.335]  And that's not very punk.
[02:14:28.335 --> 02:14:36.362]  Being owned by a monolithic transnational corporation and a 94-year-old billionaire, that's not very punk.
[02:14:36.362 --> 02:14:51.275]  Using these vast resources to create an entire TV series, which has appallingly average reviews by the way, based almost exclusively on demonizing Infowars, a far smaller independent media outlet, that's not very punk either.
[02:14:51.275 --> 02:14:53.637]  And by the way, there's another reason why the left lost
[02:14:53.837 --> 02:15:02.380]  I don't mean to sound the alarm, but... You stopped being funny because you stopped taking risks and you started placing more importance on being politically correct.
[02:15:16.954 --> 02:15:17.675]  Who've you got?
[02:15:17.675 --> 02:15:19.717]  Amy Schumer talking about her vagina.
[02:15:19.717 --> 02:15:20.117]  Again!
[02:15:39.016 --> 02:15:40.618]  You're just not funny.
[02:15:40.618 --> 02:15:42.501]  And you're not counterculture either.
[02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:46.947]  You're literally owned by a guy who has more wrinkles than an elephant's butt.
[02:15:46.947 --> 02:15:50.452]  You've lost 15 million viewers over the last 10 years.
[02:15:50.452 --> 02:15:51.874]  You're dying on your arse.
[02:15:51.874 --> 02:15:53.697]  You're not resonating with young people.
[02:15:53.697 --> 02:15:55.059]  Your audience is getting older.
[02:15:55.419 --> 02:15:58.141]  Bacon lovers, we ship free.

[02:19:59.372 --> 02:20:13.557]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.557 --> 02:20:17.538]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now a special report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:20:18.433 --> 02:20:26.835]  In a watershed moment for the culture war, Kanye West praised conservative commentator Candace Owens in a tweet saying, And how did Twitter react?
[02:20:26.835 --> 02:20:29.676]  By failing to even spell Owens' name properly and calling her,
[02:20:35.598 --> 02:20:36.699]  Far-right!
[02:20:36.699 --> 02:20:47.146]  They're going to call a former left-wing, now centre-right, black conservative who is hated by the actual far-right, far-right, then all bets are now off.
[02:20:47.146 --> 02:20:50.869]  And then the usual blue checkmarks piled in with their lies and hatred.
[02:20:50.869 --> 02:21:00.596]  Candace Owens is a far-right media personality who got famous by appearing on the conspiracy site InfoWars and calling herself a red pill black, a term popularised on the alt-right men's rights message board that is basically an antonym for woke.
[02:21:00.816 --> 02:21:01.697]  Wrong, idiot.
[02:21:01.697 --> 02:21:06.720]  She got famous by communicating a message of actual empowerment for black people.
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.302]  So save us the glib whitesplaining, please.
[02:21:09.302 --> 02:21:13.024]  Talking of whitesplaining, Sean King whined about it, too.
[02:21:13.024 --> 02:21:17.647]  Yeah, how are you going to accuse Kanye of being an Uncle Tom when you're whiter than Rachel Dolezal?
[02:21:17.647 --> 02:21:18.288]  Blip!
[02:21:18.288 --> 02:21:21.090]  So precisely how does Candace Owens think?
[02:21:21.090 --> 02:21:27.614]  Well, she tells black people not to be victims, not to be dependent on welfare, and not to blame society for all their problems.
[02:21:27.794 --> 02:21:33.436]  The truth is that the left wants to strap black people to this idea that they are victims.
[02:21:33.436 --> 02:21:34.497]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:21:34.497 --> 02:21:36.558]  They do not want black people focused on their futures.
[02:21:36.558 --> 02:21:38.679]  They want black people focused on their past.
[02:21:38.679 --> 02:21:40.780]  They like black people to be government dependent.
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:44.061]  They don't like to see black people that are free thinkers and are independent.
[02:21:44.061 --> 02:21:48.483]  I think that's what Kanye West and myself represents, the black community, and that makes them very nervous.
[02:21:48.683 --> 02:21:51.805]  That correlates exactly with Kanye's new outlook.
[02:21:51.805 --> 02:22:04.972]  Remember, Kanye met with Trump to talk about tackling black-on-black violence in Chicago, something that the left and Black Lives Matter supporters refused to incorporate into their message because it doesn't fit their race-baiting victimhood narrative.
[02:22:04.972 --> 02:22:14.798]  Kanye has also exposed how the left fans the flames of hysteria over racism to metaphorically keep black people on the plantation, to keep them docile and easily controlled.
[02:22:14.918 --> 02:22:18.022]  Racism is a dated concept.
[02:22:18.022 --> 02:22:22.446]  It's not an actual thing that even means anything.
[02:22:22.446 --> 02:22:35.721]  You know, it's something that was used to hold people back in the past, but now there's been so many leaps and breaking of the rules that it's like, it's played out like, you know, like a style from the, you know,
[02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.923]  1800s or something.
[02:22:38.923 --> 02:22:45.787]  You know, the real true freedom isn't in the words, the true freedom is in the opportunity.
[02:22:45.787 --> 02:22:55.652]  Kanye West represents a massive threat to the left because he has an army of adoring fans and he's clearly done with being a puppet for their divisive agenda.
[02:22:55.652 --> 02:23:00.315]  After this, he's going to be relentlessly attacked by the establishment like never before.
[02:23:00.595 --> 02:23:01.296]  Get ready.
[02:23:01.296 --> 02:23:12.887]  The mainstream entertainment industry is so stale, so controlled, so adversarial to originality, it can no longer produce any icons with actual authenticity.
[02:23:12.887 --> 02:23:15.730]  Kanye himself has alluded to this on several occasions.
[02:23:15.730 --> 02:23:17.992]  Cause y'all been lied to!
[02:23:17.992 --> 02:23:20.235]  Radio lied to you!
[02:23:20.235 --> 02:23:24.579]  They can't play what they wanna play because they've been paid to play it!
[02:23:27.623 --> 02:23:35.355]  Celebrities with something to say other than vacuous virtue signaling and cliche platitudes are now all but extinct.
[02:23:35.355 --> 02:23:42.886]  And that's because any celebrity that uses their platform to speak uncomfortable truths is immediately shunned and attacked.
[02:23:43.106 --> 02:23:43.786]  Weed-a-rock stars!
[02:24:04.696 --> 02:24:09.158]  represent a true threat to the status quo, to the dominant culture.
[02:24:09.158 --> 02:24:15.882]  Which is why I was right when I said conservatism is the new counterculture, and populism is the new punk rock.
[02:24:15.882 --> 02:24:18.003]  Oh, but Kanye had a breakdown, he's gone insane!
[02:24:18.003 --> 02:24:27.528]  Yeah, if you haven't been paying attention, Kanye's had about ten of what they call breakdowns since the mid-2000s, and he always comes back more influential than ever before.
[02:24:27.808 --> 02:24:28.248]  Blip!
[02:24:28.248 --> 02:24:34.193]  That's why they're terrified of him endorsing ideas and people outside of their control.
[02:24:34.193 --> 02:24:35.174]  Who's they?
[02:24:35.174 --> 02:24:42.399]  I'm talking about the dominant cultural institutions of Hollywood, the entertainment industry, the music industry and the media.
[02:24:42.399 --> 02:24:50.065]  The high priests of pop culture, the gatekeepers of what political and spiritual ideas we're told are acceptable.
[02:24:50.065 --> 02:24:54.108]  Now one of their own has gone rogue and the panic is palpable.
[02:24:54.108 --> 02:24:55.449]  The Truman Show boat is here!
[02:24:55.809 --> 02:24:58.810]  Why do you think Kanye fears for his own life?
[02:24:58.810 --> 02:25:02.812]  As Andrew Breitbart said, politics is downstream from culture.
[02:25:02.812 --> 02:25:07.173]  You can change political destiny by hijacking culture.
[02:25:07.173 --> 02:25:09.694]  In case you haven't noticed, that's what I'm doing.
[02:25:09.694 --> 02:25:10.915]  The left is slowly
[02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:15.859]  Waking up to the fact that they're losing their monopoly on controlling culture.
[02:25:15.859 --> 02:25:24.185]  When you've been in control for so many decades, something new inevitably has to emerge to become the new counterculture.
[02:25:24.185 --> 02:25:29.389]  Especially given that the left no longer pushes to be edgy, daring, or rebellious.
[02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:34.213]  And has instead embraced censorship, puritanism, and cultural sterility.
[02:25:34.213 --> 02:25:37.636]  The high priests of pop culture are the real racists.
[02:25:37.756 --> 02:25:41.718]  They're the ones who indoctrinate young black kids to aspire to be thugs.
[02:25:41.718 --> 02:25:47.401]  They're the ones who fetishize and glorify criminality and gangsterism through hip-hop music.
[02:25:47.401 --> 02:25:54.985]  Kanye is trying to move black people away from the ghettoization of their minds towards true independence and freedom.
[02:25:54.985 --> 02:25:58.787]  Candice Owens is trying to do exactly the same thing.
[02:25:58.787 --> 02:26:00.868]  And that's why they resonate with each other.
[02:26:00.868 --> 02:26:03.469]  And that's why the left is petrified of them both.
[02:26:03.709 --> 02:26:11.692]  What you're seeing happening today, obviously we have some black people that are just shouting in the back, we have some black people that are sitting in the front quietly that are chanting USA and having a normal conversation.
[02:26:11.692 --> 02:26:20.195]  I love that because what I say every single time, and you may have seen me on the news, is that what is happening right now in the black community, you're going to hear it in this room first, there is an ideological civil war happening.
[02:26:20.195 --> 02:26:25.016]  Black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery, and black people that are focused on their futures, okay?
[02:26:25.016 --> 02:26:26.837]  That's really what it comes down to, okay?
[02:26:28.405 --> 02:26:33.889]  I can guarantee you what you're seeing happening is victim mentality versus victor mentality.
[02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:35.150]  That's great by the way.
[02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.671]  I love that.
[02:26:35.671 --> 02:26:37.272]  Isn't that great?
[02:26:37.272 --> 02:26:39.414]  I love that.
[02:26:39.414 --> 02:26:50.242]  And there's no doubt in my mind, I can tell you right now who is going to be better off when we look 20 years, when we look at the faces in this room, who is going to be better off are the girls that are sitting right here and across this room because they don't have your mentality.
[02:26:50.242 --> 02:26:51.743]  Victim mentality is not cool.
[02:26:51.743 --> 02:26:53.425]  I don't know why people like being oppressed.
[02:26:53.425 --> 02:26:54.826]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
[02:26:54.826 --> 02:26:55.927]  I love oppression.
[02:26:55.927 --> 02:26:56.487]  We're oppressed.
[02:26:56.987 --> 02:27:00.010]  400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, which by the way, none of you guys lived through.
[02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:04.753]  Your grandparents did and it's embarrassing that you utilize, you utilize their history.
[02:27:04.753 --> 02:27:09.657]  You utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it.
[02:27:09.657 --> 02:27:12.219]  More emotion than they ever had when they were living through it.
[02:27:12.219 --> 02:27:13.240]  It's embarrassing.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:15.822]  You're not living through anything right now.
[02:27:15.822 --> 02:27:18.264]  You're overly privileged Americans.
[02:27:18.524 --> 02:27:21.665]  I'm also afraid that Kanye could be president one day.
[02:27:21.665 --> 02:27:22.585]  I'm not joking.
[02:27:22.585 --> 02:27:26.285]  As Terrence Williams said, both Kanye and Candace are free thinkers.
[02:27:26.285 --> 02:27:29.806]  If that triggers you, chances are you're not a free thinker.
[02:27:29.806 --> 02:27:32.586]  The left doesn't care about black people.
[02:27:32.586 --> 02:27:36.407]  They don't want black people to be business owners, doctors or scientists.
[02:27:36.407 --> 02:27:40.108]  They want them to remain mired in dependency and hopelessness.
[02:27:40.108 --> 02:27:43.248]  They want them to continue to vote for their own enslavement.
[02:27:43.248 --> 02:27:47.249]  And whether you love or hate Kanye's narcissistic personality,
[02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:52.474]  When someone comes up and says something like, I am a god, everybody says, who does he think he is?
[02:27:52.474 --> 02:27:54.536]  I just told you who I thought I was!
[02:27:54.536 --> 02:27:55.097]  A god!
[02:27:55.097 --> 02:28:07.488]  The mere threat of him derailing this agenda to any degree, the mere fact that they don't control what comes out of his mouth, is what keeps the high priests of pop culture awake at night.
[02:28:07.488 --> 02:28:09.791]  And this is an extremely visionary move on my part.
[02:28:15.532 --> 02:28:20.417]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:28:20.417 --> 02:28:21.839]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:28:55.629 --> 02:28:57.590]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:57.590 --> 02:29:02.911]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:02.911 --> 02:29:04.491]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:12.833]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:12.833 --> 02:29:18.535]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:18.695 --> 02:29:20.536]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:20.536 --> 02:29:22.697]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:22.697 --> 02:29:27.199]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:27.199 --> 02:29:29.380]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:37.244]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:33:11.617 --> 02:33:18.061]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:33:18.061 --> 02:33:20.402]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:20.402 --> 02:33:23.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.363 --> 02:33:36.628]  Well, the left ruins everything it gets its grimy mitts on, and now the NFL ratings are down, they kneel for the national anthem, and they want to ban cheerleaders.
[02:33:36.628 --> 02:33:37.548]  That's right.
[02:33:37.548 --> 02:33:40.550]  They want to get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:42.030]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[02:33:53.956 --> 02:33:55.557]  Who doesn't like cheerleaders?
[02:33:55.557 --> 02:33:57.557]  Fat, ugly, bitter feminists.
[02:33:57.557 --> 02:33:58.337]  Obviously.
[02:33:58.337 --> 02:34:00.998]  And USA Today columnist Nancy Ormore.
[02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:04.039]  No place in the NFL for cheerleaders in 2018!
[02:34:04.039 --> 02:34:10.761]  So after calling for classic songs to be banned for their offensive lyrics, USA Today now wants cheerleaders gone too.
[02:34:10.761 --> 02:34:12.222]  Is anything sacred?
[02:34:12.222 --> 02:34:14.482]  The Houston Texans aren't even bothering with the pretense.
[02:34:14.482 --> 02:34:19.664]  On their website is a photo gallery of the finalists from last weekend's cheerleader tryouts and visitors are encouraged to vote for their favourites.
[02:34:19.944 --> 02:34:23.408]  Are these action shots of the women that highlight their athletic ability or down skills?
[02:34:23.408 --> 02:34:25.791]  Do they include a list of their qualifications?
[02:34:25.791 --> 02:34:26.351]  Of course not.
[02:34:26.351 --> 02:34:27.032]  They're head shots.
[02:34:27.032 --> 02:34:28.374]  Sorry, head and chest shots.
[02:34:28.374 --> 02:34:29.455]  Close-up ones at that!
[02:34:29.455 --> 02:34:30.876]  They're better to uggle, you know.
[02:34:30.876 --> 02:34:36.262]  Wait, you mean to tell me that they judge women for a role that specifically requires hotness?
[02:34:37.043 --> 02:34:38.544]  On the level of their hotness!
[02:34:38.544 --> 02:34:40.825]  It's not their academic qualifications.
[02:34:40.825 --> 02:34:47.089]  Because the first thought that pops into my head when I watch this is, gee, I wonder what grade point average this chick got.
[02:34:47.089 --> 02:34:48.270]  Newsflash, dummy.
[02:34:48.270 --> 02:34:50.411]  Men like to look at hot women.
[02:34:50.411 --> 02:34:51.672]  That's never gonna change.
[02:34:51.672 --> 02:34:57.535]  And no matter how much you try to browbeat, shame and re-educate us, that's always gonna be a thing.
[02:34:57.535 --> 02:35:00.617]  You can't reverse basic biology through social engineering.
[02:35:00.677 --> 02:35:03.559]  The underlining premise of NFL cheerleaders is degrading!
[02:35:03.559 --> 02:35:09.484]  Presenting women as nothing more than objects to be leered at with skimpy, suggestive outfits as their uniform, their only purpose is to titillate!
[02:35:09.484 --> 02:35:10.845]  And you know what?
[02:35:10.845 --> 02:35:11.846]  She's got a point.
[02:35:11.846 --> 02:35:13.447]  This is just morally wrong.
[02:35:13.447 --> 02:35:18.131]  Congress really should pass a law to prevent women from being forced into cheerleading.
[02:35:18.251 --> 02:35:21.613]  Oh wait, that wouldn't be necessary because it's completely optional.
[02:35:21.613 --> 02:35:26.976]  I mean, cheerleaders just hate cheerleading so much, some of them pay just to audition.
[02:35:26.976 --> 02:35:30.858]  Women making their own choices on what to do with their bodies.
[02:35:30.858 --> 02:35:33.180]  Wasn't that what women's lib was all about?
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.300]  Freedom of choice.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:41.845]  You know, before all you resentful harpies hijacked feminism and turned it into a global laughingstock with your harebrained intersectional nonsense.
[02:35:42.085 --> 02:35:47.610]  It's always been an appalling message to send, and in this hashtag MeToo era, there's no longer any place for it.
[02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:49.551]  NFL cheerleaders need to go.
[02:35:49.551 --> 02:35:52.854]  NBA dance squads and NHL ice girls, well, we're at it too!
[02:35:52.854 --> 02:35:59.760]  Right, so in the name of feminism and supporting women, you want to deprive tens of thousands of current and future women of work.
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:03.423]  You purport to be a champion of women, yet you refer to these women
[02:36:03.783 --> 02:36:06.367]  As blow-up dolls come to life.
[02:36:06.367 --> 02:36:12.134]  Simply because they've chosen to do something that your joyless puritanical ass doesn't approve of.
[02:36:12.134 --> 02:36:14.598]  Now let's pause there and have another look at some cheerleaders.
[02:36:27.904 --> 02:36:30.646]  As I was saying, men like to look at hot women.
[02:36:30.646 --> 02:36:37.210]  Control freak, middle-aged, pearl-clutching, left-wing journalists who write for USA Today don't like to look at hot women.
[02:36:37.210 --> 02:36:39.812]  Did you fail the high school cheer team?
[02:36:39.812 --> 02:36:40.613]  Is that what it is?
[02:36:40.613 --> 02:36:44.315]  Oh, and by the way, this isn't just about shaking around pom-poms on game day.
[02:36:44.315 --> 02:36:47.837]  Many of these cheerleaders do important charity work and community outreach.
[02:36:47.837 --> 02:36:54.342]  They're one of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly perform for the United States Armed Forces overseas.
[02:36:54.342 --> 02:36:57.824]  These girls literally go into war zones to lift the spirits of the dead.
[02:36:58.324 --> 02:37:02.606]  And she admits this in her own article, but then says, meh, just ban them anyway.
[02:37:02.606 --> 02:37:08.127]  I mean, the NFL is already hemorrhaging viewers because of its tolerance of social justice stupidity.
[02:37:08.127 --> 02:37:10.068]  Now you want to take away the cheerleaders?
[02:37:10.068 --> 02:37:11.548]  I mean, what can we ban next?
[02:37:11.548 --> 02:37:12.929]  Las Vegas showgirls?
[02:37:12.929 --> 02:37:14.369]  Burlesque dancers?
[02:37:14.369 --> 02:37:15.630]  Instagram hotties?
[02:37:15.630 --> 02:37:17.750]  Why don't we just ban models altogether?
[02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:22.732]  I mean, what other potential career paths for young women can we terminate because we're such good feminists?
[02:37:22.892 --> 02:37:24.854]  But Paul, this is just one newspaper columnist.
[02:37:24.854 --> 02:37:25.655]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:37:25.655 --> 02:37:27.837]  This is part of a wider purge.
[02:37:27.837 --> 02:37:35.004]  F1 grid girls band, the tennis girl poster band, beach body ads band, page three girls band, booze babes band.
[02:37:35.004 --> 02:37:37.726]  We just made hundreds of thousands of women unemployed.
[02:37:37.726 --> 02:37:38.968]  Go feminism!
[02:37:42.651 --> 02:37:55.194]  Oh, we'll bitch and moan all day about the horror of displaying women who choose to wear what they want, while simultaneously celebrating a modesty culture that forces women to wear bags on their heads as a symbol of women's empowerment.
[02:37:55.194 --> 02:38:03.036]  Maybe if we just compelled women to wear certain items of clothing, you'd be all for it, because that's what seems to pass as feminism these days.
[02:38:03.036 --> 02:38:06.897]  No, the whole point should be to let women be rocket scientists.
[02:38:07.877 --> 02:38:14.201]  Oh Babylon jigglers, give them equal opportunity and mind your own frigging business!
[02:38:14.201 --> 02:38:17.863]  Feminists are going on and on and on about how it's degrading to women.
[02:38:17.863 --> 02:38:24.186]  The women that are actually doing it don't feel degraded and we're not being given the choice to decide now whether we want to do it or not.
[02:38:24.206 --> 02:38:27.989]  And this isn't a feminist crusade, this is a class crusade.
[02:38:27.989 --> 02:38:38.258]  This is about a bunch of condescending, sanctimonious, elitist snobs like Nancy R Moore looking down their noses at hard-working girls just trying to make their way in life.
[02:38:38.258 --> 02:38:40.900]  Look, not all girls can aspire to be like you.
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:47.525]  To write laborious, tormented diatribes about how everything that offends your prudish sensibilities should be banned.
[02:38:47.525 --> 02:38:53.330]  So embrace real feminism, embrace real equality, and leave these girls the hell alone.
[02:38:55.205 --> 02:39:05.453]  Another example of the control freak left that wants to decide what jobs women can or can't have or what jobs may or may not be degrading to women.
[02:39:05.453 --> 02:39:06.113]  One day they say,
[02:39:07.674 --> 02:39:12.517]  We need to allow women to operate as sex slaves on the dark web.
[02:39:12.517 --> 02:39:15.358]  The next day, they'll say, you know, that's their choice.
[02:39:15.358 --> 02:39:16.599]  My body, my choice.
[02:39:16.599 --> 02:39:20.361]  But the next day, they'll say you can't have cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:39:20.361 --> 02:39:23.022]  Just another example of the leftist control freak.
[02:39:23.022 --> 02:39:26.044]  But I think that they're onto something here, you know.
[02:39:28.336 --> 02:39:32.017]  Yeah, I think that they should get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL.
[02:39:32.017 --> 02:39:33.757]  But why stop there?
[02:39:33.757 --> 02:39:34.918]  Let's go on down the line.
[02:39:34.918 --> 02:39:37.618]  Let's get rid of cheerleaders at the college level.
[02:39:37.618 --> 02:39:41.219]  Let's get rid of the cheerleaders at high school levels.
[02:39:41.219 --> 02:39:44.600]  And, you know, there's male cheerleaders there, too, so we don't want to be sexist.
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:52.362]  Let's get rid of all of them, okay, so they don't get to put that on their resume or gain that experience or get that opportunity to get a scholarship to go to college.
[02:39:52.362 --> 02:39:52.942]  Let's end all that.
[02:39:53.618 --> 02:39:54.738]  But why stop there?
[02:39:54.738 --> 02:39:56.439]  Let's even go farther down the line.
[02:39:56.439 --> 02:39:59.340]  You've got, like, what about beauty pageants?
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:00.661]  Swimsuit competitions?
[02:40:00.661 --> 02:40:02.181]  I mean, that happens at bars.
[02:40:02.181 --> 02:40:04.662]  I think we should stop all that, too.
[02:40:04.662 --> 02:40:10.024]  And then you've got, what are the little, they have, like, beauty pageants for, like, little girls, too.
[02:40:10.024 --> 02:40:12.665]  There was the one television show.
[02:40:12.665 --> 02:40:14.105]  There's multiple shows, actually.
[02:40:14.105 --> 02:40:15.826]  So we should cancel those television shows.
[02:40:16.892 --> 02:40:20.714]  Cancel the youth beauty pageants as well.
[02:40:20.714 --> 02:40:29.937]  And then, once you've gotten that all accomplished, then we should go after the strip club industry and we should make sure that we don't have strip clubs or gentlemen's clubs or anything like that.
[02:40:29.937 --> 02:40:36.160]  And then ultimately we'll save Stormy Daniels from all the plight that she's had to deal with.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:36.460]  Oh, what?
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:38.141]  She's making how much money off of this again?
[02:40:39.873 --> 02:40:41.234]  Oh wow.
[02:40:41.234 --> 02:40:42.874]  Oh, and getting donations?
[02:40:42.874 --> 02:40:47.997]  300 grand in donations plus all the money she makes from her porn star tour?
[02:40:47.997 --> 02:40:50.958]  Okay, well it makes a lot of money, so of course the left wants to shut it down.
[02:40:50.958 --> 02:40:53.800]  Alright, well, I somehow have to segue off of that.
[02:40:54.775 --> 02:40:59.699]  To Matt Bracken, my next guest, who will be with me in the next segment as well.
[02:40:59.699 --> 02:41:05.083]  Matt, it seems to me right now that it's the perfect opportunity for a false flag in America.
[02:41:05.083 --> 02:41:22.357]  While the left is becoming totally unhinged, it's very easy to get a wind-up doll to go out there and commit some heinous act, given how the far-left minions right now are pretty much losing their cool, losing their sanity, and are on the brink of a total breakdown.
[02:41:24.289 --> 02:41:36.016]  Reading between the lines of the news yesterday, before last year, I never even knew that the Republicans had a baseball team or that they had practices in Northern Virginia.
[02:41:36.016 --> 02:41:39.077]  Or that there was not much security there.
[02:41:39.077 --> 02:41:44.280]  That nobody came out and shot at them.
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:52.205]  I would expect something like that to happen potentially now that the Mueller-Comey investigation, the wheels are coming off of that.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:55.741]  I wouldn't be surprised if something like that does happen.
[02:41:55.741 --> 02:41:56.802]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:56.802 --> 02:41:59.623]  And their whole Russian collusion thing is falling apart, too.
[02:41:59.623 --> 02:42:01.844]  You know, there was a story.
[02:42:01.844 --> 02:42:07.107]  Faith Goldie, who's a conservative speaker, she was scheduled to speak at an event at a university.
[02:42:07.107 --> 02:42:09.868]  Security was going to cost about $7,000.
[02:42:09.868 --> 02:42:13.090]  Overnight, it shot up to $30,000 and they had to cancel the event.
[02:42:13.959 --> 02:42:16.642]  Now, where is that threat coming from?
[02:42:16.642 --> 02:42:17.423]  What is the violence?
[02:42:17.423 --> 02:42:19.085]  Why all this need for increased security?
[02:42:19.085 --> 02:42:20.086]  Well, the answer is obvious.
[02:42:20.086 --> 02:42:28.096]  You have a bunch of rabid leftists out there that hate free speech, that have been brainwashed by media to think that anyone that's a conservative is a Nazi.
[02:42:28.096 --> 02:42:29.318]  They're ready to pop off.
[02:42:29.778 --> 02:42:38.381]  I mean, this is the moment that they've been waiting for, and if they get enough of them in that mindset, they might actually be able to get them to pull something off.
[02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:41.862]  So Matt Bracken and I are going to break it down all on the other side.
[02:42:41.862 --> 02:42:43.703]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:43.703 --> 02:42:45.943]  Please support us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:45.943 --> 02:42:53.406]  They're trying to shut us down with frivolous lawsuits, but thanks to your support, we're expanding in the face of all the free speech attacks.
[02:42:55.174 --> 02:42:58.778]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:58.778 --> 02:43:00.540]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:11.811]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.592 --> 02:43:21.763]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.763 --> 02:43:27.730]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:32.315]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.816 --> 02:43:35.439]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.439 --> 02:43:37.181]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.181 --> 02:43:47.172]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.172 --> 02:43:49.814]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.814 --> 02:43:54.520]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:43:55.649 --> 02:43:56.449]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:56.449 --> 02:44:06.592]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:06.592 --> 02:44:15.115]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.115 --> 02:44:23.898]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:25.987 --> 02:44:34.190]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:45.573]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.573 --> 02:44:48.254]  It is amazing!
[02:44:48.254 --> 02:44:53.216]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.

[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:16.541]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[02:45:16.781 --> 02:45:22.984]  is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra-pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[02:45:22.984 --> 02:45:30.768]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[02:45:30.768 --> 02:45:37.672]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.
[02:45:38.052 --> 02:45:44.275]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[02:45:44.275 --> 02:45:48.097]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.

[02:45:56.294 --> 02:46:01.838]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[02:46:01.838 --> 02:46:02.758]  They take hours.
[02:46:02.758 --> 02:46:05.200]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:06.381]  It's stronger.
[02:46:06.381 --> 02:46:07.982]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:46:07.982 --> 02:46:11.204]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:46:11.204 --> 02:46:12.325]  It's back in stock.
[02:46:12.325 --> 02:46:15.507]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.507 --> 02:46:18.829]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:19.409 --> 02:46:19.489]  It's
[02:46:38.052 --> 02:46:39.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:14.827 --> 02:47:22.409]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.409 --> 02:47:27.751]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:27.751 --> 02:47:39.474]  Here is the perfect scenario for the corporate fake news press, the fake news television media, the CNNs, the MSNBCs of the West.
[02:47:40.435 --> 02:47:58.574]  They're perfect scenario right now that they would be foaming at the mouth to report on would be a situation whether it be a shooting or let's say a bombing or anything like that some major event some catastrophe perhaps even you know mass casualty event
[02:47:59.591 --> 02:48:06.615]  That they can spin and then blame on conservatives, blame on Republicans, blame on the alt-right.
[02:48:06.615 --> 02:48:08.196]  You've seen them try it before.
[02:48:08.196 --> 02:48:10.217]  They tried it with the Charlottesville thing.
[02:48:10.217 --> 02:48:11.178]  That failed.
[02:48:11.178 --> 02:48:15.340]  They tried it by saying that Trump supporters are violent at their rallies.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:16.221]  That narrative failed.
[02:48:16.221 --> 02:48:18.482]  It was always the leftists going and starting violence.
[02:48:18.482 --> 02:48:20.503]  Same thing happened in Charlottesville.
[02:48:20.503 --> 02:48:26.827]  So they need a mass event that they can either blame on conservatives or blame on
[02:48:28.268 --> 02:48:30.933]  Retired members of the military and veterans.
[02:48:30.933 --> 02:48:33.659]  And it's a talking point that they've been bringing up for a long time.
[02:48:33.659 --> 02:48:35.122]  They've tried to pin it to Alex Jones.
[02:48:35.122 --> 02:48:36.725]  They tried to pin it to conservative media.
[02:48:37.884 --> 02:48:40.005]  So that would be their perfect event.
[02:48:40.005 --> 02:49:01.120]  And if they think they can get some wind-up doll to go out there in a controlled event where he's already on their radar, he's already brought up red flags, and you let him go, but then you control the situation because he's already on your radar, so then you can blame it on, oh, he maybe watched an Alex Jones video or a Paul Joseph Watson video or something, and then they create a media narrative
[02:49:02.045 --> 02:49:05.928]  That says we caused him to do that, now we have to be shut down.
[02:49:05.928 --> 02:49:09.511]  And the background is all the lawsuits, the background is all the fake news on Alex Jones.
[02:49:09.511 --> 02:49:12.012]  So, Matt Bracken, you're the expert on this.
[02:49:12.012 --> 02:49:15.155]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com, you've written multiple books about this.
[02:49:16.698 --> 02:49:18.520]  What do you think they're thinking right now in the media?
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:26.208]  Because you had the ISIS propaganda coming out and they have their gun aimed at CNN, which I think is total BS.
[02:49:26.208 --> 02:49:27.869]  I think CNN loves ISIS.
[02:49:27.869 --> 02:49:30.512]  I think, you know, so I don't know why that would happen.
[02:49:30.512 --> 02:49:33.755]  It kind of seems like maybe fake propaganda there.
[02:49:33.755 --> 02:49:37.279]  But what do you think the media would do if an event like this happened?
[02:49:37.279 --> 02:49:37.479]  I mean,
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:49.004]  We say, hey, this looks like it might be a radical Islamic terror attack and they attack us, but you know they would jump on a narrative as soon as they could if they could blame it on a Trump supporter.
[02:49:49.004 --> 02:49:58.168]  Yeah, and I think they would goad Trump supporters or someone that could be portrayed as, you know, from the alt-right if they could.
[02:49:58.168 --> 02:50:05.551]  But, you know, over the year and a half since Trump's been elected, you know, we've seen the assassination of Trump in the park.
[02:50:06.283 --> 02:50:17.027]  By, you know, a well-known group of theatrical players stabbing Trump to death or holding up his bloody head.
[02:50:17.027 --> 02:50:20.829]  These are signals to the loose cannons that you'll be praised.
[02:50:20.829 --> 02:50:22.249]  You'll be somebody.
[02:50:22.249 --> 02:50:28.652]  Your worthless life will have meaning if you make our dreams come true and assassinate the president.
[02:50:28.652 --> 02:50:31.793]  But I think that there are other actors who would say, you know,
[02:50:32.483 --> 02:50:47.771]  What we need to do is shoot up a feminist rally or a Black Lives Matter rally and leave clues pointing at the conservatives because they know for a fact that the media would not look at it critically as a false flag in any way.
[02:50:47.771 --> 02:50:50.532]  They would run with the narrative immediately.
[02:50:50.532 --> 02:50:51.973]  We saw this in Syria with
[02:50:52.569 --> 02:50:58.117]  What is, I would say, you know, at least an 80-20 chance it was a false flag attack against Assad.
[02:50:58.117 --> 02:51:00.060]  I mean, it makes no sense, the timing.
[02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:01.502]  Yeah, I mean, it is, like, it's like a hundred percent.
[02:51:01.502 --> 02:51:03.025]  But the important thing is the media went with the story.
[02:51:03.025 --> 02:51:06.470]  The media just went with it as if it was an established fact.
[02:51:07.328 --> 02:51:14.591]  Before there was any proof and there still isn't a proof, but they ran with it as an established fact to the point of firing missiles.
[02:51:14.591 --> 02:51:18.032]  So yeah, the media would immediately say this is the conservatives.
[02:51:18.032 --> 02:51:19.352]  They've just done a massacre.
[02:51:19.352 --> 02:51:22.013]  It's another reason to go after guns.
[02:51:22.013 --> 02:51:25.014]  I think if it happens, it will definitely be a gun, probably an AR-15.
[02:51:25.014 --> 02:51:32.056]  Yeah, then they can use the narrative not only against conservatives, but then of course go after the guns.
[02:51:32.056 --> 02:51:33.457]  That's one of their favorite things to do.
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:58.924]  I would have never thought this before, but after Garland, Texas, with an actual active-duty, card-carrying FBI special agent following behind the terrorists, goading them to commit mass murder for a political objective, I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI has its eye on certain loose cannons that are roaming around right now.
[02:51:59.890 --> 02:52:09.760]  And depending on the political desires, either stopping them or dropping the ball again, depending on the desired outcome.
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:23.773]  For example, if these Strzok page messages have bombshells in them that are going to completely blow up Mueller's investigation and make the Democrats look like traitors and Russian colluders,
[02:52:24.545 --> 02:52:31.607]  That's when one of these wind-up dolls, the FBI might suddenly lose track of him and then something happens.
[02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:33.167]  Well, let's be perfectly clear.
[02:52:33.167 --> 02:52:34.508]  That's what happened in Florida.
[02:52:34.508 --> 02:52:36.788]  The FBI knew Cruz was on the wash lift.
[02:52:36.788 --> 02:52:39.349]  I mean, dozens if not hundreds of red flags.
[02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:43.810]  Totally knew who he was and then there was the stand-down at the scene.
[02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:46.091]  So you got that aspect of things.
[02:52:47.091 --> 02:52:52.743]  And then you talk about the controlled aspect of, you know, oh, is the FBI behind this or CIA?
[02:52:52.743 --> 02:52:55.590]  We now have the documents that just got released.
[02:52:56.779 --> 02:52:58.460]  Unintentionally, apparently.
[02:52:58.460 --> 02:53:06.406]  How the government can use radiation coming out of cell phones to manipulate your mind and put voices in your head.
[02:53:06.406 --> 02:53:18.655]  So then you got that aspect of you got crazies out there, plus some crazy technology a government or some other entity has where they can hack into your cell phone and then use that to literally control you like MKUltra.
[02:53:18.655 --> 02:53:20.016]  People say, oh you're crazy.
[02:53:20.016 --> 02:53:20.717]  No, look it up!
[02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:27.503]  These are published documents that use electronic waves to manipulate your mind and make you act crazy.
[02:53:27.503 --> 02:53:30.487]  It's like right out of the movie Kingsman.
[02:53:30.487 --> 02:53:36.733]  And so we're dealing with all of this, but people need to understand that the media will try to create a narrative.
[02:53:36.733 --> 02:53:37.994]  That's what it's all about.
[02:53:37.994 --> 02:53:41.418]  It's all about creating a narrative, just like hands up, don't shoot.
[02:53:41.418 --> 02:53:42.118]  Never happened.
[02:53:42.719 --> 02:53:48.100]  Totally disproven, disproven in the courts, yet still to this day they do hands up, don't shoot.
[02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:52.641]  Just like still to this day they say, oh, gay frogs are a real thing, there's no scientific evidence.
[02:53:52.641 --> 02:54:00.303]  So it's all about creating that first narrative, and then that sinks into the brainwashed people's minds, the truth never penetrates.
[02:54:00.303 --> 02:54:03.584]  Yeah, I'm reading, I don't know why it took me so long.
[02:54:03.584 --> 02:54:07.904]  Right now I'm reading a terrific book, one of the best books I've ever read.
[02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:10.005]  American Betrayal by Diana West.
[02:54:11.016 --> 02:54:22.986]  And it gets into this, you know, in the 50s and 60s, really starting in the 30s, the communist networks were covered up so effectively, McCarthy ended up being the villain and he was a hero.
[02:54:22.986 --> 02:54:23.647]  He was right.
[02:54:23.647 --> 02:54:31.433]  And what people remember of that era is red baiting and, you know, communists under the bed, and it became a joke, a running gag.
[02:54:31.433 --> 02:54:32.754]  But it really happened.
[02:54:32.754 --> 02:54:36.017]  And the objective neutral truth really doesn't matter anymore.
[02:54:36.597 --> 02:54:40.519]  It's what narrative can be pounded home over and over again.
[02:54:40.519 --> 02:54:55.306]  That's why we've seen hundreds of movies with the German Third Reich Nazis as the villains, and you can count on one hand any movies that portrayed global communism, Russian, Chinese, Cambodian, any of them,
[02:54:56.006 --> 02:55:01.311]  As the great villains that they were, killing at least 100 million in the 20th century.
[02:55:01.311 --> 02:55:08.917]  So objective reality is not as important as keeping a false narrative going with a drumbeat of lies.
[02:55:08.917 --> 02:55:09.938]  And it works.
[02:55:09.938 --> 02:55:11.299]  Brainwashing works.
[02:55:11.299 --> 02:55:12.780]  It absolutely works.
[02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:14.502]  And there's no doubt in my mind.
[02:55:14.502 --> 02:55:20.887]  That thing about the mind control that was leaked from the Fusion Center, or dropped out by the Fusion Center,
[02:55:22.491 --> 02:55:31.826]  I don't think that would work on normal people, but if they've got somebody who's already hearing voices, they can probably dial him up or dial him down.
[02:55:31.826 --> 02:55:33.168]  Provoke him, for example.
[02:55:33.168 --> 02:55:33.889]  Turn him into a...
[02:55:35.501 --> 02:55:39.565]  We're really rabid lunatic from just a simmering lunatic.
[02:55:39.565 --> 02:55:41.186]  It wouldn't surprise me.
[02:55:41.186 --> 02:55:45.070]  I don't think that there's any federal agents out there doing it right now.
[02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:51.716]  But for goodness sake, after Garland, we have to be very suspicious that they might accidentally drop the ball again.
[02:55:53.497 --> 02:56:01.322]  It's so funny, Mueller, when he was head of the FBI, that was when they gutted the realistic counter-jihad training.
[02:56:01.322 --> 02:56:14.350]  So you can make an actual case that Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, Orlando, and many other attacks, they happened because the FBI had blinders put on them.
[02:56:14.350 --> 02:56:17.532]  Mosques were put out of bounds for surveillance.
[02:56:18.092 --> 02:56:32.590]  This would be like in the 1930s if the German-American Bund was put out of bounds for surveillance and you needed to talk to a Nazi about true Nazi culture because we can't be Germanophobic.
[02:56:32.590 --> 02:56:33.852]  But that's where we are today.
[02:56:33.852 --> 02:56:35.634]  We're in a land of false narratives.
[02:56:35.874 --> 02:56:55.924]  Americans don't know their history and they don't know the lies that the media has been reporting on for years that never that they never correct and you're gonna talk more of this in the next hour as well and just real quick you mentioned the stroke page text that are about to come out and potential bombshells there to me we already have all the bombshells we know what's in the text we know it all everybody knows
[02:56:56.164 --> 02:57:01.425]  Until these people actually get arrested and get tried in court and have to testify under oath, nothing's going to matter.
[02:57:01.425 --> 02:57:02.785]  That's the day this stuff matters.
[02:57:02.785 --> 02:57:04.066]  Until then, it probably doesn't.
[02:57:04.066 --> 02:57:09.407]  But the key is that InfoWars can get the narrative out there that the television news is not going to report.
[02:57:09.407 --> 02:57:12.968]  And that's why your support of InfoWarsStore.com is so imperative, folks.

[02:57:24.013 --> 02:57:26.155]  They really want to try to shut us down, okay?
[02:57:26.155 --> 02:57:29.157]  I mean, the attempts to shut us down are real, folks.
[02:57:29.157 --> 02:57:34.161]  And we can sit here and talk about it three hours a day and give you all the gruesome details, but that's not what the audience wants.

[02:58:12.235 --> 02:58:14.916]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:14.916 --> 02:58:20.719]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:20.719 --> 02:58:23.680]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:27.222]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.222 --> 02:58:29.443]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.443 --> 02:58:29.803]  I love it.
[02:58:29.963 --> 02:58:32.768]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:58:32.768 --> 02:58:33.790]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:39.439]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.

[03:00:12.910 --> 03:00:18.913]  Well, Kanye West was guilty of trumping while black about a year ago.
[03:00:18.913 --> 03:00:20.454]  He was trumping while black.
[03:00:20.454 --> 03:00:22.435]  So the thought police had to throw him in the gulag.
[03:00:22.435 --> 03:00:24.796]  And he was silent for a little while.
[03:00:24.796 --> 03:00:25.597]  Now he's back.
[03:00:25.597 --> 03:00:26.697]  He's saying he loves Trump.
[03:00:26.697 --> 03:00:27.498]  He likes the way that
[03:00:28.098 --> 03:00:45.469]  Candace Owen thinks, and the entire entertainment industry is freaking out, because their propaganda only works if it has the facade of unanimicity behind it, of the entire Hollywood and entertainment industry is behind hating Trump, he's bad.
[03:00:45.469 --> 03:00:49.812]  Well, if one steps out of line, oh my gosh, it could trigger free thinking.
[03:00:49.812 --> 03:00:50.552]  We can't have that.
[03:00:50.552 --> 03:00:52.293]  We have to get Kanye back in line.
[03:00:52.293 --> 03:00:52.634]  So then,
[03:00:53.706 --> 03:00:59.989]  Stephen Colbert, on his show last night, says Kanye West has lost his mind for supporting Trump.
[03:00:59.989 --> 03:01:08.372]  So, of course, the black man decides to think freely and leave it to the white man to just kick him right back down and put him back in line.
[03:01:08.372 --> 03:01:09.313]  That's Stephen Colbert.
[03:01:09.313 --> 03:01:13.555]  The black man, Kanye West, thinks freely and then the white man kicks him back in the line.
[03:01:13.555 --> 03:01:15.635]  Stephen Colbert says he's lost his mind.
[03:01:15.635 --> 03:01:21.358]  We went out on the streets of Austin, Texas and thought, hmm, I wonder what the students at UT think about all this.
[03:01:30.936 --> 03:01:32.677]  Nothing like, I am a god.
[03:01:32.677 --> 03:01:34.799]  Everybody says, who does he think he is?
[03:01:34.799 --> 03:01:36.860]  I just told you who I thought I was!
[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:37.921]  A god!
[03:01:37.921 --> 03:01:44.946]  Let the bass kick.
[03:01:44.946 --> 03:01:46.727]  This is Savannah Hernandez with InfoWars.
[03:01:46.727 --> 03:01:53.952]  Today we're on UT's campus to talk to students about what they think about the recent controversy surrounding Kanye West's tweets and his support of Candace Owens.
[03:01:53.952 --> 03:01:54.913]  Let's go see what people think.
[03:02:00.169 --> 03:02:01.810]  You ain't got the answers, man!
[03:02:01.810 --> 03:02:03.271]  You ain't got the answers, Dwayne!
[03:02:03.271 --> 03:02:07.254]  Kanye just tweeted a picture of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:02:07.254 --> 03:02:08.295]  What do you think about that?
[03:02:08.295 --> 03:02:09.396]  Didn't he come out as pro-Trump?
[03:02:09.396 --> 03:02:12.958]  I mean, so he's pro-Trump.
[03:02:12.958 --> 03:02:14.159]  What do you think about that?
[03:02:14.159 --> 03:02:16.281]  I didn't really have an opinion in any way to begin.
[03:02:16.281 --> 03:02:19.003]  I listened to Kanye before Trump ran for election, so...
[03:02:19.807 --> 03:02:23.288]  So his political views don't sway your opinion of him at all?
[03:02:23.288 --> 03:02:25.388]  Um, not necessarily Kanye.
[03:02:25.388 --> 03:02:32.430]  I feel like a political opinion can sway your opinion of a lot of celebrities and entertainers, but Kanye is kind of like Kanye where he's just too big to fail.
[03:02:32.430 --> 03:02:34.470]  So, it's just kind of like that.
[03:02:34.470 --> 03:02:36.071]  I mean, he can come out and say whatever he wants.
[03:02:36.071 --> 03:02:38.531]  I feel like people are still going to listen to him.
[03:02:38.531 --> 03:02:39.732]  I think it's perfectly fine.
[03:02:39.732 --> 03:02:44.913]  Dude's, uh, he's given out his First Amendment rights to discuss what political candidates he likes.
[03:02:46.141 --> 03:02:47.642]  I think that's perfectly fine, you know?
[03:02:47.642 --> 03:02:59.445]  I know there's some people who are freaking out about it, but it's like, to be honest, we live in a democracy, so it's like, I'd expect people in high positions to give their opinions.
[03:02:59.445 --> 03:03:04.687]  It's just that what's happening is people don't like the fact that he's not supporting the guy that they like.
[03:03:04.687 --> 03:03:05.748]  I'm really happy for you.
[03:03:05.748 --> 03:03:06.468]  I'm gonna let you finish.
[03:03:07.486 --> 03:03:07.786]  I don't know.
[03:03:07.786 --> 03:03:08.867]  I'm not a fan of that.
[03:03:08.867 --> 03:03:11.908]  I like his music, but I don't appreciate that as a Kanye fan.
[03:03:11.908 --> 03:03:13.309]  That's not what's up.
[03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.969]  I don't know.
[03:03:13.969 --> 03:03:17.111]  I'm kind of questioning now whether or not to continue supporting him.
[03:03:17.111 --> 03:03:17.451]  I don't know.
[03:03:17.451 --> 03:03:19.492]  I haven't really invested in much of his stuff lately.
[03:03:19.492 --> 03:03:23.254]  I mean, I listen to his music, some of his older stuff, but I mean, I don't know.
[03:03:23.254 --> 03:03:27.996]  We'll see about what he's produced, you know, what's come out late lately and everything like that.
[03:03:27.996 --> 03:03:28.977]  So, I don't know.
[03:03:28.977 --> 03:03:30.878]  I'm not really a fan of that, that he's supporting Trump.
[03:03:33.337 --> 03:03:36.578]  I mean, he has his own political affiliation, so that's cool.
[03:03:36.578 --> 03:03:44.960]  I mean, it's a good thing, I think, that he's not falling under what a lot of celebrities seem to be saying when he's speaking out for a different political affiliation.
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:49.862]  Yeah, so he actually recently tweeted, you know, we have freedom of speech, but we don't have freedom of thought.
[03:03:49.862 --> 03:03:52.303]  What do you think about that?
[03:03:52.303 --> 03:03:53.463]  Well, if he's speaking about
[03:03:55.174 --> 03:04:01.577]  Censorship in the media and certain platforms and I get what he's saying, but I mean we can still think whatever we want.
[03:04:01.577 --> 03:04:07.159]  We don't have a police like attacking citizens or incarcerating citizens because of certain thoughts.
[03:04:07.159 --> 03:04:10.841]  Maybe some European countries have that going on, but we don't have that in the United States currently.
[03:04:12.526 --> 03:04:19.169]  Can I ask you guys a couple questions about the controversy surrounding Kanye West and his recent tweets in support of Candace Owen?
[03:04:19.169 --> 03:04:20.470]  I have not read anything about that.
[03:04:20.470 --> 03:04:21.170]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:21.170 --> 03:04:23.251]  You ain't been doing an education!
[03:04:23.251 --> 03:04:24.792]  You ain't been doing an education!
[03:04:24.792 --> 03:04:29.894]  I don't want to be insulting, but I don't think Kanye himself really understands what Trump is doing.
[03:04:29.894 --> 03:04:35.917]  He just sees the few little things that they show on CNN and stuff, and he supports that, which is not good.
[03:04:35.917 --> 03:04:40.119]  Because if you're going to be somebody's supporter, you have to do your research and do your background information about that person.
[03:04:40.694 --> 03:04:41.915]  But that's just my personal opinion.
[03:04:41.915 --> 03:04:49.323]  He probably could know, but I'm just saying, because honestly, I don't think anybody that really truly understands what Trump is doing, especially with the stuff in Syria, where we're trying to support his actions.
[03:04:49.323 --> 03:04:50.124]  But that's just...

[03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:02.155]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:06:02.155 --> 03:06:05.566]  You're listening to Roger Stone.
[03:06:05.566 --> 03:06:06.389]  On and forth.
[03:06:16.314 --> 03:06:20.076]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[03:06:20.076 --> 03:06:21.297]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.297 --> 03:06:22.298]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.298 --> 03:06:23.198]  From Infowars.
[03:06:23.198 --> 03:06:23.898]  Infowars.
[03:06:23.898 --> 03:06:24.239]  Yeah.
[03:06:24.239 --> 03:06:24.999]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.999 --> 03:06:25.820]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.820 --> 03:06:29.322]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:06:29.322 --> 03:06:32.183]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:06:32.183 --> 03:06:37.126]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:06:37.126 --> 03:06:41.709]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[03:06:41.889 --> 03:06:44.191]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[03:06:44.191 --> 03:06:47.334]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:06:47.334 --> 03:06:58.363]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according to Westpac InfoWars.
[03:06:58.363 --> 03:07:00.645]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[03:07:00.645 --> 03:07:03.167]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[03:07:06.801 --> 03:07:09.584]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:07:09.584 --> 03:07:12.687]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[03:07:12.687 --> 03:07:18.872]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[03:07:18.872 --> 03:07:21.075]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[03:07:21.075 --> 03:07:22.996]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:07:22.996 --> 03:07:24.438]  Move, bitch!
[03:07:24.438 --> 03:07:25.499]  Get out the way!

[03:07:45.371 --> 03:07:46.952]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:48.194 --> 03:07:50.816]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:50.816 --> 03:07:51.856]  I'm pinch-hitting.
[03:07:51.856 --> 03:07:59.841]  I'm Roger Stone, your host for the next hour, and joining me in hosting our next hour is Matt Bracken.
[03:07:59.841 --> 03:08:03.583]  We are delighted to be with you so much in the news.
[03:08:03.583 --> 03:08:05.284]  There he is, Matt Bracken.
[03:08:05.284 --> 03:08:05.784]  Welcome back!
[03:08:07.506 --> 03:08:08.706]  Welcome back, yes.
[03:08:08.706 --> 03:08:09.306]  Good to see you.
[03:08:09.306 --> 03:08:15.608]  So, some substantial news today regarding the John F. Kennedy assassination.
[03:08:15.608 --> 03:08:26.111]  The President, in accordance with the 1994 JFK Document Release Act, ordered the release of the remaining 19,045 documents pertaining to the murder of the President.
[03:08:31.112 --> 03:08:46.080]  No document was completely withheld in full upon the President's orders and redactions based on the President's instructions are only to regard those who are currently living.
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:52.223]  Interestingly enough, the intelligence agencies had requested a further delay.
[03:08:52.223 --> 03:08:59.827]  The President ordered them to be extremely circumspect in recommending any further postponement
[03:09:00.667 --> 03:09:16.447]  And he said the material that has been withheld to date is to be re-reviewed by October 26, 2021, not that far away, to determine whether there's any continuing use reason why this government information should be withheld.
[03:09:19.611 --> 03:09:28.993]  Now, in the past, we have learned an extraordinary amount about the JFK assassination from these release documents.
[03:09:28.993 --> 03:09:42.617]  For example, we learned that the KGB had conducted their own independent investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination and had determined that Lyndon Johnson was the perp.
[03:09:43.297 --> 03:09:52.086]  We actually saw in the government-released records a memo from J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI, to President Johnson informing him of that.
[03:09:52.086 --> 03:09:58.874]  We also learned that the French intelligence conducted their own independent review at the request of Jacqueline Kennedy.
[03:09:58.874 --> 03:10:04.660]  They also concurred that Lyndon Johnson was a major orchestrator of the plot.
[03:10:05.420 --> 03:10:12.904]  We learned that President Lyndon Johnson belonged to the Ku Klux Klan early in his congressional career.
[03:10:12.904 --> 03:10:16.326]  We learned about George H.W.
[03:10:16.326 --> 03:10:25.131]  Bush's presence in Dallas on the 21st and 22nd of November 1963.
[03:10:25.131 --> 03:10:31.675]  For 30 years, former President George Bush said that he couldn't remember where he was that day.
[03:10:32.375 --> 03:10:32.895]  Matt Bracken
[03:10:48.828 --> 03:11:12.913]  Who called the Houston FBI minutes after the President was shot, essentially to establish an alibi, saying that he was speaking in Tyler, Texas, and then leading the FBI on a wild goose chase regarding a young Republican in Harris County that he said may or may not have made threats against the President.
[03:11:13.893 --> 03:11:19.875]  I think Russ Baker, in his terrific book on the Bushes, highlighted this revelation.
[03:11:19.875 --> 03:11:30.999]  So, I have not had an opportunity to examine the material that was released today, but so far it is consistent with everything the President told me he would do.
[03:11:30.999 --> 03:11:32.900]  He favors transparency.
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:41.307]  Why, you may ask, would the intelligence agencies be opposed to the release of this material?
[03:11:41.307 --> 03:11:49.915]  Particularly since those involved in these events 55 years ago are almost certainly dead and no longer with us.
[03:11:49.915 --> 03:11:54.999]  Well, the real reason, I think, is because they don't want to expose their methods.
[03:11:55.939 --> 03:11:59.201]  They leaked then, they leak now.
[03:11:59.201 --> 03:12:03.443]  They fabricate things then, they fabricate things now.
[03:12:03.443 --> 03:12:07.745]  They assassinate then, they still assassinate today.
[03:12:07.745 --> 03:12:14.928]  So it speaks to the foundations of our rogue intelligence agencies.
[03:12:14.928 --> 03:12:19.830]  This is a monumental decision by the president today.
[03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:23.092]  Some will criticize the redactions, but I would point out
[03:12:23.772 --> 03:12:39.999]  That the 1994 John F. Kennedy Records Release Act requires that the archives and the intelligence agencies publish in writing the reasons for any withholdings or redactions in the Federal Register.
[03:12:40.939 --> 03:12:43.641]  They have not yet done that.
[03:12:43.641 --> 03:13:04.412]  I have urged Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, who has been a real crusader for transparency on this issue, to look into the failure of the intelligence agencies to explain their redactions to date.
[03:13:04.412 --> 03:13:07.954]  Matt, do you have any reaction here to the JFK revelations?
[03:13:09.352 --> 03:13:13.913]  Well, I'm glad that Trump is leaning towards disclosure.
[03:13:13.913 --> 03:13:35.038]  I'll note that researchers that have been trying to follow up on a lot of untied threads of the communist networks operating in the 50s and 60s find that the archives are missing information, that physical documents have been taken out and misplaced or destroyed.
[03:13:35.038 --> 03:13:38.819]  So when they try to go back and look at these documents, they can't find them.
[03:13:39.463 --> 03:13:54.404]  I don't know if all of these documents have been kept in secure places or if, you know, people like Sandy Berger, who was trying to clean up behind Bill Clinton, you know, going into, I guess the Library of Congress or to remove
[03:13:56.112 --> 03:13:58.314]  You know, damaging information.
[03:13:58.314 --> 03:14:03.418]  It'll be interesting to see what damaging information is still left, or if it's been sanitized.
[03:14:03.418 --> 03:14:17.009]  Yeah, you bring up a famous incident in which Berger went into the National Archives, they assign a docent who spends time with you, he tells the docent, I have to take a classified telephone call, can you step out?
[03:14:17.009 --> 03:14:23.054]  While he steps out, Berger takes documents, shoves them down the front of his pants, and leaves.
[03:14:23.054 --> 03:14:25.155]  How much time did he spend in jail for this crime?
[03:14:26.061 --> 03:14:26.681]  None.
[03:14:26.681 --> 03:14:27.562]  Zero.
[03:14:27.562 --> 03:14:36.848]  But he was trying to cover up the fact that Bill Clinton could have taken out Bin Laden, had the opportunity, and passed on it.
[03:14:36.848 --> 03:14:38.529]  But you remind me of that.
[03:14:38.529 --> 03:14:41.871]  Now, it's also interesting that the National Archives
[03:14:42.851 --> 03:14:57.156]  Last November released 667 documents ahead of the of the August deadline or pardon me the July deadline and almost all of those documents were heavily redacted.
[03:14:57.876 --> 03:15:02.901]  I almost wonder whether that was a test to see what public reaction would be.
[03:15:02.901 --> 03:15:14.093]  The 96 documents released on that day are completely and totally worthless to scholars or researchers or reporters trying to figure out what happened on November 22, 1963.
[03:15:16.335 --> 03:15:30.442]  It was not until after that that the President became aware of his responsibilities under the 1994 Act and ordered the release of these documents to the consternation of our intelligence services.
[03:15:30.442 --> 03:15:33.463]  Good move today by President Donald Trump.
[03:15:33.463 --> 03:15:38.466]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show with my friend Matt Bracken, and we'll be right back.

[03:16:05.086 --> 03:16:10.770]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.770 --> 03:16:13.852]  We gotta get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[03:19:18.250 --> 03:19:19.330]  Thank you.

[03:19:29.152 --> 03:19:30.472]  They are quality.

[03:19:57.698 --> 03:20:00.399]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.665 --> 03:20:19.354]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:20:19.354 --> 03:20:20.975]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:20:20.975 --> 03:20:22.797]  Welcome back.
[03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:33.091]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.091 --> 03:20:44.433]  We were involved in a discussion with Matt Bracken regarding the release of the JFK assassination documents this morning by President Donald Trump.
[03:20:44.433 --> 03:20:54.275]  But we kind of segued into a broader conversation addressing an interview that the President gave to Fox & Friends this morning in which he intimated
[03:20:54.935 --> 03:21:03.220]  In response to a question regarding Russian collusion, that he is close to taking control of his own Justice Department.
[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:07.583]  Matt and I agree that it's long past time that he do that.
[03:21:07.583 --> 03:21:22.633]  And then last week, you had the Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying publicly that if the President fired Rod Rosenstein, the number two man in the department, but really the de facto Attorney General today, well that he
[03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:24.729]  Sessions
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:44.323]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch.
[03:21:44.323 --> 03:21:48.485]  He has full authority to direct their activities.
[03:21:48.485 --> 03:22:06.076]  But what we have instead is the Trump Justice Department ignoring the crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas that include unconstitutional illegal surveillance, the creation of fabricated evidence for the purposes of rationalizing that surveillance,
[03:22:06.616 --> 03:22:07.357]  I don't think so.
[03:22:22.316 --> 03:22:38.375]  Meanwhile, we have a witch hunt looking into the Trump campaign and Trump's many associates without yet today a scintilla of evidence of Russian collusion, conspiracy, or coordination.
[03:22:38.375 --> 03:22:39.155]  Matt, what's your take?
[03:22:39.844 --> 03:22:51.028]  Yeah, I think that the key, like the Rosetta Stone of this, is to understand how did Rosenstein become the acting Attorney General?
[03:22:51.028 --> 03:22:53.189]  Who put him forward for that?
[03:22:53.189 --> 03:23:03.593]  If we understood the machinations behind his being installed as deputy, I think we'll understand the larger outlines of this plot.
[03:23:03.593 --> 03:23:07.775]  Because clearly he was put in there to trigger Trump to fire Comey
[03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:13.892]  And then that would trigger a special counsel where he would name Comey's friend Robert Mueller.
[03:23:13.892 --> 03:23:16.093]  These are all corruptocrats.
[03:23:16.093 --> 03:23:23.197]  Rosenstein, Mueller, and Weissman all could go to prison for Uranium One.
[03:23:23.197 --> 03:23:26.418]  This, to me, gives them a strong motive to try to take out Trump.
[03:23:27.131 --> 03:23:38.721]  If there's an honest investigation into the last 10 years of the Uranium One scandal, we're talking $145 million going to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:23:38.721 --> 03:23:39.882]  That's not chicken feed.
[03:23:39.882 --> 03:23:42.024]  If you withheld $1,400 from the IRS, they want their money.
[03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:51.031]  145 million and there's no investigation.
[03:23:51.031 --> 03:23:57.836]  And Mueller, Rosenstein, and Weissman, who are all involved in that, hold the key to Trump's future.
[03:23:57.836 --> 03:23:59.057]  It's just crazy.
[03:23:59.057 --> 03:24:05.022]  This morning, the President said that he might be soon taking over the reins of the DOJ.
[03:24:05.022 --> 03:24:11.507]  I'd like to see President Trump and Devin Nunes marching into the Department of Justice with U.S.
[03:24:11.507 --> 03:24:13.028]  Marshals saying,
[03:24:13.749 --> 03:24:15.811]  We're going to take the records out.
[03:24:15.811 --> 03:24:16.752]  We've got dollies.
[03:24:16.752 --> 03:24:19.214]  We've got some, you know, the workers behind us.
[03:24:19.214 --> 03:24:22.016]  We're removing them now.
[03:24:22.016 --> 03:24:28.942]  Are you rejecting an order from your president that runs this building and do the same thing at the FBI?
[03:24:28.942 --> 03:24:33.466]  And anybody who stands in front of those records and says you can't have them, handcuff them.
[03:24:34.006 --> 03:24:36.490]  Take the records out.
[03:24:36.490 --> 03:24:46.563]  One of the biggest aspects of this scandal that has gotten almost no attention is that Strzok is a social friend of the FISA Court Judge Rudy Contreras.
[03:24:47.549 --> 03:24:54.110]  I mean, I love Sean Hannity, but he's always saying, boy, those FISA judges must be really mad that they were used.
[03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:55.811]  How do we know they were used?
[03:24:55.811 --> 03:24:59.131]  They might have been cooperating and planning this all along.
[03:24:59.131 --> 03:25:11.054]  There's that redacted email or text that says, we're going to have a meeting with Judge Rudy, but we need to make it a cocktail party and invite more people for cover for action.
[03:25:11.054 --> 03:25:14.455]  Cover for action is a term of tradecraft.
[03:25:14.455 --> 03:25:16.255]  That means, how do we
[03:25:17.075 --> 03:25:24.137]  Give ourselves a plausible reason for meeting somebody, otherwise it would be just a clandestine meeting between spies.
[03:25:24.137 --> 03:25:26.578]  We need to do it with a cover for action.
[03:25:26.578 --> 03:25:39.182]  This to me is a flagrant admission of guilty intent to meet the FISA judge out of church, you know, out of business hours to set this whole thing up.
[03:25:39.182 --> 03:25:43.804]  If the FISA court is as corrupt as the FBI is, where are we today?
[03:25:44.460 --> 03:25:53.628]  We've got a communist running the CIA by his own admission, voted for a communist in 1980 at the height of the Cold War, John Brennan.
[03:25:53.628 --> 03:25:57.812]  I mean, we've got Clapper lying repeatedly to Congress.
[03:25:57.812 --> 03:25:59.894]  They forget who runs who.
[03:25:59.894 --> 03:26:02.216]  Congress created the NSA.
[03:26:02.216 --> 03:26:04.678]  Congress created the CIA.
[03:26:04.678 --> 03:26:11.484]  Now they're off the leash, they've gone rogue, and they're trying to take out the president that's trying to put their collar back on.
[03:26:12.113 --> 03:26:15.636]  I mean, we are in the middle of a bureaucratic civil war right now.
[03:26:15.636 --> 03:26:33.289]  Nobody's being shot as of now, but day by day I expect canoe accidents, Fort Marcy Park bodies to be found, Admiral Borda suicides, because we're getting down to that period of this where there are people who are saying, if this guy testifies, I'm going to prison.
[03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:36.152]  It's time for an accident.
[03:26:36.152 --> 03:26:49.009]  Somebody's Mercedes is going to be Bluetooth enabled into a tree at 100 miles an hour like Michael Hastings after he had his sights set on John Brennan following his takedown of General Stanley McChrystal.
[03:26:49.716 --> 03:27:03.447]  I mean, these guys will stop at nothing at this point, and, you know, we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg above the water, but believe me, the sharks are circling down below, and, you know, there's blood in the water right now.
[03:27:03.447 --> 03:27:10.192]  With these Strock Page texts about to come out, literally anything could happen, including a false flag attack diversion.
[03:27:11.072 --> 03:27:26.446]  Some lunatic could be let off the FBI could drop the ball again in order to create a momentous distraction just as some of these more revelations about the corruption in the FBI and DOJ come out.
[03:27:26.446 --> 03:27:28.909]  Not to mention people like Brennan and Clapper.
[03:27:28.909 --> 03:27:31.151]  They're capable of doing literally anything.
[03:27:32.281 --> 03:27:36.224]  Matt, I think that's a very, very good analysis of the situation.
[03:27:36.224 --> 03:27:44.750]  I want to remind our listeners and our viewers that we here at InfoWars are completely and totally funded by you.
[03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:50.074]  We have no rich, conservative fat cats sitting in the wings writing us big checks.
[03:27:50.074 --> 03:27:56.859]  That's why I need you to go to the InfoWars.com site now and look at some of these extraordinary specials.
[03:27:56.859 --> 03:28:00.442]  We are the cutting edge when it comes to modern nutraceuticals.
[03:28:01.383 --> 03:28:04.385]  I particularly like Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:04.385 --> 03:28:08.668]  This show would not be possible without Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:08.668 --> 03:28:15.734]  I'm now stacking it with the Red Pill, which I think is the single best vitamin and mineral combination that I have found.
[03:28:15.734 --> 03:28:19.677]  They call this the body and mind combo.
[03:28:19.677 --> 03:28:21.699]  It is a great stack and right now,
[03:28:22.519 --> 03:28:25.682]  29.95 for Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:25.682 --> 03:28:34.929]  I find that this gives me mental clarity and mental energy around four o'clock in the afternoon when I start to flag, but the good news is it doesn't keep you up at night.
[03:28:34.929 --> 03:28:38.191]  You're not wired like you are with some of these energy drinks.
[03:28:38.191 --> 03:28:41.393]  So please take a moment, go to the Infowars.com store.

[03:28:53.413 --> 03:28:55.275]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:30:03.306 --> 03:30:04.488]  It's stronger.
[03:30:04.488 --> 03:30:06.089]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:30:06.089 --> 03:30:09.313]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:30:09.313 --> 03:30:10.434]  It's back in stock.
[03:30:10.434 --> 03:30:13.617]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:30:13.617 --> 03:30:16.941]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:30:17.501 --> 03:30:17.601]  It's
[03:30:36.098 --> 03:30:38.099]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[03:30:38.099 --> 03:30:39.480]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:30:39.480 --> 03:30:49.386]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:30:49.386 --> 03:30:52.468]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:55.094 --> 03:31:00.579]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:31:00.579 --> 03:31:01.419]  I take this.
[03:31:01.419 --> 03:31:02.560]  My family takes this.
[03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:06.844]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:31:06.844 --> 03:31:11.088]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:31:11.428 --> 03:31:16.070]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:17.211]  I don't feel good.
[03:31:17.211 --> 03:31:20.952]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:31:20.952 --> 03:31:23.653]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:31:23.653 --> 03:31:29.456]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:31:29.456 --> 03:31:32.417]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:31:32.417 --> 03:31:35.939]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:31:35.939 --> 03:31:38.180]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:31:38.180 --> 03:31:38.540]  I love it.
[03:31:38.700 --> 03:31:41.502]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:31:41.502 --> 03:31:42.523]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:48.468]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:31:48.468 --> 03:31:50.350]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:31:50.350 --> 03:31:51.591]  It's a win-win.
[03:31:51.591 --> 03:31:52.552]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:54.091 --> 03:31:58.514]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:31:58.514 --> 03:32:06.598]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:32:06.598 --> 03:32:11.901]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:32:11.901 --> 03:32:14.423]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:32:14.423 --> 03:32:18.645]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:32:18.645 --> 03:32:21.087]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:32:21.767 --> 03:32:29.010]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:32:29.010 --> 03:32:37.073]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:32:37.073 --> 03:32:44.256]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:32:44.256 --> 03:32:45.717]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:32:45.717 --> 03:32:47.538]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[03:32:48.358 --> 03:32:51.822]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your model now.
[03:32:51.822 --> 03:32:57.108]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:57.108 --> 03:32:59.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.952 --> 03:33:15.936]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.936 --> 03:33:19.498]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:19.498 --> 03:33:20.758]  Welcome back.
[03:33:23.442 --> 03:33:25.884]  The talking head's bringing us in there.
[03:33:25.884 --> 03:33:31.608]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones, and you're at Freedom Command Central.
[03:33:31.608 --> 03:33:33.909]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.909 --> 03:33:36.991]  In our last segment, Matt Bracken made a very good point.
[03:33:36.991 --> 03:33:44.777]  It was the Congress that created the NSA, created the Central Intelligence Agency, created all these alphabet soup
[03:33:45.377 --> 03:33:48.659]  Intelligence and national security agencies.
[03:33:48.659 --> 03:33:59.784]  Now we see a new phenomena with an extraordinarily disproportionate number of people from intelligence or military intelligence backgrounds now running for the Congress.
[03:34:00.544 --> 03:34:02.105]  As Democrats.
[03:34:02.105 --> 03:34:10.229]  One quarter of all Democratic challengers in competitive House districts have military or intelligence backgrounds.
[03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:17.992]  Intelligence backgrounds by far the largest subgroup of category of avocation.
[03:34:17.992 --> 03:34:19.993]  National security operatives 57, lawyers 45,
[03:34:23.675 --> 03:34:33.477]  Government officials, 35, corporate executives, businessmen, and wealthy individuals, 30, and other professionals, 19.
[03:34:33.477 --> 03:34:44.040]  Put another way, in the 102 primary elections recently held, 44 involved candidates with military intelligence backgrounds.
[03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:52.965]  Military intelligence candidates count for 10 of the 22 most competitive districts in the country.
[03:34:52.965 --> 03:34:58.248]  To me, this smacks of a separation of power issue.
[03:34:58.248 --> 03:35:08.393]  What we see here is a clear trend of intelligence types seeking to invade the Congress in order to subvert that body and in essence
[03:35:09.874 --> 03:35:15.177]  You know, the congressional oversight, you mean what's left of it?
[03:35:15.177 --> 03:35:19.579]  It's like a toothless puppy trying to, you know, pull down a pit bull
[03:35:36.201 --> 03:35:40.951]  Because the, theoretically, the toothless puppy is in charge of the pit bull.
[03:35:40.951 --> 03:35:46.242]  But, you know, when the CIA, remember, was not supposed to operate inside of the United States.
[03:35:47.014 --> 03:36:05.961]  Because the fear was that they would begin to run intelligence operations here, and that would morph into exactly what we have seen, which is the tools of intelligence operations, as opposed to intelligence gathering, intelligence operations being used at home, which is essentially what the frame-up of Donald Trump is.
[03:36:05.961 --> 03:36:14.664]  It's a rogue intelligence operation, starting with the end desire to get rid of Donald Trump before he can destroy the deep state,
[03:36:15.405 --> 03:36:26.734]  And then working backward from there to fabricate the steel dossier, take it to a probably corrupt FISA court which would rubber stamp it, and they'd be off to the races.
[03:36:26.734 --> 03:36:29.756]  So, that's at the national level.
[03:36:29.756 --> 03:36:30.957]  But at every other level,
[03:36:31.724 --> 03:36:41.368]  If these intelligence agencies think they're going to have a friendly operator now in congressional camouflage, what kind of help are they going to give them?
[03:36:41.368 --> 03:36:55.193]  You know, there's often a non-clear and intentionally non-clear distinction between active duty serving intelligence officers, retired, former, contract, etc.
[03:36:55.193 --> 03:36:55.853]  This is how, in the past,
[03:37:00.256 --> 03:37:08.802]  Former Green Berets and SEALs, they've been approached by people that they knew a decade earlier in some war zone as a CIA officer.
[03:37:08.802 --> 03:37:15.187]  And they don't always say clearly whether they are working under official orders or if they're now private.
[03:37:15.187 --> 03:37:25.054]  Because there's this gray area where the active intelligence officers will get out, but they're still really in.
[03:37:25.054 --> 03:37:28.296]  It's called sheep dipping for one word for it.
[03:37:29.119 --> 03:37:33.102]  They're actually still in, but they pretend to be private citizens.
[03:37:33.102 --> 03:37:48.656]  So, these former Green Berets and SEALs, they never know when they're dealing with some guy that they met long ago as a CIA officer, if the guy is legitimately acting on orders, or if he's gone rogue and he's operating under his own auspices.
[03:37:49.296 --> 03:38:01.205]  This is how, for example, when Michael Hastings' Mercedes blew up, you know, at full speed, I don't think that there's ever going to be a paper trail back to the CIA.
[03:38:01.205 --> 03:38:08.770]  But it's sort of like, you know, who will rid me of this troublesome priest?
[03:38:08.770 --> 03:38:18.617]  The intention is declared and people that want to curry favor, the cutouts, working with cutouts, eventually the action takes place.
[03:38:19.312 --> 03:38:23.277]  Yeah, and this has now come back to the United States.
[03:38:23.277 --> 03:38:30.966]  In 1963, Truman wrote a letter to the Washington Post that was actually literally pulled out of the Washington Post for decades afterwards.
[03:38:31.795 --> 03:38:39.322]  You know, explaining his fears that the CIA would become a Frankenstein monster, or already had become a Frankenstein monster.
[03:38:39.322 --> 03:38:42.204]  That was in December of 63, he wrote that.
[03:38:42.204 --> 03:38:43.405]  Curious timing.
[03:38:43.405 --> 03:38:45.187]  You know, right after the assassination.
[03:38:45.187 --> 03:38:49.511]  The letter ran for one edition, and then it was pulled.
[03:38:49.511 --> 03:38:55.055]  Truman said that signing the CIA into law was the biggest single mistake he ever made.
[03:38:56.997 --> 03:39:12.010]  I am very interested in the question of the FISA warrants because the New York Times reported on January 20th, 2017 that I was the subject of a FISA warrant along with Paul Manafort and Carter Page.
[03:39:12.951 --> 03:39:22.379]  A number of things that have happened since then that lead me to believe that the government has full access to my email and my communications.
[03:39:22.379 --> 03:39:31.366]  Therefore, today I filed a Freedom of Information request with approximately 40 different agencies of the government.
[03:39:32.086 --> 03:39:36.389]  Seeking information as to whether I was a subject to a FISA warrant.
[03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:38.651]  This is a precursor to a lawsuit.
[03:39:38.651 --> 03:39:43.034]  You have to ask formally and then be denied, which is what I expect.
[03:39:43.034 --> 03:39:45.896]  And then we'll move to the second stage.
[03:39:45.896 --> 03:39:56.683]  I do know that the government continues to deny that Paul Manafort was ever under surveillance, even though the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times have all reported otherwise.
[03:39:56.683 --> 03:40:00.046]  And then there is the curious question of Carter Page.
[03:40:00.706 --> 03:40:02.287]  The appointment of a U.S.
[03:40:02.287 --> 03:40:09.451]  attorney in Utah to look into the FISA abuses is a head fake, in my opinion.
[03:40:09.451 --> 03:40:12.472]  It's not that Huber, the man appointed, is not a good man.
[03:40:12.472 --> 03:40:13.813]  I think he may be.
[03:40:13.813 --> 03:40:17.715]  He's been given no budget and no authority, unlike Robert Mueller.
[03:40:18.295 --> 03:40:18.736]  We're good to go.
[03:40:34.270 --> 03:40:37.411]  As Mr. Huber will be stonewalled.
[03:40:37.411 --> 03:41:01.838]  This was to take the pressure off of Jeff Sessions for his failure to appoint a second special prosecutor to look into the FISA warrant abuses, the Steele dossier, and that whole ugly story, which seems to me to lead right back to the Hillary Clinton campaign, but thanks to Peter Stroke's text message, leads us right back to Barack Obama.
[03:41:02.538 --> 03:41:06.401]  What did the President know, and when did he know it?
[03:41:06.401 --> 03:41:07.582]  Pat?
[03:41:07.582 --> 03:41:19.893]  Yeah, I think that partly they're trying to protect the upper echelons, but, you know, if McCabe, he gets threatened, I think his terminology was something like, burn the whole damn house down, if he's indicted.
[03:41:19.893 --> 03:41:26.939]  If he's going to make the claim that he was acting under orders, that he was, you know,
[03:41:28.737 --> 03:41:33.942]  Cooperating with with Kony and Obama and indirectly Clapper and Brennan.
[03:41:33.942 --> 03:41:52.858]  If he starts pointing fingers that high, I think that he's going to need another level of life insurance and I would advise him strictly to not go bicycling or canoeing or jogging in Fort Marcy Park because I think that the man would be
[03:41:54.788 --> 03:41:57.871]  At serious risk of being Michael Hastings.
[03:41:57.871 --> 03:41:59.633]  Very serious risk.
[03:41:59.633 --> 03:42:04.597]  The other question that interests me today is discrepancy.
[03:42:04.597 --> 03:42:16.568]  Yesterday, True Pundit, who I found has had a terrific record of accuracy, said that the Russian woman lawyer, whose name I can never pronounce properly, Veselnitskaya,
[03:42:17.108 --> 03:42:22.716]  Was allowed into the country at the time of her famous meeting with Donald Trump Jr.
[03:42:22.716 --> 03:42:25.660]  on a special visa that was approved by U.S.
[03:42:25.660 --> 03:42:28.404]  Attorney Preet Bharara.
[03:42:28.404 --> 03:42:32.129]  We will come back and review this question on the other side.
[03:42:38.351 --> 03:42:45.095]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[03:42:53.143 --> 03:42:56.566]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:42:56.566 --> 03:43:00.530]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:03.873]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:03.873 --> 03:43:06.415]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:06.415 --> 03:43:11.159]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:43:11.159 --> 03:43:13.501]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:13.501 --> 03:43:19.927]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:20.487 --> 03:43:28.694]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:28.694 --> 03:43:33.759]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:33.759 --> 03:43:40.745]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:43:41.385 --> 03:43:46.309]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:51.454]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:43:51.454 --> 03:43:59.481]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have at InfoWars Life, it'd take hours.
[03:43:59.481 --> 03:44:05.906]  MicroZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics, it knocks out the yeast, the mold.
[03:44:06.947 --> 03:44:09.028]  The Candida, it's back in stock.
[03:44:09.028 --> 03:44:12.209]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.209 --> 03:44:15.971]  It's got the Preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:15.971 --> 03:44:19.092]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[03:44:19.092 --> 03:44:19.813]  So you can upload it.
[03:44:19.813 --> 03:44:29.137]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:44:29.137 --> 03:44:31.378]  That's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.378 --> 03:44:34.379]  It's a supplement with iodine, super
[03:44:34.719 --> 03:44:36.700]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[03:44:36.700 --> 03:44:38.080]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:44:38.080 --> 03:44:48.004]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:44:48.004 --> 03:44:51.065]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:44:53.686 --> 03:45:04.271]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.271 --> 03:45:06.332]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.332 --> 03:45:09.194]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.194 --> 03:45:10.694]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:10.694 --> 03:45:13.816]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:45:14.056 --> 03:45:17.499]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:45:17.499 --> 03:45:19.580]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:45:19.580 --> 03:45:29.307]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:29.307 --> 03:45:41.876]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[03:45:42.216 --> 03:45:44.197]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:44.197 --> 03:45:47.778]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:45:47.778 --> 03:45:52.681]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:45:52.681 --> 03:45:56.002]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:46:12.089 --> 03:46:25.962]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding.
[03:46:25.962 --> 03:46:31.608]  Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:32.148 --> 03:46:36.269]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:36.269 --> 03:46:47.512]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:47.512 --> 03:46:57.175]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:57.175 --> 03:46:59.796]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.206 --> 03:47:12.432]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:12.432 --> 03:47:16.038]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:16.038 --> 03:47:17.159]  Welcome back.
[03:47:23.717 --> 03:47:31.882]  You're at the right place, that's right, it's the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your host, Roger Stone, joining me, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:31.882 --> 03:47:53.597]  If you like the expanded coverage at InfoWars, if you're enjoying the Real News with David Knight in the mornings, the iconic Alex Jones Show midday, and of course, the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer, please remember that we are completely listener and viewer supported here at InfoWars, and we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced.
[03:47:54.558 --> 03:48:10.411]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[03:48:10.411 --> 03:48:20.339]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[03:48:20.959 --> 03:48:24.201]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[03:48:24.201 --> 03:48:24.762]  Why?
[03:48:24.762 --> 03:48:26.543]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter.
[03:48:26.543 --> 03:48:30.566]  And he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[03:48:30.566 --> 03:48:32.628]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[03:48:32.628 --> 03:48:34.789]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[03:48:34.789 --> 03:48:39.533]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[03:48:39.533 --> 03:48:49.140]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine.
[03:48:49.660 --> 03:48:57.951]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[03:48:57.951 --> 03:49:08.144]  And you can compare our prices with the competitor, oh, I don't know, say Whole Foods, and you'll find that our prices are lower, but our products are superior.
[03:49:08.604 --> 03:49:13.446]  You'll find no fillers, you'll find no secondary ingredients.
[03:49:13.446 --> 03:49:16.807]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[03:49:16.807 --> 03:49:23.450]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:27.211]  Whether it is Brain Force Plus, whether it is the Red Pill.
[03:49:29.332 --> 03:49:31.093]  These are some of my favorites.
[03:49:31.093 --> 03:49:33.434]  I also like the whey protein.
[03:49:33.434 --> 03:49:37.457]  Finding good whey protein that doesn't taste like gasoline is a challenge.
[03:49:37.457 --> 03:49:40.959]  The One B Salad Infowars is one of the best.
[03:49:40.959 --> 03:49:43.981]  But please, when you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself,
[03:49:44.821 --> 03:49:48.922]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360 degree win.
[03:49:48.922 --> 03:49:55.925]  You win and we win because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[03:49:55.925 --> 03:50:07.589]  So please folks, do us a favor, do yourself a favor, stand up for the First Amendment, kick George Soros right in the derriere, go to the website now and order some of these terrific products.
[03:50:08.209 --> 03:50:15.390]  So we were talking about how this woman, Russian lawyer, Vesel Nitskaya, got into the country, Matt.
[03:50:15.390 --> 03:50:22.932]  What's interesting is that the true pundit reported that she had a special visa that was approved by a U.S.
[03:50:22.932 --> 03:50:26.172]  attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara.
[03:50:26.172 --> 03:50:37.034]  But then Reuters came out with a story almost immediately contradicting that, saying that Bharara had denied her a visa, but then going on to say that the
[03:50:37.774 --> 03:50:43.538]  A state department gave her a special visa anyway in June of 2016.
[03:50:43.538 --> 03:50:46.820]  What it doesn't tell us is who approved that visa.
[03:50:46.820 --> 03:50:57.167]  She was denied a visa because she was not a witness or central to a legal case in which she had a client going on in New York.
[03:50:57.167 --> 03:51:05.593]  She had been approved for a temporary visa on three separate previous occasions by the US attorney.
[03:51:05.593 --> 03:51:07.434]  The question seems to me to remain.
[03:51:07.774 --> 03:51:11.058]  Yeah, and I'd like to discuss a little bit about that Donald Jr.
[03:51:11.058 --> 03:51:11.238]  meeting.
[03:51:27.993 --> 03:51:32.698]  To me, this all smacks of an active intelligence operation against the president.
[03:51:32.698 --> 03:51:44.149]  And what they'll do is operate on multiple tracks because you don't know which of the plans is going to be a fizzle or a hang fire and which is going to be the one that takes off and succeeds.
[03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:47.152]  So you might try five or six different parallel operations.
[03:51:48.553 --> 03:51:50.133]  One of them was the Donald Jr.
[03:51:50.133 --> 03:51:50.814]  meeting.
[03:51:50.814 --> 03:51:53.335]  It didn't matter if they talked about badminton.
[03:51:53.335 --> 03:51:59.738]  The fact that they were in the same room would be then spun into the false narrative of Russian collusion.
[03:51:59.738 --> 03:52:01.619]  Another one was Carter Page.
[03:52:01.619 --> 03:52:03.020]  He's a good, decent man.
[03:52:03.020 --> 03:52:06.682]  He was in Moscow many times on business.
[03:52:06.682 --> 03:52:07.282]  That's enough.
[03:52:07.282 --> 03:52:12.245]  The fact that he was in Moscow, that can be spun into a false narrative.
[03:52:12.245 --> 03:52:14.646]  And the other one is Papadopoulos.
[03:52:14.646 --> 03:52:16.407]  This is the most flagrant to me.
[03:52:17.188 --> 03:52:21.933]  He happens, of all the people in London, this is what, a city of many millions?
[03:52:21.933 --> 03:52:27.599]  He just happened to sit down at a bar, talk about winning back-to-back Powerballs.
[03:52:27.599 --> 03:52:38.290]  He happens to sit down with the High Commissioner to Britain from Australia, and allegedly talked about Russian espionage, just purely by coincidence.
[03:52:38.290 --> 03:52:39.191]  And then it turns out,
[03:52:39.770 --> 03:52:44.951]  That this guy Alexander Downer is a major bundler for the Hillary Clinton Foundation.
[03:52:44.951 --> 03:52:51.813]  We don't know what his angle was in doing so, getting Australians to donate to the Hillary Clinton Foundation.
[03:52:51.813 --> 03:52:55.014]  To the Clinton Foundation, Family Foundation, whatever it's called.
[03:52:55.014 --> 03:53:01.096]  So, this to me smacks of an intelligence operation where he's vectored to Papadopoulos.
[03:53:01.096 --> 03:53:06.678]  Doesn't matter if they spoke to each other for two minutes about football scores.
[03:53:06.678 --> 03:53:07.758]  American or British.
[03:53:08.513 --> 03:53:19.261]  It can then be spun as a meeting where this wonderful guy, Alexander Downer, just happened to hear Papadopoulos talking about Russian collusion.
[03:53:19.261 --> 03:53:25.686]  This, to me, is like if somebody said, hey, my neighbor, he's won 10 lotteries in a row.
[03:53:25.686 --> 03:53:29.249]  I would have to be an idiot to actually believe that.
[03:53:29.249 --> 03:53:33.612]  Now, if I saw the checks, I'd say, then the fix is in.
[03:53:33.612 --> 03:53:34.613]  This was all a setup.
[03:53:35.299 --> 03:53:37.841]  The Donald Jr.
[03:53:37.841 --> 03:53:48.167]  meeting, the London meeting with the Australian High Commissioner, who just happens to be all tied to the Clinton Foundation, and then going after Carter Page.
[03:53:48.167 --> 03:53:51.950]  Remember, it wasn't just a bug and wiretapped Carter Page.
[03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:55.532]  He was the conduit into the entire Trump campaign.
[03:53:55.532 --> 03:54:00.075]  Once they had the FISA warrant on Carter Page, all of his contacts were fair game.
[03:54:00.755 --> 03:54:04.159]  And that means going back in time because it's all archived.
[03:54:04.159 --> 03:54:05.661]  Everything is saved.
[03:54:05.661 --> 03:54:09.125]  So yeah, this to me was an intelligence operation from go.
[03:54:09.125 --> 03:54:11.988]  They assumed that Hillary would win and it would all be covered up.
[03:54:12.771 --> 03:54:24.415]  You know, that this would be used to sabotage the election, but then he actually won, and now they're desperate to cover their tracks, because people can definitely go to jail for this, or be killed.
[03:54:24.415 --> 03:54:32.478]  You know, Andrew McCabe, you'd better have a powerful force field around you, my friend, because there are people that will take you out.
[03:54:32.478 --> 03:54:37.440]  I mean, I'm talking about people that do wet jobs, do wet work for a living.
[03:54:37.440 --> 03:54:38.741]  They will have you taken out.
[03:54:39.431 --> 03:54:44.534]  Well, of course, Matt, we pray that you're wrong, but you don't seem to believe in coincidence.
[03:54:44.534 --> 03:54:57.701]  Look, both Papadopoulos and Carter Page were so low in the food chain, neither one of them was a paid staffer, neither one of them had a credential to get into the headquarters, neither one of them had any status.
[03:54:57.701 --> 03:55:06.686]  They were both volunteers in what was a foreign policy committee with over a hundred members, essentially put together for the purposes of a press release.
[03:55:07.446 --> 03:55:14.390]  Carter Page may be a perfectly nice guy, but to refer to him as a foreign policy advisor for Donald Trump is a bit of a stretch.
[03:55:14.390 --> 03:55:18.131]  In the case of Papadopoulos, it's even more of a stretch.
[03:55:18.131 --> 03:55:24.254]  So I tend to agree with you that those two operations are highly suspicious.
[03:55:24.254 --> 03:55:24.895]  The meeting
[03:55:25.595 --> 03:55:26.937]  In the Donald Trump Jr.'
[03:55:26.917 --> 03:55:36.328]  's office, which is allegedly to get negative information regarding Hillary, she has none, produces none, ends up being a discussion of adoption law.
[03:55:36.328 --> 03:55:39.852]  It's a setup, very clearly a setup.
[03:55:39.852 --> 03:55:43.497]  And there is no crime there, there's no wrongdoing there, Don Jr.
[03:55:43.497 --> 03:55:44.959]  didn't do anything wrong.
[03:55:45.920 --> 03:55:53.126]  We don't know anything about this woman lawyer other than the fact that she's connected to Fusion GPS.
[03:55:53.126 --> 03:55:57.610]  How incredibly coincidental that she's worked with them.
[03:55:57.610 --> 03:55:58.390]  Extraordinary.
[03:55:58.390 --> 03:56:01.473]  And now they're talking about Brennan's secret trip to Moscow in 2016.
[03:56:02.987 --> 03:56:08.552]  You know, the guy that voted for the Communists in 1980 as an adult, and then went up to the CIA.
[03:56:08.552 --> 03:56:14.977]  Also the guy who spied on a Senate committee looking into torture by the CIA, and then lied about it under oath.
[03:56:14.977 --> 03:56:17.599]  An Islamic convert, John Brennan.
[03:56:17.599 --> 03:56:22.924]  I think you will find, I have a long piece at Infowars you can pull up, I think he's the chief perp.
[03:56:23.504 --> 03:56:29.209]  He's the guy who starts suggesting Russian collusion long before it's a popular term.
[03:56:29.209 --> 03:56:33.733]  In fact, he's predicted it seemingly before it's ever allegedly happened.
[03:56:33.733 --> 03:56:37.517]  So, I want to thank Matt Bracken for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:37.517 --> 03:56:45.684]  I want to thank all of you for tuning in and I want to ask you one more time to remember that we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced at InfoWars.
[03:56:46.224 --> 03:56:48.266]  There is an effort to strangle us.
[03:56:48.266 --> 03:56:55.151]  There is an effort to kill our First Amendment rights, to wipe us off the internet, and literally shut us down.
[03:56:55.151 --> 03:56:59.435]  Alex Jones is working double time to prevent that, but we need your help.
[03:56:59.435 --> 03:57:08.742]  So please, go to TheInfoWars.com store now, check these extraordinary specials, particularly like the Super Blue Oral line of products.
[03:57:09.142 --> 03:57:12.466]  Now on special, the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the gargle.
[03:57:12.466 --> 03:57:14.489]  My wife is a big aficionado of these.
[03:57:14.489 --> 03:57:16.932]  It's the best whitening agent she has found.
[03:57:16.932 --> 03:57:21.758]  But find a product that works for you or look at our books or t-shirts.

[03:58:49.330 --> 03:58:52.192]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:58:52.192 --> 03:58:54.174]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:58:54.174 --> 03:58:59.198]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[03:59:07.706 --> 03:59:11.069]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:59:11.209 --> 03:59:11.709]  We're good to go.
