[21:30.680 --> 21:35.400]  them that's a quote we have all the internal videos of youtube facebook twitter saying
[21:35.400 --> 21:41.120]  our main job is to stop alex jones we have congressional hearings from four months ago
[21:41.120 --> 21:46.000]  with congressman quickly going paul watson of info wars was number one at lunch they

[22:28.520 --> 22:35.400]  and have dead people vote the bears go potty in the woods but let's go to let's go to
[22:35.400 --> 22:40.560]  the committee hearing right now with diamond and silk here it is being targeted and censored
[22:40.560 --> 22:47.040]  on social media platforms facebook along with other social media sites have taken aggressive
[22:47.040 --> 22:53.280]  actions to silence conservative voices such as ourselves by deliberately restricting weaponizing
[22:53.280 --> 23:00.600]  our page with algorithms that censor and suppress our free speech these bias algorithms are
[23:00.600 --> 23:07.080]  tactics designed to pick up on key words thus telling the pages how to behave in ways that
[23:07.080 --> 23:13.480]  repress and stifle express ideas including shadow banding which block our content for
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.800]  being seen by our followers while depriving our brand through the demonetization of our
[23:19.800 --> 23:26.640]  videos followers stop receiving notification when we posted videos and content followers
[23:26.640 --> 23:33.280]  was also mysteriously unlike from our page subtle and slowly facebook use one mechanism
[23:33.280 --> 23:39.880]  at a time to diminish our reach by restricting our page so that our 1.2 million followers
[23:39.880 --> 23:45.720]  would not see our content thus silencing our conservative voices when we reached out to
[23:45.720 --> 23:52.280]  facebook for an explanation they gave us the run around mark zuckerberg testified before
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.920]  congress and stated that the most important thing he cared about was making sure no one
[23:56.920 --> 24:04.200]  interferes in the 2018 elections but after doing our research we wondered if mark zuckerberg
[24:04.200 --> 24:11.920]  was using facebook to interfere in the 2018 elections by laboring by labeling users accounts
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.000]  as either liberal very liberal moderate conservative he admitted he was for the democrats that
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.960]  is one of them that's in the wiki lakes conservative so if I'm labeled as very liberal without
[24:24.960 --> 24:31.320]  the option to edit it update and correct the settings then algorithms are already put in
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.640]  place which allows advertisers that have liberal they label you just like the nazis put the
[24:36.640 --> 24:42.160]  stars on jews and pink triangles on gaze this is super dangerous but they know that you
[24:42.160 --> 24:48.960]  can search engine wiki lakes where obama and hillary go we own facebook we own twitter
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.960]  guys gals pull up that the headline just two weeks ago ceo of twitter says we're going
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.320]  to have a revolution against conservatives and crush them I mean they're like declaring
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.040]  the war and then conservatives are like we think maybe they're doing this to us keep
[25:04.040 --> 25:13.280]  going diamonds and silk or diamond and silk then algorithms are already put in place which
[25:13.280 --> 25:19.680]  allows advertisers that have liberal views services and causes to target at me and you
[25:19.680 --> 25:26.840]  can see the graph on the screen and it shows clearly that our personal accounts have been
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.440]  already labeled diamond and silk personal facebook page has been labeled by facebook as very
[25:32.440 --> 25:39.000]  liberal even though we are not very liberal facebook do not give us the option to change
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.920]  this label to conservative making it less likely for us to see advertisement news stories
[25:44.920 --> 25:51.040]  and services for a conservative point of view if facebook labeled our user accounts as very
[25:51.040 --> 25:56.040]  liberal and got it wrong that's good we're going to come back to more of this it's live
[25:56.040 --> 26:01.240]  it's more sophisticated it's part of the chinese global system that's being adopted of the
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.440]  world's social score where they just hit a button and you're banned from the web it's
[26:06.440 --> 26:12.640]  called internet id it's the holy grail of censorship and control so we'll get into more
[26:12.640 --> 26:18.840]  of this and how it ties into nbc's failing bet on megan kelly wall street journal her
[26:18.840 --> 26:27.640]  ratings continue to plunge continue to fall because people know she's a fraud and they're
[26:27.640 --> 26:34.160]  sick of her meanwhile they have a new hatred of journalism index being reported on and
[26:34.160 --> 26:40.200]  of course accosta of cnn talked about it's so dangerous trumps going to get people killed
[26:40.200 --> 26:48.560]  attacking free speech now saying fake journalists like jim accosta and megan kelly are frauds
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.440]  saying that they're full of lies and disinfo is not attacking the press it's saying you
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.040]  are a liar you're attacking us you're misrepresenting us you're saying go after libertarians go
[26:59.040 --> 27:09.680]  after nationals you're calling us nazis tom arnold's telling kandacellans to suck the
[27:09.680 --> 27:15.760]  racist you know what you're the ones that are completely out of control then you point

[27:20.400 --> 27:26.240]  told me they're getting ready the globalist to stage attacks against universities against
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.440]  media institutions against the u and against the fellow reserve to then say anybody that

[33:44.960 --> 33:53.120]  tech giants censor conservatives nationalist free market folks patriots anybody popular they

[34:13.440 --> 34:20.560]  bears do live in the woods and hillary clinton is corrupt and the shana clause is not real
[34:20.560 --> 34:25.280]  and obama care is not free and you did build your business but obama said you didn't
[34:27.600 --> 34:34.960]  so let me just hit a few of these little little tidbits for you that we're going to be getting
[34:34.960 --> 34:44.960]  into a germany about six years ago banned the construction of single family homes shang the
[34:44.960 --> 34:54.080]  family's bad they want to encourage not having children us today has come out and called for
[34:54.080 --> 35:01.040]  getting rid of the single family home it's right here the single family house an american icon faces
[35:01.040 --> 35:07.360]  an uncertain future and the article basically says it's bad get rid of it this is a global plan
[35:07.360 --> 35:10.960]  so what you see in china and what you see in germany is the plan here
[35:10.960 --> 35:20.720]  they want you in big jeff bezos owned bloomberg owned coffin apartments where you pay more for
[35:20.720 --> 35:28.720]  a 250 square foot but you pay for a 2000 more money and more taxes to them who were tax exempt
[35:28.720 --> 35:35.200]  by the way the guardian has an article about how jeff bezos never pays taxes so even the liberals
[35:35.200 --> 35:44.400]  admit it but he's liberals um he'll live in a 40 000 square foot house and have helicopters and
[35:44.400 --> 35:55.440]  private jets and mistresses he's liberal like all the communist liberals and you know they're rich
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.680]  parents and pulling up their Mercedes and wearing pacifist around their necks with big bags of ecstasy
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.760]  the police let them into coachella and they dance around in party and pose in front of corporate
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.440]  logos pretending they're movie stars and then are questioned by a major publication and more than
[36:11.440 --> 36:18.480]  half identify as socialist and communist they're the ruling class they don't pay taxes they take
[36:18.480 --> 36:26.000]  drugs all day they suck on pacifiers and then they hate farmers that aren't paying more
[36:26.000 --> 36:35.120]  and people that work in factories and truck drivers they're petty capitalist over there we
[36:35.120 --> 36:45.200]  are communists with our smartphones and 200 skinny jeans so we're gonna break all of that down
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.000]  here in just a moment and of course exclusive national geographic exclusive
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  exclusive
[36:55.200 --> 37:01.680]  ancient mass child sacrifice may be world's largest but i remember sitting there for the
[37:01.680 --> 37:06.480]  few years i went to college was as i was realizing how worthless it was in all the different
[37:06.480 --> 37:13.760]  sociology anthropology classes i took archaeology they would be real politically correct because
[37:13.760 --> 37:19.600]  that was the political correctness of the time they'd say you know there weren't really human
[37:19.600 --> 37:26.320]  sacrifices in mezzo america that's a lie of the uh conquistadors
[37:28.640 --> 37:34.560]  and i'm sitting there and i'd been to central america i'd been to mexico i'd been to to loom
[37:34.560 --> 37:41.840]  and akamal and chichinitsa and amazing sights and they had the mayan guides there explaining
[37:41.840 --> 37:46.080]  here we are at the well of souls where there are tens of thousands of skeletons mainly of
[37:46.080 --> 37:54.080]  children at the bottom but also women they were bound their heads bashed in and then thrown into
[37:54.080 --> 38:06.560]  the water goddess and then they take you to the next place but it but in liberal austin oh no no
[38:06.560 --> 38:12.240]  notice the children have their heads bashed out but let's just go ahead and cover this one now i
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.560]  think we'll start here first because every culture ends up with the central government
[38:16.560 --> 38:21.360]  and enough corruption they get a priest class finally it may take a thousand years it ends
[38:21.360 --> 38:27.360]  in child sacrifice because it's the ultimate thing to make the population submit if you'll
[38:27.360 --> 38:34.480]  give your three-year-old up to have their throat slit and shoved into a peat bog crying for mommy
[38:34.480 --> 38:42.160]  with blood spraying out of their mouth that's scotland ireland england germany where the
[38:42.160 --> 38:47.680]  folks live then the germanic people did the same stuff they had bonfires bonfires
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.040]  a lot of times the priest class would demand the king's son or daughter to be burned
[38:56.320 --> 39:00.720]  it was an act of the priest class dominance that usually happened during societal collapse
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.080]  the priest class took totally took over even from the warrior class and you see that with
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.440]  the Aztecs and their decline even before cortex got there with a few hundred men and
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.200]  conquered over ten thousand people in mexico city today knows mexico city today there in the
[39:15.200 --> 39:19.360]  chalupas that's where the word chalupa comes from was the floating gardens when he conquered the
[39:19.360 --> 39:29.920]  chalupas down there he just said they were all begging for us to kill them because the insanity
[39:29.920 --> 39:37.760]  had been going on so long and the hallucinating and the drugs and the occultic behavior but now
[39:37.760 --> 39:45.440]  exclusive oh the national geographics ready to tell us ancient mass child sacrifice may be world's
[39:45.440 --> 39:53.760]  largest evidence for the largest single incident of child mass sacrifice in the americas and likely
[39:53.760 --> 39:59.120]  in world history has been discovered and produced northeastern coast archaeologists tell national

[47:29.520 --> 47:41.600]  well there's a new chapter in the whole kanya west battle against the thought police
[47:42.160 --> 47:48.000]  ladies and gentlemen yesterday we had the top story on drudge report dot com
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.480]  where he was standing up to the thought police i tweeted it out at real alex jones kanya unleashed
[47:54.480 --> 48:01.520]  and he said listen we're trying to intimidate me we're trying to bully me i'm going to continue
[48:01.520 --> 48:07.280]  to stand up for free thought and free speech i don't dislike anybody i don't dislike the democrats
[48:07.280 --> 48:12.880]  but i have a right to my thoughts and my views well now he just tweeted out we're retweeting
[48:12.880 --> 48:19.600]  in at real alex jones as we speak a conversation he had with one of his friends this morning
[48:19.600 --> 48:25.200]  trying to basically intimidate him and he said listen i love you my friend but don't try to
[48:25.200 --> 48:32.000]  use fear on me to shut down my free thought exactly that is so authoritarian that's what's
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.400]  dangerous that's what's out of control so we're going to get to that here in just a moment and
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.800]  then get to this huge news about the un warning of 500 million islamists coming into europe opening
[48:44.800 --> 48:52.080]  the borders but spending it like it's a isis plan when isis is working with the globalist we're going
[48:52.080 --> 49:01.440]  to look at all of that right now now before i go any further ladies and gentlemen survival field x2
[49:01.440 --> 49:08.400]  is from our research the purest true atomic iodine and that just means it's atomic periodical table
[49:08.400 --> 49:18.480]  system the others the other forms of iodine are bound to other substances
[49:20.080 --> 49:23.440]  and go through your body and can even have some
[49:24.240 --> 49:30.240]  unpleasurable effects in the stomach in my experience because we knew how good iodine was
[49:30.240 --> 49:34.720]  a decade ago we were looking into putting into a supplement but every company i went to scores of
[49:34.720 --> 49:41.200]  them had it bound to types in alcohol saying it was atomic was pure crud try to eat the stuff at
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.000]  the store it'll eat a hole in your stomach don't do it this is the only iodine that myself and my
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.520]  family can take with no problems or side effects consult your physician but you die without iodine
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.320]  but there's less and less of it the soil and the plants and the meat and the food most of it's bound
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.720]  but we're running out of x2 we're probably going to be able to get more but the places we get it
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.520]  are increasing the price of the atomic iodine obviously a lot of it i think industrial sabotage
[50:09.520 --> 50:13.280]  people try to block us they try to stop us at every front but we got an extra shipment in
[50:13.280 --> 50:17.360]  we can keep it discounted for a few more days then it's got to go back to regular price survival

[51:24.160 --> 51:30.800]  they point out Kanye West has been with the Bronovitch the Alistair Crowley witch and he's said he
[51:30.800 --> 51:37.600]  liked Obama and you know there's Kim Kardashian with her yes that witch woman is the god of
[51:37.600 --> 51:43.520]  Hollywood and Alistair Crowley witch in her own reddit asked me anything she's tied in the
[51:43.520 --> 51:49.200]  pedestrian emails she's super uber bad news what who do you think that these parties these
[51:49.200 --> 51:56.160]  narcissist parties in Hollywood and New York this woman is worship she's everywhere and
[51:59.200 --> 52:04.560]  you got the thief and the murderer hanging on the cross by Christ on the
[52:06.960 --> 52:10.880]  hill of Golgotha on the skull hill at Calvary
[52:10.880 --> 52:21.760]  and that's Jay-Z on screen of your radio listener with her and one of them repents one of them
[52:21.760 --> 52:25.920]  doesn't and Christ says the one that repents you'll be with me today in paradise and the point is
[52:27.520 --> 52:32.480]  I judge a tree by its fruits even hanging around Hollywood scum all that soulless empty garbage
[52:32.480 --> 52:36.160]  where they're all looking to be fulfilled because they're so empty so they get deeper into the evil
[52:36.160 --> 52:41.920]  deeper into the darkness trying to find it I can't even be around Hollywood be around these
[52:41.920 --> 52:48.000]  people they feel so empty so weak I feel so bad around them that you couldn't pay me a trillion
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.520]  dollars to hang out with these people they are spiritually dead now you don't have photos of
[52:55.520 --> 53:00.000]  Kanye West with her you can sit there and put photos of next to each other but it doesn't matter
[53:00.800 --> 53:05.360]  what matters is what he's doing now and the courage he's got to stand against us we're not
[53:05.360 --> 53:12.800]  making him an idol we're saying we support free speech we support free thinking so here's his latest
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.120]  private message on his phone he put out on his twitter that we just retweeted at real Alex Jones
[53:20.720 --> 53:26.640]  yo thank you so much in an earlier message then hey it's jl I hope you reconsider aligning yourself
[53:26.640 --> 53:32.960]  with Trump you're way too powerful influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for as you
[53:32.960 --> 53:38.000]  know what you say really means something to our fans they are loyal to you and respect your opinion
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.440]  so many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump
[53:43.440 --> 53:48.880]  policies cause especially the people of color don't let this be part of your legacy you're the
[53:48.880 --> 53:55.120]  greatest artist for generation I love you john and I appreciate your thoughts you bringing up my fans
[53:55.120 --> 54:00.080]  or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought total truth
[54:00.080 --> 54:05.760]  he's not even he said I don't agree with a lot of what Trump does he says I've known the guy of 10
[54:05.760 --> 54:11.440]  plus years he's my friend I know he's a good guy I like to support him because he's under attack
[54:11.440 --> 54:17.440]  to say I support free thought and there's another rapper Chicago rapper well-known's come out and said
[54:17.440 --> 54:24.800]  yeah you don't have to be a Democrat if you're black you don't have to be anything if you're black
[54:24.800 --> 54:31.520]  or white you could be apolitical but meanwhile celebs attack Kanye West over pro-trump tweets
[54:31.520 --> 54:39.280]  complete freaking lunatic all these talentless losers have to say about I'm not gonna even
[54:39.280 --> 54:48.320]  give these people any attention but Rosie O'Donnell the director of guardians the galaxy who cares
[54:48.320 --> 54:55.200]  so that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen it's about courage and it's about not
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.640]  being cowards and it's about standing up when you've got everything to lose but see he realizes
[55:00.640 --> 55:05.120]  we've got everything to lose if we let this tyranny take over and run the entire planet

[55:50.480 --> 55:57.440]  and to give them all this garbage to incentivize and then macron and the UN even admitted in the last
[55:57.440 --> 56:08.720]  month they keep pushing this whole a plan to incentivize and Europe advertises it and now

[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.840]  got uh mad brakin on because he concurs they're getting ready to launch massive false flags
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:33.760]  against their own liberal targets in a big big way so that they can try to play the sympathy card
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.840]  and say see we've got to ban the conservatives libertarians she trumps gonna cause us to get
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:44.640]  attacked we told you that a few weeks ago we told you that this weekend now cnn msnbc ap the
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.040]  democrats say you're gonna cause violence when they're the ones fomenting it and they have ices
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.880]  coming out saying they're gonna attack leftist targets when they spend the whole left funding
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.680]  ices and the whole era of spring this is just transparent as a three dollar bill this is as
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.440]  fake as a three dollar bill but before we go to break i want to just go out to break playing
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.600]  jimma costa from supporters don't have all their faculties and talk about how they're
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.480]  going to cause violence and that's what to play another clip macron tells beset nationalism
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.120]  you know he's a little globalist selling that program a trojan horse and then i want to get
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:23.200]  into belgium tv crew pelta with rocks in brussels belgium because there are no go zones and that
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:29.360]  ties into a sweden an old uh man being beaten up these are so many of these videos i can't
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.720]  keep track of so let's just play those videos uh going out to break and we'll come back with ooo
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.000]  that smell great piece rob do and i put together uh tying it into the true war crimes and true
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.920]  demonic behavior of obama and hillary so here is all those clips together and we'll be back
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:53.280]  in the info war but the problem is is that uh people around the country don't know it's an act
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.800]  they're not in on the act and they take what he says very seriously and they take attacks from
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.640]  sean spicer and sarah sanders and and what they do to us on a daily basis very seriously they don't
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.000]  have all their faculties and in some cases their their elevator might not hit all floors my concern
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.640]  is is that there's a that a journalist is going to be hurt one of these days somebody's gonna get
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:20.080]  hurt and uh at that point you know the white house the president of the united states they're
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.640]  gonna have to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves whether or not they played a role
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.680]  in this whether they created this toxic environment that resulted in a journalist getting hurt and
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.720]  the moment that a journalist gets hurt in the united states of america because of rhetoric
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.040]  coming from the president united states we have suddenly become something less than the united
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:46.160]  states we we are starting to join at that moment a different uh group of countries around the world
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:52.560]  where the press is not safe and i i hope and um i'd like to see the white house and the president
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.320]  pay more attention to that but i'm gonna take a little it is together that we can resist the
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:05.040]  rise of aggressive nationalisms that deny our history and divide the world it is together
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:12.160]  that we will build a new strong multilateralism that defends pluralism and democracy in the face
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:19.680]  of ill winds because our culture our identity has always been true for our country

[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:10.080]  he said me and hillary are demons said we smell like
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.080]  you
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.080]  from enemies born and domestic it's alex john
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:45.200]  so
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:58.320]  okay there's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.720]  well what a treat ben garrison and sabo two of the most prolific successful uh americana
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.560]  libertarian free thinking i would even call him liberal or conservative because i know both you
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.760]  guys know garrison really well probably interviewed him 20 times very familiar with sabo's work he was
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:29.600]  all of this last week and i remember saying man we got to get you guys to town and so you're here
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.200]  thanks for coming thanks for having me man good to have you uh let's just get right into it right now
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.760]  we're here to talk about the power of art and how it's under attack and the power of communication
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.200]  cognate west all this the power of expression and how that's being demonized and how we're seeing
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:52.800]  the biggest push in modern history to eradicate it in the west so so uh ben garrison sabo get on
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.720]  up to the microphone tell us tell us your declaration of independence against this and
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.120]  the time and space you think we're in right now well for me i uh i come from a newspaper background
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:09.840]  and i was i'm very familiar with the editorial cartoons and for far too long the left has dominated
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:18.560]  that field and what they do and their cartoons um they they always end up calling for more big
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:26.240]  government and more taxes and so i want to take a different different tack and big government to me
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.520]  they create more problems than they solve i mean i'm reminded of a quote by um
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.160]  milton freedman who said if the federal government was in charge of the sahara desert
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  and five years there'd be a shortage of sand so i want to i want to draw in my cartoons i mean
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.000]  there are very few uh conservative cartoonists and um i was telling the sabo who's from la the
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.080]  famous cartoonist there was a paul conrad and he says he said conservatives cannot be funny they
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.720]  cannot be editorial cartoonist cartoonists because they're they support the status quo what's the
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:08.560]  status quo now it's the deep state and it's the corrupt situation in in washington so there's
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.520]  plenty there's plenty to go after a conservative cartoonist can go after and let me reverse that
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.320]  the status quo exactly let me reverse that i think a sabo's take on it and and and his declaration
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.840]  why he's here and what he's standing up for of course we'll introduce who he is and who he
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.840]  are but most folks don't need that but it for folks that don't need to go check out your work it's
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.760]  amazing if milton freedman could turn the sahara desert green in five years to show the power of
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:39.040]  capitalism it's a metaphor then communist people like kim jong-un they could turn the
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:45.840]  brazilian rainforest in this to the sahara in five years i'm sure he could um well what's my
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.560]  take on it uh we're in the midst of the battle man i'm i'm loving it it's uh people always tell me
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.960]  why don't you move to texas man they'll love you in texas i'm like why would i want to do that i like
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:03.200]  being right in the middle of the of the thick of it in la and um i'm excited it's it's going to be a
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.400]  very interesting two years i'm sure we're all going to be nice and tired when it's done um
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.280]  i i i don't know what more to say there's a quick kidding right now and of course you should probably
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.040]  ben garrison's probably well known as ben garrison because he's more public you are just as well known
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:28.240]  for your viral street art uh where you you know for the uh oscars put a huge sign saying and the
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.200]  award goes to the number one pedophile and it and it goes totally viral so for radio
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.200]  listeners not just for tv viewers describe some of your most viral work and why you got into it
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.280]  uh well uh i would say ted cruise helping out ted cruise with this campaign not directly uh
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.400]  that helped out that opened a few doors uh it seems with every hit it's got to get a little
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:57.440]  bigger and bigger a little more involved but uh just learning how to i'm i'm not sure i can't
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.360]  believe i'm drawing a damn blank here you're doing great you're on last week we're on fire in
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.800]  fact let's show some of sabo's incredible art from his amazing website unsavoryagents.com let's
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.360]  let's keep rolling through these guys art there it is and the oscar for biggest pedophile goes to
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.080]  i mean that reached over a billion people that was all over the news and reminded us hey all these
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.520]  sanctimonious people with the fake me too movement is a smokescreen for their giant pedophile devil
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.400]  worship command base and i love living in hollywood because of it i'm waiting for those doors to open
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.440]  up and the whole place to just melt i'd love to be a part of it i was telling someone the other
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.680]  day when i die i want people to say that that guy like another issue it's like he helped to turn a
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.880]  lot of black people away from the democrat plantation and uh we're starting to see that now
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:50.400]  with uh kandace owens and p ditty and uh these are exciting times i tell rock musicians in hollywood
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:58.480]  it's like these are the days uh bob bob dillon came from these are the times that heroes are made
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.920]  for god's sakes drop your nuts start writing the songs that need to be heard but there's so many
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.600]  people out there that just scared and uh you can't be half-hearted about this it's just go all in
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:18.000]  in and uh become a hero man i love this street uh benches where you had bernie and it says free
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.840]  on one bench and bernie and then on the other one it says a cuss word deals with bullhawk here
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.280]  bravo seara i mean it's just incredible how you can with just simple words illustrate the truth
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:35.360]  and it's so true on its face we understand it i'm glad you raised that say bo because they're having
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.960]  congressional hearings live right now with diamonds and silk who are just positive libertarian pro-free
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.680]  market ladies that want change and they've got hundreds of millions of views on youtube they're
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.480]  all over fox news they're all over the show and they're getting shadow banned on youtube and twitter
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.720]  and facebook and it's all admitted and congress is having live hearings asking our tech giants
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.280]  censoring conservatives well again we're not really conservatives in my view we're just people that
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.440]  want to have americana and free market that's been the punk that's been the rock and roll for the last
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.520]  500 years that's been what's given a space travel and medicine and science and longer lives was getting
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.200]  away from feudalism but communism and socialism and liberalism it's just forms of control and so
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.000]  they had a big comedy central show attacking paul watson we're gonna play it next hour saying hey
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.160]  you're not the new punk rock conservatives you know look the republicans control the central
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.320]  government that's not who we're talking about we're talking about the universities the media
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.800]  we're talking about academia we're talking about the big corporations almost to accompany
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:43.840]  our anti-freedom anti-free market because that gives you individual freedom and that is the real
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:51.360]  avant-garde then well you mentioned the word sanctimonious alex and i had a chance to talk
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.680]  with a sable in in some depth today and we're really in alignment we're comrades in arms now
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.000]  you might be in la and i might be up in the boonies of montana surrounded by deer and wild
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.440]  turkey but we both agree i'm just amazed at how we're we're such an alignment even we come from
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.520]  totally different but that's why i wanted to get you guys together but what what you do so well and
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.120]  what i try to do in a different manner but what you do so well is alex mitchell were sanctimonious
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.720]  you're mocking their sanctimony and they can't stand that because these people these virtue
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:28.400]  signers they think they have a moral high ground and when they see when you when you show these
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:34.080]  images that crystallize the satire into this devastating image of them that tears them down
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.560]  they cannot stand that and when they try to silence us and when they get mad you know you're

[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:26.400]  news today and we've got two great artists here in studio whether someone to make this
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:36.560]  point because it's critical and it's that if we don't all engage in our free speech right now
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.360]  we're not going to have to wait for future generations to lose their speech everyone is
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:50.960]  basically going to end up losing their free speech this is it it's premeditated it's happening but
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.880]  we've got congressional hearings going today we've got the president talking about the universities
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.480]  being these anti-free speech command bases the corporations funding anti-free speech the communist
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.680]  chinese government funding every major public school in the country many of them the number one
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.920]  funder we force that out in the news and they teach at ut that fall on gong should not be allowed on
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:22.480]  campus that's in the news this week you understand the magnitude of that they kill those buddhas
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:29.360]  and take their organs we're talking body snatching is being taught at ut but again we have no immune
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.200]  system to communism in this country because we haven't gone through it and so we're now facing
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:39.440]  real authoritarianism big mega rich funding communism as a way to bring down society so now
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:44.800]  let's go to camera two i want to just thank these guys for being here in studio with us and coming
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:51.760]  here and i want to thank ben garrison who is the number one editorial cartoonist in the world
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:56.640]  because i've been in news for 23 years i've followed it all i look at it all his stuff
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.720]  is more prolific than anybody out out there times three or four and there's some other
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:06.240]  amazing people but he is more prolific it's more powerful it's more continuous it's amazing
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:12.000]  and the number one street artist in the world when it comes to real freedom of expression
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.640]  is shabo and the amazing dangerous cutting-edge true avant-garde true punk rock and again next
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.520]  hour we're going to air a report from paul watchtower he got attacked by comedy central
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.000]  comedy central summer redstone saying oh you say conservatism is avant-garde and punk rock when we
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.280]  say punk rock we mean how it was banned in the 60s and 70s how it was blocked the sex pistols we
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.600]  don't mean literally we're saying we're punk rock we're saying we're being suppressed we're
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.240]  being de-platformed we're being censored we're being attacked and you call us all conservatives
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.240]  they call me extremely conservative on facebook they they list me i'm really a lay historian
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.800]  i've read more history books than most historians out there and i'm a classical liberal in the thomas
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:59.200]  jeffersonian vane i am in many ways socially liberal but i'm pro second amendment pro life i'm just a
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.080]  nationalist populace that likes america that likes americana you can call me a conservative paleo
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.360]  conservative these names mean nothing but the modern liberals by every definition are the opposite of
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.000]  a classical liberal they're anti-free speech they're anti-free market they're anti-choice they're
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.560]  monsters and it's good to have in the arsenal sebo and ben garrison but here's why i've got
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.800]  them here for the next few days when we're going to be meeting just a brainstorm and i want to ask
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.840]  them about this now about how do we get people excited out there to do their own street art
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.960]  in a in a in a continuum of what's totally legal versus what you got to do in an emergency
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.200]  resistance move in case they really take our speech online and the fact that they fear is
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.840]  getting on the street that's in the wiki leases in google documents they fear that final equation
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.440]  they fear that final equation is what they got antifa trying to intimidate us and how do we ignite
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:53.200]  that engine of the millions of listeners out there to do it whether it's one little sign on a poll
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.920]  or whether it's a you know a billboard on the side of their barn or a bumper sticker on their car
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.480]  or them starting their own website or their own podcast or putting up their own street art
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.440]  that continuum that we've already been ran into the segment ben garrison and then again sebo
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.160]  what are your ideas what is your grassroots initiative to give them the listeners the
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.440]  Promethean fire that both of you have when it comes to amazing art i just have to say just start
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.120]  you're going to suck it first uh you and you're going to suck again but trust me after a while
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.120]  you're going to produce something you're going to go wow that's good and the reason it's important
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:34.000]  to start now is because this is going to be a generational fight a multi-generational fight
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.120]  right and uh it's nice being on the ground level but uh we have a long fight ahead of us we we're
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:45.920]  taking on the magazines we're taking on hollywood we're taking on the social networking everything
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.920]  so uh like i said it's going to suck at first but for god's sakes take that first step well i've
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:59.520]  been trying to get young people to start drawing cartoons too i mean i especially female conservative
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:05.760]  cartoon there are no female conservative cartoonists out there finally and alex jones showed the uh my
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.760]  wife tina's cartoon of um the slimer one that was that's something my wife tina did really good
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:18.480]  she's a cartoonist too i finally got her to jump in and and she has her own cartoon every tuesday
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:24.400]  we call it tina tuesday so she's jumping into the fray and she's off to a great start she's done
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:31.040]  like four of them now but i listen there there's like a if you take all the editorial cartoonists
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.000]  that are drawing in the world only four percent of them are female and those four percent are all
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.680]  liberals so as far as i know tina's the only conservative female there's a real glass ceiling
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.520]  when it comes to libertarian conservative nationalistic females and it's a glass ceiling period
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:52.480]  why when women are just as good at art are better than men absolutely we need to see that real
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.280]  revolution of women becoming graphic designers and and putting out their ideas even if it's not
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.520]  conservative yeah and you know i don't mind if you do something illegal just don't get caught
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.240]  see if you don't get caught it's not illegal by the way we're in a war they're trying to silence us
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:10.000]  the french resistance went up on billboards in world war two and put stuff up there we're being
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.320]  occupied by the globalist they're having antifa hit us in the head with bike locks to shut us up
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.520]  so we can climb up at night and and and and put a message out on one of these corporate billboards
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.000]  especially an empty one i don't see anything bad about that you've got to cross the line he's a
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.280]  line crossing you've got to cross that line or you don't even know where i mean i'll say it i've
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.680]  climbed up on billboards yeah and you know i just made his decision i'm gonna start tagging some
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.440]  stuff in austin oh yeah you know i'm not happy with the job i i i think i've got uh two things
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.760]  when i know i'm doing a good job one it scares the hell out of the client and two i know i'm
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:47.360]  going to go to hell for doing it so it's like i love crossing those lines and i i i i believe
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.880]  if you want to make a difference and if you want a good voice you can't be half-hearted you got to
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.960]  go all in the left isn't going to love you so quit trying to get love from them it came out three

[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.600]  things down and i mean so they're burning things down we're just saying okay there's a bench put

[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.880]  toxins in it and then the same video then he has an ad for water filters interesting and they go oh

[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:18.800]  home yeah exactly like if i was gonna open a franchise of a restaurant if i was a franchisee
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.720]  i would find a restaurant that i love that was successful and had really good food that i would
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.800]  want to franchise i'd say can i franchise your great restaurant like a lot of people have gone
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:33.680]  in famously to good restaurants and they said i want to franchise this exactly i sell what i use
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:39.440]  and i like and i believe it but it shows hog in the media thinks it's like a scam he had a water
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:44.640]  filter ad after he talked about addressing in the water causing sterility done done done like oh
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.720]  my god it's hidden they always go jones said this on air we caught it here it is like it was a big
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.520]  secret it was a you know millions were watching it so in fullwarstore.com now let's talk about
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.960]  supporting these guys because i'm going to try to work with them to do limited you know prints of
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.800]  their work and get it out to fund their operation i want to get other artists involved i want to do
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.840]  this for years i haven't done it i want to watch something big they're here to brainstorm with me
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:10.080]  to be you know part of that and and you know many others but but then garrison grr graphics.com
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.440]  shabo unsavoryagents.com we saw one of his little coffee table books of some of his best
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.760]  art of the election but man the stuff is so good i want to have big coffee table books i you know
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.720]  i want to put out limited prints of what shabo's doing to put it on my walls at my office we already
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.760]  got been garrison stuff here for six seven years you know up on our walls that's how big a fan i am
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.280]  so let's just briefly talk about you guys and some of the great art you have because if you
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:41.040]  read the clinton foundation not their big corporate one but their private library foundation judicial
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.640]  watch and world net daily suit four years ago and got the documents they were saying in 2000 and
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.880]  they were saying in 2000 no no in in in 1993 they were saying we've got to shut down
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.040]  any libertarian conservative or any other liberal groups that are organic that have their own economy
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.080]  their own products books newspapers magazines films because that'll create their new culture
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:10.080]  they understood that so doing this and creating economic systems and ecosystems is how we defeat
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:16.000]  them so let's i want to get your views on that well you remember that hillary famously famously
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.080]  said i think it was in the 90s about the time you you alluded to that the internet needed an editor
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:28.160]  well guess who the editor would be it would be well of course people like hillary clinton
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.480]  and they want what they want is a chinese style censorship in in which conservative voices are
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.880]  shut down oh well that's offensive that's bullying that's this that and the other and you're not you
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.280]  know they pull the plug on it every wiki leak she was in there with all the papers and tv actually
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:49.280]  like an editor herself and their staff and guess what you've got um zuckerberg you know
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:56.160]  basically kissing the butt of the chinese dragon he wants that here too he was he was really trying
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:02.960]  to butter z up so he could get facebook and china and get all kinds of uh and get it limited and
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:09.200]  and these guys i mean come on he's in he goes to hawaii and buys up a hundred hundred acres or so
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.680]  and then what does he do he first puts a big wall on it so he has his privacy he grabbed not a lot
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:19.040]  six thousand acres of native land so he puts up first thing he does he wants to protect his
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.880]  privacy and and he gets to put a big giant wall up around his property but we get no privacy
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:30.640]  whatsoever we're exposed and we're for sale you know that's the hypocrisy we gave him that we're
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.840]  asleep at the switch we're too busy camping out having barbecues and they were too busy taking
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.800]  over everything i mean we have to start infiltrating these schools and every other damn thing the way
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.280]  they do and well that's one reason i'm i'm drawing the cartoons because i want to shake people out
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:53.760]  of their apathy and here's the advantage of art over you know written or spoken words the words
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:02.880]  tend to appeal to the left brain and the rationality of everything but art is a has a strong irrational
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.160]  component to it and when you combine rational with irrational if you can do that and get it
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.040]  nicely balanced then you've got something that's memorable and too many you know this world today
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.800]  we're we're just inundated with visual noise constantly and information noise too so if you
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:28.240]  could produce a work of art that is memorable and i'm not talking about just illustrating a
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.960]  headline or just going for a cheap gag you know i i i don't want to do a cartoon like that yeah
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.160]  no not such but really thought-provoking yeah well you have to you have to use a lot of different
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:44.000]  components in and have to mention to the the work of art for it to be memorable well one of them is
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.240]  is um irony for example you mentioned david hog i did a cartoon of him and i and i showed him
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:57.120]  him i decided to portray him as something that he hates so-called assault weapons so i drew him as
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.000]  an assault weapon and instead of bang bang he's saying band band so that's the way you get at
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.560]  him and then people will remember that that was a big hit that cartoon that's on min garison's
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.840]  site right now let's pull that every or we can search engine uh yeah there it is boom yeah so
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:17.680]  people wrote me and they thought this is this really just devastates him because and the irony
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:23.040]  again is who turned him in well he's been calling for our speech to be taken to say about oh i love
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:28.000]  that kid man it's like he's in high school and uh there's nothing i love more than remembering what
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.520]  i was like when i was in high school he's got the whole rest of his life to look back on and realize
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:40.560]  how much of a douchey was when he was a kid look at my god you talk about sanctimonious man him and
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:49.120]  coming i you know my my private parts are thicker than his arms something's going on there he needs
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.600]  some red pills is what he needs damn right i'm gonna send him a free bottle of red pill we'll be

[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:11.040]  of the second american revolution you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.240]  ben garrison sebo they're in studio and i'm telling you folks we create whole sites with

[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.680]  artists old artists female artists and just making about street art like they did in ancient roam that
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.440]  was the internet of roam was street art and the government was always trying to get rid of the
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.400]  graffiti but that's how the people actually communicated and i'm saying under an authoritarian
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:50.560]  regime you hit the streets and in this way boom it's up boom people see it boom it has an effect
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.480]  don't do it on somebody's business don't do it on you know whatever there's all sorts of places to
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.880]  do it or do it on your own car but doesn't hurt anything to put up a nice printed sticker that
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:05.120]  fits right that peels off onto a park bench didn't take photos put it on the internet it goes viral
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:12.320]  people there see it it's about interfacing the real third dimension with silicon and and and so
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.200]  that's what sebo and ben garrison are talking about uh sebo you were making some key points
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:21.360]  they're in the break and then ben was making some really key points go ahead sebo uh be
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.400]  political with your art man there's nothing i hate more than just beautiful wallpaper and uh
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.640]  what i love about uh what i do is how is how quickly it gets taken down it forces me to come
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:37.040]  up with other uh other ways of doing it like hanging them up on power lines or putting up
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.840]  behind installations and uh you know i don't touch both the power lines don't go over power lines
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.200]  do not mess with the power lines but but but i could tell you i grew up thinking that the
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.160]  left loved art you're not supposed to censor art you're supposed to appreciate all art it's like
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.240]  if that's the case why does my stuff only stay up on the street for an hour well that's when
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.360]  they were using art to take over and now they're like no no no no where were the communists chinese
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:06.320]  now you don't get art well this is this is um this is becoming a big problem isn't it i mean
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:16.240]  this the leftist wants to suppress free speech and they want to offset it by giving people this
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:23.040]  lure and the lure is free stuff but let me tell you this free stuff comes at the expense of free
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:29.440]  dumb and they don't seem to realize this this um this republic we have is a very rare thing in
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:35.280]  the history of the world it's uh it's something that's very dear needs to be protected and it
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.960]  we shouldn't just be just be apathetic sitting on our hands and giving it up willy nilly i mean
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:49.040]  we have to start fighting and and using our free speech and speaking out against socialism and all
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:55.440]  of its pernicious forms that's that's what i try to do i mean i just i just despise the things that
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.720]  bernie sanders says i despise the people who want us to to give up our liberty and and exchange it
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:08.720]  for security we have to stop being afraid of losing our stuff i mean i'm somebody that you know i had
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.600]  a house i had savings i made bad investments and i ended up going haywire and next thing you know i
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.800]  lost it all you know what it's not that bad i started i started over and i had help i had a
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.280]  lot of help from people when i saw my cartoons we started getting supporters on patreon i was like
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:30.800]  i was like humble but also just amazed and excited and we we got a guy who came to us and said you
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:36.800]  know let me do your website for you so we got a man our webmaster it's beautiful eric eric and
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:43.680]  ohio and we're building a community we're building a culture and now we have now we have a an animator
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.080]  apoco labelle in montreal who's animated my cartoons and he's done such a fantastic job and
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.600]  we got such a great response from that so we're excited about doing more animation they're shutting
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:00.400]  us down because we're popular we're winning and we are the the future our listeners of the future
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.760]  you made a key point during the break and i want to say about a comment on this you guys are on fire
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.920]  during the breaks and you're doing great on air but you're a little more subdued obviously uh you
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:12.320]  hear out of the lights but you were talking about tyranny worldwide it's here your friend in germany
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:18.160]  well i have a i have a friend in in germany who's about my age and he's um uh you know he and his
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:24.880]  family visited us in montana about four years ago but he is just livid this endless and he's
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:32.320]  just despises miracle but he's livid at the endless immigration into his country that's changing
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:39.120]  the very uh you know the very fiber of what what german culture used to be and we know that he's
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.320]  he's also afraid to speak out because um you could be fined you could be sent to jail look
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:48.480]  what they're doing to people some people in england they're finding them and jailing them just for
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:54.800]  having an opinion we can't let that come to america because they want that to come here too so everybody
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:00.800]  can do something and that's you know many years ago alex jones said that on air and i and i was
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.520]  thinking well yeah he's right i'm you know my dad was a world war two veteran he was in many battles
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.000]  what have i done nothing all i did was pay my taxes oh i'm very proud of the fact that you
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.400]  when you first talked like six years ago you said i inspired you and and i've been a little bit
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.560]  brask i've had my issues i'm not perfect oh i'm not either but it's kind of like the squeaky
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:22.800]  wheel and everything i've been a train wreck but the train wreck so many people have talked to you
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:28.160]  said you inspired me you already knew more than i knew in many ways but but i inspired you and others
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.720]  to take action i'm most proud of that i got a little bit late started but i it doesn't matter
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.800]  you got to start you know everybody can do something there's you know even if you're just
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.040]  talking to your neighbor just make everybody aware that you know we've got something very special
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:47.520]  and it needs to be protected and that's that's our republic and our constitution and i don't
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:54.320]  want to see that go away and be replaced by collectivism which always collapses it's a nightmare
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.000]  well they're trying right now they're trying to push uh basically they're trying to push
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.720]  naked democracy on us and this really bothers me because i want everybody out there to start
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:06.720]  listening what the left says and they always say the same thing our democracy our democracy
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.440]  hillary says that all they want direct democracy which means if 51 percent say exact like nazi
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.560]  germany hillar was elected we're going to kill this group it happens well in a republic you
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:22.720]  can't do that carl mark said democracy is the road to socialism they want to and you listen to bill
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:28.080]  marr for example he wants to do away with the electoral college so does hillary they want
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:35.200]  just they want the cities to be uh the have the primary voice over the rural areas and i was
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:41.040]  thinking of myself well the our whole republic was based on having the cities and the rural balanced
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:45.760]  and not having a dominant overpopulated state dominate a rural state right well really united
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:51.600]  states we're not we're not the united blob of washington dc so not the united coastal elites
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:58.560]  exactly so the states should have say and but bill marr says well why does montana have you know
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:02.080]  they'd hardly have any people there at all but they have two senators and why does california
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.160]  have two senators we should have a lot more senators than montana and let's explain they've
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:11.520]  all got more house members but for the senate there's that check and balance on population
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.960]  this is all super smart why should people in some super far away area be controlled by some far
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:21.680]  off king of england they they they we don't want to have this happen again i'm tripping out on
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.480]  germany they've gone full circle they went from the whole hitler thing to you can't say hitler
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:31.840]  anymore and now they're inviting all these people who hate jews they want to kill jews yeah they're
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.800]  telling jews in germany and sweden and everywhere don't wear your yamakas yeah so they like god full
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:43.760]  circle so welcome your new nazis germany uh you know i used to love i was enamored by europeans i
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.040]  grew up in the country i was like you had a french or english accent it was awesome now it's like
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.600]  what happened to you people well i mean here's the deal they had wars in europe in the last 300
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.080]  years that killed most of the population and i'm sorry a lot of weps got left and i'm not saying
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.160]  all the manner you know weps in europe it's just people been slapped down so just like they did
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:08.160]  what hitler said look at this 73 year old swedish woman prosecuted for criticizing mass immigration
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:14.240]  well i'm sorry every muslim country sided with hitler in world war two so you say wow why is germany
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:20.160]  siding with islam hitler sided with islam he didn't like christianity yeah if i ever get a dog i'm
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:26.320]  going to teach him to zeke hyal just like that guy in in the uk i'm oh yeah count dancula is like a
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.480]  libertarian liberal doing a joke that that charlie chaplin could do or john cleese could do but he's
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.080]  facing years in prison he's been convicted sentencing's coming up for having a pug say howl hitler
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.280]  and they want to throw you in jail too or some of them want to like al gore wants to make sure
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.960]  that you get prosecuted for questioning his uh this climate change or that he invented the
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:54.400]  damn internet yeah i had the secret service knock on my door for some tweets it's like uh i can't
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.640]  wait for them to bust my door down at three o'clock in the morning because i posted something on facebook
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:05.200]  it's incredible but then my daughter can say i'm gonna blow the white house up it's okay yeah you
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:09.520]  know uh when i saw when i heard that the secret service came they left a little door hanger they
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.640]  said oh well the secret service gives a call i was scared at first for like two seconds i was scared
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.360]  then uh i said something about lee harvey oswald i said screw that when they come back tomorrow i
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:25.120]  went to kinko's i printed really big the word oswald and i literally papered my whole apartment
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.880]  with that wall with that word i put my ar against the wall and i opened the windows i said you guys
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.320]  can't come inside but you can interview me from outside and i had a blast it was great but well
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.440]  they this is a good point though they want you to be in fear they i mean this is the whole point of
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.560]  the like the yeah they're trying to bully us and i don't know about everybody else i'm not gonna be
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.400]  bullied go ahead then sir well we started getting bullied in in in 1913 with the 16th amendment when
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:57.040]  they met when they started wanting to incriminate ourselves and sign our name to a form and and
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.040]  give up direct taxes which are unconstitutional and this has gotten so bad now that we're working as
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:09.760]  slaves for the government uh one third of the year and we and people will fill it out and they're
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.400]  afraid that's because the iris they know the iris can come and seize their goods at any time and
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.400]  they they got to fill out all this stuff and they go but they want you this is one of the reasons
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:23.120]  why we have that because they want us to be it's a form of mind control and fear is a good and
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.920]  that's what kanya west is saying he says he says he says you're not going to use your threats of
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.120]  fear you're not going to intimidate me to manipulate my free thought that's his latest thing uh yo i was

[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:33.680]  systems you know there used to be a time when the left you know that they were all about independence
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.880]  they were all about all these uh you know about the individual and that's like if you're not loving
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:44.400]  on the big government you're which doesn't even make sense somehow you're a nazi they're the nazis
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:50.160]  a cult of aggressive people just because you're wearing make america great again it's insane
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.280]  even worse they're they're communists it's like how many people do the communists with smartphones
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.760]  i notice how conservatives usually aren't wearing really fancy clothes i mean i'm on tv so i'm wearing
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.200]  you know a jacket i've been wearing for five years i love this baby this is like a four hundred
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:08.080]  dollar jacket the left is always wearing like super fancy everything and the conservatives
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:12.480]  are just working and aren't i mean it's like it's like they've got fancy phones they got all this
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.800]  crap the capitalism may but they say they hate it and look at all those people that were yelling

[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.320]  nothing more than socialist indoctrination centers now and they're the cancer they're the cult of
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:39.040]  anti-free speech that's now like a virus takes over cell replicates and so now the cells are
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.480]  busting and the viruses are coming out let's have fun with it man mylo should have ordered another
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:51.440]  beer and just stood there and flipped them off well you know i do the cartoon that's that's
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:57.040]  kind of in alignment what we were just talking about i i drew a really fancy you know a super
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:03.120]  expensive water fountain that's you know pumping out pure water but it's for liberals only left
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:10.480]  only and then i drew a really kind of a downtrodden rusted old you know water fountain conservatives
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:16.640]  you know and that's how it was for blacks yeah i play i used that that liberal leftist meme and
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:21.440]  flipped it so i like flipping their own stuff and then hey you're doing this to conservatives now
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.800]  well you're awesome you're gonna be on the war room coming up with of course roger stone and with

[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:18.840]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:19.840]  Yours truly.
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:22.640]  Word on the street is conservatism is the new punk rock.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:25.440]  Just ask Alex Jones' British sidekick.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:31.900]  Leftists are desperately clinging to this idea that they have the monopoly on cool conservatism.
[02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:33.400]  Is the new punk rock.
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:37.560]  And while the old punk rock was a subculture of anti-establishment teenagers screaming
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:42.200]  into a microphone about being misunderstood and underrepresented, the new punk rock is
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.200]  just as cool and just as anti-establishment.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.600]  And even the lame stream media agrees.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.760]  Of course, technically the right controls, like the whole establishment.
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:51.760]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:56.400]  My entire argument is that conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.600]  You just listed branches of government.
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:02.280]  Hate to break it to you, but none of those are cultural institutions.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:05.960]  The government doesn't control the output of cultural institutions.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:09.800]  God only knows what you're talking about, but I'm talking about Hollywood, the music
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.280]  industry, Silicon Valley, and academia.
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.680]  They're the high priests of pop culture.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:20.920]  Not Mike Pence, not C-Pack, which I specifically said was not representative of counterculture
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.400]  over a year ago.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:27.480]  Then you imply that when I say counterculture of punk, I'm talking about the GOP establishment.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:32.600]  And in another part of the very video you played, I say the exact opposite.
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:36.600]  And obviously I don't mean conservatism like Mitch McConnell conservatism.
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:39.280]  I'm not talking about old establishment Republicans.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:45.600]  So in the very first 30 seconds, you've tried to spin it by falsely framing the entire argument.
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:52.960]  Conservatism is punk rock because, um, I think...
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:56.880]  Oh, you edited some people together to make it look like they had no clue what they were
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:01.520]  talking about, because Comedy Central doesn't do that to literally everyone they're trying
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.920]  to demonize, do they?
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:03.920]  How original.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:07.560]  You want to know why conservatism is the new counterculture?
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:08.960]  Well listen up.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:14.440]  Decades ago it was the right to shut down offensive edgy speech, music, comedy, movies,
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440]  and art.
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.400]  They were the ones who know platformed controversial speech.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.200]  Who were the new authoritarians?
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.440]  Who were the new puritans?
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:28.280]  Who was trying to shut down offensive edgy speech, music, comedy, movies, and art today?
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:29.280]  The Left.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:34.040]  Who literally riots to shut down controversial ideas now?
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:35.040]  The Left.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.000]  You control popular culture.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.600]  You viciously police the boundaries of acceptable speech.
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:45.600]  And anyone who dares express diversity of thought is ostracized and shunned.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:47.320]  And that's not very punk.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:53.400]  Why do you think contrarians like Jordan Peterson, who rail against identity politics, are the
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:56.240]  new rock stars who pack out venues?
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:01.280]  Why do you think my biggest demographic is 18 to 35 year olds, while CNN's average
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.840]  viewer is 60?
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:08.120]  Why do you think Generation Z is the most conservative generation since World War II?
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.520]  These kids are sick of being subjected to the endless, joyless guilt trip that is identity
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:14.520]  politics.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.760]  The endless moralizing about the parameters of acceptable speech and what they can and
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  can't say.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.080]  I get messages every day from teenagers in schools, in universities, who tell me that
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.680]  the new edgy avant-garde thing to be is anti-left wing.
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:30.880]  It's seen as a form of rebellion.
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.520]  I speak to people who work inside universities who tell me exactly the same thing.
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:36.520]  Safe spaces.
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.520]  Trigger warnings.
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.160]  Literally being afraid of the discussion of new ideas.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.800]  That's not very punk, is it?
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.520]  These kids tell me my content is the new counterculture.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.560]  But Comedy Central says that's just not the case.
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.720]  Right, so who owns Comedy Central?
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:57.680]  Oh look, it's Viacom, a multinational media conglomerate owned by Lifetime Democratic
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.440]  donor Sumna Redstone.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:06.880]  So a network owned by a giant global corporation, which in turn is owned by a 94 year old billionaire.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:10.200]  They're the final authority on what's cool.
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.160]  They get the final say on what's counterculture.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:14.160]  Give me a break.
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.280]  You're an integral part of the establishment.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:21.680]  So where do you get off lecturing your audience on what's anti-establishment?
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:26.000]  I mean, I'm no spring chicken, but your boss looks like he's really down with the kids,
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  doesn't he?
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.840]  What's another defining aspect of counterculture?
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  Political street art.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.680]  What's the nature of the only noteworthy political street art that we see now?
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.240]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:45.880]  So then they drag out this rotund punk singer from a band that I've never heard of to lecture
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:48.240]  us all on what it means to be punk.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.240]  You're not punks.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:53.880]  You've co-opted the language from punk rock, but it doesn't make you punk.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.360]  Meanwhile, the Sex Pistols Johnny Rotten, you know, one of the true originators of punk,
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:05.680]  claims Brexit and Trump in the context of populism, in the context of true anti-establishment
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:06.680]  rebellion.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.080]  Where do I stand on Brexit?
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:13.280]  Well, here it goes, the working class have spoke, and I'm one of them, and I'm with them.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.280]  The Donalds.
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.640]  As one journalist once said to me, is he the political sex pistol?
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.840]  Well, in a way, it doesn't attract you.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:25.720]  But what I dislike is the left-wing media in America are trying to smear the bloke as
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:28.320]  a racist, and that's completely not true.
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:29.960]  He terrifies politicians.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:30.960]  I mean, you live-
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.520]  And this is joy to behold.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  Right.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.800]  I mean, that very much is the Sex Pistols thing, anti-establishment.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.920]  He is the absolutely archetypal anti-establishment character.
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:45.040]  I'm going to take the opinion of Johnny Rotten over some obese nobody in a garage band.
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:49.080]  Again, the Sex Pistols were no platform for being offensive.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:51.080]  I am a man.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  To cry.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:57.600]  I think it's degrading and disgusting when our children can't see such things.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.400]  They were being offensive and blasphemous.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.560]  Who is doing the no-platforming of offensive speech now?
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:05.160]  Yeah, that's you guys.
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.160]  And that's not very punk.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.000]  No, I've been listening to a lot of my favorite commentators on YouTube.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.320]  They are saying that, like, our movement is punk.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.440]  Can you name, like, a single punk band?
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:15.920]  Oh, I hate punk music.
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:18.520]  I just want to say controversial stuff that gets me attention.
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:19.520]  Right.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.360]  So they're implying that I'm faking an interest in punk music, and that I'm only saying this
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.800]  now to get attention.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.440]  Oh, but what's this?
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:32.320]  The Daily Beast reports on my old school friends from over 20 years ago, saying that I, as
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:39.440]  a 13-year-old, was into the Sex Pistols, alternative music, smoking, and generally,
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.440]  being punk.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:41.760]  Now who's punk now, bitches?
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.440]  Punk has always been a fairly inclusive place.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.000]  The class you have, songs, they're talking about anti-racism, they're talking about anti-fascism.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.480]  You know, you have bands like The Bad Brains, a group of black kids in DC.
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:52.480]  Right, girl.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:56.320]  Women that felt underrepresented or not represented at all, people of different sexualities.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.320]  Right.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.440]  So because some punk bands decades ago pushed identity politics, which back then they did
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.880]  with, let's be fair, some merit and pure motivation, that means the modern counterculture should
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:09.960]  be about pushing identity politics.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:17.080]  Literally every dominant establishment, cultural institution pushes identity politics.
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:22.520]  So how on earth can it be anti-establishment and punk to push identity politics?
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:28.000]  Again, Jordan Peterson, he's the antithesis of identity politics and he's treated like
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.920]  a rock star by young people.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:31.920]  He's punk.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.400]  The very reason the establishment is freaking out now about Kanye is that he's encouraging
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:41.160]  black people to get off the reservation of identity politics.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.640]  Identity politics is the establishment.
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:46.080]  Identity politics is the dominant culture.
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.720]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture at the same time, idiots, all
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:52.840]  across Europe.
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:59.640]  The age group of voters powering populist parties, parties that reject identity politics
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:06.720]  is getting younger and younger.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.840]  So again, we see this attempt to portray the right as joyless puritans who can't have
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:12.840]  fun.
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:17.800]  Yet it's the left who consistently act like joyless puritans and literally try to ban
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:22.760]  fun, whether it be cheerleaders, offensive songs, topless models or free speech.
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:28.520]  You're the new censors, you're the new puritans, and that's not very punk.
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:35.000]  Being owned by a monolithic transnational corporation and a 94-year-old billionaire,
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.520]  that's not very punk.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  Using these vast resources to create an entire TV series, which has appallingly average reviews
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:49.040]  by the way, based almost exclusively on demonizing info wars, a far smaller, independent media
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:51.200]  outlet, that's not very punk either.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.840]  And by the way, there's another reason why the left lost their monopoly on counterculture.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:01.760]  You stopped being funny, the opposition with Jordan Klepper being a prime example of that.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.160]  I don't mean to sound the alarm, but...
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:08.200]  Alarm, alarm.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:12.360]  You stopped being funny because you stopped taking risks and you started placing more
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:16.640]  importance on being politically correct than making people laugh.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.320]  Look at all the coolest, best-loved comedians.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:24.680]  People like Roseanne, Bill Burr, Joe Rogan, Ricky Gervais, they may not be conservatives,
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:30.080]  but they're all completely adversarial to the kind of sterile, unfunny, identity politics
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.520]  garbage that you try to pass off as comedy.
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  Who've you got?
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.800]  Amy Schumer talking about her vagina again.
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.560]  You're just not funny, and you're not counterculture either.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:47.040]  You're literally owned by a guy who has more wrinkles than an elephant's butt.
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.960]  You've lost 15 million viewers over the last 10 years, you're dying on your arse.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.720]  You're not resonating with young people, your audience is getting older.

[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:13.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:18.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now a special report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:23.280]  In a watershed moment for the culture wall, Kanye West praised conservative commentator
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:27.880]  Candice Owens in a tweet saying, I love the way Candice Owens thinks.
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:30.320]  If you see something that's great, you got to respect it.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:31.960]  And how did Twitter react?
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:37.240]  By failing to even spell Owens name properly and calling her far right, they're going to
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:43.400]  call a former left wing now center right black conservative who is hated by the actual far
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:49.360]  right far right then all bets are now off and then the usual blue check marks piled in
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:50.840]  with their lies and hatred.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:54.520]  Candice Owens is a far right media personality who got famous by appearing on the conspiracy
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:58.200]  site info wars and calling herself a red-pill black attempt popularized on the alt-right
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:01.000]  men's rights message board that is basically an anti-infowalt.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  Wrong idiot.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.760]  She got famous by communicating a message of actual empowerment for black people.
[02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:09.360]  So save us the glib white-splaining please.
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:12.960]  Talking of white-splaining, Sean King wind about it too.
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:16.480]  Yeah, how are you going to accuse Kanye of being an uncle, Tom, when you're whiter than
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:17.960]  Rachel Dole as y'all?
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:21.040]  But, so precisely how does Candice Owens think?
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:25.600]  Well, she tells black people not to be victims, not to be dependent on welfare and not to
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.800]  blame society for all their problems.
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:33.560]  The truth is that the left wants to strap black people to this idea that they are victims.
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.560]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.600]  They do not want black people focused on their futures.
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:38.720]  They want black people focused on their past.
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:40.800]  They like black people to be government dependent.
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:44.000]  They don't like to see black people that are free thinkers and are independent.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.720]  I think that's what Kanye West and myself represents the black community and that makes
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:48.720]  them very nervous.
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:51.760]  That correlates exactly with Kanye's new outlook.
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:56.960]  Remember, Kanye met with Trump to talk about tackling black-on-black violence in Chicago,
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:01.000]  something that the left and Black Lives Matter supporters refused to incorporate into their
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  message because it doesn't fit their race-baiting victimhood narrative.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.600]  Kanye has also exposed how the left fans the flames of hysteria over racism to metaphorically
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:15.480]  keep black people on the plantation, to keep them docile and easily controlled.
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:18.120]  Racism is a dated concept.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:22.360]  It's not an actual thing that even means anything.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:27.720]  It's something that was used to hold people back in the past, but now there's been so
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:37.880]  many leaps and breaking of the rules that it's played out like a style from the 1800s
[02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:40.280]  or something.
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:45.920]  The real true freedom isn't in the words, the true freedom is in the opportunity.
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:50.520]  Kanye West represents a massive threat to the left because he has an army of adoring
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.800]  fans and is clearly done with being a puppet for their divisive agenda.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:23:00.720]  After this, he's going to be relentlessly attacked by the establishment like never before.
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.720]  Get ready.
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:08.280]  The mainstream entertainment industry is so stale, so controlled, so adversarial to originality.
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:13.040]  It can no longer produce any icons with actual authenticity.
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:28.200]  Kanye himself has alluded to this on several occasions.
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:33.720]  Celebrities with something to say other than vacuous virtue signaling and cliched platitudes
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:38.680]  are now all but extinct and that's because any celebrity that uses their platform to
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:44.440]  speak uncomfortable truths is immediately shunned and attacked by the legacy media.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:49.600]  Look what they did to Morrissey after he spoke out against mass immigration and Islamic terrorism.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:56.100]  This paucity of authentic, interesting celebrities is why YouTubers like PewDiePie and Candice
[02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:58.440]  Owens are the new rock stars.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:59.440]  Weed or rock stars.
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:03.960]  Now, obviously, most of these new rock stars aren't going to be political, but the ones
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:09.600]  that are represent a true threat to the status quo, to the dominant culture, which is why
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:14.840]  I was right when I said conservatism is the new counterculture and populism is the new
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:15.840]  punk rock.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:16.840]  Oh, but Kanye had a breakdown.
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:17.840]  He's got insane.
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:18.840]  Yeah.
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:22.960]  If you haven't been paying attention, Kanye's had about 10 what they call breakdowns since
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:23.960]  the mid-2000s.
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:29.440]  And he always comes back more influential than ever before, but that's why they're terrified
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:34.280]  of him endorsing ideas and people outside of their control.
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:35.280]  Who's they?
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.240]  I'm talking about the dominant cultural institutions of Hollywood, the entertainment industry, the
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:46.880]  music industry and the media, the high priests of pop culture, the gatekeepers of what political
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.120]  and spiritual ideas were told are acceptable.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.120]  Now one of their own has gone rogue and the panic is palpable.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.440]  Your Truman Show boat is heating the wall.
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:58.840]  Why do you think Kanye fears for his own life?
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.880]  Because Andrew Breitbart said politics is downstream from culture.
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:06.840]  You can change political destiny by hijacking culture.
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:09.720]  In case you haven't noticed, that's what I'm doing.
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:15.320]  The left is slowly waking up to the fact that they're losing their monopoly on controlling
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  culture.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:22.320]  When you've been in control for so many decades, something new inevitably has to emerge to
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:26.920]  become the new counterculture, especially given that the left no longer pushes to be
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:33.520]  edgy, daring or rebellious, and has instead embraced censorship, puritanism and cultural
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:34.520]  sterility.
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:37.440]  The high priests of pop culture are the real racists.
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:41.520]  They're the ones who indoctrinate young black kids to aspire to be thugs.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.880]  They're the ones who fetishize and glorify criminality and gangsterism through hip-hop
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:47.880]  music.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:52.960]  Kanye is trying to move black people away from the ghettoization of their minds towards
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:55.080]  true independence and freedom.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.480]  And so Inns is trying to do exactly the same thing, and that's why they resonate with each
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:01.480]  other.
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:03.480]  And that's why the left is petrified of them both.
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.920]  What you're seeing happening today, obviously, we have some black people that are just shouting
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:07.920]  in the back.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:10.360]  We have some black people that are sitting in the front quietly that are chanting USA
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:11.600]  and having a normal conversation.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:14.440]  I love that, because what I say every single time, and you may have seen me on the news,
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.960]  is that what is happening right now in the black community, you're going to hear in this
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:20.800]  room first, there is an ideological civil war happening, black people that are focused
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:23.720]  on their past and shouting about slavery, and black people that are focused on their
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.320]  futures, okay?
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:28.280]  That's really what it comes down to, okay?
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:33.880]  I can guarantee you what you're seeing happening is victim mentality versus victor mentality.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:34.880]  I promise you.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:35.880]  That's great, by the way.
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.880]  I love that.
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:37.880]  That's not great.
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:38.880]  I love that.
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.560]  And there's no doubt in my mind, I can tell you right now who is going to be better off
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:46.240]  when we look 20 years, when we look at the faces in this room, who is going to be better
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.320]  off are the girls that are sitting right here and across this room because they don't have
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:50.320]  your mentality.
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:51.560]  Victim mentality is not cool.
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:54.600]  I don't know why people like being oppressed, it's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:59.120]  I love oppression, we're oppressed, 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow, which by the way, none
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.040]  of you guys lived through, your grandparents did, and it's embarrassing that you utilize,
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:07.960]  you utilize their history, you utilize their history, and you come in here with more emotion
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.480]  than they ever had when they were living through it, more emotion than they ever had when they
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:12.480]  were living through it.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:13.480]  It's embarrassing.
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:15.880]  You're not living through anything right now.
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:18.280]  You're overly privileged Americans.
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:21.640]  They're also afraid that Kanye could be president one day.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:22.640]  I'm not joking.
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:26.320]  As Terrence Williams said, both Kanye and Candice are free thinkers.
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:29.840]  If that triggers you, chances are you're not a free thinker.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.640]  The left doesn't care about black people.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:36.440]  They don't want black people to be business owners, doctors or scientists.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:40.160]  They want them to remain mired in dependency and hopelessness.
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.080]  They want them to continue to vote for their own enslavement and whether you love or hate
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:47.400]  Kanye's narcissistic personality.
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:51.640]  If someone comes up and says something like, I am a God, everybody says, who does he think
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:52.640]  he is?
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:55.120]  I just told you who I thought I was, a God.
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:00.760]  The mere threat of him derailing this agenda to any degree, the mere fact that they don't
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  control what comes out of his mouth is what keeps the high priests of pop culture awake
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:07.760]  at night.
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:16.040]  And this is an extremely visionary move on my part.
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:22.080]  Joining the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:29:00.320]  on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.480]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:09.480]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.000]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:26.960]  to take back the nation it's Owen Shroyer you're listening to the Alex Jones show well
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:32.960]  the left ruins everything it gets its grimy mits on and now the NFL ratings are down they
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:37.760]  kneel for the national anthem and they want to ban cheerleaders that's right they want
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:53.960]  to get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL here's Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:34:00.040]  Who doesn't like cheerleaders that ugly bitter feminists obviously and USA Today columnist
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:05.560]  Nancy or more no place in the NFL for cheerleaders in 2018 so after calling for classic songs
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:11.400]  to be banned for their offensive lyrics USA Today now wants cheerleaders gone too is anything
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.400]  sacred the Houston Texans aren't even bothering with the pretense on their website as a photo
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.800]  gallery of the finalists from last weekend's cheerleader tryouts and visitors are encouraged
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.200]  to vote for their favorites are these action shots of the women that highlight their athletic
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:26.400]  ability or downskills do they include a list of their qualifications of course not their
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:31.280]  head shots sorry head and chest shots closer ones at that the better to ogle you know wait
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:36.920]  you mean to tell me that they judge women for a role that specifically requires hotness
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:41.560]  on the level of their hotness is not their academic qualifications because the first
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:46.040]  thought that pops into my head when I watch this is gee I wonder what grade point average
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:51.520]  this chick got news flash dummy men like to look at hot women that's never gonna change
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:56.640]  and no matter how much you try to browbeat shame and reeducate us that's always gonna
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:01.200]  be a thing you can't reverse basic biology through social engineering the underlining
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:05.160]  premise of NFL cheerleaders is big raiding presenting women as nothing more than objects
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:08.920]  to be leader with skimpy suggestive outfits as their uniform their only purpose is to
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:14.240]  titillate and you know what she's got a point this is just morally wrong congress really
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:19.200]  should pass a law to prevent women from being forced into cheerleading oh wait that wouldn't
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.720]  be necessary because it's completely optional I mean cheerleaders just hate cheerleading
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:29.600]  so much some of them pay just to audition women making their own choices on what to
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.600]  do with their bodies wasn't that what women's lib was all about freedom of choice you know
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:39.160]  before all your resentful harpies hijacked feminism and turned it into a global laughing
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.520]  start with your hair brained intersectional nonsense it's always been an appalling message
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:49.760]  to send it in this hashtag need to era there's no longer any place for it NFL cheerleaders
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:53.520]  need to go NBA dance squads and NHL ice girls while we're at it too right so in the name
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:58.560]  of feminism and supporting women you want to deprive tens of thousands of current and future
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:04.160]  women of work you purport to be a champion of women yet you refer to these women as blow
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:10.400]  up dolls come to life simply because they've chosen to do something that your joyless puritanical
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  ass doesn't approve of now let's pause there and have another look at some cheerleaders
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:32.760]  as I was saying men like to look at hot women control freak middle-aged pearl clutching
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:37.800]  left-wing journalists who write for USA Today don't like to look at hot women did you fail
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:42.520]  the high school cheer team is that what it is on by the way this isn't just about shaking
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:46.760]  around pom-poms on game day many of these cheerleaders do important charity work and
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:51.800]  community outreach so one of the biggest entertainment groups to regularly perform for the United
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:57.720]  States armed forces overseas these girls literally go into war zones to lift the spirits of
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:02.760]  the troops and she admits this in her own article but then says man just ban them anyway I mean
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.040]  the NFL is already hemorrhaging viewers because of its tolerance of social justice stupidity
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.760]  now you want to take away the cheerleaders I mean what can we ban next Las Vegas showgirls
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:18.120]  burlesque dancers instagram hotties why don't we just ban models all together I mean what
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:22.760]  other potential career paths for young women can we terminate because we're such good feminists
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:27.640]  but Paul this is just one newspaper columnist no no no no this is part of a wider purge
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:33.640]  f1 grid girls band the tennis girl poster band beach body ads band page three girls band
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.840]  booze babes band we just made hundreds of thousands of women unemployed go feminism
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.720]  oh will bitch and moan all day about the horror of displaying women who choose to wear what they
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:52.760]  want well simultaneously celebrating a modesty culture that forces women to wear bags on their
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.240]  heads as a symbol of women's empowerment maybe if we just compelled women to wear
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:02.200]  certain items of clothing you'd be all for it because that's what seems to pass as feminism
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:09.080]  these days no the whole point should be to let women be rocket scientists or Babylon jigglers
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:15.480]  give them equal opportunity and mind your own frigging business feminists are going on and on
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:20.120]  and on about how it's degrading to women the women that are actually doing it don't feel degraded
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:24.600]  and we're not being given the choice to decide now whether we want to do it or not and when this
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:30.840]  isn't a feminist crusade this is a class crusade this is about a bunch of condescending sanctimonious
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:36.840]  elitist snobs like Nancy or more looking down their noses at hardworking girls just trying to
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.600]  make their way in life look not all girls can aspire to be like you to write laborious tormented
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:48.120]  diatribes about how everything that offends your prudish sensibilities should be banned so embrace
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:57.400]  real feminism embrace real equality and leave these girls the hell alone another example of the
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:03.640]  control freak left that wants to decide what jobs women can or can't have or what jobs may or may
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:11.640]  not be degrading to women one day they say we need to allow women to operate as sex slaves on the
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:17.320]  dark web the next day they'll say you know that's their choice my body my choice but the next day
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:22.040]  they'll say you can't have cheerleaders in the NFL just another example of the leftist control
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:29.640]  freak but I think that they're on to something here you know I yeah I think that they should
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:35.480]  get rid of cheerleaders in the NFL but why stop there let's go on down the line let's get rid of
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:41.480]  cheerleaders at the college level let's get rid of the cheerleaders at high school levels and you
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:46.040]  know there's male cheerleaders there too so we don't want to be sexist let's get rid of all of them
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:50.680]  okay so they don't get to put that on their resume or gain that experience or get that opportunity
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:55.640]  to get a scholarship to go to college let's end all that but why stop there let's even go farther
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:01.240]  down the line you've got like what about beauty pageants swimsuit competitions I mean that happens
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:07.880]  at bars I think we should stop all that too and then you've got what are the little they have like
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:12.520]  beauty pageant for like little girls too there was the one there was the one television show
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:18.280]  there's multiple shows actually so we should cancel those television shows cancel the youth
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.720]  beauty pageants as well and then once you've gotten that all accomplished then we should go
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:27.640]  after the strip club industry and we should make sure that we don't have strip clubs or
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:32.920]  gentlemen's clubs or anything like that and and then and then ultimately we'll save stormy daniels
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:38.120]  from all the plight that she's had to deal with oh what she's making how much money off of this again
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:46.280]  oh wow oh and getting donations 300 grand and donations plus all the money she makes from her
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:50.920]  porn star tour okay well it makes a lot of money so of course the left wants to shut it down all
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:57.800]  right well I somehow have to segue off of that to Matt Bracken my next guest who will be with
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.760]  me in the next segment as well Matt it seems to me right now that it's the perfect opportunity
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:08.920]  for a false flag in America while the left is becoming totally unhinged it's very easy to
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:16.040]  get a wind-up doll to go out there and commit some heinous act given how the far left minions right
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:22.280]  now are pretty much losing their cool losing their sanity and are on the brink of a total breakdown
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:26.680]  the reading between the lines of the news yesterday
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:32.440]  uh I never before last year I never even knew that the Republicans had a baseball team
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:38.120]  or that they had practices in northern Virginia or that there was not much security there that
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:46.360]  they did that nobody came out and shot at them you know I would expect something like that to happen
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:51.880]  you know potentially now that the uh the Mueller Comey investigation the wheels are coming off of
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:57.240]  that so I wouldn't be surprised if something like that does happen yeah exactly and their whole
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:02.600]  Russian collusion thing is falling apart too you know there was a story uh Faith Goldie who's a
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:07.800]  conservative speaker she was scheduled to speak at an event at a university security was going to
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:14.040]  cost about seven grand overnight it shot up to 30 grand and they had to cancel the event now
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.920]  where is that threat coming from what is the violence why all this need for increased security
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:23.880]  well the answer is obvious you have a bunch of rabid leftists out there that hate free speech
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:27.960]  that have been brainwashed by media to think that anyone that's a conservative is a Nazi
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:33.240]  they're ready to pop off I mean this is the moment that they've been waiting for and if they get
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:38.600]  enough of them in that mindset they might actually be able to get them to pull something off so Matt
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:43.800]  Bracken and I are going to break it down all on the other side this is the Alex Jones show please

[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:08.040]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:15.240]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:20.600]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:26.200]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.800]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:38.280]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.320]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:49.640]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:33.880]  and now your host owin shroyer here is the perfect scenario for the corporate fake news press
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:41.800]  the fake news television media the cnn's the msnbcs of the west their perfect scenario right now
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:47.000]  that they would be foaming at the mouth to report on would be a situation
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:54.520]  whether it be a shooting or let's say a bombing or anything like that some major event some catastrophe
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:48:03.400]  perhaps even you know a mass casualty event that they can spin and then blame on conservatives
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:08.760]  blame on republicans that blame on the alt right you've seen them try it before they tried it with
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:14.520]  the charlottesville thing that failed they tried it by saying that trump supporters are violent at
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.360]  their rallies that narrative failed it was always the leftist going and starting violence
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:25.080]  same thing happened in charlottesville so they need a mass event that they can either blame on
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:31.800]  conservatives or blame on retired members of the military and veterans and it's a talking point
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:35.560]  that they've been bringing up for a long time they've tried to pin it to alex jones they try to pin
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:41.320]  it to conservative media so that would be their perfect event and if they think they can get some
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:47.080]  wind-up doll to go out there in a controlled event where he's already on their radar he's already
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:52.200]  brought up red flags and you let him go but then you control the situation because he's already on
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:57.720]  your radar so then that you can blame it on oh he maybe watched an alex jones video or a paul
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:03.160]  just watching video or something and then they create a media narrative that says we caused him
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:07.960]  to do that now we have to be shut down and the background is all the lawsuits the background
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:12.440]  is all the fake news on alex jones so matt bracken you're the expert on this enemies foreign
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:17.400]  and domestic dot com you've written multiple books about this what do you think they're
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:22.600]  thinking right now in the media because you had the isis propaganda coming out and they have their
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:29.320]  gun aimed at cnn which i think is total bs i think cnn loves isis i think as you know so i
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:34.120]  don't know why that would happen it kind of seems like maybe fake propaganda there but what do you
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:39.720]  think the media would do if an event like this happened i mean we say hey this looks like it
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:44.760]  might be a radical islamic terror attack and they attack us but you know they would jump on a narrative
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:50.840]  as soon as they could if they could blame it on a trump supporter yeah and and there i think they
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:56.280]  would go trump supporters uh or someone that could be portrayed as you know from the alt right
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:02.040]  if they could but you know over the last since the year and a half since trumps been elected
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:07.880]  you know we've seen the assassination of trump in the park by you know a well-known
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:15.720]  group of theatrical players stabbing trump to death you know that we're holding up his
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:22.120]  bloody head these are signals to the loose cannons that you'll be praised you'll be somebody
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.880]  your worthless life will have meaning if you make our dreams come true and assassinate the president
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:33.560]  but i think that there are other actors who would say you know what we need to do is is
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:40.680]  shoot up a feminist rally or a black lives matter rally and leave clues pointing at the
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:45.720]  conservatives because they know for a fact that the media would not look at it critically as a
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:51.240]  false flag in any way you know they would run with the narrative immediately we saw this in
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:56.440]  syria with what is i would say you know at least the 80 20 chance it was a false flag attack
[02:50:56.440 --> 02:51:05.320]  against Assad i mean it makes no sense the timing the media just went with it as if it was an
[02:51:05.320 --> 02:51:11.000]  established fact before there was any proof and there still is no proof but they ran with it as
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:16.040]  an established fact to the point of firing missiles so yeah the media would immediately
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.240]  say this is the conservatives they've just done a massacre it's another reason to go after guns
[02:51:21.240 --> 02:51:27.960]  i think if it happens it will definitely be a gun probably an ar-15 yeah then they can use
[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:32.120]  the narrative not only against uh conservatives but then of course go after the guns that's
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:38.040]  one of their favorite things to do but again you know i would have never i would have never
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:43.720]  thought this before but after garland texas with an actual active duty you know card
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:50.200]  carrying fbi special agent following behind the terrorists goading them to commit mass murder
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:55.560]  for a political uh objective i wouldn't be surprised if the fbi has its eye on
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:52:01.800]  certain loose cannons that are roaming around right now and depending on the uh political
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:09.640]  desires either stopping them or dropping the ball again depending on the desired outcome
[02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:15.480]  for example if these stock page messages have bomb shells in them that are you know going to
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:21.080]  completely blow up a Mueller's investigation and make the democrats to look like you know that
[02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:27.000]  look like traitors and and russian colluders that's when the you know then then one of these wind
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:31.960]  up dolls the fbi might suddenly lose track of him and then something happens well let's be
[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:37.080]  perfectly clear that's what happened in florida the fbi new cruise was on the wash lift i mean
[02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:43.400]  dozens if not hundreds of red flags totally knew who he was and then there was the stand down at the
[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:50.360]  scene so you've got that aspect of things and then you talk about the controlled aspect of you know
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:57.320]  oh is the fbi behind this or cia we now have the documents that just got released unintentionally
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:04.280]  apparently how the government can use radiation coming out of cell phones to manipulate your
[02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:09.320]  mind and put voices in your head so then you've got that aspect of you got crazies out there
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:14.600]  plus some crazy technology a government or some other entity has where they can hack into your
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:19.880]  cell phone and then use that to literally control you like mk ultra people saying oh you're crazy
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:26.520]  no look it up this is these are published documents they use electronic waves to manipulate your mind
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:32.280]  and make you act crazy it's like right out of the movie kingsman and so we're dealing with all of this
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:37.800]  but people need to understand that the media will try to create a narrative that's what it's all about
[02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:44.120]  it's all about creating a narrative just like hands up don't shoot never happened totally disproven
[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:48.760]  disproven in the courts yet still to this day they do hands up don't shoot just like still to this
[02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:53.480]  day they say okay frogs are a real thing there's no scientific evidence so it's all about creating
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:58.840]  that first narrative and then that sinks into the brainwash people's minds the truth never never
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:04.760]  penetrates yeah i'm i'm i'm reading i don't know why it took me so long right now i'm reading a
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:11.720]  terrific book one of the best books i've ever read american betrayal by diana west and it gets into
[02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:18.680]  this um you know in the 50s and 60s really starting in the 30s the communist networks were covered up
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:24.600]  so effectively mccarthy ended up being the villain and he was a hero he was right what people remember
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:31.240]  of that era is red baiting and you know communists under the bed and it became a joke a running gag
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:36.440]  but it really happened and then the objective neutral truth really doesn't matter anymore
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:41.720]  it's what narrative can be pounded home over and over again that's why we saw we've seen you
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:47.480]  know hundreds of movies with you know the german third rike nazis as the villains
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:54.040]  and you can count on one hand any movies that portrayed a global communism russian chinese
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:59.800]  cambodian any of them as the you know great villains that they were killing at least 100
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:06.040]  million in the 20th century so objective reality is not as important as main as keeping a false
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:12.600]  narrative going with a drumbeat of lies and it works brainwashing works it absolutely works
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:18.200]  and there's no doubt in my mind that thing about the mind control um that was leaked from the fusion
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:23.800]  center or dropped out by the fusion center i don't i don't think that would work on normal
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:29.320]  people but if they've got somebody who's already you know hearing voices they can probably dial
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:35.880]  him up or dial him down you know provoke him for example turn him into a uh you know we're really
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:42.280]  rabid lunatic from just a simmering lunatic it wouldn't surprise me i don't think that there's a
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:47.800]  any federal agents out there doing it right now but for goodness sake after garland we have to be
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:53.960]  very suspicious that um they might accidentally drop the ball again you know mule it's it's um
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:59.880]  so funny meuler when he was ahead of the fbi that was when they gutted the the realistic counter
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:08.440]  jihad training so you can make an actual case that ford hood boston san bernadino orlando many
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:15.800]  other attacks they happened because the fbis had blinders put on them you know mosques were put off
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:22.040]  out of bounds for surveillance this would be like in the 1930s if uh you know the german american
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:28.040]  bund was put out out of bounds for surveillance and you needed to talk to a nazi about true
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:34.120]  nazi culture because we can't be you know germanophobic but that's where we are today we're in a
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:39.400]  land of well that's the problem americans don't know their history and they don't know the lies
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:43.160]  that the media has been reporting on for years that never they never correct and you and you're
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:49.640]  going to talk more of this in the next hour as well and just real quick you mentioned the stroke page
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:53.320]  texts that are about to come out and potential bombshells there to me we already have all the
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:56.920]  bombshells we know what's in the text we know it all everybody knows until these people actually
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.480]  get arrested and get tried in court and have to testify under oath nothing's going to matter that
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:06.040]  that's the day this stuff matters until then it probably doesn't but the key is that info wars can

[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:20.280]  well kanye west was guilty of trumping while black about a year ago he was trumping while black
[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:23.880]  so the thought police had to throw him in the gulag and he was silent for a little while
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:29.240]  now he's back he's saying he loves trump he likes the way that kandace owin thinks
[03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:35.720]  and the entire entertainment industry is freaking out because their propaganda only works if it has
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:43.960]  the facade of unanimity behind it of the entire hollywood and entertainment industry is behind
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:49.640]  hating trump he's bad well if one steps out of line oh my gosh it could trigger free thinking
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:56.040]  we can't have that we have to get kanye back in line so then steven colbert on his show last night
[03:00:56.040 --> 03:01:02.760]  says kanye west has lost his mind for supporting trump so of course the black man decides to
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:07.800]  think freely and leave it to the white man to just kick him right back down and put him back
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:12.360]  in line that's steven colbert the black man kanye west thinks freely and then the white man kicks
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:16.440]  him back in the line steven colbert says he's lost his mind we went out on the streets of
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:21.320]  austin texas and thought hmm i wonder what the students at ut think about all this
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:36.200]  something like i am a god everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i
[03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:46.840]  was a god let the base kick let the base kick this is the vanna hernan is with info wars today
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:50.840]  we're on ut's campus to talk to students about what they think about the recent controversy
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:54.920]  surrounding kanye west tweets and his support of kandace owens let's go see what people think
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:05.240]  you ain't got the answers man you ain't got the answers sway kanye just tweeted um a picture of
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:08.840]  himself wearing a make america great again how what do you think about that didn't you come out as
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:15.160]  pro trump i mean so he's pro trump what do you think about that i i didn't really have an opinion
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:20.600]  at any way to begin i listened to kanye before trump ran for election so his political views
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:26.360]  don't sway your opinion of him at all um not necessarily kanye i feel like a political opinion
[03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:30.840]  can sway your opinion of a lot of celebrities and entertainers but kanye is kind of like kanye
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:35.400]  where he's just too big to fail so it's just kind of like that i mean he could come out and say
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:39.640]  whatever he wants i feel like people are still gonna listen to him i think it's perfectly fine
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:44.600]  dudes uh uh he's given out his uh first amendment rights to discuss what political candidates he
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:49.640]  likes i think that's perfectly fine you know i know so some people are freaking out about it but
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:56.280]  it's like to be honest we live in a democracy so it's like i'd expect our uh uh i'd expect people
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:01.160]  in uh uh high positions to give their opinions it's just that what's happening is people don't
[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:05.880]  like the fact that he's not supporting the guy that they like i'm really happy for you i'm gonna
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:11.240]  let you finish i don't know i'm not a fan of that i like his music but i don't appreciate that as a
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:15.960]  kanye fan that's not what's up i don't know i'm kind of questioning now whether or not to continue
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:19.640]  supporting him i don't know i haven't really invested in much of his stuff lately i mean i'll
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:24.760]  listen to his music some of his older stuff but i mean i don't know we'll see about what he's produced
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:29.960]  you know whisking out uh lately and everything like that so i don't know i'm not really a fan of that
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:37.080]  that he's supporting trump i mean he has his own political affiliations that's cool i mean
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:41.240]  it's a good thing i think that he's not falling under what a lot of celebrities seem to be saying
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:46.920]  and he's speaking out for a different political affiliation yeah yeah so he actually recently
[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:50.200]  tweeted you know we have freedom of speech but we don't have freedom of thought what do you think
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:58.920]  about that well if he's speaking about censorship in the media and certain platforms then i get what
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:04.280]  he's saying but i mean we could still think whatever we want we don't have a police like attacking
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:08.120]  citizens or incarcerating citizens because of certain thoughts maybe some european countries
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:13.560]  have that going on but we don't have that in the united states currently can i ask you guys a couple
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:17.800]  questions um about the controversy surrounding kanye west and his recent tweets and support of
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:22.760]  kandace owens i have not read anything about that i'm sorry you ain't been doing the education
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.000]  bro you ain't been doing the education i don't want to be insulting but i don't think kanye
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:31.800]  himself really understands what trump is doing he just sees like the few little things that they
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:36.680]  show on c and n and stuff and he supports that which is not good because if you're going to be
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:39.880]  a somebody supporter you have to do your research and do your background information about that
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:43.720]  person but that is my personal opinion he probably could know but i'm just saying because
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:46.760]  honestly i don't think anybody that really truly understands what trump is doing especially with
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:50.200]  the stuff in syria we're really trying to support his actions but that's that's just

[03:08:11.560 --> 03:08:18.760]  regarding the john f kennedy assassination uh the president uh in accordance with the 1994
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:28.600]  jfk document release act ordered the release of the remaining 19045 documents pertaining to the
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:35.960]  murder of the president uh no document was completely withheld in full upon the president's
[03:08:35.960 --> 03:08:43.400]  orders and redactions based on the president's instructions are only to regard those who are
[03:08:43.400 --> 03:08:51.080]  currently living uh interestingly enough the uh intelligence agencies had requested a further
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:59.800]  delay the president uh ordered them to be extremely circumspect in recommending any further postponement
[03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:09.160]  and he said the material that has been withheld to date is to be re-reviewed by october 26 2021
[03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:15.480]  not that far away to determine whether there's any continuing use uh reason why this government
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:21.400]  document this government information should be withheld now in the past we have learned
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:28.840]  uh an extraordinarily extraordinary amount about the jfk assassination from these release documents
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:35.960]  for example we learned that the kgb uh had conducted their own independent investigation
[03:09:35.960 --> 03:09:42.280]  into the john f kennedy invest uh assassination and had determined that linden johnson was the
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:48.120]  perp we actually uh saw in the government released records a memo from jadgar hoover the head of the
[03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:54.200]  fbi to president johnson informing him of that we also learned that the french intelligence
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:10:00.120]  conducted their own independent review at the request of jack millen kennedy they also concurred
[03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:07.480]  that linden johnson was a major orchestrator of the plot uh we learned that president linden johnson
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:14.600]  belonged to the kukoks clay in early in his congressional career uh we learned uh about
[03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:26.680]  george h w bush's presence uh in dalis on the 21st and 22nd of november 1963 for 30 years uh
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:33.000]  former president george bush said that he couldn't remember where he was that day that bracken will
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:39.480]  tell you everyone remembers where they were that day uh any anybody who was old enough to think
[03:10:40.600 --> 03:10:49.880]  but we also saw uh in the release documents memos between george h w bush uh who called the
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:57.800]  houston fbi minutes after the president was shot essentially to establish an alibi saying that he
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:06.120]  was speaking in tyler texas uh and then leading the fbi on a wild goose chase regarding uh a
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:12.840]  young republican in harris county that he said may or may not have made threats against the president
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:19.960]  i think ross baker in his terrific book on the bush has highlighted this revelation so
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:26.920]  i have not had an opportunity to examine the material that was released today but so far it
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:32.840]  is consistent with everything the president told me he would do he favors transparency
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:41.160]  why you may ask uh would the intelligence agencies be opposed to the release of this material
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:48.360]  particularly since those involved in these events oh 55 years ago are almost certainly dead and no
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:54.920]  longer with us well the real reason i think is because they don't want to expose their methods
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:12:03.480]  they leaked then they leak now they fabricate things then they fabricate things now they
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:10.280]  assassinate then they still assassinate today uh so it is uh it speaks to the foundations
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:19.080]  of our rogue intelligence agencies uh this is a monumental decision by the president today
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:26.680]  okay some will criticize the redactions but i would point out that the 1994 john f kennedy records
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:35.160]  release act requires that the archives and the intelligence agencies publish in writing
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:42.440]  the reasons for any withholdings or redactions in the federal register they have not yet done that
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:48.520]  um i have urged senator chuck grassley the chairman of the senate judiciary committee
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:56.280]  and congressman walter jones of north carolina who has been a real crusader for transparency
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:13:03.320]  on this issue to look into the failure of the intelligence agencies to explain their redactions
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:10.920]  to date matt do you have any reaction here to the jfk revelations well i'm i'm glad that um
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:17.720]  trump is leaning towards disclosure uh i'll note that um researchers that have been trying to follow
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:25.640]  up on a lot of of untied threads of the communist networks operating in the 50s and 60s find that
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:33.000]  the archives are missing information that physical um physical documents had been taken out and
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:38.040]  misplaced or destroyed so when they try to do the you go back and look at these documents they
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:43.720]  can't find them i don't know if all of these documents have been kept in secure places or if
[03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:50.680]  you know people like sandy burger who was trying to clean up behind bill clinton you know going
[03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:58.120]  into um uh i guess the library of congress or uh to remove you know damaging information
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:03.320]  it'll be interesting to see what damaging information is still left or if it's been sanitized
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:08.920]  yeah you you you bring up a famous incident which burger went into the national archives
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:15.160]  they assign a docent who's who spends time with you he tells the docent i have to take a classified
[03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:20.200]  telephone call can you step out while he steps out burger takes documents shoves them down the
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:27.400]  front of his pants and leaves how much time did he spend in jail for this crime none zero
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:33.480]  but he was trying to cover up the fact that bill clinton could have taken out bin laden it had the
[03:14:33.480 --> 03:14:40.760]  opportunity and passed on it uh but uh you remind me of that now it's also interesting that the
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:51.560]  national archives last november released 667 documents ahead of the of the august deadline or
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:58.200]  pardon me the july deadline and almost all of those documents were heavily redacted i almost
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:05.800]  wonder whether that was a test to see what public reaction would be the 96 documents released on
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:11.320]  that day are completely and totally worthless to scholars or researchers or reporters trying to
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:18.760]  figure out what happened uh on november 22nd 1963 it was not until after that that the president
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:25.640]  became aware of his responsibilities under the 1994 act uh and ordered uh the release of these
[03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:32.600]  documents to the consternation of our intelligence services uh good move today by president donald

[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:34.280]  welcome back i'm roger stone and you're on the alex jones show we were involved in a
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:41.720]  discussion with matt bracken regarding the uh the release of the jfk assassination documents
[03:20:41.720 --> 03:20:47.480]  this morning by president donald trump but we kind of segued into a broader conversation
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:54.200]  addressing an interview that the president gave to fox and friends this morning in which he intimated
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:00.280]  in response to a question regarding russian collusion that he is close to taking control of
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:07.960]  his own justice department um matt and i agree that it's long past time that he do that and then
[03:21:07.960 --> 03:21:14.200]  last week you had the attorney general jeff sessions saying publicly that if the president
[03:21:14.200 --> 03:21:20.440]  fired rod rozenstein the number two man in the department but really the defacto attorney general
[03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:31.400]  today well that he sessions would step down he seemed to back off that slightly uh but make my day
[03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:38.120]  i mean matt please make my day uh the the amount of power the president has i'm not sure he really
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:45.240]  understands the justice department is it is an extension of the executive branch he has full
[03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:51.480]  authority to direct their activities but what we have instead is the trump justice department
[03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:58.280]  ignoring the crimes of the clinton's and the obamas that include unconstitutional illegal
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:06.040]  surveillance the creation of fabricated evidence for the purposes of rationalizing that surveillance
[03:22:06.920 --> 03:22:14.600]  the disappearance of records the misappropriation of monies all of those crimes including the crimes
[03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:21.480]  of the clinton foundation go unexplored the sale of 20 percent of our uranium stock unscathed
[03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:29.080]  a meanwhile we have a witch hunt looking into the trump campaign and trump's many associates
[03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:37.320]  without yet today a scintilla of evidence of russian collusion conspiracy or coordination
[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:44.040]  matt what's your take yeah i think that the the key the like the rosetta stone of this is to
[03:22:44.040 --> 03:22:52.040]  understand how did how did rosinstein become the um acting attorney general who put him forward for
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:23:00.040]  that if we understood the machinations behind his being installed as as a deputy i think we'll
[03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:06.440]  understand the larger outlines of this plot because clearly he was put in there to trigger
[03:23:06.440 --> 03:23:12.120]  trump to fire comey and then that would trigger a special counsel where he would name comey's
[03:23:12.120 --> 03:23:19.400]  friend robert mehler these are all corruptocrats rosinstein mehler and winds and and weissman
[03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:25.800]  are all could go to prison for uranium one this to me gives them a strong motive to try to take
[03:23:25.800 --> 03:23:33.320]  out trump if there's an honest investigation into the last 10 years of the uranium the uranium one
[03:23:33.320 --> 03:23:40.120]  scandal we're talking 145 million dollars going to the clinton foundation that's not chicken feed
[03:23:40.120 --> 03:23:47.320]  you know if you if you withheld 145 if $1,400 from the irs they want their money
[03:23:47.320 --> 03:23:54.920]  145 million and there's no investigation and mere rosinstein and weissman who are all involved in
[03:23:54.920 --> 03:24:01.800]  that hold the key to trump's future it's just crazy this morning the president said that he might be
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:09.240]  soon taking over the reins of the doj i'd like to see president trump and devin nuñez marching
[03:24:09.240 --> 03:24:15.880]  into the department of justice with us marshals saying we're going to take the records out we've
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:21.800]  got dollies we've got some you know the workers behind us we're removing them now are you are we
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:27.800]  are you rejecting an order from your president that runs this building and do the same thing at the
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:33.880]  fbi and anybody who stands in front of those records and says you can't have them handcuff them
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:39.560]  take the records out you know one of the biggest aspects of this scandal that has gotten almost
[03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:48.120]  no attention is that struck is a social friend of the fisi court judge rudy contraris i mean i i
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:53.960]  love sean hannity but he's always saying boy those fisi judges must be really mad that they were used
[03:24:53.960 --> 03:24:59.000]  how do we know they were used they might have been cooperating and planning this all along
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:05.560]  there's that redacted email or text that says we're going to have a meeting with uh judge rudy
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:12.040]  but we need to make it a cocktail party and invite more people for cover for action cover for action
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:19.320]  is a term of tradecraft uh that that means how do we give ourselves a plausible reason for meeting
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:25.000]  somebody otherwise it would be just a clandestine meeting between spies we need to do it with a
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:32.600]  cover for action this to me is a flagrant admission of guilty intent to meet the judge the fisi judge
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:40.200]  out of church you know out of out of uh business hours to set this whole thing up if the fisi court
[03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:48.040]  is as corrupt as the fbi is where are we today we've got a communist running the cia by his own
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:54.520]  admission voted for a communist in 1980 at the height of the cold war john brennan i mean we've
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:26:02.120]  got clapper lying repeatedly to congress they forget who runs who congress created the nsa
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:08.680]  congress created the cia now they're off the leash they've gone rogue and they're trying to take out
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:14.040]  the president that's trying to put their collar back on i mean we are in the middle of a bureaucratic
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:21.320]  civil war right now nobody's being shot as of now but day by day i expect canoe accidents uh
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:27.800]  fort marcy park bodies to be found admiral border suicides because we're getting down to that that
[03:26:27.800 --> 03:26:33.800]  period of this where uh there are people who are saying if this guy testifies i'm going to prison
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:39.560]  there it's time for an accident you know somebody's mercedes is going to uh be bluetooth enabled into
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:46.280]  a tree at 100 miles an hour like michael hastings after he had his sights set on john brennan
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:52.120]  following his takedown of general stanley mccrystal i mean these guys will stop at nothing at this
[03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:58.360]  point and uh you know we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg above the water but believe me
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:03.320]  the the sharks are circling down below and you know there's there's blood in the water right now
[03:27:03.320 --> 03:27:08.440]  with these stock page texts about to come out literally anything could happen including a
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:14.680]  false flag attack diversion you know some some lunatic could be let off the off the uh fbi could
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:21.640]  drop the ball again in order to create a momentous distraction just as some of these uh you know more
[03:27:21.640 --> 03:27:27.800]  revelations about the corruption in the fbi and doj come out not to mention people like brennan
[03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:34.200]  and clapper they're capable of doing literally anything that i think that's a very very good
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:40.520]  analysis of the situation i want to remind our listeners and our viewers that we here at info
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:48.360]  wars are completely and totally funded uh by you we have no rich conservative fat cat sitting in the
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:53.800]  wings writing us big checks that's why i need you to go to the info wars dot com site now
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:59.480]  and look at some of these extraordinary specials we are the cutting edge when it comes to modern
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:06.120]  nutraceuticals uh i particularly like brain force plus this show would not be possible
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:11.960]  without brain force force plus i'm now stacking it with the red pill which i think is the single
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:19.480]  best vitamin and mineral combination that i have found they call this the body and mind uh combo

[03:33:21.640 --> 03:33:29.080]  welcome back the talking heads bringing us in there i'm roger stone sitting in for alex jones
[03:33:29.080 --> 03:33:35.400]  and you're at freedom command central it's the alex jones show in our last segment matt bracken
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:42.280]  made a very good point it was the congress that created the nsa created the central intelligence
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:50.040]  agency created all these alphabet soup intelligence and national security agencies now we see a new
[03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:56.920]  phenomena with an extraordinarily disproportionate number of people from intelligence or military
[03:33:56.920 --> 03:34:03.800]  intelligence backgrounds now running for the congress as democrats one quarter of all democratic
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:09.160]  challengers in competitive house districts have military or intelligence backgrounds
[03:34:09.160 --> 03:34:18.200]  uh intelligence backgrounds by far the largest subgroup of uh of uh category of avocation national
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:28.520]  security operatives 57 uh lawyers 45 government officials 35 corporate executives businessmen
[03:34:28.520 --> 03:34:37.320]  and wealthy individuals 30 uh and other professionals 19 put it another way in the 102 primary elections
[03:34:37.320 --> 03:34:45.640]  recently held 44 involved candidates uh with military intelligence backgrounds uh military
[03:34:45.640 --> 03:34:53.800]  intelligence candidates count for 10 of the 22 most competitive districts in the country to me
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:35:01.560]  this smacks of a separation of power issue what we see here is a clear trend uh of intelligence
[03:35:01.560 --> 03:35:09.720]  types seeking to invade the congress uh in order to subvert that body and in that's in essence uh
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:17.400]  subvert the oversight authority of the congress over our rogue intelligence agencies interestingly
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:25.240]  enough you see no comparable move among republican challengers this is extraordinary matt your thoughts
[03:35:25.240 --> 03:35:31.800]  you know the congressional oversight you mean what's left of it it's like a toothless puppy
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:38.840]  trying to you know pull down a uh a pit bull because the theoretically the toothless puppy
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:44.840]  is in charge of the pit bull but you know when the cia remember was not supposed to operate
[03:35:44.840 --> 03:35:49.720]  inside of the united states because the fear was that they would begin to run intelligence
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:55.560]  operations here and that would morph into exactly what we have seen which is the the tools of
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:36:01.560]  intelligence operations as opposed to intelligence gathering intelligence operations being used at
[03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:08.600]  home which is essentially what the frame up of donald trump is it's a rogue intelligence operation
[03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:14.600]  starting with the end desire to get rid of donald trump before he can destroy the deep state
[03:36:14.600 --> 03:36:20.600]  and then working backward from there to fabricate the uh you know the steel dossier take it to a
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:26.120]  probably corrupt fiza court which would rubber stamp it and they'd be off to the races so
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:32.920]  at that's at the national level but at every other level if these intelligence agencies think
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:38.840]  they're going to have a friendly operator now and congressional uh camouflage what kind of
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:45.080]  what kind of help are they going to give them you know it's there's often a uh not a non-clear
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:52.040]  and intentionally non-clear distinction between active duty serving intelligence officers retired
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:37:01.160]  former contract especially you know et cetera um this is how in the past former greenberries
[03:37:01.160 --> 03:37:05.720]  and seals they've been approached by people that they knew a decade earlier in some war zone
[03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:13.320]  as a cia officer and they don't always say clearly whether they are working under official orders
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:21.720]  or if they're now private because there's this gray area where the active intelligence officers
[03:37:22.520 --> 03:37:28.280]  will get out but they're still really in it's called sheep dipping for one word for it
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:34.360]  they're actually still in but they pretend to be private citizens yep so these former
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:38.920]  greenberries and seals they never know when they're dealing with some guy that they met
[03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:46.440]  long ago as a cia officer if the guy is legitimately acting on orders or if he's gone rogue and he's
[03:37:46.440 --> 03:37:53.960]  operating under his own auspices this is how uh for example if when michael hastings mercedes
[03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:59.640]  blew up you know at full speed uh i don't think that there's ever going to be a paper trail back
[03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:06.840]  to the cia but it's sort of like uh you know who will rid me of this of this uh meddlesome this
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:14.520]  troublesome priest the intention is declared and people that want to curry favor the the you know
[03:38:14.520 --> 03:38:21.160]  cutouts working with cutouts eventually the action takes place you know and this is now come back
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:27.640]  to the united states it was in 1963 truman wrote a letter to the washington post that was actually
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:33.080]  literally pulled out of the washington post for decades afterwards you're explaining his fears
[03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:39.160]  that the cia would become a frankenstein monster or already had become a frankenstein monster
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:44.840]  that was in in december of 63 he wrote that curious timing you know right after the assassination
[03:38:45.400 --> 03:38:52.040]  the letter in for one addition and then it was pulled truman said that signing the the cia into
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:59.160]  law was the biggest single mistake he ever made uh right i am very interested in the question of the
[03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:07.080]  faiza court warrants because um the new york times reported on january 20th 2017 that i was the
[03:39:07.080 --> 03:39:14.360]  subject of a faiza warrant along with paul manifold and carter page a number of things that have
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:20.520]  have happened since then that lead me to believe that the government has full access to my email
[03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:28.920]  and my communications therefore today i filed a freedom of uh information request with approximately
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:34.760]  40 different agencies of the government seeking information as to whether i was a subject to
[03:39:34.760 --> 03:39:41.080]  a faiza warrant this is a precursor to a lawsuit you have to ask formally and then be denied which
[03:39:41.080 --> 03:39:47.720]  is what i expect and then we'll move to the second stage i do know that the government continues to
[03:39:47.720 --> 03:39:53.240]  deny that paul manifold was ever under surveillance even though the washington post the wall street
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:39:58.040]  journal the new york times have all reported otherwise uh and then there is the curious
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:07.000]  question of carter page the appointment of a u.s attorney in utah to uh look into the faiza abuses
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:12.760]  is a head fake in my opinion it's not that uber the man appointed is not a good man i think he
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:19.480]  may be he's been giving no budget and no authority unlike robert muhler therefore i expect his probe
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:26.840]  to be very narrow also i'm mindful of what happened when the house committee on assassinations
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:34.040]  attempted to investigate the fbi the secret service and the cia they were stall stone walled
[03:40:34.040 --> 03:40:41.080]  as mr uber will be stone walled uh this was to take the pressure off of jeff sessions for his
[03:40:41.080 --> 03:40:49.080]  failure to appoint a second special prosecutor to look into the faiza warrant abuses the steel
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:55.320]  dossier and that whole ugly story which seems to me to lead right back to the hillary clinton
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:02.920]  campaign but thanks to peter strokes text message leads us right back to barack obama what did the
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:09.960]  president know and when did he know it at yeah i think that i think that um partly they're trying
[03:41:09.960 --> 03:41:15.880]  to protect the the upper echelons but you know if mccabe he does threatened i think his terminology
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:22.360]  was something like burn the whole damn house down if he's if he's indicted uh if he's if he's going
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:29.560]  to make the claim that he was acting under orders that he was you know in in uh cooperating with
[03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:36.840]  with kony and obama and indirectly clapper and brennan um you know if he starts pointing uh
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:43.560]  fingers that high i think that he's going to need another level of life insurance and i would advise
[03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:51.880]  him strictly to not go bicycling or canoeing or uh jogging in fort marcy park because i think that
[03:41:51.880 --> 03:42:00.280]  the man would be uh at serious risk of being michael hasting very serious risk the other question
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:07.160]  the interest made today is uh is a discrepancy yesterday true pundit who i found has had a
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:13.880]  terrific record of accuracy said that uh the russian woman lawyer uh whose name i can never
[03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:20.600]  pronounce properly vessel nitskaya was allowed into the country uh at the time of her famous
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:28.440]  meeting with donald trump jr on a special visa that was approved by us attorney pre bahara uh we
[03:42:28.440 --> 03:42:38.600]  will come back uh and review this question on the other side
[03:42:53.080 --> 03:42:57.800]  introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on
[03:42:57.800 --> 03:43:03.720]  mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95 of your energy
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:09.480]  they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by
[03:43:09.480 --> 03:43:14.760]  supporting mitochondria much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria
[03:43:14.760 --> 03:43:21.320]  don't run at 100 efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:27.080]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen
[03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:33.560]  species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market
[03:43:33.560 --> 03:43:38.600]  the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:43:38.600 --> 03:43:46.120]  species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life

[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:07.960]  nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical
[03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:14.360]  defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[03:45:14.360 --> 03:45:19.480]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 when
[03:45:19.480 --> 03:45:24.280]  this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we

[03:48:06.120 --> 03:48:12.760]  to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills then they take those headlines and they use
[03:48:12.760 --> 03:48:19.640]  them as the rationale to remove us from the internet remove us from youtube from facebook from google
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:26.360]  and so on the costs are astronomical and they're only rising why because alex jones is a fighter

[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:12.920]  of these terrific products so we were talking about how this woman russian lawyer uh vessel
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:18.360]  nitskaya got into the country mat and what's interesting is that the true pundit reported
[03:50:18.360 --> 03:50:24.760]  that she had a special visa that was approved by a u.s attorney for the southern district of new york
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:31.160]  pre bahara but then reuters came out with a story almost immediately contradicting that
[03:50:31.160 --> 03:50:39.800]  saying that bahara had denied her a visa but then going on to say that the state department gave her
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:47.000]  a special visa anyway in june of 2016 what it doesn't tell us is who approved that visa she was
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:53.480]  denied a visa because she was not a witness or central to a legal case uh in which she had a
[03:50:53.480 --> 03:50:59.720]  client going on in the in the uh in new york she had been denied uh she had been approved for a
[03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:06.920]  temporary visa on three separate previous occasions by the u.s attorney the question seems to me to
[03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:13.720]  remain who let this woman in the country she clearly came here for the purposes of setting
[03:51:13.720 --> 03:51:21.320]  up donald trump jr who's a great man and a good patriot uh but uh this question is vexing do you
[03:51:21.320 --> 03:51:28.200]  have an opinion yeah and i i'd like to discuss a little bit about that donald jr meeting to me
[03:51:28.200 --> 03:51:33.960]  this all smacks of an active intelligence operation against the president and what they'll do is is
[03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:39.640]  operate on multiple tracks because you don't know which of the plans is going to you know be a fizzle
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:45.160]  or a hangfire and which is going to be the one that takes off and succeeds so you might try five or
[03:51:45.160 --> 03:51:51.640]  six different parallel operations um one of them was the donald jr meeting it didn't matter if they
[03:51:51.640 --> 03:51:57.000]  talked about badminton the fact that they were in the same room would be then spun into the false
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:52:04.200]  narrative of russian collusion another one was carter page he's a good decent man he was in
[03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:10.440]  moscow and you know many times in business that's enough fact that he was in moscow that can be spun
[03:52:10.440 --> 03:52:16.360]  into a false narrative and the other one is papadopoulos this is the most flagrant to me
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:22.760]  he happens of all the people in london this is what a city of many millions he just happened
[03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:28.920]  to sit down at a bar talk about winning back-to-back power balls he happens to sit down with the
[03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:35.880]  high the high commissioner to britain from australia and allegedly talked about russian espionage
[03:52:35.880 --> 03:52:42.680]  just purely by coincidence and then it turns out that this guy alexander downer is a major
[03:52:42.680 --> 03:52:46.520]  bundler for the hillary clinton foundation we don't know what he was his angle was
[03:52:47.160 --> 03:52:52.280]  in doing so getting australians to donate to the hillary clinton foundation to the clinton
[03:52:52.280 --> 03:52:58.520]  foundation family foundation whatever it's called so this to me smacks of an intelligence operation
[03:52:58.520 --> 03:53:04.760]  where he's vectored to papadopoulos doesn't matter if they spoke to each other for two minutes about
[03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:12.440]  football scores for american or british it can then be spun as a see a meeting where where this
[03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:18.600]  wonderful guy alexander downer just happened to hear papadopoulos talking about russian collusion
[03:53:19.160 --> 03:53:25.560]  this to me is is like if somebody said hey my neighbor he's won 10 lotteries in a row
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:31.720]  i would have to be an idiot to actually believe that now if i if i saw the the checks i'd say
[03:53:31.720 --> 03:53:39.720]  then the fix is in this was all a setup the the the uh donald jr meeting the the london
[03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:44.040]  meeting with the height the australian high commissioner who just happens to be all tied
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:50.200]  to the clinton foundation and then going after carter page remember it wasn't just a bug and
[03:53:50.200 --> 03:53:56.120]  wiretap carter page he was the conduit into the entire trump campaign once they had the
[03:53:56.120 --> 03:54:02.360]  faiza warrant on carter page all of his contacts were fair game and that means going back in time
[03:54:02.360 --> 03:54:08.200]  because it's all archived everything is saved so yeah this to me was an intelligence operation
[03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:13.320]  from go they assumed that hillary would win and it would all be covered up you know that that
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:18.520]  that this would be used to sabotage the election but then he actually won and now they're in
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:23.960]  they're desperate to cover their tracks because people can definitely go to jail for this or be
[03:54:23.960 --> 03:54:29.400]  killed you know andrew mccabe you'd better have a powerful force field around you my friend
[03:54:29.400 --> 03:54:35.560]  because there are people that will take you out i mean i'm talking about people that do wet jobs
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:41.720]  do wet work for a living they will have you taken out well of course matt we pray that you're wrong
[03:54:41.720 --> 03:54:48.360]  but you don't seem to believe in coincidence look no popadopolis and carter page were so
[03:54:48.360 --> 03:54:53.560]  low in the food chain neither one of them was a paid staffer neither one of them had a credential
[03:54:53.560 --> 03:55:00.040]  to get into the headquarters neither one of them had any status they were both volunteers in what
[03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:05.720]  was a foreign policy committee with over a hundred members essentially put together for the purposes
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:11.240]  of a press release carter page may be a perfectly nice guy but to refer to him as a foreign policy
[03:55:11.240 --> 03:55:17.960]  advisor for donald trump is a bit of a stretch in the case of popadopolis it's even more of a stretch
[03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:24.840]  so i tend to agree with you that those two operations are highly suspicious the meeting
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:30.600]  in the donald trump junior's office which is allegedly to get negative information regarding
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:37.560]  hillary she has none produces none ends up being a discussion of adoption law uh it's a setup very
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:44.040]  clearly a setup uh and there is no crime there there's no wrong doing there don jr didn't do
[03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:50.120]  anything wrong uh we don't know uh anything about this woman lawyer other than the fact
[03:55:50.120 --> 03:55:57.000]  that she's connected to fusion gps how incredibly coincidental that she's worked with them
[03:55:57.560 --> 03:56:03.400]  now we're talking they're talking about brendan's secret trip to moscow in 2016 you know the guy
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:09.560]  that voted for the communist in 1980 as an adult well also the guy who's cia also the guy who spied
[03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:14.760]  on a senate committee looking into torture by the cia and then lied about it under oath
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:20.440]  an islamic convert john brennan i think you will find i have a long piece of info wars you can
[03:56:20.440 --> 03:56:27.400]  you can pull up i think he's the chief perp he's he's the guy who starts suggesting russian collusion
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:32.760]  long before it's a popular term in fact he's predicted it seemingly before it's ever allegedly
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:37.320]  happened so i want to thank matt bracken for joining us here on the alex joneshow
