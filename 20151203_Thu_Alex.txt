[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.260]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[00:21.260 --> 00:39.060]  Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Thursday the third
[00:39.060 --> 00:45.020]  day of December 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones we have the founder of the weather
[00:45.020 --> 00:50.460]  channel joining us to discuss the global government carbon tax situation being
[00:50.460 --> 00:55.340]  pushed in Paris France John Coleman will be joining us Joe Biggs will be
[00:55.340 --> 01:01.860]  joining us from the road with our crew detailing the American caliphate and I
[01:01.860 --> 01:08.580]  got to talk to a state police counterterrorism person with Homeland
[01:08.580 --> 01:13.700]  Security last night about my reporters going out to one of these Islamic
[01:13.700 --> 01:18.140]  centers out in the middle of nowhere with bar bar fences around it and just
[01:18.140 --> 01:22.300]  talking to the folks at the front guard check and we've got footage of all of
[01:22.300 --> 01:29.140]  that coming up as well now that said as soon as I heard about the tragic events
[01:29.140 --> 01:34.460]  in San Bernardino that started right as the show was basically ending yesterday
[01:34.460 --> 01:41.300]  right as all of this was going on I heard it was a husband and wife shooter
[01:41.300 --> 01:46.380]  and then it was some type of Christmas party and then as soon as we heard that
[01:46.380 --> 01:51.140]  it was Arabic surnames and that the wife had just been back from Saudi Arabia
[01:51.140 --> 01:56.020]  had been brought over from Saudi Arabia we said clearly this looks like a terror
[01:56.020 --> 02:01.260]  attack the media has been desperately trying to spin this and said this is not
[02:01.260 --> 02:07.140]  a terror attack and they also right up front and Paul Watson's written articles
[02:07.140 --> 02:11.240]  about this from full wars calm tried to blame the libertarians or the right
[02:11.240 --> 02:20.300]  wing for what reportedly Saeed Farouk and his wife did and I was talking a few
[02:20.300 --> 02:23.180]  days ago about political correctness where people won't even report crimes
[02:23.180 --> 02:29.300]  that are being committed by any quote protected group black Arabic female you
[02:29.300 --> 02:32.660]  name it the left will not do it of course they died a big shootout with the
[02:32.660 --> 02:36.500]  police they have some of that footage we can roll in the background with some of
[02:36.500 --> 02:41.540]  the audio as I speak here but neighborhood and neighbor didn't report
[02:41.540 --> 02:47.180]  San Bernardino shooter over fears of being called racist political correctness
[02:47.180 --> 02:54.620]  stopped woman from alerting authorities over suspicious activity so yeah let's
[02:54.620 --> 03:00.380]  go ahead and roll this audio so they end up running off Saudi Arabia coming
[03:00.380 --> 03:08.960]  back a few months later and killing gunshots what is it 13 or 14 people now
[03:08.960 --> 03:12.300]  the numbers have been the numbers have been changing and wounding a whole bunch
[03:12.300 --> 03:19.100]  of others so this isn't the San Bernardino Californian version of Paris
[03:19.100 --> 03:25.020]  because they're just not going to say it's that just like Major Hassan in
[03:25.020 --> 03:29.820]  contact with Alcada for two years on record congressional hearings attacks
[03:29.820 --> 03:36.460]  and kills oh 14 people again and it's not called Islamic terror and neither
[03:36.460 --> 03:40.860]  were the attacks on the Marine Corps Army Navy recruiting centers none of
[03:40.860 --> 03:46.060]  these attacks are in fact ladies and gentlemen I guess you can say that
[03:46.060 --> 03:50.460]  Syria well Obama won't say Syria and the radical jihadists that are there a
[03:50.460 --> 03:54.420]  radical Islamist he won't even say al-Qaeda or ISIS or al-Nusra is
[03:54.420 --> 04:00.060]  Islamic in fact they come out and said they're not Islamic and they've also I
[04:00.060 --> 04:03.260]  guess said the two plus two equals five and you can keep your doctor and you
[04:03.260 --> 04:08.180]  didn't build your business and they're not coming after your guns either so we
[04:08.180 --> 04:18.580]  have this wall we have this we have this wall of garbage taking place and and
[04:18.580 --> 04:22.860]  then dovetailing the big Donald Trump interview that is in over 1600 newspapers
[04:22.860 --> 04:28.140]  in the U.S. you go to Google news type in Alex Jones Donald Trump you get 1600
[04:28.140 --> 04:31.500]  plus stories in one category then there's two other ones of several hundred
[04:31.500 --> 04:37.060]  but it's over 2,000 stories when I checked a few hours ago CNN ABC news all
[04:37.060 --> 04:41.500]  of it demonizing Donald Trump for coming on he knew that what happened and then
[04:41.500 --> 04:47.020]  they just misrepresent what I've said what I do they go Jones believes Trump
[04:47.020 --> 04:51.700]  went on a show or the host believes Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma when I
[04:51.700 --> 04:55.620]  told a caller I didn't think it was weather weapons see this is how they
[04:55.620 --> 05:01.380]  misrepresent this is how they deceive could a high-tech doomsday weapon wipe
[05:01.380 --> 05:06.100]  out America a new report warns that the U.S. military has failed to keep pace
[05:06.100 --> 05:10.220]  with China and Russia in electromagnetic warfare tech boss and
[05:10.220 --> 05:13.660]  presidential candidate John McAfee recently warned about a doomsday
[05:13.660 --> 05:19.180]  electronic weapon that could wipe out 90% of Americans within two years of the
[05:19.180 --> 05:23.460]  attack and he urged politicians that this is the number one threat facing the
[05:23.460 --> 05:27.780]  country weapons that wipe out enemy electronics are a staple of science
[05:27.780 --> 05:32.740]  fiction films McAfee claims the country and its leaders are unprepared for EMP
[05:32.740 --> 05:37.380]  weapons and warned that gun crime should not be the single issue that decides
[05:37.380 --> 05:41.860]  votes recently president Obama declared voting against those politicians who are
[05:41.860 --> 05:45.700]  on the wrong side of the gun control issue McAfee says this is confusing
[05:45.700 --> 05:51.740]  because the possibility of 90% death for citizens of the U.S. far outweighs gun
[05:51.740 --> 05:56.060]  violence which causes fewer deaths per year than traffic accidents
[05:56.060 --> 05:59.340]  Leanne McAdoo for info wars.com

[08:15.740 --> 08:34.100]  radio network
[08:34.100 --> 08:38.460]  ladies and gentlemen here we are on this Thursday already the third day of
[08:38.460 --> 08:44.940]  December 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones we have the founder of the weather
[08:44.940 --> 08:49.100]  channel who's been an outspoken critic of anthropogenic man-made global warming
[08:49.100 --> 08:53.260]  joining us he of course has been proven correct with that they admit it's not
[08:53.260 --> 08:58.260]  global warming now or global freezing it's global climate change period you've
[08:58.260 --> 09:02.820]  got to pay the UN the IMF the World Bank Al Gore Prince Charles and others
[09:02.820 --> 09:08.900]  George Soros Ted Turner Bill Clinton you've got to pay Barack Obama he's part
[09:08.900 --> 09:14.380]  of the carbon exchange in Chicago big investor you have to be let in to the
[09:14.380 --> 09:20.300]  club and you've got to pay them money for everything you do in your life and or
[09:20.300 --> 09:24.580]  you're basically a horrible earth killer and so he will be joining us
[09:24.580 --> 09:29.500]  obviously for about 30 minutes coming up in the second hour to talk about that
[09:29.500 --> 09:38.740]  we have Joe Biggs joining us from a undisclosed location he was in upstate
[09:38.740 --> 09:42.460]  New York yesterday going to these different Islamic training centers and
[09:42.460 --> 09:47.140]  I got a call he got a call last night from the one of the heads of the
[09:47.140 --> 09:53.380]  counterterrorism task force with Homeland Security because well we were
[09:53.380 --> 09:59.140]  there investigating so that is all coming up they're gonna be traveling
[09:59.140 --> 10:02.620]  around the country showing this radicalization showing some of these
[10:02.620 --> 10:08.140]  reported hot spots where this reported radicalization reported trainings going
[10:08.140 --> 10:11.580]  on we're sure that's not true at some locations maybe true at others we're
[10:11.580 --> 10:18.020]  investigating and we're not planning to attack the poor little Muslims that's
[10:18.020 --> 10:22.100]  basically what we were being asked by the state police
[10:22.580 --> 10:26.780]  who were with Homeland Security and I said well did the people say Biggs or
[10:26.780 --> 10:31.380]  anybody threatened them no they just got scared after they left and so we're
[10:31.380 --> 10:35.060]  just and then of course they knew how to call Biggs they knew how to call Josh's
[10:35.060 --> 10:40.340]  phones without having their phone numbers that's Homeland Security for you
[10:40.340 --> 10:46.540]  oh but they let 154 illegals in last week out of Mexico that land in New York and
[10:46.540 --> 10:52.940]  don't even look at their passports that's CBS News CBS News but don't you
[10:52.940 --> 10:58.460]  worry Joe Biggs and Josh Owens and Michael Zimmerman oh they have all their
[10:58.460 --> 11:02.100]  info in fact they knew right where they were and right what they were doing with
[11:02.100 --> 11:06.380]  all the spy gadgets and the threat fusion centers and all the rest of it
[11:06.380 --> 11:11.180]  gotta keep your eyes on people with no criminal records that are patriots and
[11:11.180 --> 11:15.180]  you know the state police guy was somewhat nice and pretty much apologetic
[11:15.180 --> 11:21.300]  about it but this is what this government's been turned into now as soon
[11:21.300 --> 11:24.300]  as I heard as the show was ending yesterday that a husband and wife team
[11:24.300 --> 11:28.580]  had gone into basically a Christmas party at a health department facility
[11:28.580 --> 11:33.820]  for mentally disabled this guy was you know environmental sciences and force
[11:33.820 --> 11:38.740]  or whatever you know they churn these degrees out and he he gone and got his
[11:38.740 --> 11:44.460]  wife and Saudi Arabia recently come back this Said Farooq and as soon as I
[11:44.460 --> 11:48.220]  Paul Watson called me about four o'clock and he said nobody's reporting this but
[11:48.220 --> 11:55.980]  it's Said Farooq and it looks like a Arabic Slash Islamic name and he was
[11:55.980 --> 11:59.700]  looking him up it looks like he's Islamic and I said of course it probably is
[11:59.700 --> 12:03.820]  just yeah he said can I go with it and I said yeah you know ask the question is
[12:03.820 --> 12:08.020]  it Islamic terror you go to drudgereport.com and see the headline there
[12:08.020 --> 12:15.340]  from the New York Post and it basically says the same thing Muslim killers
[12:15.340 --> 12:23.100]  terror-eyed as couple slaughterers 14 in California you better believe and know
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.300]  that if it was a registered Republican that had done this you'd be hearing white
[12:27.300 --> 12:32.460]  Christian Republican or black Christian Republican did this but
[12:32.460 --> 12:36.740]  statistically you don't see Christian Republicans or libertarians or
[12:36.740 --> 12:40.660]  constitutionalist or veterans engaging in a lot of crime lowest crime rates
[12:40.660 --> 12:46.740]  across the board it's just a FBI statistics fact but that doesn't seem
[12:46.740 --> 12:52.260]  to matter because last night CNN all of them were saying too early to tell can't
[12:52.260 --> 12:56.420]  say is this Islamic can't say it was terror related but today they're being
[12:56.420 --> 13:01.100]  forced to say okay maybe it's terror related or maybe they're mentally ill
[13:01.100 --> 13:04.940]  they tried to spend it too oh part of the health department deals with mental
[13:04.940 --> 13:09.060]  health of course a whole bunch of other departments in it but but but maybe it's
[13:09.060 --> 13:13.340]  mentally ill people and then Democrats came out and did prayer shaming that
[13:13.340 --> 13:21.140]  stories up on info wars.com and said how dare you put out prayers on Twitter for
[13:21.140 --> 13:27.020]  the families do something ban the guns the guns are banned in Syria and that
[13:27.020 --> 13:30.940]  just let Al Qaeda come in and murder everybody because they had guns the
[13:30.940 --> 13:34.900]  guns are pretty much banned in places like Paris and they went and killed an
[13:34.900 --> 13:48.220]  unarmed crowd and now under political correctness they admit that it was known
[13:48.220 --> 13:52.980]  that something was being planned and that nothing was done remember for four
[13:52.980 --> 13:58.580]  years they said until a couple years ago that the Fort Hood shooter Hassan who
[13:58.580 --> 14:06.220]  killed 14 people major Hassan wounded scores of others was not an Islamic
[14:06.220 --> 14:11.260]  terrorist when he was in direct communication with the leaders of
[14:11.260 --> 14:15.260]  Al Qaeda and the CIA wanted it classified but Congress had hearings and
[14:15.260 --> 14:21.780]  admitted it for two years he was protected at that base while communicating
[14:21.780 --> 14:27.700]  with the number two guy in Al Qaeda look it up and then he was allowed to run
[14:27.700 --> 14:31.220]  around and murder whoever he wants there's the headline Pentagon will not
[14:31.220 --> 14:34.660]  label Fort Hood shooting a terror attack and that's exactly what they said
[14:34.660 --> 14:39.940]  about the Army Navy Marine Corps shootups that have happened the military
[14:39.940 --> 14:53.860]  bases that have been attacked you name it truly absolutely over-the-top
[14:54.780 --> 15:00.580]  Soviet level brainwashing in this country I mean it's it's beyond even
[15:00.580 --> 15:08.220]  photo shopping people out of photos things that the Soviets would do with an
[15:08.220 --> 15:17.500]  old-fashioned airbrush now we sit back we look at this there's so many stories
[15:17.500 --> 15:23.660]  within this story they're bringing in record numbers of these people a global
[15:23.660 --> 15:28.980]  Sunni Caliphate Jihad has been declared against Shiites against Christians
[15:28.980 --> 15:34.540]  against Jews against agnostics against animus against Buddhist against Hindus
[15:34.540 --> 15:40.500]  against everybody but the Sunnis now most Sunnis and I've looked at the
[15:40.500 --> 15:44.300]  demographics don't want to be radical and they get in pecked and attacked and
[15:44.300 --> 15:56.380]  and religious police they get gone after by the radical sect at the center of
[15:56.380 --> 16:02.620]  Sunni Islamic religion that is the group that controls and dominates Mecca and
[16:02.620 --> 16:10.060]  that is the literal bandits of the House of Saud who were just a small bandit
[16:10.060 --> 16:16.060]  clan that would rob the caravans and control the entrance into Mecca and
[16:16.060 --> 16:24.540]  Medina and that's all they are and they are the absolute most crazed murderous
[16:24.540 --> 16:30.860]  cult you can imagine and that's who al-Qaeda and al-Nusra and all these
[16:30.860 --> 16:38.140]  people are that's who they are and they're the enemy and you watch it's gonna
[16:38.140 --> 16:42.060]  come out this guy's connected to ISIS it's gonna come out he's a sympathizer
[16:42.060 --> 16:46.660]  it's gonna come out he's a Wahhabist his wife came from Saudi Arabia a few
[16:46.660 --> 16:51.900]  months ago he went over there and got his bride and this country let him bring
[16:51.900 --> 16:56.500]  his bride into this country so they could go into a Christmas party and kill a
[16:56.500 --> 17:05.220]  bunch of liberal Americans see San Bernardino you bet over all of this you
[17:05.220 --> 17:10.220]  were politically correct you you flagellated yourself figuratively with
[17:10.220 --> 17:23.060]  bullwebs and now Saeed Farooq and Tashin Malik had an IED factory in their home
[17:23.060 --> 17:27.780]  we just learned minutes ago as the police finally got into the house and
[17:27.780 --> 17:37.220]  we're able to secure it oh is it terrorism now and you watch they're
[17:37.220 --> 17:41.500]  gonna use these attacks that are already going on to set up armored vehicles
[17:41.500 --> 17:45.180]  checkpoints police states all these systems that they claim are gonna be to
[17:45.180 --> 17:48.460]  protect us and then it's gonna be used against the gun owners the veterans the
[17:48.460 --> 17:53.420]  tea party and the patriots you say well the cops won't do that oh yeah they're
[17:53.420 --> 17:57.540]  gonna be wearing bodycams they're gonna be ordered with earpieces like robots to
[17:57.540 --> 18:01.460]  follow the exact orders of the social engineers and the homeland security
[18:01.460 --> 18:06.260]  leftist back of the threat fusion centers because it's true that the police
[18:06.260 --> 18:10.340]  and military know about this fraud and are upset about it the problem is
[18:10.340 --> 18:15.580]  they're being globalized and federalized where they don't have any capability to
[18:15.580 --> 18:19.540]  make decisions based on the facts they see moment to moment and to have that
[18:19.540 --> 18:23.460]  discretion they're no longer police officers they're now robots they're
[18:23.460 --> 18:27.460]  now biological androids when they follow these orders and that's why they're
[18:27.460 --> 18:31.500]  sending in the thought police and the black lives matter and the George Soros
[18:31.500 --> 18:43.140]  garbage and all the rest of it right now they're doing all of this right now
[18:43.140 --> 18:46.580]  because they're about to overthrow local governments through political
[18:46.580 --> 18:49.780]  correctness and bring their globalization and control in now we do have
[18:49.780 --> 18:53.980]  clips of Donald Trump coming up some of the highlights from the broadcast
[18:53.980 --> 19:04.580]  yesterday and the Donald Trump story is basically the same as this story the
[19:04.580 --> 19:10.500]  mainstream dinosaur media trying to spin that this is an Islamic terror and it
[19:10.500 --> 19:14.380]  being so obvious it's blowing up in their face and Donald Trump coming on
[19:14.380 --> 19:20.500]  and the media not responding to anything he said other than the fact that he said
[19:20.500 --> 19:23.940]  I've got a lot of credibility and a good reputation with people he respects
[19:23.940 --> 19:30.340]  wonder who he's talking about the point is they then misrepresent in all these
[19:30.340 --> 19:36.620]  articles over 2,000 of them look at this family fair it's the perfect example of
[19:36.620 --> 19:40.940]  deception they twist and misrepresent more than 10 things that I supposedly
[19:40.940 --> 19:45.260]  believe they say I believe there was no moon landing everyone knows I to tell
[19:45.260 --> 19:49.180]  that that I believe there was a moon landing and there's also a larger secret
[19:49.180 --> 19:52.900]  space program they admit going on I've been criticized for saying the moon
[19:52.900 --> 19:57.700]  landings I believe were real they don't even show where I said that they just
[19:57.700 --> 20:04.980]  lie that that's what they do earthquake floods winter storms prolonged
[20:04.980 --> 20:09.420]  power outages or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we
[20:09.420 --> 20:13.260]  need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food
[20:13.260 --> 20:16.740]  storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat
[20:16.740 --> 20:21.100]  storage I'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you
[20:21.100 --> 20:25.500]  to consider how will I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood
[20:25.500 --> 20:29.460]  coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you
[20:29.460 --> 20:33.740]  can't take it with you another concern there may come a time when you need to
[20:33.740 --> 20:37.700]  stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you
[20:37.700 --> 20:42.140]  can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think

[22:18.820 --> 22:23.100]  want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years ago I

[23:07.540 --> 23:12.740]  and it involves FEMA I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof
[23:12.740 --> 23:16.540]  revealing their secret could land me in hot water but I think you deserve to know
[23:16.540 --> 23:22.100]  exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at FEMA 3.com before it
[23:22.100 --> 23:26.580]  disappears again but be warned it's really disturbing because the fact is

[23:56.140 --> 23:59.420]  that's FEMA 3.com
[24:09.420 --> 24:16.340]  it seems like yesterday but it was a long ago we're about to enter the 21st
[24:16.340 --> 24:21.980]  year of the Info War
[24:24.980 --> 24:32.700]  deadlines and commitments I want to just say something I want to give thanks I'm
[24:32.700 --> 24:36.500]  thinking about this morning for the providence and the support that God has
[24:36.500 --> 24:41.100]  given Info Wars and I want to thank God for the great crew the great reporters
[24:41.100 --> 24:45.220]  and the people behind the scenes that make this possible and you the viewers
[24:45.220 --> 24:49.340]  and listeners our affiliates the station owners managers our sponsors
[24:49.340 --> 24:53.940]  everybody you have made this operation possible I get so angry fighting the
[24:53.940 --> 24:58.300]  globalist that I kind of overheat sometimes like a football coach that
[24:58.300 --> 25:02.740]  gets mad on the sidelines even when you're winning the game because it just
[25:02.740 --> 25:07.380]  means everything to me but at least we're awake and trying to do something I
[25:07.380 --> 25:11.460]  see other people that think this is all a joke and it makes me think of the
[25:11.460 --> 25:21.940]  passage from the famous song all along the watchtower where Jimi Hendrix says
[25:21.940 --> 25:26.140]  there are many here among us who think that life is but a joke but you and I
[25:26.140 --> 25:32.380]  we've been through that this is not our fate so let us stop talking falsely now
[25:32.380 --> 25:37.460]  because the hour is getting late and that's why Donald Trump came on this
[25:37.460 --> 25:44.860]  show was to be radical was to get in the face of the system was to have them
[25:44.860 --> 25:49.420]  come out and attack him as a 9-11 truth her so he can bring up the 28 pages and
[25:49.420 --> 25:54.700]  the rest of it and they've partially taken the bait but not completely and
[25:54.700 --> 25:58.460]  I've had some behind-the-scenes conversations with some of his campaign
[25:58.460 --> 26:02.780]  people and I've had some short behind-the-scenes conversations with Donald
[26:02.780 --> 26:06.900]  Trump that if the media knew about those they'd really be freaking out and
[26:06.900 --> 26:13.940]  running around screaming so am I 100% sold on Donald Trump no I mean I was 50
[26:13.940 --> 26:19.420]  60% for him you know months ago still ambiguous and but the stuff he's been
[26:19.420 --> 26:23.940]  doing has been so positive just the facts he's bringing up are so
[26:23.940 --> 26:27.980]  insinuated the other side that we have to defend him because the ideas he's
[26:27.980 --> 26:34.220]  putting out in general are very good I like Rand Paul I like Ted Cruz I like
[26:34.220 --> 26:39.900]  Donald Trump and then I watched Donald Trump be misrepresented the media and
[26:39.900 --> 26:42.420]  I'm talking about this later after Joe Biggs leaves us and Paul Watson leaves
[26:42.420 --> 26:46.540]  us I'm gonna have them all on together coming up in the next segment I see what
[26:46.540 --> 26:52.340]  they do to him it's what they do to me I mean they get on the news and say Alex
[26:52.340 --> 26:56.100]  Joe's a 9-11 truth her he believes the New York Police Department blew up the
[26:56.100 --> 27:01.260]  towers that's a quote from Bill O'Reilly and people more than a decade ago no I
[27:01.260 --> 27:04.380]  said Saudi Arabia was involved our government stood down bare minimum the
[27:04.380 --> 27:08.060]  28 pages now show that I talked to top experts involved I interviewed the
[27:08.060 --> 27:10.940]  police officers that were there that talked about the countdown to blow up
[27:10.940 --> 27:16.940]  building 7 we don't know exactly what happened but we're not being given the
[27:16.940 --> 27:21.020]  truth about 9-11 just like we notice Obama is basically running ISIS right
[27:21.020 --> 27:26.020]  now this rabbit hole goes deep people why is the government of Europe and the
[27:26.020 --> 27:29.780]  United States bringing in millions of jihadis that just attacked us again
[27:29.780 --> 27:34.180]  out in California and the media is practicing covering this up and saying
[27:34.180 --> 27:40.700]  turn our guns in they said in literally over a hundred articles that I had time
[27:40.700 --> 27:46.460]  to even glance at it's a talking point that Trump goes on man show who believes
[27:46.460 --> 27:49.460]  moon landing didn't happen whenever they brought up to Al Gore that global
[27:49.460 --> 27:53.420]  warming had stopped ten years ago in Congress he said oh and you believe the
[27:53.420 --> 27:59.220]  moon landings didn't happen that is a default statement now I say the moon
[27:59.220 --> 28:06.420]  landings happened and I detail that and I get criticized by the people on the
[28:06.420 --> 28:09.660]  other side I think they're fake think it's fake if you want I've done the
[28:09.660 --> 28:15.020]  research I know it's real but I certainly don't deserve the media without a
[28:15.020 --> 28:21.340]  link of where I said it saying the moon landings didn't happen but see that's
[28:21.340 --> 28:24.100]  how they deceive their audiences and that's why they're losing credibility
[28:24.100 --> 28:28.180]  Paul we're going to break in a moment but getting back to this Saeed Farooq and
[28:28.180 --> 28:32.060]  his wife from Saudi Arabia man they're really trying to spend this and say it's
[28:32.060 --> 28:36.380]  not Islamic terror but now they found IEDs improvised explosive devices at their
[28:36.380 --> 28:43.700]  house this is I mean can Obama handle this will he be able to spend this well
[28:43.700 --> 28:47.940]  they've basically found a bomb factory in the guy's house of course he had pipe
[28:47.940 --> 28:53.820]  bombs body armor GoPro cameras strapped to his body along with his she had his
[28:53.820 --> 28:59.060]  wife this is totally premeditated total terrorism yeah but Obama is still
[28:59.060 --> 29:02.300]  out saying it could you know it could be workplace grievance they could have had
[29:02.300 --> 29:05.860]  a little argument that just got out of control which ended up in him
[29:05.860 --> 29:11.540]  massacring 14 people wounding you know over a dozen others and even CNN right
[29:11.540 --> 29:15.300]  now is still reporting that law enforcement sources say it could still
[29:15.300 --> 29:19.980]  be a workplace grievance because that's what you do when you have a little tiff
[29:19.980 --> 29:26.420]  a little argument with somebody at work you go back home get bombs and AK-47s
[29:26.420 --> 29:29.580]  and start massacring them I mean that's what any normal person would do right
[29:29.580 --> 29:34.180]  and Paul come back and talk more about this with Joe Biggs from undisclosed
[29:34.180 --> 29:39.180]  location in New York that Homeland Security basically come after him for
[29:39.180 --> 29:44.540]  daring to go show some of the little islamo palaces that are being set up
[29:44.540 --> 29:50.860]  we'll be back stay there Paul Joseph Watson we're on the March the Empire's

[30:08.580 --> 30:13.300]  were husband and wife Saeed Farooq and Tashfeen Malik according to authorities
[30:13.300 --> 30:17.660]  the couple crashed an employee holiday party dressed in assault clothing and
[30:17.660 --> 30:22.060]  working as if they were on a mission according to co-workers Farooq was a
[30:22.060 --> 30:26.860]  devout Muslim who traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned
[30:26.860 --> 30:31.300]  with a wife his wife was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi
[30:31.300 --> 30:36.340]  Arabia before coming to the US on social media accounts Farooq describes
[30:36.340 --> 30:40.740]  himself as a Sunni the council on American Islamic relations immediately
[30:40.740 --> 30:44.620]  went into damage control Muslim leaders asked that people not implicate
[30:44.620 --> 30:49.260]  Islam or Muslims for the mass killings saying the massacre may have been work

[33:29.420 --> 33:34.580]  the former United States Republic now pretty much controlled and occupied by
[33:34.580 --> 33:39.900]  the globalist they're in a mop-up operation federalizing local police
[33:39.900 --> 33:42.940]  and governments right now the feds themselves are run by offshore
[33:42.940 --> 33:46.900]  corporations that are above the law tax exempt Joe Biggs joins us from an
[33:46.900 --> 33:51.820]  undisclosed location here in a moment in upstate New York and we're not being
[33:51.820 --> 33:57.660]  dramatic about this he got a call I got a call by the joint terrorism task force
[33:57.660 --> 34:02.540]  one of the head guys I've got his name right here on my phone wanting to know
[34:02.540 --> 34:09.300]  why they were up at this Islamist center one of the more famous ones and we
[34:09.300 --> 34:12.860]  explained well just like we said on air we're investigating the American
[34:12.860 --> 34:17.180]  Caliphate we're gonna be all over the United States well we wanted to make
[34:17.180 --> 34:24.220]  sure cuz you know after what just happened with this shooting in California
[34:24.220 --> 34:29.300]  that this isn't some type of response up here by you by you and obviously we
[34:29.300 --> 34:32.180]  understand that that's not what you're planning and I just said I'm actually
[34:32.180 --> 34:37.900]  talking to a state police guy senior halfway asking us if we're planning
[34:37.900 --> 34:46.660]  violence it's ridiculous but this is how they turn it around and and and this is
[34:46.660 --> 34:50.900]  the culture that gets pushed now can you imagine if a Christian or a
[34:50.900 --> 34:55.020]  conservative or a libertarian or a veteran had just killed 14 people at a
[34:55.020 --> 34:59.140]  Christmas party in San Bernardino, California they I mean this last guy
[34:59.140 --> 35:04.100]  was a cross-dressing mental patient with sex crime background who was a
[35:04.100 --> 35:09.220]  Democrat it's all come out now but in my the first two days they said he was a
[35:09.220 --> 35:14.420]  Republican and just statistically just like Senator Cruz said a few days ago
[35:14.420 --> 35:18.060]  you can say what you want about conservatives libertarians Republicans
[35:18.060 --> 35:24.460]  veterans they have the lowest crime rate statistically there is its fact black
[35:24.460 --> 35:29.340]  Republicans have the lowest crime rate in a racial spread of blacks white
[35:29.340 --> 35:34.340]  Republicans have the lowest crime rate in a racial spread of whites Asian
[35:34.340 --> 35:37.740]  Republicans have a have the lowest crime rate in a racial spread of Asians
[35:37.740 --> 35:46.020]  Hispanics same deal it is a fact it is a unequivocal fact by giant margins and
[35:46.020 --> 35:50.460]  you people try to continue to act like veterans gun owners conservatives
[35:50.460 --> 35:55.140]  Christians libertarians constitutionalist red-blooded Americans are the
[35:55.140 --> 35:59.460]  problem and we're terrorists and we're gonna kill everybody and all you got to
[35:59.460 --> 36:03.860]  point to is Oklahoma City that was as funny as the $3 bill that's one thing
[36:03.860 --> 36:08.860]  Vanity Fair CNN and literally 2000 plus publications got right was when they
[36:08.860 --> 36:14.700]  said an Oklahoma City truth or Donald Trump comes on Oklahoma City truth or
[36:14.700 --> 36:19.420]  show yeah you're right I've interviewed the police officers the witnesses the
[36:19.420 --> 36:23.180]  general that exposed it all I've got the hotel receipts world that daily got
[36:23.180 --> 36:27.100]  them LA Times interviewed the FBI agents that blew the whistle about all the
[36:27.100 --> 36:33.700]  other guys that were with McVay but they were federal agents folks CIA FBI ATF
[36:33.700 --> 36:40.220]  and German intelligence and the FBI guys came out and we're in the LA Times
[36:40.220 --> 36:45.380]  talking about this I mean I've just done my research but they know the public
[36:45.380 --> 36:50.860]  status they go there were no Muslims celebrating Donald Trump is a liar that
[36:50.860 --> 36:56.940]  they're even saying now at two different soccer games that no one yelled
[36:56.940 --> 37:00.740]  a la Akbar as an insult during the minute of silence for the French attacks
[37:00.740 --> 37:07.100]  and of course it was and met so we're gonna now go to Joe Biggs and Paul
[37:07.100 --> 37:10.860]  Joseph Watson's gonna be coming back with us some as well Joe is in the snow
[37:10.860 --> 37:13.980]  out there right now we'll be coming back to Paul Watson in a moment and we're
[37:13.980 --> 37:18.340]  in undisclosed location because we've got Homeland Security the state police
[37:18.340 --> 37:22.260]  and we've got these different training centers we don't want folks know where
[37:22.260 --> 37:25.940]  we're at where we're gonna be going next Joe big tell folks about the last 48
[37:25.940 --> 37:29.380]  hours what you've witnessed what's happened as you stand out in a field in
[37:29.380 --> 37:35.020]  the snow well it's interesting I mean they keep the government knows that
[37:35.020 --> 37:38.420]  there's these sleeper cells all over the country and yet they can never find
[37:38.420 --> 37:44.460]  them until after an attack happened yet Josh and I go to Islamberg I give my
[37:44.460 --> 37:49.060]  name only a number at the gate so I can be reached and contacted by their you
[37:49.060 --> 37:55.300]  know PR guy and you've got this terrorism task force guy calling me then
[37:55.300 --> 37:58.260]  you've got him calling Josh how did you even know Josh was there I've never
[37:58.260 --> 38:03.260]  even mentioned his name on this trip and the the state police guy with the
[38:03.260 --> 38:06.380]  terrorism task force goes hey don't worry about it we have this kind of
[38:06.380 --> 38:09.820]  technology I can't tell you what it is but we know everything you're doing so
[38:09.820 --> 38:13.260]  you're meaning to tell me that you can't find these people before they do this
[38:13.260 --> 38:17.180]  stuff which shows me that you're allowing it to happen you know the attack
[38:17.180 --> 38:20.940]  yesterday in San Bernardino they're saying that there was a spur of the
[38:20.940 --> 38:25.620]  moment thing because they've a disputed a party I'm sorry you don't have pipe
[38:25.620 --> 38:30.580]  bombs and all these guns with a dispute at a party that's completely and totally
[38:30.580 --> 38:34.620]  you've got blown up twice in armored vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan was
[38:34.620 --> 38:37.700]  that about disputes at parties when they were firing RPGs at you?
[38:37.700 --> 38:44.460]  Negative oh I mean that that that's that is a premeditated thing you know and the
[38:44.460 --> 38:48.020]  fact that the mainstream media is coming out and using this new term assault
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.300]  clothing what is assault clothing Alex I've never heard of that in my entire
[38:52.300 --> 38:56.900]  life he was just into assault clothing nothing was planned how are they
[38:56.900 --> 39:00.580]  gonna cover up when they've covered up the Marine Corps centers attacks the
[39:00.580 --> 39:04.060]  the Fort Hood attacks said that wasn't terrorism how many more of our own
[39:04.060 --> 39:08.020]  parishes are we gonna have that they're gonna cover up I mean the interesting
[39:08.020 --> 39:12.860]  thing about yesterday is that social media knew the name of this guy say
[39:12.860 --> 39:16.380]  heed for oak the whole day everyone knew that this is who the guy it was
[39:16.380 --> 39:21.340]  mainstream media didn't even release it last night until about 11 30 p.m. our time
[39:21.340 --> 39:26.860]  over here because the whole time they were scared to say the name because they
[39:26.860 --> 39:30.460]  thought it would offend somebody and immediately after releasing this guy's
[39:30.460 --> 39:34.500]  name then they bring in this whole Muslim group to speak on Fox and CNN and
[39:34.500 --> 39:38.260]  you know they condemn everything blah blah blah but I guarantee you if that was
[39:38.260 --> 39:41.620]  a white guy they would have been all over that that would have been terrorism
[39:41.620 --> 39:45.220]  from the get-go and they would have started condemning white people and
[39:45.220 --> 39:48.940]  saying that Christians are out to kill everybody and we're the actual radicals
[39:48.940 --> 39:53.700]  we got to take the guns away I mean we talk about the government taking the
[39:53.700 --> 39:57.380]  guns away but they were in full force last night Alex I was watching between
[39:57.380 --> 40:03.020]  CNN and Fox and MSNBC in my hotel room I heard each single channel say that we
[40:03.020 --> 40:07.060]  should take guns away from law-abiding citizens and then we should destroy all
[40:07.060 --> 40:11.260]  the guns and try to start over again that's what's happening right now when
[40:11.260 --> 40:14.940]  you have politicians like Hillary Clinton coming out and immediately within
[40:14.940 --> 40:19.140]  minutes using it to push this anti-gun agenda you know that there's something
[40:19.140 --> 40:23.300]  going on and especially at the Inland Regional Center there has been active
[40:23.300 --> 40:28.180]  shooter drills there for the past few months the nurse that was inside there
[40:28.180 --> 40:32.140]  was filming going oh my god texting her husband at the same time hey another
[40:32.140 --> 40:35.540]  drill just started you know and then 10 minutes into texting she's telling her
[40:35.540 --> 40:38.940]  husband oh I think this is real now but if you go back and look they said that
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.140]  14 people died in those active shooter drills 14 people died apparently in this
[40:43.140 --> 40:47.700]  real incident so there's something fishy going on this is one of those that has
[40:47.700 --> 40:53.060]  false flag written all over it without a doubt yeah I'm here to tell you and my
[40:53.060 --> 40:55.900]  false flag that means they could have known he was gonna do it and let him do
[40:55.900 --> 40:59.100]  it and then they cover up that it's Islamic turn it around and blame the
[40:59.100 --> 41:03.300]  Second Amendment in George Washington instead of the very people that are
[41:03.300 --> 41:08.780]  doing this mentally ill cross-dresser liberals and crazy jihadis I mean these
[41:08.780 --> 41:12.820]  are the constituents up the SWAT team was already geared up in there within
[41:12.820 --> 41:19.260]  seconds they were geared up and ready in within seconds they knew that this was
[41:19.260 --> 41:23.980]  going to happen well notice it's a Democrat controlled state and they want
[41:23.980 --> 41:26.940]  to be the second amendment Hillary Clinton's already coming out saying we
[41:26.940 --> 41:30.140]  need more gun control I guess she doesn't know much about the state of
[41:30.140 --> 41:33.660]  California but it has some of the strictest gun control laws there is in
[41:33.660 --> 41:37.780]  the country I mean look at the regulations on these long guns assault
[41:37.780 --> 41:42.260]  rifles that they keep talking about the weapons they found on the the suspects
[41:42.260 --> 41:49.380]  were police weapons police handguns Wow I didn't know that I knew that they were
[41:49.380 --> 41:53.940]  military style you're saying these are guns they got the handguns that they use
[41:53.940 --> 41:57.780]  they said they were the M&P or the Smith and Wesson handguns police issue and
[41:57.780 --> 42:01.380]  these guys have ski masks rolling around that's what they were using oh my gosh
[42:01.380 --> 42:06.020]  you mean they had police-issued guns whoa that they're even reporting that I
[42:06.020 --> 42:10.380]  think it was on NBC that I saw it earlier that is insane what was the
[42:10.380 --> 42:12.980]  headline on that I'm gonna pull that up now Joe I want you to continue with your
[42:12.980 --> 42:16.740]  analysis also shoot some live feed reports if you'd like from full wars.com
[42:16.740 --> 42:20.140]  but I'm gonna go back to Paul Watson here in a moment but obviously you're
[42:20.140 --> 42:23.420]  gonna be traveling around the country to different sites that are known to have
[42:23.420 --> 42:27.620]  training going on some of the paramilitary religious indoctrination you
[42:27.620 --> 42:30.460]  name it you describe pulling up you've got footage it'll be out soon from your
[42:30.460 --> 42:34.540]  hidden camera to a guard shack a car blocking the road and then these are the
[42:34.540 --> 42:38.100]  folks that call the state police on you with Homeland Security who were then
[42:38.100 --> 42:41.380]  tracking everything you did did you say anything threatening to these people oh
[42:41.380 --> 42:45.940]  negative at all I was a very nice I came over and shook their hand told them
[42:45.940 --> 42:49.580]  what I was there for and as I approached the gate the guy stepped out of the car
[42:49.580 --> 42:54.060]  you know I talked to him I gave him my name and number and then one vehicle
[42:54.060 --> 42:58.020]  pulled up two guys got out one would start a walking around me a guy was
[42:58.020 --> 43:01.140]  questioning me and then another vehicle came up and they got out and started
[43:01.140 --> 43:05.700]  looking at me so they were definitely you know out there on height and alert you
[43:05.700 --> 43:09.180]  know there've been reports that they carry a lot of guns around there so I
[43:09.180 --> 43:12.060]  didn't personally see any guns on anybody but who's to say what was inside
[43:12.060 --> 43:14.980]  those vehicles well you know it's okay for them to have guns we're gonna have
[43:14.980 --> 43:18.420]  ours that's how this isn't gonna be where the left just takes our guns that
[43:18.420 --> 43:22.540]  lets their giotties have them and and people say oh the state police got your
[43:22.540 --> 43:25.460]  number from you know that was the thing well he must have written big sis
[43:25.460 --> 43:28.940]  number down because the number didn't work so we used our system to get their
[43:28.940 --> 43:33.140]  numbers and it's like yes we know there's a whole NSA tracking grid sting
[43:33.140 --> 43:37.340]  ray systems integrated systems where you get all of our data and the point is
[43:37.340 --> 43:41.780]  none of it keeps us safe a plane flew in from California last week with a
[43:41.780 --> 43:46.500]  hundred and forty plus illegals on it into JFK and they just didn't even check
[43:46.500 --> 43:51.380]  their passports and just let them go this is a total fraud this is a setup to
[43:51.380 --> 43:55.180]  allow this to happen and then go after our guns what else can you report to
[43:55.180 --> 43:59.500]  folks job X I mean obviously the TSA hasn't stopped anything they've had
[43:59.500 --> 44:02.620]  these recent polls coming out where they there's more weapons there's more
[44:02.620 --> 44:07.300]  ammunition to get through now for the TSA there than ever before so this is all
[44:07.300 --> 44:11.420]  complete and total BS it's all fear mongering it's all to get you to take
[44:11.420 --> 44:16.060]  your liveries away while installing this fear in this police state to track
[44:16.060 --> 44:19.140]  your every single movement that's why they want the driverless cars so they
[44:19.140 --> 44:22.980]  can watch you everywhere you go you know people think this the stingray
[44:22.980 --> 44:26.940]  technologies you know or a bunch of you know crazy loony stuff no I'm telling
[44:26.940 --> 44:30.220]  you when you're sitting there driving around and two of the guys that are
[44:30.220 --> 44:33.820]  with you you know people are calling them and how do they know that they're
[44:33.820 --> 44:38.060]  even here with me so there's definitely a lot of stuff going on the spying is in
[44:38.060 --> 44:42.300]  full effect they look at us as the number one threat they look at these
[44:42.300 --> 44:46.260]  Syrian refugees these people coming over from the other countries is fine but
[44:46.260 --> 44:50.620]  it's us it's me and you the Patriot the American we're the ones who are the
[44:50.620 --> 44:56.260]  terrorists they hate us yeah and that is the people on top calling the shots I
[44:56.260 --> 45:00.300]  don't think the state police guy hates us he seemed pretty nice and somewhat
[45:00.300 --> 45:04.260]  apologetic but still it doesn't matter it's still going on I mean they all know
[45:04.260 --> 45:08.580]  who we are they know we're not gonna attack anybody it's ridiculous yeah
[45:08.580 --> 45:12.660]  we're just here to expose what's going on a report on the facts something that
[45:12.660 --> 45:17.180]  the mainstream media is lacking in well believe in the police have their hands
[45:17.180 --> 45:20.780]  tied and they're sick of it as well it's that's why people are waking up so fast
[45:20.780 --> 45:24.300]  inside the system because this is just getting crazy okay Joe we're gonna
[45:24.300 --> 45:27.740]  probably pop in with you again in the fourth hour today of overdrive I know
[45:27.740 --> 45:30.340]  you're found a lot of reports for the nightly news seven o'clock central and
[45:30.340 --> 45:33.940]  I know you've got some of that footage we're about to put out and more you're
[45:33.940 --> 45:37.740]  moving on to your next site so we won't put on any info on that until you've
[45:37.740 --> 45:42.220]  been there and gotten some reconnaissance legally and lawfully in the
[45:42.220 --> 45:47.060]  area I know you're also going to be deploying some other legal and lawful
[45:47.060 --> 45:51.020]  systems to detail and documents of Godspeed we'll be praying for you and
[45:51.020 --> 45:55.820]  Josh and mr. Zimmerman thank you all right there goes Joe Biggs from upstate
[45:55.820 --> 46:01.220]  New York standing in the snow let's go now to Paul Watson Paul you got on a
[46:01.220 --> 46:05.460]  few minutes before we went to break go ahead and expand on the situation it
[46:05.460 --> 46:09.380]  really is crazy when you're informed and even halfway paying attention to watch
[46:09.380 --> 46:14.940]  jihad well hobbyist attacks happening all over the world whether it's Molly or
[46:14.940 --> 46:21.140]  Kenya or whether it's areas of Syria or whether it's areas of the Middle East or
[46:21.140 --> 46:26.100]  or Russia or the United States and to have the media say it's not Islamic and
[46:26.100 --> 46:33.580]  then to blame American gun owners Paul it reminds me of Obama grandstanding with
[46:33.580 --> 46:36.900]  Halan two days ago saying we're gonna pass climate change global government
[46:36.900 --> 46:40.860]  to stand up to the jihadis when they're the ones that brought the jihadis in I
[46:40.860 --> 46:43.980]  mean are people gonna make this connection or will the mainstream media
[46:43.980 --> 46:50.340]  succeed in covering the shop well it's it's the narrative is collapsing because
[46:50.340 --> 46:53.820]  now it's emerged that this guy was radicalized we know he just recently
[46:53.820 --> 47:00.300]  returned from Saudi Arabia but still NBC is reporting that he might have been
[47:00.300 --> 47:05.860]  triggered by the Christmas party that he attended before this I said did I call
[47:05.860 --> 47:09.820]  you this morning at 9 30 and I said put out an article saying I bet he got
[47:09.820 --> 47:13.020]  triggered by a Christmas tree not seriously but knowing that's what they
[47:13.020 --> 47:16.180]  do see more than the people deserve that because the Christmas tree I'm sorry
[47:16.180 --> 47:22.260]  well yeah I mean if he was offended then obviously the victims are to blame for
[47:22.260 --> 47:25.860]  provoking him right that was the argument after Charlie Hebdo those
[47:25.860 --> 47:29.780]  cartoonists deserve to get massacred because they were provoking the precious
[47:29.780 --> 47:34.180]  muslims so again the whole narrative as soon as this came out there was a
[47:34.180 --> 47:38.540]  report that it was three white guys completely unconfirmed when for hours on
[47:38.540 --> 47:42.140]  the police scanner which I was listening to they kept saying over and over again
[47:42.140 --> 47:47.460]  Said Farooq Middle Eastern man Middle Eastern woman long beard that was on the
[47:47.460 --> 47:52.180]  police scanner for hours and for hours the left and I'm not just talking about
[47:52.180 --> 47:57.220]  people on Twitter with three followers I'm talking about the more cost out of
[47:57.220 --> 48:02.540]  the Daily Coast you know the former CIA staffer these big left-wing people
[48:02.540 --> 48:06.700]  Hillary Clinton came out within minutes blamed it on the Second Amendment came
[48:06.700 --> 48:10.940]  out immediately and blamed it on all white people and I've compiled some of
[48:10.940 --> 48:15.940]  these tweets in my video which is just go up on info wars.com so for hours they
[48:15.940 --> 48:20.500]  were saying white terrorism this is white terrorism why doesn't media say it's
[48:20.500 --> 48:24.820]  white terrorism then as soon as it emerges that it's a muslim and his
[48:24.820 --> 48:29.020]  jihadist wife you know obviously workplace violence nothing to see here
[48:29.020 --> 48:35.140]  let's all the trees are evil though yeah so now that I mean they're saying about
[48:35.140 --> 48:40.300]  what freaks these people are at CNN ABC news MSNBC can you imagine getting up
[48:40.300 --> 48:43.980]  in the morning and looking in the mirror and being just such nibbling evil
[48:43.980 --> 48:47.860]  twisting fraudsters I mean Paul have you seen this is a separate issue of
[48:47.860 --> 48:53.460]  deception these articles from Vanity Fair to CNN's top stories where they just
[48:53.460 --> 48:58.140]  misrepresent and twist everything I stand for and then say that Donald Trump
[48:58.140 --> 49:02.100]  now supports all that I mean you talk about deception these people really are
[49:02.100 --> 49:07.740]  criminals yeah there were articles actually trying to link you and Donald
[49:07.740 --> 49:11.940]  Trump with the San Bernardino shooting in the hours after I didn't know that I
[49:11.940 --> 49:16.420]  didn't know that oh okay this is like Trump appears on the Alex Jones show
[49:16.420 --> 49:20.820]  right before the San Bernardino shooting like how is that connected in any way
[49:20.820 --> 49:24.540]  like you're responsible for it because you had Trump on your radio show
[49:24.540 --> 49:29.260]  completely ludicrous and then all these tweets which are in this video so when
[49:29.260 --> 49:33.220]  are we going to start classifying white men as terrorists maybe we should put
[49:33.220 --> 49:36.980]  white conservative men in concentration camps we can eliminate mass
[49:36.980 --> 49:41.580]  shootings by making it illegal for white men ages 15 to 65 to own guns there
[49:41.580 --> 49:47.220]  was a deluge of these tweets and posts Alan Combs said it was a shooting that
[49:47.220 --> 49:52.100]  probably was targeted against Planned Parenthood which was two miles away this
[49:52.100 --> 49:56.420]  was in the media aftermath of when this shooting first was reported on the media
[49:56.420 --> 50:00.620]  and of course when it came out when their narrative completely collapsed they
[50:00.620 --> 50:05.180]  all stopped talking about it and moved on to whatever else and now if you look
[50:05.180 --> 50:08.660]  for example at salon.com's front page you have to scroll right down to the
[50:08.660 --> 50:13.340]  bottom to even find a mention of this shooting so again they tried to exploit
[50:13.340 --> 50:16.820]  it to demonize conservatives to demonize the second and when they can't they
[50:16.820 --> 50:20.420]  just deep six it like Major Assan the Marine Corps recruiting centers and
[50:20.420 --> 50:24.580]  all the other attacks yeah and it was like after the Paris massacre don't blame
[50:24.580 --> 50:29.300]  it on Muslims fine fair enough but you have to analyze the religion of Islam
[50:29.300 --> 50:32.500]  because it's violent and intolerant and that is what motivates some of these
[50:32.500 --> 50:37.100]  people so don't blame everything on gun owners analyze the motives of the
[50:37.100 --> 50:40.660]  individual and where their beliefs come from and stop trying to have tolerant
[50:40.660 --> 50:43.900]  Western men sit down when they urinate that's a feminist thing where they make
[50:43.900 --> 50:47.740]  you know young boys do that to dominate them as part of sexual harassment by the
[50:47.740 --> 50:52.460]  bizarre CIA-run feminist cult of Gloria Steinem you know we want women to be free

[54:13.060 --> 54:19.860]  here's Obama's statement on the Jihad attack we don't know that much yet it's
[54:19.860 --> 54:24.140]  still an active situation FBI is on the ground offering assistance to local
[54:24.140 --> 54:28.380]  officials as they need it it does appear that they're going to be some
[54:28.380 --> 54:33.820]  casualties of your Jihadies you know obviously our hearts go out to the
[54:33.820 --> 54:40.020]  victims and the families of course the one thing we do know is that we have a
[54:40.020 --> 54:45.820]  pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere
[54:45.820 --> 54:50.860]  else in the world and there are some steps we could take not to eliminate
[54:50.860 --> 54:56.420]  every one of these mass shootings but to improve the odds that they don't
[54:56.420 --> 55:02.860]  happen as frequently common sense gun safety laws stronger background checks
[55:02.860 --> 55:09.500]  you know and you know for those who are concerned about terrorism you know some
[55:09.500 --> 55:15.500]  may be aware of the fact that we have a no-fly list where people can't get on
[55:15.500 --> 55:20.100]  planes but those same people who we don't allow to fly could well go into a
[55:20.100 --> 55:25.940]  store right now in the United States and buy a firearm and that is directly
[55:25.940 --> 55:31.140]  from Rahm Emanuel when he was the White House Chief of Staff saying we need a
[55:31.140 --> 55:35.580]  no-gun buy list folks they got millions innocent people on those lists it's no
[55:35.580 --> 55:38.540]  judge no jury they let the jihadies fly back and forth they let folks with no
[55:38.540 --> 55:42.540]  passports come in but he goes hey we don't have anything to surveil anybody
[55:42.540 --> 55:46.260]  we don't have any technology we can just track the info wars reporters
[55:46.260 --> 55:51.340]  everywhere they go and know who's there and call their cell phones up but we
[55:51.340 --> 55:57.940]  have no idea about any of this we gee we don't understand what's happening then
[55:57.940 --> 56:04.740]  he goes on to say it's unparalleled in human experience this you funded jihadies
[56:04.740 --> 56:08.740]  that have killed 300,000 people or more in Syria over the last four and a half
[56:08.740 --> 56:13.500]  years Obama these very people run around and murder folks men women and
[56:13.500 --> 56:17.700]  children what we have is a media that hypes up mass shootings to an
[56:17.700 --> 56:21.900]  unparalleled level we're 330 million people you got some crazy cross dresser
[56:21.900 --> 56:26.260]  on a bunch of drugs goes and shoot some Planned Parenthood people some cops one
[56:26.260 --> 56:29.380]  of your people as usual one of your mentally ill scumbags and then now
[56:29.380 --> 56:32.980]  you've got this guy from Saudi Arabia with his new bride only be in there a
[56:32.980 --> 56:37.260]  few months running around with bomb factories and you're blaming Americans
[56:37.260 --> 56:44.380]  for it and I'm telling you it's you know if they could uptick this right now
[56:44.380 --> 56:47.500]  mass shootings are flat it's a very low probability of death in this country
[56:47.500 --> 56:51.980]  let me say they hype enough of this and just all these weird drug doubt socialist
[56:51.980 --> 56:55.420]  zombies that it'll be their duty to go get a gun because they're so anti gun
[56:55.420 --> 57:00.180]  and start shooting people in just a big false flag fit to blame the second
[57:00.180 --> 57:03.500]  amendment because they hate us and they want to dominate us because we're the
[57:03.500 --> 57:06.220]  producers we're gonna go to break come back with five more minutes with Paul

[57:29.980 --> 57:33.580]  it's a trigger for the jihadis and their bomb factories that they see an evil

[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.780]  that's right
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:01:03.620]  this republic is under serious attack ever wanted to see how America and the
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:08.300]  West itself would fall how would be deliberately crashed into the ashes of
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.980]  history you now have front row seats most dangerous place to be though is in
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.460]  the bleachers the only chance we've got is getting on the field Paul I know
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.340]  you're churning out reports analysis you name it you were reporting on the
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:27.380]  afternoon the guy's name Michael Savage was reporting in at world net daily on
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.700]  his show hours before I want to get Michael Savage on to get his take on
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.460]  this the attack is happening they want to use the attacks with one hand to take
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.780]  our freedoms and take our guns but on the other side bring in the jihadis I
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.060]  mean this is just too rich that you know he just went and got his bride Saudi
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:46.780]  Arabia and came back and the clerics have called for a jihad on America it's
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:51.220]  happening it's happening in Europe and it is a real radical attack but it is a
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.740]  false flag in that evidence is emerging they brought these people in they knew
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.780]  what they were gonna do they're allowing them to attack us so somehow we've got
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.260]  to explain that not to our listeners but to the rest of the population that look
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.740]  a false flag doesn't just mean the government did it all but if the
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:10.940]  government brings them in then that's still a false flag right Paul well you
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.220]  remember Obama said why is everyone worried about Syrian orphans and mothers
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:21.900]  this accomplice in this attack this woman went and dumped her what six months
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.380]  old baby on a grandma before she went on this rampage so it's not whether their
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:30.020]  mothers or what a lot of these Islamic terrorists are women they're called black
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:33.940]  widows it's a known phenomenon Obama just said I mean look in Israel all the
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:39.980]  stabbings Obama just said a couple days ago again ISIS no threat in America yeah
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.060]  and the other thing is political correctness remember the Bryce William
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:49.100]  shooting of the TV reporters on air that was motivated by him alleging they made
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:54.060]  you know racist comments towards him now we have in this case the neighbors of
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:59.140]  this shooter Farouk who said they didn't report into authorities because they were
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:03.060]  afraid they'd be called racist because it was racial profiling even though they
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.820]  were seeing these packaged deliveries over and over again these odd
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:11.420]  deliveries other neighbors reported three to four Middle Easters Middle Easterners
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.020]  recently moved into the area CVS reported more neighbors who said they
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.380]  didn't say anything because they didn't want to racially profile these people so
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:25.380]  again the concerns of political correctness have been put above genuine
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:30.740]  rational security concerns and it's wound up with 14 people dead just as it
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.140]  did with the Bryce William situation start being jihad attacks in the West
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.660]  every week Paul I've been saying this for months it's happening there I think
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.820]  they've jumped the shark I think they've gone too far doubling down and saying
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:48.140]  there's no such thing as Islamic terror they're not going to get away with this
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:53.060]  well obviously it can be defeated by waffling on about climate change in
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.980]  front of the UN your president is actually now saying that on a weekly
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.460]  basis that's how ludicrous it's become then the other thing was Trump and these
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:05.660]  other Republicans Ted Cruz tweeted out you know all our prayers are with the
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:09.660]  victims of the San Bernardino attack and then the left and the media and the
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.180]  New York Daily News said prayer for the victims is not going to fix this only
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.500]  complete gun control is going to fix this so they actually basically cracked
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:22.060]  upon everyone who just said this is really terrible I'm praying for the
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:26.620]  victims to push their gun control agenda as soon as it came out wasn't a white

[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.860]  really embarrassing for the left and it proves they will exploit feverishly
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.420]  anything before the bodies are called to push this radical gun control because
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:44.340]  they have this irrational hatred of freedom and irrational hatred of the
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.460]  Republic and the irrational hatred of the family they really are a sick cult of
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:54.540]  scum who want total global power and wanted carbon taxes Paul continue the

[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.580]  boss and presidential candidate John McAfee recently warned about a doomsday
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:19.100]  electronic weapon that could wipe out 90% of Americans within two years of the
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:23.380]  attack and he urged politicians that this is the number one threat facing the
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.700]  country weapons that wipe out enemy electronics are a staple of science
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:32.700]  fiction films McAfee claims the country and its leaders are unprepared for EMP
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.300]  weapons and warned that gun crime should not be the single issue that decides
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.820]  votes recently president Obama declared voting against those politicians who are
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:45.660]  on the wrong side of the gun control issue McAfee says this is confusing
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:51.660]  because the possibility of 90% death for citizens of the US far outweighs gun
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.500]  violence which causes fewer deaths per year than traffic accidents Leanne

[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:15.780]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:24.780]  now into the second hour until about 40 after so we've got a really amazing
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.180]  guest extremely informative and also in this day and age there's a lot of
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:32.940]  courage to engage in the First Amendment John Coleman meteorologist the
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.300]  original national weatherman on Good Morning America the founder of the
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.340]  weather channel we're talking to him in a moment but obviously everybody's
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:47.500]  focused on the dead the 14 dead in San Bernardino and just minutes ago during
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.420]  the break I was watching CNN and their supposed coverage of a live press
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.140]  conference of the FBI and others and they're getting up there saying too early
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:09:01.100]  to say it's terrorism don't say it's terror okay they the police now say
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:07.020]  they had a bomb factory at their house basically suicide vest tactical gear go
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:12.140]  pros to videotape the killing that jihadis do you know they said for four
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:16.780]  years the Fort Hood shooter Major Hassan was not jihad of course he talked to the
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:20.180]  head of al-qaeda said he was gonna do it it was a jihad and they've now admitted
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.820]  that the attack on the Marine Corps recruiting center and those killed they
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.860]  said oh no this isn't Islamic terror of course it was they couldn't say that
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:34.420]  about Paris though they tried or Charlie Hebdo of the rest of it so this is
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.140]  happening this guy had brought his bride into the country NBC News is saying
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.500]  maybe maybe he was triggered by the Christmas party in a Christmas tree we
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.460]  even have a clip of that coming up after our guest leaves us but this is sick
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:55.380]  folks this is getting sicker and sicker and sicker by the minute that when we
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.460]  get attacked by these folks there's such political correctness that even
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.940]  neighbors have admitted well we didn't want to report because they were
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.860]  Islamic that we saw suspicious things going on well they've now been killed
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:11.340]  in a hail of gunfire with the police obviously in a chase yesterday and the
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.060]  answer by the control left is we the people should turn our guns in so we
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:19.780]  can be safe from the jihadis that they're now reporting somehow got police
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:27.700]  issued weapons so to get this straight for the mainstream media I'm not saying
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.620]  the government did this and it's a false flag I'm saying the Obama
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:35.580]  administration letting this guy come in with his radicalized wife protecting
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.780]  people Holland opening the French borders all of this they are directly
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.940]  connected to allowing this to happen and are aiding and abetting it we now have
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.980]  the Detroit police chief coming out today and saying armed citizens deter
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.020]  terrorist attacks in Detroit police chief says and the head of Interpol said
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:57.060]  where they have gun control in Kenya he said we should arm the Kenyans that's
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:02.460]  how we answer these terrorist attacks against jihadis now shifting gears to
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:08.100]  John Coleman founder of the weather channel on cable television Coleman was
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.060]  also the original weather caster on the ABC network morning program good morning
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:16.180]  America for many years he was a full professional member of the American
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.540]  Meteorological Society is meteorologist obviously and was once honored as
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.300]  broadcast meteorologist the year Coleman I had a 61 year career in television
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:30.460]  extending from the campaign of from Champaign Illinois to Milwaukee Chicago
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.740]  New York City and Coleman has become very active in his efforts to counter the
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:39.900]  global warming climate change frenzy his studies of the climate data convinced
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.460]  him that there is no significant man-made global warming and his beloved
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.620]  science meteorology has been hijacked by a cadre of politicians environmentalist
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:51.980]  and the scientists who they generously fund to provide scientific papers
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.580]  supporting their failed theory and boy has that really been proven true now
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.340]  with hide the decline climate gate it's about a global tax and as Vladimir
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.500]  Putin said it's about shutting down industrial nations and letting other
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.820]  nations operate China can operate India can operate but we can't John Coleman
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:15.420]  blog.com is his website sir thank you so much for coming on with us and your
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:19.420]  your tireless work you know now they call for arresting people in Europe who
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:24.140]  question man-made climate change just now climate change not warming and they're
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.620]  even talking about it in America going after people for their speech they're
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:34.060]  doing an investigation as you know I would imagine in New York State of this
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:38.820]  Alex a great risk I have my Christmas tree up in my living room here in San
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:45.420]  Diego just a hundred miles from San Bernardino history and is it gonna
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:51.940]  stimulate someone to attack me I think not because for the most part we're
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:57.900]  peaceful but you're right we certainly have some strange and awful people among
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:03.180]  us and those events such as happening in San Bernardino touch our hearts believe
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:10.380]  me and keep us alert because we know that any day something can happen absolutely
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:14.460]  it is a sick testament you have to you know we make a comment about having a
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:21.100]  defensive evil beautiful Christmas tree in fact I want to say nice my wife and
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.580]  I decorated that yesterday and enjoyed it a lot but she made me turn off the
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.540]  San Bernardino February so we're decorating and I think she was right
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:36.220]  about that enjoy Christmas is but she can now while I'm enjoying Christmas over
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:42.740]  in Paris they are a hundred and eighty five nations can you imagine forty
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:49.940]  thousand people gathered all over bad science a totally false premise and it
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:55.340]  just drives me nutty I want to show you the man who passed away about five days
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:00.500]  ago Maurice strong Maurice is the man behind this you ever heard of him Alex
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.780]  I have but a lot of folks have it tell us all about him well Maurice was a son
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:11.540]  of an oil baron in Canada interestingly enough but the other side of him was he
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:16.140]  was a one-world Chinese guy he joined the United Nations as an undersecretary
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.980]  and he wanted us to have a one-world government and when he saw how Al Gore
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:27.500]  was succeeding with climate change then global warming in the United States he
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:34.220]  snapped onto that and he threw the first international Earth Day in Stockholm
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:41.180]  back in 72 and out of that was able to grow the United Nations intergovernmental
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:46.660]  panel on climate change so that big meeting in Paris are we strong started
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:54.740]  he was the man he made it happen and he was his and if you look at interviews
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.900]  with him he said that he was looking for a way to create one-world government
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:06.420]  that was his plan and by using global warming he was going to tax the rich
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:11.740]  nations of the world to pay the poor nations of the world and create this
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:19.020]  one equal nation of the world that were a global government so Maurice strong this
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:24.820]  was his life's work well he passed away four days before this giant the event
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.340]  began in Paris but he had already been retired because he got caught with his
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:36.580]  hands in the cookie jar during the oil for food thing following the war in
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:41.700]  Afghanistan when he suddenly a check for about nine hundred thousand dollars to him
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:49.660]  the UN showed up and he said oh yeah and retired to Shanghai or Beijing I've seen
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:55.860]  both and that's where he passed away in the last few days so he created this
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.860]  great United Nations global warming frenzy and now we have a hundred and
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:07.220]  eighty-five nations of negotiating and negotiations as usual have run into a
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:14.620]  snag because the rich nations who have to pour the pay the poor nations are
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:18.540]  holding back a little and the port and what's the money from the poor nations
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:23.660]  the poor nations you give us the money guys so we'll see how this whole thing
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:31.380]  comes out in Paris in any case it's all because of so-called global warming well
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:36.260]  as you know there hasn't been any global warming of any significance in almost
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:42.500]  20 years so there are young people now 19 years old married having children maybe
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:48.900]  in the military college graduates 19 years old and during their lifetimes the
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:55.020]  earth is not really warm that is an amazing amazing thing there's there's
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:00.180]  little ups and downs in that chart see him there of that warming but that
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:06.220]  warming is is that those are those ups and downs are a tenth of a degree that's
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:12.060]  not degrees that's even hundreds of a degree so now we have such political
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:17.300]  silliness that if the temperature peaks up just a little bit right let's say
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.340]  two hundredths of a degree suddenly they start screaming that is the warmest it
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:28.740]  ever was well that's sheer and total nonsense first of all think about when
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:34.420]  I was a kid I'm 81 years old when I was a kid a thermometer was a little stick
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:39.460]  of wood with a little tube of mercury attached to it and the best you could
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:44.900]  possibly read the temperature was within one or two degrees I mean its
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:51.180]  accuracy was pretty questionable and now they're telling us we have records
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:55.540]  because of hundreds of a degree you've got to be kidding if you're looking at
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:59.380]  the pattern over those say the last thousand years temperatures have gone
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:04.340]  up and down we had the medium of a warm period we have the little ice age and
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:08.660]  you see that little squirgo on the extreme right hand side of your screen
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:14.220]  the last little red squirgo on this chart that's the warming of the 20th
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:20.940]  century into the 21st century it is nothing it is insignificant and it is
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.340]  far less than the middle of the warm period and they're telling us is the
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:30.020]  warmest earth has ever been you know why that is that manipulated the data it's
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:34.700]  an amazing thing and we even caught them with the Copenhagen documents we even
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.860]  caught them with the hide the decline emails but they are so committed to this
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:45.740]  that they just continue to move forward but they do whatever they can it's it's
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:51.420]  a screaming outrage this is our federal government know what the national
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:56.300]  other service that is National Data Climate Center down in Charleston
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:01.860]  South Carolina they these people have manipulated the temperatures four times
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:07.180]  and in the process they have made the past cooler so the present is
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:11.980]  comparatively warmer only by degree or two but enough for them to scream and
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:16.940]  holler about global warming now the whole thing Alex is blamed on what
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:22.020]  what's the bedrock do you know CO2 you got it right friend I know you're very
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:27.140]  well informed man by the way oh my wife and I visited both Austin and San
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.540]  Antonio last year wonderful beautiful cities and certainly a great place to
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:39.060]  live but if you look at the long-term temperatures and CO2 of planet Earth as
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:45.020]  determined by the ice cores dug near and then article in the South Pole you find
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:50.740]  that the CO2 has been up and down and it tends to follow temperatures not vice
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:55.420]  versa in other words CO2 doesn't drive temperatures up the temperatures cause
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.620]  the CO2 to sure and in Al Gore's film this was found in British court for those
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:04.060]  that don't know that he had flipped basically where he has temperature
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:08.380]  following CO2 and I understand that you're a top meteorologist John Coleman
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:12.700]  founder of the Weather Channel John Coleman blog.com a lot of my listeners
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:17.460]  are informed they know you all about you what you've done your tireless work and
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.860]  I want to get into the more of the science with you but specifically though
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.980]  back to Maury Strong the David Rockefeller the UN if they can tax carbon
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.780]  they can track all human activity they can selectively pick winners and losers
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.700]  general electric by Obama was given as you know two thousand plus waivers to
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.580]  operate coal power plants the last seven years their competitors weren't they
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:45.540]  had to shut down so this is all about raw power and what you explained earlier
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.260]  so key they're making a bunch of money and getting power out of this it's not
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:54.220]  like they're well-meaning misguided idiot liberals who want to save the
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:58.860]  earth and are just worried about CO2 this is their way of taxing and
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.740]  controlling the entire carbon cycle and they're trying to ram through these
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:09.420]  global treaties to do it and I really think you know the diabolical nature of
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:15.540]  that needs to be exposed well I'm shocked when Al Gore is put on television and
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:22.820]  no one falls into task when he screams about tons and tons of carbons viewing
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:28.860]  end of the atmosphere that's your nonsense what we are emitting is yes
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:36.460]  tons and tons of carbon dioxide and odorless tasteless invisible gas that is
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.020]  essential to life and it's a trace I've been in the atmosphere forever and man
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:48.180]  has contributed just a tiny amount to it and it's still less than one half of one
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:52.140]  percent well sir you're the expert on this but I've had astrophysicist on I've
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:56.780]  had historians on during the warmer periods going back over hundreds of
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:01.340]  thousands of years it's a boom time for plants animals humans we see the booms
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:07.980]  and civilization during these warming periods and also CO2 has been much higher
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.340]  in our history and is associated with higher oxygen levels plants growing
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.740]  better better health I mean is it the earth if you look back over the last
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:21.140]  thousand years from ice core samples actually in a CO2 starved position isn't
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:27.860]  CO2 a tiny trace gas absolutely and yes we desperately need more not less
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:32.900]  here in Southern California where I live they pump CO2 and large quantities
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:37.900]  into the greenhouses in order to make the flowers grow fast you know we supply
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:42.660]  all those flowers for the whole nation your Christmas and Thanksgiving buffets
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:48.940]  all come from greenhouses here loaded with carbon dioxide CO2 I have a friend
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:54.660]  who was a great submariner and set many records in his submarining days and he
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:23:01.300]  tells me that on their subs they took the CO2 up to 5,000 parts per million no
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:06.900]  problem they did it all the time and they thrived on my friend Craig it's so
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:13.580]  over in the Phoenix area he uses CO2 to prove that plants grow faster he grows
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:19.860]  plants with low CO2 and high CO2 and those with high CO2 the trees grow feet
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.260]  higher than those that don't have it and since we have been putting a little
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.740]  more CO2 into the atmosphere crops grow better there's more food for the world's
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:35.980]  core or our plants grow better and the plants put off more oxygen too the earth
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:44.740]  is 20% greener Alex it's amazing it is amazing so what are we gonna do about
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:52.660]  this great need for more CO2 in the earth we're gonna keep growing using our
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:58.100]  fossil fuels understand CO2 comes from the exhaustive fossil fuels burn so our
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:03.420]  jet aircraft our cars and trucks all cause it now they have taxed CO2 already
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:08.260]  particularly here in California but to some extent nationally US CO2 is down
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:13.260]  10% in the last decade as you know the average American family is now paying
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:21.220]  more than $1,200 a year more for their food products for their energy for
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:26.220]  everything and that's a lot of money for a poor family and under the plans of the
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:31.820]  Obama administration that's going to go up to about $4,500 a year for that
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.500]  family of four now the kids don't get their pads they can't get on the
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:40.100]  internet the kids don't get their health care they can't go to summer camp they
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:44.220]  don't get your clothes that up you know it's serious matter it's a very serious
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:49.020]  matter it's an impoverishment cloud and pebbin sickening plan they literally
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.340]  are turning the lights off they're literally turning the oxygen supply of
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:57.940]  the plants off CO2 the equivalent I mean this is something you'd imagine Lex
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:03.620]  Luther to do in a 1950s comic book and I wonder where did Maury strong cook this
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.460]  up because first it was global freezing then it was gonna be warming and you
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.100]  and others just prove that so now it's change period and they get on the news
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:17.260]  when it's hot or it's cold and say it's our fault by the way I covered the ice
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:22.700]  age coming story for ABC I was their science reporter I remember when Time
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:29.460]  Magazine had that picture of New York City under all that ice yes sir I covered
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:34.060]  that story for ABC interviewed the scientists behind it and those same
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:39.900]  scientists have now seems their mind and our global warming nuts it is an
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:44.820]  amazing turn of events but isn't the real danger we study real sunspots cyclical
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:51.340]  systems that we could be entering a mini cooling period well a mini one yes and
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:56.380]  within a couple of thousand years we'll all be gone but our ancestors will be
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.300]  around we'll have to cope with the beginning of the next ice age because
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:05.020]  they have come on a regular basis about every twenty thousand years through the
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.940]  history of earth and now you're a top meteorologist I want you to walk through
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.940]  this but folks understand there's not just 365 days around the sign there's not
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:17.140]  just the four seasons that's the cyclical yearly cyclical system but they will
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:22.060]  but exactly we know there are larger seasons larger cycles please continue
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.300]  John Coleman well one of those larger cycles is caused by the tilt of the
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.980]  earth on its axis where our solar system is quite imperfect and our earth is
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.140]  quite imperfect and the earth actually tilts you know about 70 degrees on its
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:41.540]  axis and when it tilts more or less that has a huge impact on the weather and
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:47.740]  maybe the reason behind the beginning of ice ages but there's also a astrophysicist
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:53.540]  named sevens one in Norway I may be getting his name slightly wrong now you
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:58.900]  got it but he's a heck of a man and he has a theory that is caused by cosmic rays
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:04.380]  coming in elsewhere from the universe and activating our atmosphere a very
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:08.420]  interesting theory that I've been studying the truth is of course we don't
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:14.180]  know for sure what causes ice ages but I'm happy to say that we are so civilized
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:20.540]  today that when the next ice age comes I think man will be able to cope with it
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:25.620]  by putting up reflectors to reflect more sunlight into the earth and deter the
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:31.100]  ice age I mean our great scientific enterprise will be able to geo-engineer
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:35.420]  it's not the politicians it's the scientists to make the earth a great
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.620]  place but what about this hoax I mean I just saw a public letter where tens of
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:43.020]  thousands of scientists just signed saying global warming is a fraud this is
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:48.060]  all a fraud they get on the news and say all scientists agree that that global
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:52.140]  warming is real pay Al Gore tax money or the earth will die I mean they
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:56.860]  literally say that it's so ridiculous yeah that person's totally manipulated
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:04.060]  that 97% figure is widely used but there are 30,000 31,000 to be exact
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.780]  scientists so far who have signed the Oregon petition and that petition states
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:14.420]  clearly what I state with all my heart and with great study and great scientific
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:21.260]  knowledge there is no significant man-made global warming now there hasn't
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:25.740]  been any in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future that
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:31.420]  petition signed by thousands of scientists is an example that there's not
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:38.300]  97% of the science but Alex it's the power of money our government is now
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:45.060]  giving four billion dollars a year to researchers who will support global
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:51.540]  warming and zero dollars to researchers who will cover and I should add that
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.020]  that's their new tactic with gun control they're funding billions I professor
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:58.860]  lot on a few weeks ago to now fund all this fake data on guns I mean they
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.760]  really are cooking the books yeah and this is the same thing going on with
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.260]  global warming well let's think about this that four billion dollars so far
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:12.580]  they've had about 10,000 research projects they have funded every time a
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:19.700]  scientist does a research project he has a publicist who puts out a press
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:24.660]  release when he starts I mean you know that so-and-so so-and-so the bees are all
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.140]  dying from the global warming or whatever and then he puts out a couple
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.740]  press releases while he's working it and is when he's done he puts out more
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:37.740]  well the media compels up those press movies so day in day out
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:41.860]  negative and I doubt we're day lose with propaganda stay there John Coleman I'm
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:44.860]  gonna come back and talk about how we fight this and how you woke up to all
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:47.820]  this I mean you've been fighting this for decades you've been vindicated as
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:53.820]  well stay with us I'm Alex Jones the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:30:02.180]  GCN radio network here's what we know about the shooting that took place in
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:07.300]  San Bernardino, California where 14 people were killed and 17 others were
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:12.100]  wounded the shooters were husband and wife Saeed Farooq and Tajfeen Malik
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.820]  according to authorities the couple crashed an employee holiday party
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.860]  dressed in assault clothing and working as if they were on a mission
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:24.380]  according to co-workers Farooq was a devout Muslim who traveled to Saudi
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:29.180]  Arabia earlier this year and returned with a wife his wife was believed to be
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:33.500]  from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia before coming to the US on
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:38.660]  social media accounts Farooq describes himself as a Sunni the council on
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:42.540]  American Islamic relations immediately went into damage control Muslim
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:46.500]  leaders asked that people not implicate Islam or Muslims for the mass
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:51.060]  killings saying the massacre may have been work-related mental illness or

[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:20.500]  Alex Jones I remember growing up watching John Coleman on good morning America
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.860]  remember when he started the weather channel and it was you know the top
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:29.220]  rated things for for so long then I got to say it's declined quite a bit since
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:33.100]  he left just from what I've seen in the news and then you tune into it and it's
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:37.060]  all this propaganda about the global warming is going to get you and oh my
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.860]  gosh we have a dust storm it's global warming turning it all into the same
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:47.140]  scam it's so sad and the same mainstream media is telling us this isn't an
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:50.580]  Islamic radical attack in California and they're trying to blame
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:58.020]  conservatives I mean these are just really sick sick people and the mainstream
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:02.740]  media is committing suicide it really is committing suicide it's like we had
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:08.180]  Donald Trump on yesterday and there are over 2,000 articles we go to Google
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.900]  news click news type and Alex Jones Donald Trump and it's just all this
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.700]  made-up stuff stuff I never said Donald Trump goes on a show that denies the
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:23.060]  moon landings I say the moon landings were real I call about the 28 pages Saudi
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:28.180]  Arabia to congressional hearings that our government knew and they go look
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.500]  he's a truth or all this other stuff well yeah I mean I want the truth about our
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.860]  government covering up Islamic terror to come out but they misrepresent it they
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:41.020]  claim all sorts of other weird stuff this is how they deceive Donald Trump
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:44.780]  called for five million dollars if he was to go to CNN debate to be given to
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.380]  a wounded warrior program the headline said Donald Trump was to be paid five
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:52.860]  million dollars said nothing about him wanting to give the money away that's
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:57.300]  how they misrepresent and the reason I bring this up is John Coleman you've
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.700]  been through a lot of demonization for telling the truth about man-made little
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:04.900]  warming I've seen them misrepresent what you say or they go oil companies fund
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.260]  these people no oil companies funded me I mean it really is frustrating to see
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:14.940]  how disingenuous they are but isn't that I mean isn't that the reason that
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:19.740]  mainstream media isn't such decline is that people know that they engage in so
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:23.820]  many dirty tricks and then now they only seem to be doubling down and getting
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:29.060]  more deceptive about the things they say and do instead of watching the main
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:34.380]  screen media yesterday Alex I watched your program with Donald Trump and Lord
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:41.940]  mountain program I had no need to turn on my television said that I wow I'm
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:45.580]  flattered sir I didn't know your reviewer thank you the main screen media is
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:51.620]  in decline because now scientists technology has made it possible for you
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:58.380]  to reach thousands millions of people via the internet and go right around
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:04.220]  television and that's why it's in this huge decline they have a big big problem
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:08.940]  and it's the technology it's the work of scientists that makes it possible and
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:14.420]  that's the work of scientists that is going to solve this so-called global
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:19.180]  warming problem is going to end our age of fossil fuels now fossil fuels have
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:25.620]  fueled this country for about the close to 200 years now however in this great
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:32.300]  21st century it will not be long before you begin to hear about graphene and
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:38.860]  graphene will solve the problem in 30 years I'll be dead but you'll be an
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:45.340]  old man but in 30 years we won't need fossil fuels anymore we'll be turning
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:52.180]  them off because science has brought in the new wave of technology and these
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:56.460]  are great things that happen now you asked before the break about how I got
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:03.260]  into this whole global warming thing yes I'm excited about science and what it
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:09.980]  can do but then I had covered that ice age thing so I heard about Al Gore being
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:15.540]  elected to the US Senate after he wrote a book about climate change and I said to
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:20.220]  the man who works for me a man named Joe DeLeo who's a certified consulting
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:27.260]  meteorologist of great reputation and he was he worked with me as my scientist
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:31.140]  helper when I was doing good morning America and then went with me to the
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:36.060]  weather channel I said to Joe I said what's this all about I'm very skeptical
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:40.900]  because I was I saw this whole ice age thing and he said let's research it and
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:46.020]  we began to research and the more and more we research in the early ages of
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:52.500]  computers before the internet was easy we finally came to the real facts that
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:58.180]  how it all happened and what started Al Gore and I'm speaking to you today from
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:03.620]  San Diego and just a few miles from me is where the modern problem began at the
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:09.980]  Scripps Oceanographic Institution and there a man named Roger Ravel and a man
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:15.140]  named Tom Seuss I came up with a study that said yes global warming was being
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:21.380]  caused by carbon dioxide it was a small study wasn't a big deal but it started
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:27.420]  something back in the small as the smoggy fifties but we've cleaned up the
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:32.780]  atmosphere hugely since then with great technology and science but never mind
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:38.580]  that started something and Roger Reveld and went to Harvard he left the
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:42.700]  Scripps Oceanographic Institute in anger went to Harvard and started the
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:47.900]  Center for Population Studies but he talked about this problem with carbon
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:53.820]  dioxide in his class and in the front row of his very first class who was the
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:39:01.140]  freshman student Al Gore and Al Gore gobbled on to this and made it the
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:07.260]  meaning of his life now a few years later Ravel realized that the global warming
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:12.220]  wasn't happening and tried to take it back but Al Gore was already in the
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:18.380]  Senate and beginning to spend tens of millions of dollars on science to support
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:22.620]  this this awful theory to make himself the savior of the world I mean if you're
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:26.460]  writing the script I could see why they did it you you write a screenplay where
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:33.220]  you're the hero and so here we were and so I learned that how wrong this was and
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:38.580]  how honorable it was as a great scientist that made Ravel that he come
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:43.220]  back and say my theory was wrong that's the sign of a great scientist when he
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:49.060]  can realize his theory is wrong and safe so because now we're entrapped by all
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:53.340]  these scientists who are receiving these tens of millions of dollars a year for
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:59.260]  their institutions to study global warming all these scientists receiving
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:04.900]  that money and if they do what Ravel did and said wait a minute it's not really
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.500]  happening if they were to do that their money would be cut off their
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.580]  mortgages they couldn't send their kids to college their wives would need them so
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:18.340]  they just stick with it so they're bought and paid for they become political
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:22.660]  prostitutes John Coleman founder of the Weather Channel won the National
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:28.060]  Meteorologist the Year Award during his career John Coleman blog.com such a big
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.820]  fan of what you've done over the years we've got about four or five minutes left
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.620]  I want to invite you back up for a full hour very very soon sir when there's not
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.940]  all this horrible shooting news and jihadi wave attack a news and the rest
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.460]  of it but but this really is front and center with this global government open
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:46.460]  treaty openly admitting world government they've really emerged I want to
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:51.300]  ask you as a smart businessman as a guy that started one of the most successful
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.460]  cable networks out there one of the first to do it just as a savvy person
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:00.740]  looking at the gestalt all the different pieces because I really respect your
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:07.460]  view and want to know it in your gut is this thing have so much inertia that
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:11.500]  it'll still roll over us even though it's a proven fraud or is the tide
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:15.980]  turning against it in your gut if we all work hard and you work hard and we
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:19.980]  expose what's happening and we tell the truth where does this end up going
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:24.020]  because I mean we know it's criminal we know it's dastardly we know it's a
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:28.020]  fraud we know it's anti-science we know it's going to be used to restrict other
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:32.540]  sciences that they call disruptive we know they're blocking real clean energy
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:36.580]  and only funding themselves with sickening boondoggles to their friends
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:42.940]  they want at the UN and more a strong zone words a new dark age to control the
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.020]  population that's really the end game of this like the communists used to keep
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:52.100]  people poor so so how do we have the new renaissance defeat these people and do
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:55.980]  you think we can defeat them in your gut if this was a football game and you're
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.420]  looking into the future we're in the second quarter in your gut where do you
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.700]  think we're going to be in the fourth quarter I think it will fade away I
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.860]  don't think we'll win I don't think they'll win I think the bathroom will
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.900]  continue I was in for easier Lord Mockman said we have turned the tide
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:19.020]  yesterday but I wish I could agree with him but I can't but Alex it's not going
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:25.380]  to be the public debate it's not going to be politics that settles the fight it's
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:30.500]  going to be science and that's what I was telling you that science is going to
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:38.140]  produce a new way to our civilization that is so sensational that we will turn
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:46.180]  off our use of CO2 and when we turn off our our fossil fuel the whole thing is
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:51.660]  over it's over we're not producing any more CO2 they don't have a basis to
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:58.260]  complain their whole right fest dies I can hardly wait but I don't think I'll
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:02.900]  live that long but I think it's about 30 years away when we have a totally new
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:10.340]  power regime for our civilization based on graphene that will just wipe out the
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:14.860]  whole argument and end the debate so you believe we'll transcend by
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:18.820]  technology and development as the last Renaissance did those that are
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:23.940]  attempting to stagnate society into these new classes systems that the liberals
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.580]  are pushing a lot I think that's really an exciting world view and I tend to
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:32.020]  agree with you overall and the battle is up to us but speak specifically about
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.700]  the innovative technology that you were just mentioning that a lot of the
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.420]  viewers and even myself aren't up to speed on I mean I know what it is but I'd
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.020]  like to hear from you who is obviously an expert
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:49.860]  by the way go to YouTube and you'll find my report on graphene that's t-r-a-p-h-e-n-p
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:56.060]  graphene invented by two French scientists won the Nobel Peace Prize
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:03.860]  Nobel Science Prize in 2009 and more than 30 patents have been issued for
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:11.220]  graphene products at this point and it is the most powerful the hardest best
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:17.380]  conductor most amazing substance ever created by man it can substitute for the
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:23.780]  steel and the aluminum and our vehicles and get this we will be able to build a
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:29.260]  paint with it if you paint a car with it it will produce enough power power that
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:33.380]  car forever incredible it would make me a battery
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:39.300]  graphene batteries there's a patent been issued for graphene batteries now we
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:44.100]  still can't produce graphene inexpensively in quantity for several
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:51.620]  companies working to do that when they do the world really changes you plastic
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:57.620]  was the substance of the 20th century graphene will be the substance of the
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:03.820]  21st century and it will end the global warming debate and it will it will
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:11.700]  power this civilization into things that we only dream about today well I agree
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:14.900]  with you and there are so many other technologies being developed that many
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.180]  of us don't even know about yet that could leapfrog pass this I mean it's
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:22.780]  really is amazing and that's what I've been told by high-level people in the
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:28.060]  CIA in the FBI in foreign governments is there's a fight between elites that
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.500]  want to stagnate development and keep it for themselves and elites that want to
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:35.260]  give it to the people but at the end of the day as you said the true elite is
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.460]  the scientific mind of innovation and it's really hard to hold that down sir
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:44.300]  go ahead I don't know that they're the elite because money is so powerful
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:50.620]  that's where the money is and politics is controlling the money yes but science
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:58.140]  has to overcome that and it's not easy but it's science has ruled the world if
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:05.340]  you look at it civilizations countries empires come and go even rocks have a
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:11.300]  lifetime but science has always taken us to the next level and so I'm confident
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.700]  that science will win the battle and global warming by making it totally
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:19.500]  unimportant that's why they want us to forget about science in school now and
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.540]  make it all about infighting and racial garbage when what unifies this is
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:29.460]  innovation is discovery and so much more wow John Coleman blog.com I am so
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:34.020]  thankful you came on I've tried to get you on for years and I must have not
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.860]  been reaching out to the right place but I'm very honored that you tuned into the
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:40.260]  show and we really appreciate you coming on sir and the minute or two we have
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:44.660]  left any other key points you would like to relate to the viewers and listeners
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:50.100]  out there well I think the key point that I will make you this science that has
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:54.980]  made this program possible it is science that has made many others like it
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:47:02.220]  possible the mainstream media of which I was a key player for 60 years used to
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:06.780]  when I started we had like two TV stations people could watch one
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:12.540]  newspaper they could read and there was no internet at all and I have watched as
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:18.060]  cable came and brought additional channels and spread out the power and
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:23.620]  that helped but then came the internet and now we have digital television which
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:31.180]  is growing in leaps and bounds and I think this will this opens up
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:36.300]  communications the Facebook is just a small thing I'm trying to develop
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:40.900]  something called my like my world which involves both video and a Facebook like
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:47.420]  content and Twitter that would just tear the world apart because everybody would
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:50.260]  become a communicator and that's the way it ought to be
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:54.780]  wow well mr. Coleman promised me that you will come back in the next few months
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:59.380]  with us again storage it's really been a treat my pleasure Alex thank you wow I
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:04.900]  tell you what an innovator what a broadcaster what a fighter he was there
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.620]  at the beginning when they were rolling his fraud out and he sent around other
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.300]  scientists other meteorologists going this doesn't sound right they just said
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.060]  we were gonna be freezing to death that we didn't give them all the power let's
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:17.940]  look into this and so from the beginning he's just been going come on guys
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:22.780]  Al Gore is gonna save us we're gonna pay him tax money the guy that says he
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:26.300]  invented the internet the internet was invented back in the 60s by British and
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:31.060]  US scientists wasn't vented by Al Gore had nothing to do with it then he went
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:37.100]  well I was in the Senate in the late 80s when we gave the internet some funding
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:43.100]  I saw this bumper sticker on somebody's car I think it was quoting Oliver
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:47.700]  Wendell Holmes or something but it said I like paying taxes because I like
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:55.020]  civilization and that's kind of the proto-fraud idea of what Obama said if
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:49:00.420]  you got a business you didn't build that somebody else did that so I mean
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:04.580]  obviously some type of government some type of centralized system some type of
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:09.660]  law has helped build civilization but in latter phases it becomes very
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:15.540]  oppressive and destructive historically and then it destroys civilization but it
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:22.220]  is the human mind and human free will and markets that innovate so I like free
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:28.180]  market because I like choice and I like civilization the collectives say if
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:31.860]  somebody commits a crime with a gun you lose your second amendment because
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:37.020]  you're all collectively bad no I'm not racist because there's some other white
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.740]  guy that's racist or of a black guy's racist some other black person isn't
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:45.780]  racist I judge people by the character of their conduct and their deeds and who
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:49.740]  they are I listen to Jimmy Henry's cuz I like his singing and his guitar not
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:55.380]  cuz he's black the same thing I judge people by who they are and that's a
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:59.060]  common sense let's get back to it we're gonna go to break I'm gonna come back
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.180]  with a bunch of Donald Trump clips and then Jakari Jackson's gonna be on the

[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:07.580]  think that this could trigger the jihadi should we take the Christmas trees

[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:18.260]  Sheriff John Brown came and I started out of town yeah
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:21.260]  we're not looking for a fight
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:37.380]  the local government level of the police to then bring in tyranny we're
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:49.380]  exposing the false flag but I have never seen a more sickeningly illustrated
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:55:00.340]  example of just oxymoronic treason as the European governments and our
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:04.220]  government bringing in radical jihadists that continue to attack us and the
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:10.100]  media trying to spin the fact that it's because they saw a Christmas tree or
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:16.620]  it's not jihad or trying to blame the right wing or patriots and then
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.540]  politically correct neighbors not reporting them to police they're
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:23.860]  admitting this because they were Muslims and they didn't want to be
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.900]  politically incorrect and then Obama arming these very groups the Middle East
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:35.300]  to commit wholesale carnage against the Libyans the Syrians the Egyptians the
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:41.900]  Iraqis I mean I just have never seen our government be such bad guys before and
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:48.820]  it's certainly not been perfect but man this is low down and then kid Daniels
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.220]  just walked in with this story and I just gulped it's up on info wars.com
[01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:59.460]  right now I've told him red link this sucker right now this is such a big
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:08.420]  deal Obama arms ISIS link militants without background checks Wow just like
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:12.380]  that plane last week from Mexico with 140 people and then their passports
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:15.540]  weren't even looked at it's like the migrants are being brought in they're
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.980]  just being dispersed is this like sleeper cells or something is this worse
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:23.340]  than I thought I mean something's going on here I've told everybody that I've
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.580]  been dreading December everybody else I've talked to it just feels it's
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:31.460]  building up to this month now we're here and you got stuff with Russia going on
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:35.820]  and economic craziness look at this article this needs to be our top story
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:39.540]  red linked on info wars.com
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:48.100]  Obama arms ISIS link militants without background checks gun control advocates
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:51.300]  want to enact universal background checks for guns that's registration response
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.100]  to San Bernardino shootings even though President Obama wasn't performing
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:57.460]  stringent background checks on ISIS linked moderate rebels he was arming in
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:02.620]  Syria and now he's letting him come in without background checks we need to add
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:06.540]  that kit the demand for more gun control is also strange considering that the
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:09.740]  shooting occurred in California I said that already has some of the strongest
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:13.180]  gun laws the nation in California we have tough gun laws I don't know how
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:16.660]  these weapons involved the shooting got where they were we'll find out said
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:23.220]  Barbara Boxer said the Senate floor and the people well we have these gun laws
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:28.140]  but look at this we have 56% reduction in gun violence is 93 in my great state
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:34.500]  because we have taken action no boxer gun ownership went up so criminals are
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:38.260]  scared and now all we've got your weird cross-dressing crazies in your jihad he's
[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.900]  attacking us I mean literally I mean always do it in gun-free zones like you
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:48.300]  know this government building or at Fort Hood you said that wasn't terror
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:54.380]  people know you're a pack of liars Paris climate summit hackers leak login to

[01:59:49.820 --> 02:00:00.620]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:10.620]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the GCN radio
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:34.420]  network
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:51.980]  We are back, the phone calls are coming up in the next segment, look at this story, Paris
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:59.180]  climate summit, hackers leak login details of more than a thousand officials, well it
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:03.420]  was five years ago at the Copenhagen event pushing world government again that we got
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:07.820]  the Danish text, the documents and it was all how the third world was to be shut down
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:14.580]  with crippling taxes that were almost double, almost double what the West would pay.
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:19.380]  So it was all sold as class envy, wealth redistribution and it is wealth redistribution from the very
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:25.340]  poor, the blue collar, the middle class, the upper middle class, the Nuvarish, the wealthy,
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.700]  the ultra wealthy that aren't on the inside group.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:33.060]  That's why big oil companies like Dutch World Shell and BP and of course Goldman Sachs is
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:35.340]  in a well company as well, they're big in oil.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.700]  They are the top funders of the global warming fraud.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:44.980]  Paris climate summit hackers leak login, oh I'm sorry Bill Maher told you that I was funded
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:49.220]  by the oil companies.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:55.780]  He also put up a headline saying that I said cancer was good for you, I never said that.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:02.140]  So see this is what we deal with and this is the deception they engage in.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:07.540]  But data including emails, user names and phone numbers of 1,415 delegates posted online
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:11.020]  by anonymous in protest against arrest of activist.
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:15.860]  Now they banned free speech in France and Germany.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.940]  Hackers have leaked it anonymous, the hacktivist group hacked the website of the summit organizers,
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:24.460]  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and posted names, phone numbers and user names
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:31.220]  and email addresses and secret questions and answers onto an anonymous publishing site.
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:35.060]  It's claimed the attack was an act of protest against the arrest of protestors on a climate
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:36.060]  march.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:39.540]  Yeah they even have the leftist, you know, astroturf groups out there calling for world
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:40.540]  government.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:41.540]  They even get arrested.
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:45.260]  Climate activists organized a peaceful protest, said the demonstration was hijacked by a small
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:48.980]  group of anarchists, probably paid by the globalists, who clashed with police.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:53.500]  All public protests have been banned in the city since a state of emergency was declared,
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:57.660]  that's called martial law, after the terror attacks nearly three weeks ago which the government
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:03.780]  helped set up and help create, isn't that just special.
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:08.620]  And here's another report here out of Wired Magazine and they spent it like, oh to control
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:11.420]  the outcome, no, no, they're running the show.
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:15.140]  So I'd tell people this 15 years ago, people didn't believe me, now it's all admitted,
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:20.180]  this is Wired Magazine, hard to believe it's in Wired Magazine, the fossil fuel industry
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:25.620]  is helping bankroll the Paris climate talks.
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:28.860]  You might not expect fossil fuel companies to pay for a conference designed to shrink
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:31.980]  their industry, but in Paris that's precisely what's happening, see they have to spend it
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:32.980]  now.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:39.500]  Oh, this week and next roughly 40,000 diplomats, that's parasites, activists, policy experts
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:43.820]  and journalists are gathered at the French capital for a round of high stakes negotiations
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:45.340]  aimed at slowing climate change.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:49.660]  So they just state the fraud, slowing climate change, what does that mean?
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:53.460]  Now it's not global warming or global freezing, it's change.
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:58.060]  We've got to stop winter from coming or summer, it's so evil, is it true mommy that the conspiracy
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.420]  theorists said we always had the seasons?
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:06.260]  Yes, they're evil, we never had seasons before, everything was like a golf course in the spring.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:08.860]  But mommy, is it a spring season?
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:11.380]  That's a thought crime now, just be quiet.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:16.020]  They're packed into a regional airport that is described by our climate desk partners,
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:20.340]  they have a climate desk that the New Republic has been converted into resembles a cross
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:24.420]  street United Nations Headquarters building, Disney World's Epcot Center and Natural History
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:25.420]  Museum.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:32.860]  And then it just goes in to mention how Google 3M, Puma, Ikea are corporate sponsors but
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:38.740]  also the big oil companies and they're there helping.
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:42.660]  And the spin is they just get where all this is going so they've gotten on board, no they
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:46.940]  were on board from the start, you know who owned Occidental Petroleum, he got it from
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:47.940]  Armand Hammer.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.820]  I mean Al Gore is one of the biggest oil company owners in the world.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:55.420]  Oil wants to shut down coal, your cheap energy.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:02.380]  Could a high tech doomsday weapon wipe out America?
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:07.580]  A new report warns that the US military has failed to keep pace with China and Russia
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:09.580]  in electromagnetic warfare.
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:14.220]  Tech boss and presidential candidate John McAfee recently warned about a doomsday electronic
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:20.300]  weapon that could wipe out 90% of Americans within two years of the attack and he urged
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:24.580]  politicians that this is the number one threat facing the country.
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:29.220]  Weapons that wipe out enemy electronics are a staple of science fiction films, McAfee
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:35.060]  claims the country and its leaders are unprepared for EMP weapons and warned that gun crime
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.540]  should not be the single issue that decides votes.
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:42.620]  Recently President Obama declared voting against those politicians who are on the wrong side
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:48.180]  of the gun control issue, McAfee says this is confusing because the possibility of 90%
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:53.780]  death for citizens of the US far outweighs gun violence which causes fewer deaths per
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:56.220]  year than traffic accidents.
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.220]  Lee and McAdoo for Infowars.com.
[02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:02.580]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:07.700]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:12.900]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time, just one of the key compounds.

[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:45.340]  Welcome to Deep Cleanse.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:50.340]  And I think I was about four years old when the song came out.
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.340]  And past is gone.
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:59.340]  But it lives on our hearts and minds and our experiences.
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:06.340]  And if you don't learn by your experiences, you truly are a slave.
[02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:12.340]  You've got to know how to lose, know how to win.
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:18.340]  That's why they don't let you ever get out there in the arena.
[02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:20.340]  That's what political correctness is all about.
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.340]  Don't use words that might hurt people's feelings.
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.340]  Don't have contact sports. You might get hurt.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:27.340]  Don't climb a mountain. Don't write a song.
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:30.340]  Don't give people A's or B's. Don't give people trophies.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:36.340]  Because it hurts other kids' feelings if they don't win the trophy.
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:39.340]  Really all you're doing is creating a jellyfish.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.340]  You know it's true.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:48.340]  They come back to you.
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:53.340]  I look back at all the most horrible things in my life.
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:55.340]  They were all the best things in my life.
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:10:02.340]  Experiences that were hair-racing only made me stronger.
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:07.340]  Nietzsche was right in all of his insane ramblings.
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.340]  There are some nuggets there that are totally true.
[02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:14.340]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:22.340]  We're going to go to the ground in Austin, Texas here in a moment.
[02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:26.340]  At the bottom of the arm I'm going to go to William, Tim, Kim, Noah, Adam and others.
[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:28.340]  Our crew is ready to go right now.
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:31.340]  Jacari, Jackson and others down at the Capitol.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:35.340]  We will continue, as I said, with your calls and a bunch of news I haven't gotten to.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:38.340]  And a bunch of Donald Trump clips I haven't played.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.340]  We'll get to those as well because that was really an important interview.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:46.340]  But not just what he said, it was also how the media responded.
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:49.340]  Misrepresenting what he said and what I stand for.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:54.340]  Just like they're misrepresenting this Jihad attack out in California in San Bernardino.
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:11:01.340]  It really shows the new levels of deception and false reality that these people are going to.
[02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:05.340]  Now I had other questions I meant to get to with Donald Trump yesterday about
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:08.340]  banking reform, the Federal Reserve, a bunch of those questions came in.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:09.340]  I didn't get to it.
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:15.340]  I was also going to try to get into the fact that you can't just bring people in and then
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:20.340]  surveil everybody, you've got to stop Jihadis coming in, he says use surveillance to stop them.
[02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:22.340]  The truth is that surveillance is already in place.
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:26.340]  And stuff like, hey, I'm a militarist, but I'm against the Iraq war.
[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:30.340]  Some of these statements I don't like.
[02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:33.340]  That's why I've said I agree with a lot of what Trump says, not all of it.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:35.340]  But here's what I do know.
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:38.340]  He's not Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:44.340]  Sworn enemy of free speech, sworn enemy of the Second Amendment, swarm enemy of Christians.
[02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:49.340]  He's not persecuting Christians with the IRS.
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:51.340]  Neither's Ted Cruz, neither's Rand Paul.
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:57.340]  I'll take any of them or any combination of them over Bernie Sanders.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:59.340]  And I don't get into lesser of two evils.
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:06.340]  But let me tell you, I learned a big lesson not supporting John McCain in 2008.
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:14.340]  And it wasn't that he was even good or that he was even going to win.
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:15.340]  It was going to be Obama.
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:18.340]  That was the heir apparent, the whole establishment behind him.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:20.340]  I just hate Rhino-Republican so much.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:22.340]  And McCain's just as bad as Obama, probably worse.
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:27.340]  He wouldn't have got it anyways, but I should have been upfront saying if the establishment wants Barack Obama,
[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:30.340]  you know he's going to be bad and you know that McCain's a ringer.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.340]  And I did basically say that.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:39.340]  I mean, I kind of was more against Obama than McCain, but it's impossible when they run somebody like this.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:45.340]  I mean, I saw an article today in the Christian Science Monitor at the Christian Science Monitor Breakfast.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:49.340]  Again, you talk about a pentagram, an inverted reality.
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.340]  McCain, in fact, I sent it to you, Nika.
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:52.340]  I don't know if you printed it.
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:54.340]  I didn't see it here, but I didn't go over all the news today.
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.340]  There's so much.
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:13:03.340]  And there is McCain saying, we have an emergency plan in case Trump gets the nomination because we know he'll lose
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:06.340]  and it'll hurt other Republicans across the board.
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:09.340]  That's what happens when you run a bad candidate.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:13.340]  This is the guy run as a dead fish against Barack Obama.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:14.340]  There it is.
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:18.340]  Without naming names, John McCain frets about top GOP ticket in 2016.
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:22.340]  And then you read it and he's talking about himself.
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:25.340]  Trump is a strong candidate.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.340]  He's focused.
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:29.340]  He's unapologetic.
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:31.340]  He's pushing all the right buttons.
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:36.340]  If he's the real guy he says he is, he could be the next Ronald Reagan.
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:44.340]  And not that Reagan was perfect, but at least he didn't try to gut the country.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:48.340]  Now, I say get rid of these speakers of the House, get rid of the Rhinos, get people elected at the state level.
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.340]  That's the real way to win.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:54.340]  But also, if we can get a decent president in or take control of the Congress, I'm all behind that.
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:57.340]  And look at the whole system against Trump.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:03.340]  I mean, I know completely trusting, especially up front, but more and more, especially in private conversations,
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:11.340]  and I'm just going to leave it at that, I've never had people this high level sit there and point blank tell me the stuff they've told me.
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:19.340]  And I just really have trouble believing that the Trump camp would have told me things they told me if they weren't for real.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:23.340]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:27.340]  And I will probably be going up to New York soon.
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:33.340]  But the point is, or somewhere else on the campaign trail, to have a private meeting with Trump, he invited me up there.
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:37.340]  But people know this country's being killed right now.
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:40.340]  They know the country's going down and it's hitting the crossroads.
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:42.340]  And we just got to decide which side we're on.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.340]  And that means Trump has to decide and everybody else does.
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:50.340]  I mean, do we really want to join the globalist, bankrupting and gutting this country?
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:55.340]  I don't think Donald Trump wants to do that and I think he's a big enough egomaniac and I mean that in a good way.
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.340]  That's what just men are just like that.
[02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.340]  They just call being dominant, being aggressive, crazy.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:01.340]  No, that's normal.
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:03.340]  That's what built this country.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:08.340]  And I think he's a big enough egomaniac that he thinks he can save this country.
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:13.340]  Well, if he thinks he can and we think he can and we work together, maybe it'll work.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:19.340]  And if he becomes a guy on a white horse and acts like a thug, he'll fall so fast it'll make your head spin.
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:20.340]  That's where I stand.
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.340]  I know Hillary is bad.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:26.340]  I know Bernie Sanders is as bad as it gets.
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:36.340]  Now joining us from in front of the Tenenbaum, in front of the Christmas tree, down in front of the Texas State House, is Jakari Jackson.
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:39.340]  And I would also add, he's down there with Joe Jennings running camera.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.340]  We're talking to some of the crowds.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:48.340]  There are moves, lawsuits in Texas to remove that, to remove nativity scenes all over Texas, even from churches that are private.
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:49.340]  The atheists don't want to look at it.
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.340]  This is happening all over the country.
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:59.340]  The governors had to basically pass laws and sign executive orders blocking the state removing nativities.
[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:09.340]  The governor also, as Jakari is going to be reporting the Nile and the Nightly News from the Capitol, has also filed a lawsuit over the refugees that Jakari went and reported last week on.
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.340]  300 of them at one high school alone, my alma mater, Anderson.
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:18.340]  So that's coming up as well, but Jakari Jackson is across from the tree.
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:22.340]  He's been talking to some of the locals and they're now asking the question in NBC.
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:26.340]  Did the Jihadis attack because they saw a Christmas tree at the health department, Jakari?
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:30.340]  I mean, this would be comedy if it wasn't so sickening, Jakari.
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:35.340]  Jakari Jackson reporting in Austin, Texas, documenting the war on Christmas.
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:38.340]  Yes, as you say, Alex, they have been coming out to the Christmas trees.
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:41.340]  I saw that clip that you were alluding to on MSNBC.
[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:46.340]  They were asking, you know, what set this guy off? You know, was it some kind of trigger at a holiday party?
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:51.340]  Whatever set this guy off, set him off long before he entered that holiday party, Alex, that Christmas party.
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:53.340]  The guy had body armor.
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:55.340]  He had homemade explosives.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:58.340]  He had his guns off his armaments ready to go.
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:02.340]  He was just looking for the opportune moment to bring those out.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.340]  That's right, Jakari.
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:09.340]  And I know you're going to try to talk to some crowds, but there's not folks really out there right now after the lunch hour in front of the Capitol.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:16.340]  But I just can't believe we even have to report on the fact that there are lawsuits trying to remove the Christmas tree behind you.
[02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:20.340]  I mean, these people really are about dominating culture.
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:25.340]  Yeah, they are because the former governor of Texas, Rick Perry, he actually had to come down.
[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:27.340]  That's one of the good things I can actually say about the guy.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:29.340]  One of the few good things is he came out.
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:34.340]  He said, I want the Christmas trees and the nativity scenes, all these things to remain in the state of Texas.
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:40.340]  They're alluding to Alex. It's been all over, not just here in Texas. There is a story in Virginia that has been in the news recently.
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:43.340]  The VA in Virginia is now banning Christmas trees in their facilities.
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:50.340]  They're even saying that you can't see any Christmas carols or anything that's even remotely related to any type of religious ceremony.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:57.340]  And in Germany and in Italy and other places, they're trying to ban kids having Christmas carols even at private schools.
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:01.340]  Outdoor Christmas parades are being canceled in case someone gets offended.
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:06.340]  My God, how did we turn into this Soviet state overnight?
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:14.340]  Well, it's always about if somebody is offended, somebody is offended, but they have no problem trying to offend Christians or allowing Christians to be offended,
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:21.340]  taking their rights away, taking away their holidays and festivities, having kids in class stomp on the name of Jesus and do all these other things.
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.340]  But they wouldn't dare do that to a Muslim suit.
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:27.340]  And again, I agree with that. And I'm not against Muslims themselves.
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:32.340]  Absolutely. But why do they get special treatment? I just don't get it.
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:38.340]  I don't know. It's everybody's a protective group except the Christians or any type of Christian festivity.
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:41.340]  If it was anything else out here, people would have no problems with it.
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:48.340]  We've seen in various places this satanic temples and all this stuff going on, these satanic holidays, different things going on.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:53.340]  Nobody has an issue with that. Nobody tries to cancel those. But anything related to Christmas, they can't stand it.
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:19:02.340]  Whoa, Jacari. Whoa. I am so freaked out right now. I'm going to skip this network break and you can go across the street and try to talk to some of the folks on the Capitol grounds.
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:11.340]  Jacari, they just canceled the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree lighting and the governor has in California canceled it because of the mass shooting.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:16.340]  Believing it may be offensive and trigger more Muslims. It is now the Christmas tree's fault.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:23.340]  This is the Sacramento Bee, Jacari, on screen for TV viewers. Radio listeners, let's put it back up and I'll give the headline out.
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:30.340]  Brown cancels Capitol Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Decision follows mass shooting Wednesday in San Bernardino.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:34.340]  This is all on purpose, Jacari. This is running up the white flag.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:39.340]  I mean, it's completely ridiculous to blame anything except the individual's actions.
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:47.340]  Baruch and his new wife, I mean, they decided to make these decisions to go out there and kill people to throw pipe bombs at the police and all this other.
[02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:51.340]  It had nothing to do with Christmas or Jesus or Christmas trees or anything like that.
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:54.340]  But they weren't terrorists with pipe bombs, though. Just everything.
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:20:00.340]  Well, and that's another ridiculous thing about it. Alex, even if you don't call it Islamic terror, can you at least call these guys terrorists?
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:05.340]  They're running around. They had a premeditated attack. They killed, I believe, 14 people, wounded, several others.
[02:20:05.340 --> 02:20:10.340]  Shooting at police officers, doing all these crazy, heinous things, and nobody wants to call them terrorists.
[02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:12.340]  That's exactly what they are.
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:18.340]  Well, the governor wanted to change it to holiday tree lighting and then because that he's just canceling it all together now.
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:23.340]  I mean, these people aren't crazies, though. They want to learn to ban our speech.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:28.340]  They want to set the precedent that if they can take Christmas away, they can take anything away, Jacari.
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:32.340]  And I don't want to hear the super hardcore Christians, the Pharisees out there, and I'm not blaming them.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:36.340]  I get their point saying, it's not even Christian. It's a Germanic cannon bomb.
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:41.340]  Yeah, you know, and it's, it's, it's, look, it's not who cares what it is. We don't mean it satanic.
[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:48.340]  It's a pretty tree. We're talking about Christ lights in the sky, you know, the, the wise men, all of the nativity.
[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:55.340]  The point is, it's under attack. Like, I don't even like Halloween. Folks know that it is a cultic. It is bad.
[02:20:55.340 --> 02:21:05.340]  But if folks want to try to ban it on colleges because they say it's politically incorrect, we have to defend people's rights to celebrate it.
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:13.340]  Yeah, absolutely. Because as you keep saying, as they keep chipping away against our free speech, they're telling kids on college campuses,
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:18.340]  what type of politically correct costumes that they can wear, which is completely ridiculous.
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:26.340]  People can dress up like witches and duels and cut people's heads off or pretend to do that thing. But if you dress up like a cowboy, they call that racist and offensive.
[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:27.340]  It's completely ridiculous.
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:30.340]  And it's designed to be as wide as possible.
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:36.340]  Jacari, you're out there on the ground with you and a macadoon who did this, I think, last year, and most folks said, no, leave Christmas alone.
[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:42.340]  If you go to UT, though, there'll be more whacked out. Maybe go there later and compare and then see if folks want to ban Christmas.
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:50.340]  But now you've really got the question. California has banned the Christmas tree at the Capitol and the lighting now is not going ahead.
[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:54.340]  They're not lighting it up because it must be hurtful to people.
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:22:04.340]  So say California is restricting the Christmas tree at the Capitol. The decision has just been made. Do you think it should be removed here to not hurt radical Muslims feelings?
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:10.340]  I don't see a ton of people out there, but I see some. Are there some folks you can probably go talk to, Jacari?
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:15.340]  Yeah, there's a few people. It's not very many people out here today, but we'll go and try to talk to the people who are on the location.
[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:19.340]  There was a lot last time. Okay, go ahead and walk across the street. We'll come back to you in a few minutes.
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:23.340]  Jacari, thank you. Folks, I can't even deal with this anymore.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:30.340]  I mean, I know it's supposed to be extreme to say ban the word father and mother boy and girl and ban Christmas trees.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:35.340]  But I mean, give me a break. This has got to stop at some point.
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:44.340]  The whacked out crazies that call themselves liberals are the most twisted mentally ill people I could ever imagine.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:51.340]  And everybody knows I'm not about the left drive paradigm. I'm a libertarian. I have some views you could call liberal.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:53.340]  A lot that are called conservative.
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:59.340]  But under Obama, I've seen Democrats as part of the plan. The same thing in Europe.
[02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:07.340]  This new phase of liberalism is so crazy. All I can call it is Jim Jones cult.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:12.340]  I mean, I mean, you talk about Jim Jones cult. This is classic cult programming.
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:18.340]  And there's a total assault on freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association, just normal thinking processes.
[02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:27.340]  Our children in these schools are being taught how to be mentally ill basket cases, jumping and phantoms that don't exist while their basic freedoms are being destroyed.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:31.340]  Here is a news clip about the tree and they even spin it like it's no big deal.
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:36.340]  Like he will now not light it. It will now not be lit. They're removing Christmas is what's happening.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:41.340]  I hear this war on Christmas thing 15 years ago and I was like, it's not that bad.
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:45.340]  No, it is. It is a war on Christmas here it is.
[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:58.340]  There was this dispute and I wonder if there's ever going to be any resolution in terms of what that dispute was about that happened before the suspect stormed out.
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:02.340]  Yeah, I think we're going to get the details at some point, but we don't have them yet.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:11.340]  You know, understanding of course that there's many dead people here, the victims as well as some of those who were shot and are in critical condition.
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:15.340]  I think we will eventually get some indication on what that dispute was about.
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:22.340]  This was a holiday party. Maybe it was called a Christmas party. I mean, there's so many potential triggers here.
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:27.340]  It's really unclear, but the most important thing is to circle back with Joseph as it doesn't add up.
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:36.340]  This clearly was a planned out event. I mean, you don't rush home, get the guns, have the bombs already made, have the tactical gear on without having some sort of plan.
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:43.340]  Was there something that caused that plan to happen yesterday or was that something that was going to happen?
[02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:52.340]  So now until we forget about this, they're going to spin it that they don't know of its terror until we forget. That's just what they did.
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:58.340]  By the way, they're getting the clip about the Christmas tree being banned. That was the other clip. I misunderstood that.
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:07.340]  Let's go back to Jacarie Jackson, who is in front of the Texas Capitol down there on a windy, chilly day, beautiful day out there.
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:12.340]  I wish I was out there with him. Maybe he can walk over and talk to some of those folks sitting having a picnic.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:18.340]  Jacarie, is it the last man on earth or do we have some people down there at the State House?
[02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:23.340]  It was just a few. We're planning to get over here and walk and talk a little bit. Maybe we can start moving that way now.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:26.340]  See what people have to say about the Christmas tree.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:31.340]  Don't say Christmas tree. It may be a trigger. Here we go. Jacarie Jackson, you take over.
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:36.340]  Excuse us, folks. We're just asking people what they think about the Christmas tree out here. Do you have any thoughts or opinions?
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:40.340]  I didn't know there was one. California just banned it.
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:44.340]  I think it's nice.
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:53.340]  Because of this very unfortunate shooting that happened the other day in California, they're actually canceling the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. How do you feel about that?
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:58.340]  I want Christmas trees to be lit.
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:01.340]  Do you want them to be lit? Yeah, regardless.
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:04.340]  This has nothing to do with that shooting.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.340]  That's a very good point, sir. Thank you so much.
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:09.340]  So, as the gentleman said, it had nothing to do.
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:15.340]  Now, notice, those are older folks now. I guarantee you go to UT. You'll probably get half the people, Jacarie.
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:21.340]  If it was in California, it'd be 9 out of 10, who will say actually get rid of the Christmas trees, they cause the murders.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:26.340]  And then even if they're not Muslim, they'll probably say something like, you know, Allah Akbar or something.
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:28.340]  Is it so trendy, Jacarie?
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:33.340]  Yeah. I mean, well, it's always the people who have lived through things that actually want to fight for the rights that they have.
[02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:39.340]  It's the younger people that we often find who are willing to throw those rights away, not understanding that they're there for a reason.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:43.340]  Well, that's right. And, you know, some of the old folks push the police state and they do bad things, too.
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:46.340]  And a lot of young people are either really awake or they're not awake, but it's true.
[02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:53.340]  It is young trendies of every race, color and creed that are space alien weird when it comes to getting rid of rights.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:57.340]  You know, like, let's put all the gun owners in slave camps. Yeah, let's do it.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:02.340]  Oh, yeah, we see them do all kinds of things. Like you said, let's take away the guns, let's put them in FEMA camps.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:07.340]  All the other type of shenanigans we've seen people calling for, let's ban water, all those things.
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:14.340]  So it's the kind of default response is just if you don't understand something that you don't like, it just turn around and ban it.
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:19.340]  Well, I mean, Jakari, notice those people right there didn't even believe you at first.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:25.340]  Because that's a normal response. I can't believe they just canceled the Christmas tree lighting because of the shooting.
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:30.340]  Yeah, it's kind of like they're letting these guys win, you know, because they say it's related to a Christmas party,
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:33.340]  which like as the gentleman said, had nothing to do with Christmas.
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:36.340]  This was a sick individual who had been planning this for quite some time.
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:38.340]  He's just looking for the opportune moment to strike.
[02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:41.340]  It had really nothing to do with any type of Christmas festivities.
[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:44.340]  Good guys with guns took him out. We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:47.340]  You can shoot your man on the street and your report on the refugee situation.
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:49.340]  But let me bring this up to you, Jakari.
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:57.340]  You went out to my alma mater, Anderson last week, where they have 2000 students, 300 of them from Syria and Iraq,
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:01.340]  almost all of them Sunnis, the paper reported, 600 total.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:05.340]  Now Obama won't tell the governor or other governors where he's putting them.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.340]  A lawsuit's been filed.
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:12.340]  I do believe it's gotten to this point where Homeland Security is calling our reporters in New York at Jihad areas
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:17.340]  and knows where they're at and knows their numbers, even though those aren't public with NSA systems.
[02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:24.340]  But then they won't tell the governor of Texas where the quote migrants are coming from or where they're at.
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:26.340]  Yeah, it's completely ridiculous.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:32.340]  I had a chance to talk to Syrian girl last night on the nightly news and she made a very good point that I've been echoing as well
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:39.340]  is if we would just leave people alone in their own countries, if we weren't sending Jihadis and drones to places like Pakistan and Yemen and Syria
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:45.340]  and not doing all these horrific things, people would be happily content to stay in their homelands or being forced out of there
[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:47.340]  because of policies of the Obama administration.
[02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:53.340]  And after Obama uses your tax dollars to go tear up a country, he wants to use more of your tax dollars to bring people here.
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:57.340]  But in coming full circle, they would stay at home if he hadn't messed up their countries in the first place.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:29:01.340]  Absolutely. I just got a text message from a great famous musician.
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:06.340]  And hopefully he'll come on the show because he sends me texts and I love talking to him.
[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:10.340]  He's been on the show before and he makes a lot of really great points.
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:17.340]  He says, you're nailing it on calling this leftist utilitarian power grab as a Jim Jones cult, dead on.
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:24.340]  It is a cult of all the earmarks, denial of reality, selfish bootlicking, veneration of false God and a death wish.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:31.340]  Jacarie Jackson, great job down there on the ground. I know you're about to shoot a person on the street. You're about to cover the whole situation
[02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:37.340]  with the lawsuit over the migrants, over the refugees and more.
[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:40.340]  And we'll see you back for the nightly news tonight. Jacarie Jackson, thank you.
[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:41.340]  Thank you.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:45.340]  There goes Jacarie from the Texas State House. We're going to come back and go right to your calls.
[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:48.340]  William, Tim, Kim, Noah, Adam and others. Stay with us.
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:51.340]  We're on the march. The empire's on the road.
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:55.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:27.340]  Farooq was a devout Muslim who traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned with a wife.
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:33.340]  His wife was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia before coming to the U.S.
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:37.340]  On social media accounts, Farooq describes himself as a Sunni.
[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:41.340]  The Council on American Islamic Relations immediately went into damage control.
[02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:46.340]  Muslim leaders asked that people not implicate Islam or Muslims for the mass killings,
[02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:52.340]  saying the massacre may have been work-related, mental illness or extreme ideology.

[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:10.340]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:15.340]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:34.340]  I don't need your prayers, it's true.
[02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:58.340]  Earl Haggard, he may have the best voice of country, problem is he doesn't have the best writers.
[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:00.340]  Bring out your phone calls now.
[02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:06.340]  I am really glad to be able to make this correction because I was reading it off the screen from about 15 feet away
[02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:09.340]  and didn't scan the whole article.
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.340]  And then they had another article up that looked just like it.
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:15.340]  It was all mixed together with a whole bunch of stories on screen about banning Christmas trees and lawsuits,
[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:19.340]  taking them down and Starbucks coffee cups and all the rest of it.
[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:26.340]  Brown's saying he didn't do the lighting out of respect for the victims to not go ahead and have an event
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:31.340]  because they'll have the tree lighting, so that's good, I'm actually glad they're not that insane.
[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:37.340]  The problem is they're taking Christmas trees down all over and restricting them.
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:40.340]  And we did find other headlines and other articles that were more clear.
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:44.340]  That story of the Sacramento Bee was not very clear.
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:49.340]  There's Fox News, Brown cancels Christmas tree lighting ceremony after San Bernardino shooting.
[02:34:49.340 --> 02:34:54.340]  I'll tell you what the big scandal is, though, that we know is happening.
[02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:59.340]  I'm trying to blame the right wing for this yesterday, trying to say it's not radical Islamists that's involved.
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:02.340]  Well, here's the headlines at Drudge.
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:08.340]  Terror, eyed as couples, slaughterers 14 in California, that was known this morning, the New York Post.
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:14.340]  Muslim killers recently traveled to Saudi Arabia, radicalized terrorist link.
[02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:18.340]  Well, they're really Wahhabist killers and I'm not lionizing the Shiites.
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:22.340]  It's just almost every terror attack we've seen has been Wahhabist, Saudi Arabian types.
[02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:27.340]  And the ladies from Saudi Arabia, he's from Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia.
[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:34.340]  Radicalized terrorist link with the IEDs, tactical equipment, throwing pipe bombs at the police, but not a terrorist.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:40.340]  You imagine if you or I was running around doing this and throwing pipe bombs and blowing stuff up, it'd be terrorist.
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:44.340]  You were black or white or Hispanic, it'd be terrorist.
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:49.340]  But because it's politically correct, they want to bring these folks in to create even bigger crisis to take our rights.
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:54.340]  They want to cover it up. We're going to your calls in 60 seconds, but I just want to briefly say
[02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:58.340]  we are offering free shipping across the board.
[02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:04.340]  I've excited to extend it out until the 18th, basically 15 days from now.
[02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:11.340]  If you order by the 18th books, videos, nutraceuticals, the Info Wars power station.
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:14.340]  We guys bring one of those in here, please. Thank you.
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:19.340]  If you do that, it's guaranteed to be delivered before Christmas in the lower 48.
[02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:23.340]  Now if you order it the next week or so, you can get it in Europe, you can get it in Hawaii, wherever.
[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:28.340]  It's just that the 18th of the day where it's going to get to you before Christmas.
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:34.340]  Free shipping, infowarslife.com.
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:37.340]  We have a bunch of specials that are running there right now.
[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:41.340]  30% off brain force in tonight. Try it out for yourself.
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:45.340]  Regardless, you're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:51.340]  $9.95 colloidal silver. The leading competitor of the exact same stuff is $24.95.
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:53.340]  30% off X2NationIA 9.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:57.340]  20% off Info Wars select storeable food and free shipping.
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:00.340]  Deals like this don't come around very often.
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:07.340]  And the profit we do make helps fund this operation infowarslife.com.
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:12.340]  Info Wars store.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:16.340]  Now, this is a good problem to have, but we only got a thousand of these.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:20.340]  Info Wars premium power pack super charts.
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:26.340]  We've now sold, I just checked during the break, in four days, or three and a half days, half of these.
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:30.340]  These will sell out by next week at current sales rates.
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.340]  It'll be a few months until I get more.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:40.340]  It's the Info Wars premium power pack for $119. The exact same unit that's just private level by us sells for over $150.
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:47.340]  Leading competitors that are even bigger, don't have as much power or as many plugs or flashlights cost $140 something.
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:50.340]  And we could sell those. We could sell ten different units of these.
[02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:55.340]  We got the very best with the best performance, best reviews.
[02:37:55.340 --> 02:38:00.340]  The latest cutting edge to then cut it to a price no one else has it for, not even Amazon.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:05.340]  The Info Wars premium power pack super charts, free shipping as well.
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:08.340]  You cannot beat this deal. It's in stock for a limited time.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:13.340]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:20.340]  The third the size of a briefcase, its own jumper cables internally. This is high tech.
[02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:26.340]  And I have used it personally on my car a month ago when I left the lights off with the beta unit,
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:30.340]  the original unit we approved that hadn't come in yet, you know, the mass shipment.
[02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:34.340]  So InfoWarsStore.com want to thank you all for your support.
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:39.340]  And be sure and support local affiliates as well if you want this broadcast to continue expanding against the enemy.
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:42.340]  And you're the reason it's doing that. Your prayers are support.
[02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:45.340]  And you notice I'm getting more hardcore, more focused, more reports.
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:49.340]  Our reporters are all up in their game because the enemy is moving fast.
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:51.340]  This is a key time in human history.
[02:38:51.340 --> 02:38:57.340]  We're going to just sit by while this is full tilt buggy and wish later sucking our thumbs we'd have been in the game.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:02.340]  We're in the game now. We're taking action now. We're fighting now. We're committed now.
[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:07.340]  We're ringing the alarm now. We're taking action now. We're trying to stop the Civil War now.
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:10.340]  We're trying to stop the crash of our civilization now.
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:14.340]  We're starting to try to stop the globalist one world government now.
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:17.340]  Now. We're exposing force inoculation now.
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:22.340]  We're exposing open borders now. We're exposing their plan to get our guns now.
[02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:27.340]  We're getting people elected to state houses and to federally and internationally now.
[02:39:27.340 --> 02:39:32.340]  UKIPs, the fastest growing party in England, the UK and Europe, totally patriot now.
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:34.340]  We're taking action now.
[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:39.340]  We've got people skydiving into world government events as publicity stunts now.
[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:50.340]  We're with hackers, information that leaks to us, blowing their secret plans wide open and sabotaging globalist operations with military precision and savage glee now.
[02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:53.340]  We're operating like a pack of gremlins on board their fleet ships,
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:57.340]  ripping the equipment to pieces and burning them to the ground politically now.
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:03.340]  We're hitting them hard now. We're not backing down. We're going full tilt.
[02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:08.340]  William in New York, thank you for holding. I really appreciate that. Go ahead.
[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:11.340]  Yeah, no problem. Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:16.340]  I'm calling on an article that I read yesterday.
[02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:22.340]  And, you know, one thing I know that you had the interview with Trump and I saw it. It was great.
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.340]  I read this article and it's called by Yahoo Politics, by the way.
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:29.340]  Can Donald Trump be stopped?
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:34.340]  Now, one thing that kind of set off a red flag three quarters down on the article,
[02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:40.340]  it states here from, you know, a quote from CNN, Steven Carlson,
[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:45.340]  saying that Trump would present the Republican Party with a dilemma
[02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:51.340]  whether to accept a potential nominee who may fear could stumble in a general election
[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:58.340]  or to try to install an alternative, perhaps in a coup, at the party convention in Cleveland
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:02.340]  that might enrage the GOP base and tear the party apart.
[02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:06.340]  Now, I can't believe that they will go to that extent.
[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:12.340]  I mean, would they really show their face and show America and the people
[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:18.340]  that they are really, really willing to commit to just wipe away the political process
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:23.340]  and put him out, you know, just by, it's like, you know, what is this?
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:27.340]  You know, a military coup. They're going to take out a president or something.
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:32.340]  They're going to take him out like even if he's elected in the primaries by the people
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:34.340]  and that's who they want.
[02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:38.340]  Now, I've seen articles and I've seen mainstream TV shows that say
[02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:43.340]  if Trump gets the nomination, they may not just give it to him at the RNC
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  and they're allowed to do that now.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:49.340]  Now, are they doing that to make us love him so we go after him?
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:52.340]  I mean, the psychology, there is reverse psychology here,
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:55.340]  but I'm pretty sure that's not what's happening
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:58.340]  because the way they've been lying about him and everything else,
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:03.340]  plus the rhetoric he's saying is so accurate on so many fronts.
[02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:08.340]  All I know is this, he's saying the right things and until he double crosses us,
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:10.340]  he's better than Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:13.340]  I mean, what does your gut tell you about Trump, William?
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:20.340]  Well, like you said, you know, it's best to just go with the flow,
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:27.340]  see what happens and, you know, I don't know, he doesn't sound too political to be honest.
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:31.340]  He sounds like a man on a mission and he sounds like he's going to be going forth
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:37.340]  to try as hard as he can and fight the waves that they built in Washington
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:41.340]  to bring us back to somewhat a stable country.
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:43.340]  That's right. He doesn't have to be an angel.
[02:42:43.340 --> 02:42:45.340]  All he's got to do is not want to wreck the country.
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:48.340]  Listen, this country's been so wealthy, so powerful.
[02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:50.340]  There's so much innovation.
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:53.340]  If they just don't shut our power plants off, we can compete with China.
[02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:55.340]  I mean, we literally have bowling balls tied to our feet.
[02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:58.340]  We're like a boat at the boat dock, chain to the boat dock,
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:02.340]  and we're like dragging the boat dock through the ocean, through the lake,
[02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:05.340]  cut the chain, cut the rope.
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:07.340]  We will exerge forward.
[02:43:07.340 --> 02:43:09.340]  The globalist want a managed economy.
[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:11.340]  They want to dominate us. They want to control us.
[02:43:11.340 --> 02:43:17.340]  All we've got to do is sever that and literally economy will explode.
[02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:19.340]  Let's see, then they can't dole welfare out to us.
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:22.340]  Dole select jobs out to us. Dole out select government jobs.
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:25.340]  They want to be the people controlling the purse springs.
[02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:27.340]  God bless you, William.
[02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:32.340]  Let's talk to Tim and Wyoming. Tim, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:33.340]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing?
[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:34.340]  Good, my friend. Go ahead.
[02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:36.340]  Glad to get on the air with you.
[02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:38.340]  I wanted to mention a few things.
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:42.340]  I was actually taking notes while you were talking to other guests
[02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:46.340]  or other with the jacarian various other people.
[02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:50.340]  You said to a jacari, you're about to do a person on the street.
[02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:53.340]  I just wanted to pull you in when you accidentally said something
[02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:54.340]  politically correct.
[02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.340]  No, I was being sarcastic when I said that.
[02:43:56.340 --> 02:43:58.340]  And then there weren't a lot of folks out there.
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:01.340]  Someone let him do it for the news tape is because, you know,
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:04.340]  it's more induce if you're getting a bunch of the clips together
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:07.340]  instead of him wandering around between each group of people.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.340]  We'd rather do it live if there's a big line of people,
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:12.340]  but again, it's just him walking 50 yards every time he talks to somebody.
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:15.340]  We want to head scrap that, but he's going to be doing it tonight on the news,
[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:16.340]  you know, taping it obviously.
[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:18.340]  But yeah, that's a good point.
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:19.340]  Right.
[02:44:19.340 --> 02:44:21.340]  I just wanted to make that, you know, kind of throw you a little,
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:23.340]  a little, you know, a little.
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:24.340]  No, no, you're right.
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:25.340]  It's everywhere.
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:26.340]  It's absolutely everywhere.
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:29.340]  And I realized I said it when I said it.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:30.340]  Right.
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:33.340]  Now, actually there, you were the reason I called in.
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:37.340]  I wanted to talk to you about now that this climate,
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:41.340]  climate change and terrorism, supposed,
[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:45.340]  supposed mix, supposed combination.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:47.340]  Now, the question I have is who are the climate terrorists?
[02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:49.340]  Wouldn't that be the people that are telling us?
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:51.340]  I mean, I say they're climate terrorists.
[02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:55.340]  And David Knight used the term crony climatism, which is,
[02:44:55.340 --> 02:44:56.340]  which is pretty good.
[02:44:56.340 --> 02:44:59.340]  But I mean, they're, they're climate terrorists because they're telling us
[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:02.340]  the climate is our fault.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:03.340]  It's not the sun.
[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:04.340]  It's not anything real.
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:05.340]  It's all, it's all.
[02:45:05.340 --> 02:45:07.340]  Yeah, they're telling us we're the terrorists.
[02:45:07.340 --> 02:45:10.340]  They're telling us we're guilty and they're going to organize things to stop us
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:14.340]  and organize civilization around demonizing the human condition
[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:15.340]  and human activity.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.340]  And then they claim the jihadists are attacking because of climate change
[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:20.340]  without a shred of any proof.
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:21.340]  It's total horse manure.
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:25.340]  The Western governments brought the jihadis in to overthrow Syria.
[02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:30.340]  I mean, they are the authors of what's happening telling us it's our fault
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:33.340]  because we cause climate change and cause the terrorists to attack
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:35.340]  by extension saying we're terrorists.
[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:40.340]  Yes, it is total buffoon level false reality fraud.
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:47.340]  And they put out posthumous postulates, you know, dead postulates on purpose
[02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:50.340]  because they cannot be debated because they're so stupid.
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:54.340]  It's like saying porcupig from the moon, pee-pee on the earth.
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:55.340]  And that's why the terrorists attacked.
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:58.340]  I mean, how do you even debate that?
[02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:02.340]  You know, it's just totally stupid, but they have unified media
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:05.340]  and red carpets and jumbo trons and attack helicopters
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:09.340]  and jets flying overhead and surveillance blimps with eating caviar
[02:46:09.340 --> 02:46:11.340]  saying you can't have food.
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:12.340]  It hurts the earth.
[02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:13.340]  Mwah, mwah, mwah.
[02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:17.340]  The literal marion-twanette may not have said let him eat cake,
[02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:18.340]  but Obama sure did.
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:19.340]  Hollande sure did.
[02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:21.340]  And again, people say, well, this is over the top.
[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:22.340]  It's meant to make us rebel.
[02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:23.340]  No, it's not.
[02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.340]  It's meant to dominate and break our will.
[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:27.340]  See, we're awakened upset.
[02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:30.340]  But to the average zombie, they just get more conditioned,
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:32.340]  more prepared.
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:34.340]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:35.340]  Right, right.
[02:46:35.340 --> 02:46:36.340]  Of course.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:37.340]  Now, you use the term zombies.
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:38.340]  I agree with that.
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:41.340]  I mean, I like to term mind control zombies because mind control
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:46.340]  by television, by mainstream media, by newspapers, by magazines,
[02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:51.340]  by whatever the Fedgov, so to speak, umbrella
[02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:53.340]  or the globalist umbrella throws over our face,
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:56.340]  puts it in front of our face so we don't see reality.
[02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:57.340]  They throw that at us.
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:02.340]  I use the term lemmings basically because lemmings will flood over a cliff.
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:06.340]  One lemming turning and going the other direction is unheard of.
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:10.340]  But I think that the lemmings today, I mean, we're headed towards the cliff
[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:13.340]  and there's no boat at the bottom for us to land in.
[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:15.340]  I like the boat analogy that you used earlier,
[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:17.340]  chained to the dock and can't go anywhere.
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:20.340]  But what about the people who are behind us in the boat
[02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:22.340]  while we're trying to get away?
[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:26.340]  We're trying to roll away and get to the shore of freedom, so to speak.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:29.340]  And they're standing behind us with axes chopping through the bottom of the boat.
[02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:31.340]  So we think, what about those people?
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.340]  We need to throw them overboard.
[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:34.340]  They're pretending they're with us.
[02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:35.340]  They jump in the boat with us.
[02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:38.340]  Then they say, oh, yes, we're coming along
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:42.340]  and we're going to bring these hatchets along so we can chop down trees
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:44.340]  and build new boats when we get to the other shore.
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:47.340]  That's what they do because they're in central control.
[02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:50.340]  They see any other wealth we have or any other independence or freedom
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:52.340]  as something they don't run.
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:57.340]  It's why power companies have been caught, especially Big Oil
[02:47:57.340 --> 02:48:01.340]  and the wind companies lobbying to ban fireplaces
[02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:05.340]  and lobbying to ban cook stoves and lobbying to ban barbecue pits.
[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:08.340]  They're just making a monopoly on energy where we're totally controlled by them.
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:11.340]  It's called enslavement.
[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:13.340]  It's called domestication.
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:15.340]  It's called domination.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:21.340]  It's called being made absolutely dependent and kept as a prisoner.
[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:23.340]  Thank you for the call, Tim.
[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:24.340]  NOAA in Oregon.
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:25.340]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:27.340]  Thank you for calling.
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:28.340]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:29.340]  This is my first call.
[02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:35.340]  I can't directly connect yesterday's shooter to the information I'm going to provide.
[02:48:35.340 --> 02:48:39.340]  But when you paint the background with the facts of what's been happening
[02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:43.340]  in San Bernardino County for the last three years, it's pretty suspicious.
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:45.340]  The album is...
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:46.340]  Wait a minute.
[02:48:46.340 --> 02:48:47.340]  I'm going to let you have the floor here, sir.
[02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:51.340]  But are you telling me you believe the for-hood shooter and admitted jihadist
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:53.340]  who talked to the head of Al Qaeda for two years
[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:56.340]  and killed 14 people that that was a terror attack?
[02:48:56.340 --> 02:48:58.340]  Because you're a conspiracy theorist if you say that.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:01.340]  I'm going to ignore the logic, the facts, the admissions,
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:04.340]  and I'm going to laugh at you like Rachel Maddow and say you're a racist.
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:08.340]  Okay, so it doesn't matter how many radical Muslims kill people.
[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:10.340]  I have the moral control.
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:14.340]  Like Carl Rove said, I control history and I'm saying the moon is made of cheese.
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:18.340]  I don't care what you say because I have a term, conspiracy theory,
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.340]  that makes me an intellectual god.
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:22.340]  Now, sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:24.340]  Well, that works. They might as well stick with it.
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:25.340]  Yes.
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:31.340]  The Al Nour Islamic Center in Ontario, California is one of the biggest mosques in the area.
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:35.340]  They attempted to expand in Chino in 2013.
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:39.340]  An appeal was filed claiming that multiple zoning issues were ignored
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:43.340]  by the local planning commission that had originally granted
[02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:46.340]  a temporary operating permit to this mosque.
[02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:52.340]  The appeal that was done by the neighborhood was successful
[02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:54.340]  and the permit was denied.
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:59.340]  The Islamic center chairman was clothed as saying in the local paper,
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:04.340]  I believe that the issue is not the septic tank but rather Islamophobia.
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:06.340]  They think Islam is going to come to their neighborhood
[02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.340]  and it's going to destroy their culture.
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:10.340]  This neighborhood for some reason doesn't like us.
[02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:13.340]  Otherwise, why are they filing one lawsuit after another,
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:16.340]  wasting their money, appeal after appeal?
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:21.340]  In 2015, after that case was completed,
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:27.340]  the local neighborhood came together as a group called Source.
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:30.340]  They have our unique community environment in Anagram.
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:34.340]  They were an unnamed group of citizens that were listed as the plaintiffs
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:39.340]  in a 2015 appeals case claiming that they did not receive adequate compensation
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:44.340]  for various case fees, winning $19,190.
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:48.340]  Listen, I'm going to come back to you briefly now to put a bow on this.
[02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:51.340]  Specifically, what are you saying you think really happened out there with the shooting?
[02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:54.340]  I'm sorry, it's not terror and it's not a shooting.
[02:50:54.340 --> 02:51:20.340]  What do you think happened out there in the liberal gift?
[02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:24.340]  This year, due to the extreme popularity of giving I.D. Stronghold wallets and clutches
