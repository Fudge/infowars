[00:00.000 --> 00:08.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, November 23rd, 2021.
[00:08.080 --> 00:13.680]  You know, a lot of you are tuned in today thinking I'm going to be talking a lot about
[00:13.680 --> 00:21.080]  the January 6th witch hunt committee subpoenaing myself and how they're drooling on national
[00:21.080 --> 00:23.240]  TV hoping I get arrested for something.
[00:23.240 --> 00:25.720]  It's all part of their globalist communist purge.
[00:25.720 --> 00:29.560]  And I'm going to cover some of that with Roger Stone in hour number two.
[00:29.560 --> 00:33.240]  But that's that's not our top stories.
[00:33.240 --> 00:36.600]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the fact the globalist are gearing up to launch new bio
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.520]  weapon attacks on us and are establishing UN run martial law worldwide.
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.840]  As we told you, they would 20 plus months ago when they launched this attack.
[00:45.840 --> 00:49.160]  And they've got all these other distractions and diversions going to cover up the Gisling
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.720]  Maxwell pedophile ring story will be breaking down next segment as well.
[00:53.720 --> 00:56.120]  Paul Watson also joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:56.120 --> 00:58.160]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:58.160 --> 01:07.280]  Here is a key Gregory's report.
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.920]  Before recent headlines, most of us haven't been thinking much about smallpox.
[01:12.920 --> 01:19.680]  But an important timeline of events published by Corey Diggs shows us how the same foundations,
[01:19.680 --> 01:27.800]  corporations and NGOs responsible for COVID-19 have been very busy with smallpox since June
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.480]  of 2001, when the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Johns Hopkins, and
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.000]  answer, who was awarded the majority of money for Operation Warp Speed, simulated a smallpox
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.760]  attack on U.S. citizens named Dark Winter, we're about to go into a dark winter, a dark
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.760]  winter and begin preparing for a smallpox attack.
[01:52.760 --> 02:00.280]  In September of 2007, the FDA licensed a new modern smallpox vaccine made by Sanofi
[02:00.280 --> 02:01.280]  Pasteur.
[02:01.280 --> 02:08.880]  In 2014, six vials of smallpox are found in a cardboard box at the NIH and transferred
[02:08.880 --> 02:10.800]  to the CDC.
[02:10.800 --> 02:17.400]  Months later, the first antiviral drug used to treat smallpox was created, funded by Bill
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.840]  Gates and the Wellcome Trust.
[02:19.840 --> 02:27.600]  On October 6, 2017, emergent biosolutions, responsible for a vaccine that injured over
[02:27.600 --> 02:35.080]  300,000 soldiers, acquired the smallpox vaccine contract from Sanofi Pasteur.
[02:35.080 --> 02:43.120]  In July of 2018, the FDA approves a drug to treat smallpox made by SEGA Technologies,
[02:43.120 --> 02:51.120]  who signs a contract to maintain a stockpile of 1.7 million doses of their antiviral drug.
[02:51.120 --> 02:58.960]  September 3, 2019, emergent biosolutions is awarded $2 billion to deliver their smallpox
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.840]  vaccine into the national stockpile.
[03:02.840 --> 03:08.000]  Weeks later, one of only two labs in the world known to store live samples of the very old
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.880]  virus that causes smallpox suffers an explosion.
[03:12.880 --> 03:19.320]  And the FDA approves a vaccine to prevent both smallpox and monkeypox.
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.760]  In March of 2021, Merck secures over $300 million from the Biden administration and
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.600]  the Bill Gates Foundation to convert, upgrade, and equip their facilities.
[03:31.600 --> 03:37.760]  In June of 2021, the FDA approves the antiviral treatment for smallpox, which was funded by
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.920]  Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust in 2014.
[03:41.920 --> 03:48.320]  In July, Oxford University assists SEGA in expanding use of their monkeypox drugs into
[03:48.320 --> 03:50.980]  the Central African Republic.
[03:50.980 --> 03:56.520]  On Halloween, Joe Biden signs an executive order to exercise authority over the national
[03:56.520 --> 03:59.000]  defense stockpile.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.240]  Weeks later, Bill Gates warns governments of a smallpox terror attack.
[04:05.240 --> 04:11.280]  Seven days after that, several vials of smallpox are incidentally discovered at the Merck
[04:11.280 --> 04:14.120]  facility in Pennsylvania.
[04:14.120 --> 04:19.500]  The very next day, a rare case of monkeypox is discovered in Maryland.
[04:19.500 --> 04:23.840]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[04:23.840 --> 04:31.040]  Well, the, the idea of a, a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because
[04:31.040 --> 04:34.160]  they're a pathogen with a high death rate would be ticked.
[04:34.160 --> 04:39.840]  Now the good news is most of the work we're going to do to be ready for pandemic two,
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.320]  I call this pandemic one.
[04:43.320 --> 04:59.680]  For info wars.com, this is Greg Reese.

[06:25.360 --> 06:50.280]  Next Tuesday, November 23rd, info wars, because there's a war on for your mind, well, I am
[06:50.280 --> 07:03.080]  being persecuted along with Owen Schreuer and James O'Keefe and so many other individuals
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.360]  because I'm a loyal American and because I stand against this globalist takeover.
[07:09.360 --> 07:10.640]  They will not be successful.
[07:10.640 --> 07:16.080]  They can't be too many children and others will die under the chemical biological attack
[07:16.080 --> 07:19.640]  we're now under.
[07:19.640 --> 07:26.080]  American Union led by Germany is now saying the next move will be forced injection with
[07:26.080 --> 07:32.040]  the COVID-19 genetically engineered bio weapon mass creating as a vaccine at the hands of
[07:32.040 --> 07:36.080]  the military and police that will trigger a bloody civil war, which has been the plan
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.760]  they want an excuse to go around and start killing people in mass.
[07:39.760 --> 07:42.160]  They're triggering a civil war worldwide.
[07:42.160 --> 07:48.560]  How did I know 21 months ago and literally put out hundreds of reports and segments on
[07:48.560 --> 07:57.080]  these shows, hundreds saying that by the winter of 2021, you'll have them going around starting
[07:57.080 --> 08:03.120]  to do mass arrest of unvaccinated and taking them to camps because it was in the United
[08:03.120 --> 08:08.960]  Nations documents and even the CDC documents because they follow the UN orders.
[08:08.960 --> 08:11.560]  They call it the shield project.
[08:11.560 --> 08:13.800]  Now it's happening in Europe.
[08:13.800 --> 08:16.520]  It's happening in Australia and it's happening in Canada.
[08:16.520 --> 08:19.920]  It's happening.
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.320]  That's a stack right here.
[08:24.320 --> 08:27.360]  German government says prepare for forced inoculations.
[08:27.360 --> 08:28.360]  No one will be allowed.
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.640]  It's not what we're going to lock you in your house if you don't take it.
[08:30.640 --> 08:33.480]  We're coming to give it to you.
[08:33.480 --> 08:36.560]  And the military started arresting and taking people out of their homes that haven't taken
[08:36.560 --> 08:37.760]  the injections.
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.400]  That's coming up.
[08:39.400 --> 08:43.720]  The Gisling Maxwell trial confirming the Clintons went to the island when they said
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.440]  they didn't and were involved in the trafficking of children.
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.440]  It's all coming out.
[08:48.440 --> 08:51.400]  That's what they're trying to distract us with all the rest of the garbage.
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.880]  That's going to be broken down.
[08:52.880 --> 08:58.400]  Paul Watson is going to join us to cover a host of issues at the bottom of the hour.
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.720]  Then Roger Stone, next hour, because he's also been subpoenaed by this witch hunt and
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.880]  what that really signifies and they're hoping to try to claim that if we testify, we say
[09:09.880 --> 09:17.680]  something not true and so they can then indict us not for leading an insurrection, but for
[09:17.680 --> 09:19.080]  supposedly lying to Congress.
[09:19.080 --> 09:20.880]  That's their plan.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.320]  Will I plead the Fifth Amendment?
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.240]  We'll talk about it next hour.
[09:26.240 --> 09:28.840]  It's all coming up today.
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.280]  And then in the third and fourth hour, we're going to take you into the matrix with the
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.680]  keys of how to defeat it with reset wars.
[09:35.680 --> 09:41.200]  The first big in-depth look, you do not want to miss the third and fourth hour, most powerful
[09:41.200 --> 09:42.200]  info ever.
[09:42.200 --> 10:06.880]  Here's something I shot this morning where I'm calling for a new January 6th investigation.
[10:06.880 --> 10:09.300]  It's time for the truth to come out.
[10:09.300 --> 10:16.480]  It's time for the American people to demand a real January 6th investigation.
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.800]  Because if you look into what really happened that day, it was a deep state operation that
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.840]  almost triggered an extremely violent event at the Capitol.
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.840]  The terrible events of that day, as bad as they were, were microscopic compared to what
[10:30.840 --> 10:33.920]  the deep state was actually planning.
[10:33.920 --> 10:40.120]  And that's why they're fighting so hard to run this fake committee, this kangaroo court.
[10:40.120 --> 10:46.560]  That's why they are making so much noise about the general public being terrorist, the American
[10:46.560 --> 10:53.280]  people not being trustworthy, and moms at PTA meetings being the number one terror threat.
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.480]  It's because they know the truth about January 6th comes out, which is coming out thanks
[10:57.480 --> 10:59.200]  to Tucker Carlson and others.
[10:59.200 --> 11:01.760]  Their entire deep state is going down.
[11:01.760 --> 11:10.800]  Just like Russiagate, January 6th was their operation.
[11:10.800 --> 11:19.280]  The January 6th witch hunt committee makes Joe McCarthy blush from his grave.
[11:19.280 --> 11:28.240]  It is a complete and absolute fishing expedition trying to demonize populist Americans that
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.240]  want our country to be sovereign and want to put our nation first.
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.240]  It is 21st century mass persecution.
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.360]  Now as you've probably seen on the news, it was the top story yesterday, not the man that
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.360]  ran over 40 plus people killing five because they were white in Wisconsin.
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.200]  No ladies and gentlemen, the story was Alex Jones and Roger Stone subpoenaed by the January
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.200]  6th committee.
[11:52.200 --> 11:54.140]  Here's the problem with that.
[11:54.140 --> 11:59.720]  They will claim I lie about something to the committee, which isn't even true.
[11:59.720 --> 12:05.720]  I wouldn't lie, and then they will have the FBI and the Justice Department indict me for
[12:05.720 --> 12:06.720]  lying to Congress.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.720]  I'm not stupid.
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.240]  So, they've been asking why other people aren't declaring the 5th.
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.400]  I'm probably going to declare the 5th not because I've done anything wrong, but because
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.720]  these people are political criminals that have an axe to grind and have been bragging
[12:20.720 --> 12:22.440]  everywhere they want to put me in prison.
[12:22.440 --> 12:23.440]  Okay?
[12:23.440 --> 12:24.440]  I'm 37 years old.
[12:24.440 --> 12:27.160]  Don't have any felonies, any of those issues.
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.240]  I'm a good person, a family man, and I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in
[12:31.240 --> 12:32.240]  prison.
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.240]  No, sir.
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.760]  Don't want to have that happen.
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.280]  And so, I don't want to testify before them because they will lie and say that I lie.
[12:40.280 --> 12:41.680]  Here's the other problem though.
[12:41.680 --> 12:44.560]  I want a January 6th investigation.
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.320]  I want to know why the National Guard will refuse the President Trump when he asks for
[12:49.320 --> 12:50.320]  him on record.
[12:50.320 --> 12:53.560]  And then later, the head of the National Guard in D.C. Lydon said that Trump hadn't asked
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.920]  or that he couldn't supply him, and just last week admitted that Trump indeed did ask for
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.920]  him and was refused.
[12:59.920 --> 13:04.360]  I want to know why half the Capitol Police were sent, for quote, traffic control by D.C.
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.360]  that controls them that day, and the Capitol had half the police they had.
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.800]  I want to know who ordered the stand down of the police and let the people in the building.
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.840]  I want to know about the FBI, infiltrating groups, and the federal documents that have
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.960]  come out that indeed they did have informants inside.
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.600]  They brought the same FBI agent from Michigan who set up the false flag against Governor
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.240]  Whitmer to run the operations on January 6th.
[13:27.240 --> 13:30.480]  I want a real investigation, but this isn't a real investigation.
[13:30.480 --> 13:36.560]  They have a few hand-picked Republicans like Liz Cheney and others that are horrible neocons,
[13:36.560 --> 13:39.760]  and they are basically setting up a show trial here.
[13:39.760 --> 13:45.240]  So, I'm on air weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at infowars.com.
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.680]  We're still on the air in many ways, bigger than ever, telling the truth, laying out the
[13:48.680 --> 13:53.760]  documents, covering what's really happening, and I really do want to testify to Congress.
[13:53.760 --> 14:00.200]  And so, if they let me testify live in front of the cameras or depose me on C-SPAN, I will
[14:00.200 --> 14:01.640]  probably do it.
[14:01.640 --> 14:04.080]  That way they can't twist what I said later.
[14:04.080 --> 14:06.840]  But I've seen what they've done to other people, and there's no way I'm going to go
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.160]  behind closed doors with chif and all these other crazy people and swallow as well the
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.400]  Chinese agent and let them sit there and claim that I've done something wrong, or claim
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.720]  that I lied to Congress.
[14:18.720 --> 14:20.960]  I want an investigation of them.
[14:20.960 --> 14:21.960]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.560]  The deep state that controls them and ran the fake Russiagate operation also provocateur
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.560]  January 6.
[14:27.560 --> 14:32.440]  I want to know why the groups I was working with, with Ali Alexander on record, had the
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.400]  permit on the edge of the Capitol by the Supreme Court where Trump thought he was going, where
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.240]  I told the crowds, don't go in the building, go over here, let's be peaceful.
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.000]  They know all this, and they can't stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.280]  This country is in an emergency.
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.320]  They never want us to have a real election in 11 months.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.720]  They want to set up this tyranny.
[14:51.720 --> 14:54.000]  They want to brand their opposition as terrorists.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.880]  They want to have a political purge, and it's wrong.
[14:55.880 --> 15:01.600]  So I want a real January 6 investigation that's bipartisan, and I would be happy to testify
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.240]  before that under oath.
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.920]  But I'm not a fool, I'm not an idiot, and I'm not about to be set up by the political,
[15:07.920 --> 15:12.040]  globalist criminals in Congress, the Democrats, that have sold this nation out to China.
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.120]  This whole thing is about distracting from Biden, the stolen election, the gas prices
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.600]  that have doubled, the incredible inflation, the borders collapsing, the pedophile rings
[15:20.600 --> 15:24.040]  running around all over the country, and this whole New World Order agenda is selling our
[15:24.040 --> 15:25.160]  country out.
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.040]  You people are traders, you signed on to the wrong team, America's awake to you, so good
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.080]  luck trying to put the patriot leadership in prison.
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.240]  We're going to peacefully have a velvet revolution in this country of ideology and of culture,
[15:38.240 --> 15:41.920]  and we're already winning, and your New World Order is destined to fail.
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.760]  Your great reset is nothing but the establishment trying to take over and trying to suppress
[15:46.760 --> 15:47.920]  the people.

[16:57.720 --> 17:06.560]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was de-platformed.
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.440]  Infowars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching
[17:11.440 --> 17:12.440]  their attack.
[17:12.440 --> 17:18.440]  Three years later, an infowars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience, but

[17:24.640 --> 17:28.960]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.040]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.360]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[17:36.360 --> 17:37.360]  We don't think so.
[17:37.360 --> 17:42.600]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't
[17:42.600 --> 17:43.600]  let them.
[17:43.600 --> 17:46.440]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[17:55.160 --> 17:56.160]  And God bless America.
[17:56.160 --> 18:06.160]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[18:06.160 --> 18:09.120]  It's very, very simple, but the multiple don't know.
[18:09.120 --> 18:15.840]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[18:15.840 --> 18:22.400]  of dollars in other major currencies, and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.360]  property, energy.
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.360]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past, they created thousands of
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.400]  trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market, so they never allowed
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.440]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.920]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[18:43.920 --> 18:49.920]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.440]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund to be the only things
[18:54.440 --> 18:55.440]  left standing.
[18:55.440 --> 18:56.440]  This is the Great Reset.
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.440]  This is what's happening now.
[18:57.440 --> 18:58.440]  We warn everyone.
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.440]  It's the only way to stop it.
[19:01.440 --> 19:05.440]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[19:05.440 --> 19:11.360]  When we look at the world system now, openly announcing the Mark of the Beast, everything
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.360]  that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us
[19:16.360 --> 19:22.360]  bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics,
[19:22.360 --> 19:26.560]  our very future over to them.
[19:26.560 --> 19:28.320]  They want control of appropriation.
[19:28.320 --> 19:31.280]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.080]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.760]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image, and given free will and make
[19:42.760 --> 19:48.120]  no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so
[19:48.120 --> 19:53.160]  that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[19:53.160 --> 20:02.560]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[20:02.560 --> 20:31.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:31.560 --> 20:42.760]  Well, I got really fired up yesterday when I learned that the witch hunt McCarthy 2.0
[20:42.760 --> 20:43.760]  was after me.
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.600]  I mean, I knew that was coming and there's subpoenas coming in and all the rest of it
[20:49.600 --> 20:53.520]  because we'd already had the FBI and Justice Department, all of them subpoenaing us and
[20:53.520 --> 20:57.360]  sending us letters and just dealing with it with the lawyers and the amount of money
[20:57.360 --> 21:00.840]  it cost to have them just dig through everything so you certify we don't have what you're
[21:00.840 --> 21:01.840]  asking for.
[21:01.840 --> 21:05.800]  And people say, oh, well, just it's a bunch of BS, don't comply, well, then they swat
[21:05.800 --> 21:06.800]  to you.
[21:06.800 --> 21:10.520]  So, let it be known we're not holding anything back, they don't have an excuse to come here
[21:10.520 --> 21:12.000]  with 40 dudes and guns.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  They know that.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.560]  That's why they let Owen turn himself in because we're not looking for a fight with
[21:16.560 --> 21:17.560]  the FBI.
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.160]  If they want to destroy the country and destroy their children's future, we're going to try
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.120]  to politically stop them because we believe getting in a physical fight with them is what
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.280]  the globalists want.
[21:26.280 --> 21:33.560]  Because we're good Americans, we're understanding that discretion is the greater part of valor.
[21:33.560 --> 21:38.440]  But the deep state with the poison shots and the rest of it is really pushing towards the
[21:38.440 --> 21:44.080]  physical confrontation because they're losing the political war for hearts and minds.
[21:44.080 --> 21:45.920]  We're winning big time.
[21:45.920 --> 21:47.080]  This is a football game.
[21:47.080 --> 21:52.440]  We're in the fourth quarter and we're like 60 points ahead, okay?
[21:52.440 --> 21:57.200]  The only hope they've got is that our team starts biting and hitting and stabbing the
[21:57.200 --> 22:00.240]  other team so that our team gets disqualified.
[22:00.240 --> 22:02.840]  They've lost.
[22:02.840 --> 22:04.760]  They know that.
[22:04.760 --> 22:09.720]  Their house of cards is coming down and I'm not the type of person that sits up here like
[22:09.720 --> 22:13.200]  some propagandist and tells you we're winning when we're not.
[22:13.200 --> 22:20.160]  I've been on there 28 years and the first 22 or so I told you we were losing.
[22:20.160 --> 22:25.320]  The tide began to turn about eight years ago and the hearts and minds, we're winning.
[22:25.320 --> 22:28.920]  And I can tell you the average person that works in the federal government, whether they're
[22:28.920 --> 22:32.080]  the military or in the federal agencies, it's not a bad person.
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.200]  In fact, they're more awake on average, I found, than the general public because they've
[22:35.200 --> 22:36.200]  seen the corruption.
[22:36.200 --> 22:37.200]  What do they do?
[22:37.200 --> 22:40.000]  Get out so the bad guys can be put in?
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.720]  It's a very small group at the top that is executing all this and a very large group
[22:44.720 --> 22:47.680]  of corrupt Justice Department lawyers.
[22:47.680 --> 22:50.960]  But the federal marshals and even the average FBI agent, they're not our enemy.
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.920]  I don't say that to kiss their ass.
[22:52.920 --> 22:59.320]  I say that because we don't want to be lured in to a civil war, which is what China wants.
[22:59.320 --> 23:04.640]  And I've got so many incredible articles here today, so much.
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.880]  And I sit here before I go live on air after hours and hours and hours and hours of research
[23:09.880 --> 23:11.880]  yesterday evening and today.
[23:11.880 --> 23:16.560]  I was up working at 1 a.m. last night because this is important stuff.
[23:16.560 --> 23:21.480]  And I was up at 5.30, studying until my younger daughter got up at 7 o'clock and I made her
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.480]  breakfast.
[23:22.480 --> 23:26.400]  I had to take an hour out, hash browns, bacon, eggs, bagels with cream cheese.
[23:26.400 --> 23:29.960]  We just pig out every morning at a great time with my four-year-old daughter because that's
[23:29.960 --> 23:30.960]  where I just recharge.
[23:30.960 --> 23:33.600]  I spent an hour whether just eating and playing in the backyard.
[23:33.600 --> 23:37.040]  It was like an eon of just delight compared to all this evil.
[23:37.040 --> 23:39.080]  But that's what I fight for.
[23:39.080 --> 23:40.520]  That's who I fight for.
[23:40.520 --> 23:46.720]  And if I need to die for her, if I need to get put in prison or killed, cards on the
[23:46.720 --> 23:53.600]  table, baby, chips on the board, everything in, everything in, and it's not even a question
[23:53.600 --> 23:57.760]  when you get to that point of the fact that they're coming after our children.
[23:57.760 --> 24:01.200]  So all over the world, they're announcing under globalist control that they're going
[24:01.200 --> 24:05.560]  to start injecting newborn babies with the deadly shots that erase their immunity and
[24:05.560 --> 24:07.080]  just destroy them for life.
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.720]  It's on record.
[24:09.720 --> 24:18.520]  So people ask as a 47-year-old man that's been around the world and seen a lot of stuff
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.360]  and been through a lot of pain, which made me stronger, by the way.
[24:21.360 --> 24:23.840]  All that pain in hindsight now is the best part of my life.
[24:23.840 --> 24:27.120]  I didn't enjoy it at the time, but it made me better.
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.840]  I would be the biggest cowered piece of crap ever if I didn't stand up for children who
[24:32.840 --> 24:34.280]  don't have anybody to stand up for them.
[24:34.280 --> 24:36.960]  So I'm going to tell you all, you're on the right side of history.
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.960]  Everybody knows it.
[24:37.960 --> 24:38.960]  They can see it.
[24:38.960 --> 24:39.960]  They can feel it.
[24:39.960 --> 24:45.360]  They can analytically document it all for themselves, and we know we're in a time of
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.120]  great evil trying to grab everything it can and take it down with it.
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.640]  So let me just give you a gestalt of the news.
[24:54.640 --> 24:57.360]  There is a Breitbart article that I read this morning.
[24:57.360 --> 24:58.360]  I don't have the full article.
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.440]  You guys print it for me because I didn't print all the pages for some reason.
[25:02.440 --> 25:08.360]  I've got a Breitbart article that is the most important article of the day.
[25:08.360 --> 25:11.800]  And if you're a new listener that just tuned in this week or today, you're like, well,
[25:11.800 --> 25:13.280]  wait, you said written house is a diversion.
[25:13.280 --> 25:14.960]  Well, he's important for the Second Amendment.
[25:14.960 --> 25:16.280]  He's important for self-defense.
[25:16.280 --> 25:17.720]  He's a great young man.
[25:17.720 --> 25:24.040]  But compared to them coming after hundreds of millions of children with poisoned shots,
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.680]  his pain is a drop of blood compared to an ocean of blood.
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.240]  But how China and the Democrats have responded in lockstep together is a rosetta stone through
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.320]  which a keyhole through which you can see their whole agenda.
[25:36.320 --> 25:40.080]  This is the most important article of the day because you understand this, you understand
[25:40.080 --> 25:41.080]  everything.
[25:41.080 --> 25:43.000]  So let me hit it right now.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.440]  China in thousands of articles a week is saying America's done, America's over, America's
[25:49.440 --> 25:53.520]  so racially divided that we will burn up and be over.
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.920]  And they're telling investors that and they're telling other governments that and they're
[25:56.920 --> 26:03.240]  screaming that from the rooftops and the mountain tops and the hilltops and the valleys.
[26:03.240 --> 26:04.240]  And who is China?
[26:04.240 --> 26:05.560]  There were the globalists have invested.
[26:05.560 --> 26:07.080]  There were Hollywood's invested.
[26:07.080 --> 26:10.560]  There were the New World Order has set up their new system.
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.760]  And China owns four of the six big production houses that if you go look at who owns the
[26:14.760 --> 26:20.240]  movie houses that fund all this black on white violence movies and whites are the devil
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.960]  shows and all these TV shows and programs, it's the communist Chinese regime, which is
[26:25.960 --> 26:28.080]  the most homogeneous group of people in the world.
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.480]  And I'm not against the Chinese that on average they just want to be with Chinese.
[26:31.480 --> 26:32.840]  Okay, that's what you're comfortable with.
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.720]  It's who your mama and daddy was at your culture, I get it.
[26:35.720 --> 26:40.120]  You're not bad because most of you decide you want to stay who you are.
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.120]  They don't like the Koreans.
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.120]  They don't like the Japanese.
[26:42.120 --> 26:43.120]  They don't like the Russians.
[26:43.120 --> 26:44.120]  They like Chinese.
[26:44.120 --> 26:46.640]  They're the oldest culture in the world.
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.480]  And they get that their strength is the fact that they are unified.
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.240]  So they're financing with the left and paying billions a week, billions a week.
[26:55.240 --> 27:00.200]  There's thousands of programs every year that whites of the devil kill them, get them.
[27:00.200 --> 27:02.520]  And the weak minded buy into that to divide the country.
[27:02.520 --> 27:03.520]  That's all it is.
[27:03.520 --> 27:04.520]  And China brags.
[27:04.520 --> 27:05.520]  They say America's over.
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.960]  They will be destroyed in a race war within the next year because that's their plan.
[27:10.960 --> 27:12.560]  China can't launch nuclear missiles at us.
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.160]  We get in a war with them and destroy them, but they can release a bio weapon with the
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.880]  China files, Bill Gates and the globalist and the public president Biden they put in.
[27:21.880 --> 27:26.360]  So this is the takedown of America and the end of the country.
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.840]  So all the Justice Department lawyers and all the FBI and all you can pretend this
[27:31.840 --> 27:37.080]  and say if you get Trump and get Alex Jones and, you know, get Owen Schreuer and get James
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.160]  O'Keefe and if you get us all why you'll be a real boy finally, you'll be in charge
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.160]  of the new America.
[27:44.160 --> 27:45.160]  No.
[27:45.160 --> 27:46.840]  They always get rid of the traders that helped bring down the country.
[27:46.840 --> 27:48.640]  They never leave you in place.
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.040]  In fact, I know after you guys have brought the country down, I'll be approached one last
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.200]  time to join the globalist.
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.200]  I know that.
[27:55.200 --> 27:57.400]  I'm just going to say no, I want to leave the country.
[27:57.400 --> 28:00.480]  If we lose it all, I'm just, and they'll probably just kill me on the spot.
[28:00.480 --> 28:01.480]  But I know how this works.
[28:01.480 --> 28:03.360]  I know how the real elite operate.
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.360]  Okay.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.360]  You guys don't.
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.680]  You kiss the ass of the group taking the country down in your fools.
[28:08.680 --> 28:12.200]  You're the idiots that lower the drawbridge for the Huns to come in at midnight.
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.560]  And the first thing the Huns do after they capture the city is arrest you and slit your
[28:16.560 --> 28:18.720]  throat.
[28:18.720 --> 28:22.560]  You think the Huns, you think the globalist, you think the new world order respects people
[28:22.560 --> 28:25.040]  that lower drawbridges on their own people.
[28:25.040 --> 28:27.240]  You are the curse.
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.320]  You are the plague, as Cicero said 2000 plus years ago.
[28:31.320 --> 28:34.080]  So this article, we'll cover it later, we've got a bunch of big guests on.
[28:34.080 --> 28:35.080]  But this is everything.
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.800]  Our enemies bragging how they're financing all this race crap.
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.120]  And I'm not stupid, I'm not going to play into it.
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.280]  But it's getting rough, man.
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.240]  I tell you, white folks are getting beat up, stabbed, and attacked everywhere.
[28:49.240 --> 28:52.280]  And the system is there trying to bring this country down.
[28:52.280 --> 28:53.280]  And it's so sad.
[28:53.280 --> 28:57.280]  We need to rally together against the globalists and restore the republic if we have any sense
[28:57.280 --> 28:58.280]  left in us.
[28:58.280 --> 28:59.280]  Hey, everybody.
[28:59.280 --> 29:00.280]  Confused?
[29:00.280 --> 29:07.120]  There's so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[29:07.120 --> 29:13.280]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.280]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins on them.
[29:18.280 --> 29:24.720]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at mfoldwarstore.com are clean, are pure, are
[29:24.720 --> 29:30.400]  highest quality, and they're long lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.680]  And right now, our strongest product, the three new tropics we have, Rain Force Plus,
[29:35.680 --> 29:43.000]  Rain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force are back in stock at mfoldwarstore.com.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.520]  Turbo Force has been sold out for more than six months.
[29:46.520 --> 29:49.360]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[29:49.360 --> 29:57.000]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available

[29:59.600 --> 30:01.000]  I know you're humble.
[30:01.000 --> 30:08.160]  I know you're like me, but I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the
[30:08.160 --> 30:13.880]  fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and mfoldwar's over the years
[30:13.880 --> 30:15.640]  have changed the world in incredible ways.
[30:15.640 --> 30:24.760]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever
[30:24.760 --> 30:28.400]  that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever
[30:28.400 --> 30:29.400]  been.
[30:29.400 --> 30:31.280]  The tip of the spear is banned out there.
[30:31.280 --> 30:35.520]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is mfoldwarstore.com.
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.400]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[30:40.400 --> 30:46.840]  Great to our Legal Defense Fund to stay on the air and save mfoldwarstore.com and continue
[30:46.840 --> 30:51.960]  to go to mfoldwarstore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force sold out for months,
[30:51.960 --> 30:57.120]  10 hours of clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.000]  great products.
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.040]  Today anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was the platform.
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.440]  Info Wars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching
[31:10.440 --> 31:11.760]  their attack.
[31:11.760 --> 31:17.400]  Three years later, an Info Wars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[31:17.400 --> 31:23.640]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save Info Wars.
[31:23.640 --> 31:27.960]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[31:27.960 --> 31:31.040]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.360]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial.
[31:35.360 --> 31:36.360]  We don't think so.
[31:36.360 --> 31:41.600]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't
[31:41.600 --> 31:42.600]  let them.
[31:42.600 --> 31:45.400]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.
[31:45.400 --> 31:52.120]  With your support, go to saveinfowars.com now and give your donation to save the First
[31:52.120 --> 31:53.120]  Amendment.
[31:53.120 --> 32:06.640]  Why do my enemies hate me so much, why do the globalists hate you so much, why do they
[32:06.640 --> 32:07.640]  hate America so much?
[32:07.640 --> 32:12.160]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[32:12.160 --> 32:13.160]  coexist with.
[32:13.160 --> 32:14.320]  It's very, very simple.
[32:14.320 --> 32:21.000]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.000]  and liberty and due process and justice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.880]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates, you didn't start a fight with David
[32:31.880 --> 32:36.640]  Rockefeller, you didn't start a fight with the U.N., they started a fight with you.
[32:36.640 --> 32:41.240]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away and they're not going
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.640]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[32:46.640 --> 32:50.720]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[32:50.720 --> 32:55.240]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under
[32:55.240 --> 33:24.440]  attack we have any chance of beating these people.
[33:24.440 --> 33:39.240]  It is a real honor to be in the crosshairs of the most evil people on earth.
[33:39.240 --> 33:45.760]  My flesh doesn't like it, but my spirit loves it because I intend to go into harm's way,
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.680]  I intend to take on the evil, I intend to challenge the corrupt power structure because
[33:50.680 --> 33:57.200]  I don't want to be energetically, spiritually aligned with them in any way and that means
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.840]  I need to be an absolute opposition to them and I am in opposition to everything the globalist
[34:02.840 --> 34:05.840]  and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates stand for.
[34:05.840 --> 34:10.360]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us because he has been really doing an excellent job over at
[34:10.360 --> 34:20.640]  Summit.News and also at infowars.com and newswars.com, laying out so much here, dealing with what
[34:20.640 --> 34:27.000]  happened in Wisconsin at this attack a few days ago that killed five people, injured
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.080]  more than 40, some of them in critical condition, including children as young as four and five
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.480]  years old, literally blood all over the streets, gallons and gallons of it everywhere.
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.400]  They said it looked like a slaughterhouse, they washed it away as quickly as possible
[34:39.400 --> 34:44.600]  and the news said he was being chased by police, it was their fault and that was totally made
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.160]  up and not true, says the Black Lives Matter, left his police chief.
[34:48.160 --> 34:55.000]  He was let out of jail, obviously by a Soros finance DA that is a leader in letting armed
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.200]  criminals and others out and I don't want to read the whole rap sheet of this black
[34:59.200 --> 35:03.440]  supremacist terrorist, but it's long.
[35:03.440 --> 35:11.040]  No trafficking, sex assaults, choking, attacking, trying to run people over, I mean he's a
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.680]  regular jihadi and he believed he was going out now, the evidence has come out, to attack
[35:16.680 --> 35:23.360]  and kill evil whites that were having a horrible celebration parade they've been having for
[35:23.360 --> 35:24.360]  over 100 years.
[35:24.360 --> 35:30.720]  So Paul Watson joins us to talk about this and to expand on it, there's also a recent
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.080]  Liverpool bombing at a hospital by a Christian convert who was a jihadi.
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.480]  So Paul Joseph Watson joins us to talk about this incredible level of not just attempts
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.480]  at race war and social division, not just here but in Europe as well, the same global
[35:44.480 --> 35:50.240]  has run everything, but all the looting and attacks and massive crime exploding everywhere.
[35:50.240 --> 35:55.200]  Like Koshwab said, they're going to undermine civilization and collapse it, we're here now.
[35:55.200 --> 35:58.400]  So I just want to cover these topics, I want you to hit them Paul, I don't want to also
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.120]  do 35,000 foot view before you leave us in about 30 minutes.
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.920]  Paul Joseph Watson, what's your view on all this?
[36:04.920 --> 36:11.080]  Well, with the attack in Wisconsin, Alex, you had the narrative being set in the immediate
[36:11.080 --> 36:16.840]  aftermath of the incident by the media, saying that this driver, this massacre driver was
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.840]  fleeing a crime scene, he'd been involved in some kind of knife fight and he was fleeing
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.640]  the scene of a crime.
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.600]  If you're trying to evade police attention, Alex, because you've just been involved in
[36:27.600 --> 36:31.960]  a crime and you're trying to get away, what's the one thing you wouldn't do?
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.280]  You wouldn't drive directly into the main street in the town where the Christmas parade
[36:37.280 --> 36:38.360]  is happening.
[36:38.360 --> 36:44.280]  The most public place possible, if you're trying to evade police attention and mow down
[36:44.280 --> 36:50.560]  50 people, including children, not a very good way of keeping out of the eye of the police
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.560]  is it?
[36:51.560 --> 36:52.560]  Paul, you're right.
[36:52.560 --> 36:55.440]  But now they confirm he ran over barricades, he had all the side streets, he was not being
[36:55.440 --> 36:58.640]  followed by police, it's all a lie.
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.000]  Yeah, but they're still reporting that he was fleeing a crime scene.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.360]  They're not even asking what the motive was.
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.120]  You've got an arrest video of him today, which has been released by NBC.
[37:08.120 --> 37:12.320]  They cut out about two minutes of the video where the police go and arrest him.
[37:12.320 --> 37:13.960]  We don't know what happened there.
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.040]  And then of course, we have his statements, we have his Facebook profile posts.
[37:18.040 --> 37:22.320]  We have his YouTube videos, which are all deleted within two hours of the incident,
[37:22.320 --> 37:27.560]  of course, hiding the evidence, which show, as he said, he was a black supremacist.
[37:27.560 --> 37:30.400]  He posted violent threats against white people.
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.760]  He told people to go out and randomly, physically, violently assault white people.
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.520]  He was doing rap songs on his SoundCloud account about George Floyd and Eric Garner.
[37:41.520 --> 37:45.600]  He was amplifying BLM rhetoric at every possible opportunity.
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.600]  He was posting about the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict and saying how angry he was about
[37:50.600 --> 37:51.600]  this.
[37:51.600 --> 37:57.840]  But just a coincidence, Alex, that someone mows down 50 people in Wisconsin, and he's
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.520]  a black supremacist, two days after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict, and you asked the question.
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.360]  Well, it's also a coincidence that in England and Europe and all over, they had to put up
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.520]  these freedom barricades everywhere because of all the jihadis running over folks with
[38:12.520 --> 38:13.520]  vehicles.
[38:13.520 --> 38:18.560]  But the news spins it and says it's actually the vehicles, the bus attack, truck attack.
[38:18.560 --> 38:24.560]  Yeah, they say dissolve the borders, well, now in London, we've got borders on our bridges
[38:24.560 --> 38:30.600]  because about three of them have been used as vectors for massacres by jihadists.
[38:30.600 --> 38:33.040]  And another one happened the other week, which we're going to talk about.
[38:33.040 --> 38:35.400]  There's the arrest video that you're watching, by the way.
[38:35.400 --> 38:39.640]  So yeah, imagine if you had a white supremacist, you go on his Facebook page, it's full of
[38:39.640 --> 38:43.760]  Confederate flags, it's full of violent threats against black people.
[38:43.760 --> 38:50.520]  Two days later, he's angry about the verdict of a trial, he goes out and mows down 50, mainly
[38:50.520 --> 38:51.520]  black people.
[38:51.520 --> 38:57.040]  Do you think the media would make the connection that maybe the motive is that he hates black
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.840]  people and that he's a race supremacist?
[38:59.840 --> 39:01.360]  They would be all over it.
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.400]  This would be the top story in America for a month.
[39:04.400 --> 39:06.640]  And they've basically forgotten it already.
[39:06.640 --> 39:08.640]  They brushed it under the carpet.
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.600]  The police chief, who went on a Black Lives Matter march in June 2020, made his officers
[39:13.600 --> 39:15.680]  kneel to Black Lives Matter.
[39:15.680 --> 39:17.560]  He's brushed it under the carpet.
[39:17.560 --> 39:18.800]  And basically that's it.
[39:18.800 --> 39:24.520]  And it's absolutely incredible that they get away with this by saying that he was fleeing
[39:24.520 --> 39:25.520]  the police.
[39:25.520 --> 39:27.520]  The police even said he wasn't fleeing them.
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.280]  Why would you go and mow down 50 people if you're trying to evade police attention?
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.360]  The narrative doesn't hold together, it makes no sense whatsoever.
[39:36.360 --> 39:41.800]  And we've now still, as you said, right before I went live, I was in the control room, we
[39:41.800 --> 39:46.680]  got TVs and you could see them still saying, oh, we don't know why it happened.
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.680]  It's a mystery.
[39:47.680 --> 39:49.440]  It's such a tragedy.
[39:49.440 --> 39:52.600]  For TV viewers, we roll the footage from up top of building.
[39:52.600 --> 39:58.640]  I mean, he clearly is like driving over person after person after person, like a Frogger
[39:58.640 --> 40:00.080]  video game.
[40:00.080 --> 40:02.400]  And then they're saying this is all an accident.
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.880]  Yeah, you had an eyewitness who said he'd been going down the middle of the road.
[40:07.880 --> 40:09.480]  He swerved and headed downtown.
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.040]  So they said he could have gone down the side of the road where there weren't people.
[40:13.040 --> 40:16.320]  There are numerous roads that he could have turned off that he could have gone down to
[40:16.320 --> 40:18.280]  avoid the public parade.
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.360]  As he's apparently trying to evade police attention, he mows down 45 of them, including
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.600]  a dance troupe of grannies, a dance troupe of kids.
[40:26.600 --> 40:29.240]  You've still got 10 kids in the ICU, Alex.
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.840]  I agree, but let's compare that to there's a Black Lives Matter rally that just happened
[40:35.840 --> 40:37.760]  to like five people, 10 people.
[40:37.760 --> 40:40.240]  And then somebody's car barely bumps them.
[40:40.240 --> 40:41.240]  That's on the national news.
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.160]  Oh my God, a white person just attacked BLM with no proof.
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.160]  They may have even staged it.
[40:46.160 --> 40:47.160]  We don't even know.
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.240]  This could be Jesse Small.
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.840]  But this is now being put on the news as a huge racial attack when there's not even any
[40:52.840 --> 40:53.840]  proof.
[40:53.840 --> 40:56.320]  But the other ones that accident and no big deal.
[40:56.320 --> 41:02.200]  Precisely, and they said the Kyle Rittenhouse incident was a racial attack where he legally
[41:02.200 --> 41:03.200]  defended himself.
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.840]  Well, they said he shot three Black people on MSNBC.
[41:06.840 --> 41:11.680]  The Independent literally put on their front page that he killed three Black people.
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.080]  So they told you for 14 months that Rittenhouse had murdered BLM protesters, or even in some
[41:17.080 --> 41:19.080]  cases they said Black people.
[41:19.080 --> 41:26.360]  Meanwhile, this literal Black supremacist who hates white people runs over 45, 50 white
[41:26.360 --> 41:27.360]  people.
[41:27.360 --> 41:28.360]  He's angry about the Rittenhouse verdict.
[41:28.360 --> 41:32.080]  And it's, oh no, he was just fleeing the scene of a crime.
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.880]  It makes absolutely no sense given his profile.
[41:35.880 --> 41:40.800]  And then you look at the New York Times, for example, Alex, the day after this happened,
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.000]  they put it on page 22 of the newspaper.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.960]  Can you imagine if a white supremacist, again, had barreled through a Black Lives Matter parade
[41:49.960 --> 41:56.560]  in an SUV, killed five people, potentially more, injured 45 people, would that be on
[41:56.560 --> 41:57.800]  page 22 of the newspaper?
[41:57.800 --> 42:02.200]  Well, remember when the psycho went and shot poor innocent Black people in South Carolina
[42:02.200 --> 42:03.200]  at the church?
[42:03.200 --> 42:04.200]  That was horrible.
[42:04.200 --> 42:05.200]  We were against it.
[42:05.200 --> 42:06.200]  The media said all whites were guilty.
[42:06.200 --> 42:08.080]  No, that was one crazy person.
[42:08.080 --> 42:11.600]  The point is, admit it's a bad person, whether they're Black, white, whatever.
[42:11.600 --> 42:12.600]  This is crazy.
[42:12.600 --> 42:18.280]  Yeah, Dillon Roof, they had his entire motive laid out within 12 hours of the attack.
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.800]  This guy apparently is just saying nothing, and it's going to have disappeared by the
[42:21.800 --> 42:22.800]  end of the week.
[42:22.800 --> 42:27.560]  By the way, Wikipedia changed their description of the incident from the Waukesha Christmas
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.560]  parade attack.
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.920]  Now they're calling it the Waukesha Christmas parade car crash.
[42:32.920 --> 42:34.960]  It was just a car crash, Alex.
[42:34.960 --> 42:35.960]  Maybe an accident.
[42:35.960 --> 42:40.520]  Oh, well, you saw Schumer say, oh, oh, we're going to build better roads.
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.120]  The racist roads caused this.
[42:42.120 --> 42:43.240]  I'm not joking.
[42:43.240 --> 42:44.240]  You saw that.
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.600]  We'll come right back and talk about a similar case in the UK of a hospital getting bombed
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.280]  by an admitted jihadi, and the news is saying he's a Christian.
[42:52.280 --> 42:54.520]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the media is the enemy.
[42:54.520 --> 42:57.720]  It's owned by mega banks that are destroying our countries that want to get rid of the
[42:57.720 --> 42:58.720]  middle class.
[42:58.720 --> 43:23.480]  That's what I'm asking for free.
[43:23.480 --> 43:28.680]  On top of that, we also have DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10 to clean out the
[43:28.680 --> 43:29.680]  planet yourselves.

[43:34.200 --> 43:42.040]  And now we have super coral calcium toothpaste, similar to our previous coral biting toothpaste,
[43:42.040 --> 43:44.800]  but even stronger, even more concentrated.

[44:01.400 --> 44:07.440]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines working
[44:07.440 --> 44:15.200]  for, quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil
[44:15.200 --> 44:17.040]  groups are.
[44:17.040 --> 44:21.840]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[44:21.840 --> 44:24.160]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[44:24.160 --> 44:29.080]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.360]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[44:33.360 --> 44:37.800]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front.
[44:37.800 --> 44:40.760]  And so people are waking up.
[44:40.760 --> 44:44.080]  The weapons work a little too good.
[44:44.080 --> 44:47.880]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too
[44:47.880 --> 44:48.880]  big of a noise.
[44:48.880 --> 44:51.720]  But it's too late for a return back now.
[44:51.720 --> 44:53.440]  They're coming after our children.
[44:53.440 --> 44:58.920]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[44:58.920 --> 45:01.080]  Remember God is watching.
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.400]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[45:05.400 --> 45:09.800]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[45:09.800 --> 45:15.040]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[45:15.040 --> 45:16.040]  system.

[46:57.800 --> 47:02.200]  many other great products.
[47:02.200 --> 47:15.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.920]  You talk about mine control, you talk about propaganda, I remember seven, eight years
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.920]  ago in Germany and France when Islamics would run over sometimes hundreds of people with
[47:25.920 --> 47:32.320]  cars killing 80 plus in one event in France and the media would say truck attack and we
[47:32.320 --> 47:34.440]  make jokes about it but it's not funny.
[47:34.440 --> 47:40.040]  Now in America, CNN, MSNBC, I've got the articles right here, are calling in a car accident,
[47:40.040 --> 47:48.640]  a truck attack, an SUV attack, these are the headlines, you've seen them and now we've
[47:48.640 --> 47:57.320]  got Democrats saying the attack at the Christmas parade is karma for written house acquittal.
[47:57.320 --> 48:01.080]  These are and of course it's a weird, crazy white woman and I'm not trying to put white
[48:01.080 --> 48:07.640]  people down, I'm just saying this is a bunch of leftist people engaged in black magic basically
[48:07.640 --> 48:11.680]  who want power and most of them are white trying to get power out of making us all
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.880]  kill each other and I'm sick of it.
[48:13.880 --> 48:19.360]  I'm sick of the racist ass black people and the weirdo white people pulling their strings
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.720]  because they're going to get, everybody killed basically, this is so, and while the chai
[48:23.720 --> 48:29.240]  comms brag, covered this earlier, in their newspapers how they're financing Hollywood
[48:29.240 --> 48:33.000]  to create racial division to bring America down and then we're all screwed, the whole
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  ship goes under.
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.560]  It's unbelievable, it's so obvious, Paul, going back to you here, you've been all over
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.320]  this, I mean you produce so many reports on this, you've written so many articles on
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.680]  it, there's another example, this guy bomb in the hospital and then the media calls him
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.640]  a Christian, I mean this is, so they go further now, it's not just cover up that it's Islamics,
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.920]  they then frame Christians who statistically are the most peaceful people in the world,
[48:57.920 --> 48:59.920]  Paul Watson of Summit.News.
[48:59.920 --> 49:06.600]  Yeah, this was an incident that happened last Sunday on Remembrance Day during the parade
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.200]  where this individual was, got into a taxi with a suicide bomb, he planned to blow himself
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.200]  up, thankfully the taxi driver who should get the highest honour, the highest medal available,
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.880]  I don't think he has yet, he'll probably end up like the mill wall supporter during
[49:21.880 --> 49:26.600]  the London Bridge attacks who challenged the terrorists and was later demonised as a domestic
[49:26.600 --> 49:27.600]  extreme.
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.600]  In fact, let's remind people of the lion of London Bridge, what he fought like 10 dudes
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.120]  who stabbed him dozens of times and still kicked their ass and saved people, I mean tell
[49:36.120 --> 49:39.120]  people about that guy, we forget about the lion of London Bridge.
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.880]  Well, yeah, they ran onto the London Bridge, started mowing people down, jumped out the
[49:43.880 --> 49:46.340]  car, started stabbing people.
[49:46.340 --> 49:51.120]  This guy is challenging them, he's attacking them and he's later put on a government watch
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.240]  list because he criticised Islam too much and was too vehement in his opinion.
[49:55.240 --> 49:58.120]  He was made to go take classes, he was made to go take classes.
[49:58.120 --> 50:04.800]  Yeah, he was made to take reeducation classes, the literal hero in stopping the jihadist
[50:04.800 --> 50:07.600]  attack was put on a government watch list.
[50:07.600 --> 50:13.560]  This case in Liverpool last Sunday, so he gets in taxi with the suicide bomb, the taxi
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.880]  driver knows something's up with him, he's fidgeting around with wires, there's smoke
[50:17.880 --> 50:20.200]  emanating from his backpack.
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.760]  The taxi driver drives him to where he wants to go, which is outside of women's hospital
[50:24.760 --> 50:25.760]  in Liverpool.
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.800]  Now we don't know whether he planned to attack the hospital or a remembrance day parade that
[50:30.800 --> 50:33.840]  was taking place, just a stone's throw away.
[50:33.840 --> 50:39.400]  By the way, the remembrance day parade started at a cathedral, so apparently this Christian
[50:39.400 --> 50:44.240]  convert wants to bomb a Christian cathedral because that makes perfect sense.
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.160]  So thankfully, he ends up just blowing himself up, no one else was seriously injured, the
[50:49.160 --> 50:51.120]  taxi driver survived.
[50:51.120 --> 50:56.080]  Then the media comes out and says he was a Christian convert, well we know that they
[50:56.080 --> 51:02.280]  lie because his asylum claim was rejected in 2014, they go to the cathedral and pretend
[51:02.280 --> 51:08.560]  to become Christian converts, so then their asylum application is more likely to be accepted.
[51:08.560 --> 51:13.520]  The fact is, while he was constructing this bomb, he was seeing attending a mosque every
[51:13.520 --> 51:16.000]  single day during Ramadan.
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.680]  The week before the attack, he was seen praying in this mosque with fellow Muslims, and yet
[51:21.680 --> 51:25.520]  this lie that he was a Christian convert, he wasn't a Christian convert, he was a fake
[51:25.520 --> 51:29.760]  convert, was still being repeated by the BBC.
[51:29.760 --> 51:32.840]  Is after this attempt to the attack happened?
[51:32.840 --> 51:36.960]  So Paul, I mean at this level, they might as well just say Daryl Brooks was a white
[51:36.960 --> 51:44.200]  supremacist in Wisconsin in Waukesha that ran over 50 black people, I mean that's the
[51:44.200 --> 51:49.080]  level of this identity theft, this info, and I'm not trying to even blame any group, I'm
[51:49.080 --> 51:52.760]  just saying they cover up when one group does it and then lie about written house and say
[51:52.760 --> 51:57.120]  he shot three black people, not true, it's just next level, this is brainwashing that's
[51:57.120 --> 51:59.440]  so insane but they never get in trouble for it.
[51:59.440 --> 52:02.160]  There is the white supremacist that ran over 50 black people.
[52:02.160 --> 52:06.960]  No, their reaction today, the Daily Beast in particular, is they're now going after
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.900]  Tim Paul and Andy Noe saying that they're bad for posting screenshots of this guy's
[52:12.900 --> 52:18.000]  Facebook account where he's like, yes, let's go out and violently attack white people,
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.600]  this guy ran over another white...
[52:19.600 --> 52:22.800]  I'm glad you raised that point, they're now claiming that they're internet trolls who
[52:22.800 --> 52:27.720]  made it up, no, that's really his Facebook and Twitter, that's really his Instagram,
[52:27.720 --> 52:30.800]  that's really who he is, but they can't handle it.
[52:30.800 --> 52:36.920]  And again, if the tables were turned, if a white guy was posting Confederate flags, hatred
[52:36.920 --> 52:41.280]  of BLM and calling for people to go out and violently attack black people, that would
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.600]  be a pretty big part of the story on CNN, wouldn't it, but it's not, it's brushing the carpet.
[52:46.600 --> 52:52.680]  This Liverpool attacker, he entered the UK in 2014, his asylum claim was rejected in
[52:52.680 --> 53:00.000]  2015, he was still in the country six years later, despite his asylum claim being rejected,
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.080]  no one knows who he was, he came from Iraq, whether he was radicalized, he obviously was
[53:04.080 --> 53:05.080]  radicalized.
[53:05.080 --> 53:06.080]  So he remained in the country for 60 years.
[53:06.080 --> 53:13.360]  They say he was a devout Muslim, you've got at least this in your article at summit.news,
[53:13.360 --> 53:15.680]  he was at mosque repeatedly every week.
[53:15.680 --> 53:19.520]  Yeah, and again, he's another refugee.
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.600]  How many times do we have to have refugees turn into terrorists before we have proper
[53:23.600 --> 53:25.400]  border controls, Alex?
[53:25.400 --> 53:30.600]  The Manchester Arena bomber blew himself up, killed a bunch of kids at the Ariana Grande
[53:30.600 --> 53:39.480]  concert in 2017, a refugee from Libya literally rescued by the Royal Navy by the UK government
[53:39.480 --> 53:44.400]  brought into the country, that's how he repays us by blowing up a bunch of kids.
[53:44.400 --> 53:51.160]  You had the Paris massacre terrorists exploited the refugee wave, pretended to be Syrian,
[53:51.160 --> 53:54.200]  that's how they got into Europe, that's how they killed dozens of people.
[53:54.200 --> 53:59.760]  Oh, I love how they always call 25, 30 year old men children too, and in Germany and France
[53:59.760 --> 54:04.080]  even put them in middle schools with little kids, they then rape, and this is all a sick
[54:04.080 --> 54:05.560]  leftist joke.
[54:05.560 --> 54:12.280]  Yeah, they literally have 45 year old men coming in on buses to the UK and say their
[54:12.280 --> 54:13.520]  children.
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.280]  They did tests of their teeth even in Sweden and found that they were 40, 50 years old,
[54:18.280 --> 54:21.960]  but we were called racists for pointing out that they're not children.
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.840]  And you had it with the beheading of the school teacher in France, Samuel Patier.
[54:26.840 --> 54:32.120]  Again, a refugee brought in by the government ends up killing somebody in France.
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.200]  You had the beheading in Nice, same story, a Chechen refugee.
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.200]  There have been innumerable mass casualty terror attacks carried out across Europe by
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.680]  people either pretending to be refugees, getting into the country on the carpet of the refugee
[54:46.680 --> 54:47.680]  wave.
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.320]  And you have a situation in the UK, Alex, where we've had over 20,000 boat migrants
[54:53.320 --> 54:56.060]  come in this year alone.
[54:56.060 --> 55:02.000]  Turns out the government has only deported out of 20,000 just this year, five of them.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.400]  And you've seen the videos.
[55:03.400 --> 55:08.480]  They got off the boats, whether it's in the UK, in Spain, wherever, and just run off into
[55:08.480 --> 55:10.240]  the nearest town.
[55:10.240 --> 55:11.760]  Nobody knows who the hell they are.
[55:11.760 --> 55:14.680]  And in many cases, they've gone up on to blow themselves up.
[55:14.680 --> 55:20.240]  Paul, Paul, I live, I live backed up to woods and houses and apartments.
[55:20.240 --> 55:24.000]  And my son wants us to be armed now.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.280]  We hiked down there because it's almost going around.
[55:26.280 --> 55:30.360]  There are Haitians living and running around the woods behind my house.
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.480]  And this is in West Austin, which is a nice area.
[55:32.480 --> 55:35.160]  This is all over the damn world now, all over the Western world.
[55:35.160 --> 55:36.240]  And it's only just begun.
[55:36.240 --> 55:37.560]  How crazy is this going to get?
[55:37.560 --> 55:40.600]  I know you live in London, you're planning to move out soon, you were telling me off
[55:40.600 --> 55:41.600]  air.
[55:41.600 --> 55:42.600]  It's like uninhabitable now.
[55:42.600 --> 55:43.600]  You came and go out.
[55:43.600 --> 55:50.080]  It's getting worse, and this government promised to reduce immigration to drastically
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.080]  lower levels.
[55:51.080 --> 55:52.240]  It's completely failed to do so.
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.760]  The only good thing that's come out of this is that now Nigel Farage is saying he's going
[55:55.760 --> 55:57.480]  to get back into politics.
[55:57.480 --> 56:01.480]  And he is the only real opposition in this country because we have a fake Labour Party
[56:01.480 --> 56:04.800]  opposition, which wants even more open borders.
[56:04.800 --> 56:07.160]  So that's the only good thing that's come out of it.
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.760]  But then again, you had the media reaction after the attempted Liverpool suicide bombing.
[56:11.760 --> 56:18.280]  Within 48 hours, Sky News, one of the top broadcasters in the UK, 48 hours after RG Haddis tried
[56:18.280 --> 56:24.320]  to blow up a hospital, their top headline on their website was about some Pakistani cricket
[56:24.320 --> 56:30.800]  players being called mean words by other cricket players 15 years ago.
[56:30.800 --> 56:36.160]  And that was seen as a more important controversy, someone being called a mean word 15 years
[56:36.160 --> 56:41.720]  ago, than a literal suicide bomber trying to blow up a hospital or trying to blow up
[56:41.720 --> 56:46.280]  a World War II, World War I memorial, just a stone's throw away from where his bomb went
[56:46.280 --> 56:47.280]  off.
[56:47.280 --> 56:50.600]  So again, it's about letting them into the country, and then it's about the media cover-up
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.840]  that happens in the immediate aftermath, and that's precisely what you've seen again
[56:54.840 --> 57:00.040]  with this SUV attack, this black supremacist in Wisconsin, and it's only going to continue.
[57:00.040 --> 57:05.520]  Exactly, which is all an exercise by the intelligence agencies and the ruling class over the media
[57:05.520 --> 57:12.240]  to see if they can successfully cover up vaccine damages, vaccine deaths, secret operations,
[57:12.240 --> 57:14.280]  crimes committed by the invaders.
[57:14.280 --> 57:15.680]  All of it is a plan.
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.880]  Paul, do five more minutes with us ahead of Roger Stone joining us with exclusive information
[57:19.880 --> 57:24.080]  on the subpoenas he and I received from the January 6th Tangaroo Court coming up.
[57:24.080 --> 57:29.760]  Please don't forget, listeners, we only got a week or so left on free shipping and double
[57:29.760 --> 57:35.480]  page reappoints at infowarstore.com, and TurboForce, 10 hours of clean energy, is finally back
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.960]  in stock, 48% off, and we've got the new super whitening coral calcium toothpaste, better
[57:41.960 --> 57:48.240]  than even the last brand we had, made to Merica back in stock, discounted infowarstore.com.
[57:48.240 --> 57:54.800]  Infowars, there are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy
[57:54.800 --> 58:00.240]  powders, energy pills, and look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've
[58:00.240 --> 58:07.840]  got incredible downsides, horrible crashes, and again, so many toxins on them.
[58:07.840 --> 58:14.240]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are
[58:14.240 --> 58:19.920]  highest quality, and they're long lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[58:19.920 --> 58:25.240]  And right now, our strongest product, the three new tropics we have, RainForce Plus,
[58:25.240 --> 58:32.440]  RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[58:32.440 --> 58:37.840]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months, it's back in stock with free shipping,
[58:37.840 --> 58:46.560]  40% off, it is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available
[58:46.560 --> 58:50.280]  right now, and it funds the infowar, a 360 win.
[58:50.280 --> 59:01.120]  If you only knew the power of a downside, join Bill Gates, and together, we will defeat
[59:01.120 --> 59:02.120]  humanity.
[59:02.120 --> 59:09.640]  Then our gods say we'll reward us with eternal life.
[59:09.640 --> 59:14.080]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[59:14.080 --> 59:19.720]  They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their
[59:19.720 --> 59:25.160]  social Darwinistic system, and in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us, and dumb
[59:25.160 --> 59:30.320]  us down, and poison us, and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and
[59:30.320 --> 59:34.680]  out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to us.
[59:34.680 --> 59:41.000]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more?
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.880]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts, the front lines of the fight
[59:45.880 --> 1:00:14.880]  is infowars.gov.
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:22.640]  The year is 2021, the date is Tuesday, November 23rd, I'm Alex Jones, your host, honored
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.640]  to be here.
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:27.760]  Paul Watson, big picture, obviously we've got the WikiLeaks, we've got the documents,
[1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:32.240]  we've got Klaus Schwab's public statements, the powerful elites of the world are devaluing
[1:00:32.240 --> 1:00:37.560]  currencies to use them to buy up all the infrastructure, the rearguard action is social conflict, divide
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:43.440]  and conquer, that so many empires have used for control, but it doesn't seem like it's
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.960]  going well for them, so it seems like we're going into a very dangerous, insane time.
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:52.200]  What would you call this time we're living in, and what do you expect them to do in the
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:57.240]  next 11 months ahead of the midterms, because they know they're about to be repudiated and
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:00.320]  the globalists are about to lose control of their main command base.
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:03.560]  How do you think they're going to strike back?
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:09.040]  I think they're going to intensify the complete demonization of the unvaccinated, Alex, to
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.960]  the point where you had the Australian minister the other day, and you probably played the
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:19.000]  clip already yesterday, where he's literally saying with like raging bug eyes, which is
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:24.160]  the common denominator which all these people have, quote, if you give a green light, give
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:29.920]  comfort to support anybody who argues against the vaccine, you're an anti-vaxxer, that's
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:34.560]  the kind of rhetoric that George W. Bush said when he said you're either with us or with
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:35.560]  the terrorists.
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:41.520]  The next stage is to literally dehumanize, demonize the unvaccinated as terrorists, and
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:43.440]  that's precisely what's happening.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:47.400]  The left pretends to care about oppressed minorities.
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:53.880]  The preeminent oppressed minority today is the unvaccinated, they're dehumanized by the
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:58.360]  media, that's the guy I was talking about right there, they're dehumanized by the media
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:01.880]  and violently persecuted by the state.
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:06.400]  We told this lie that we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, Alex.
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:11.360]  The numbers you look out of the UK today, you look at the numbers of people in hospital,
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:19.120]  COVID hospitalizations in the UK, 67% of COVID hospitalizations in the UK are vaccinated
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:20.120]  people.
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:27.000]  It's even higher when you look at adults, 71% of COVID hospitalizations are vaccinated.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:32.280]  So it's not a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it's a complete lie and yet they continue
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:39.000]  to claim that because they need to dehumanize, denigrate the unvaccinated so that they can
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:45.320]  release the wrath of the state in terms of violent persecution against the unvaccinated,
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:51.160]  use them as the scapegoat and abuse them, use them as the example as warning to intimidate
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:52.160]  other people.
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:59.600]  But again, as you said, it's not really working because even in places like Poland, like Denmark,
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.960]  you have large numbers of the population that remain unvaccinated despite this massive
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:07.640]  tyranny and these threats against them.
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:10.800]  Paul, I want to ask you what comes next in the two minutes we have left and do an hour
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:14.000]  later in the week or next week, please with us, I respect your view on this, you're dead
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.800]  on target.
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:18.880]  You've got German government putting out numbers in the UK government that people are
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:22.200]  twice as likely to die if they've had the shot.
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:25.800]  They say they don't know why and then now you're more likely to get sick if you've had
[1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:26.800]  the vaccine.
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:29.080]  I mean, even Fauci's having to admit that now.
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:30.680]  So how the hell are they going to get away with this?
[1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:34.160]  This just seems like they've shot themselves in the foot here.
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:39.480]  In the UK, they're actually trying to lobby the government to not release the statistics
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:43.040]  because they're being cited by the unvacced extremists.
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:48.160]  For example, Alex, this is reported today from official government data, the rates of
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:52.880]  COVID infection per 100,000 are now higher among the Vax than the unvax.
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:56.680]  We have Gibraltar cancelling official Christmas events.
[1:03:56.680 --> 1:03:59.320]  Their entire adult population is vaccinated.
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:06.400]  They've got a COVID spike, Ireland, 94% adult population vaccinated, they've got a COVID
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:07.400]  spike.
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.480]  So the entire case for this, the entire case for vaccine passports, which by the way, now
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:18.120]  banning people who can prove they don't have the virus, they're removing that option entirely.
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:22.800]  Their entire case for it has been demolished and the only way they can intensify it and
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:27.680]  step it up is by increasing the intimidation, increasing the threats as we've seen in Austria
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:32.320]  by now literally threatening to put people in prison for four years if they don't take
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:33.320]  the vaccine.
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:34.320]  And that's the way it's going.
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:38.040]  Paul, you do the best job breaking it down over to Summit.News and also in Four Wars,
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:39.040]  but you're absolutely right.
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:42.880]  And now Germany is saying, oh, we may just force and isolate everybody, not just lock
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  you in your house.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:45.800]  I mean, this is here, tyranny's not coming.
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:46.800]  It's here.
[1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:48.960]  Watson, thank you so much and have a great Thanksgiving.
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:52.200]  I know you don't really celebrate in the UK, but I'm going to be here eating bugs like
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:53.200]  Bill Gates said.
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:54.200]  Okay.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:55.200]  Okay.
[1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:56.200]  Thanks Alex.
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  Thank you.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:05.520]  There are so many, there are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks,
[1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:11.000]  energy powders, energy pills, and look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:18.600]  got incredible downsides, horrible crashes, and again, so many toxins in them.
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:25.000]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowarstore.com are clean, are pure, are
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.680]  highest quality, and they're long lasting, and they help focus your mind.

[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:57.320]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available

[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:39.160]  We say that you wanna go to a land that's far away, how are we supposed to get there
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:44.160]  with the way that we're living today?
[1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:57.160]  You talk lots about God, freedom comes from the car, but that's not why this bitch wants
[1:06:57.160 --> 1:06:58.160]  it.
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:14.600]  Not what I want at all, I want money, power, glory, I want money, and all your power, I
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:30.600]  want money I want glory I want I want to take it for what's it got, I want glory I
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:40.660]  want to take it and for what's it got, money coming for it, I want money I want
[1:07:40.660 --> 1:07:52.100]  I want money and no your power, no your glory
[1:07:52.100 --> 1:08:00.660]  I want money, I want to go, I want to take it to heart and sugar
[1:08:00.660 --> 1:08:09.220]  I want money, I want to go, I want to take it to heart and sugar
[1:08:09.220 --> 1:08:27.780]  I want to go, I want to go, I want to take it to heart and sugar
[1:08:27.780 --> 1:08:42.500]  Macartheism on steroids the year 2021 every major populist nationalist leader has been subpoenaed
[1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:49.380]  or indicted or even convicted and then pardoned by president trump we have the global exclusive
[1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:54.980]  roger stone longtime political confidant of the 45th president and of course we know
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:09:01.860]  the real winner at evidence overwhelming now joining us to discuss the subpoena by the
[1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:06.740]  united states house select committee on the january 6 attack which again is the
[1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:14.020]  progeny of joseph mccarthy and has gone even further mccarthy didn't put hundreds of people
[1:09:14.020 --> 1:09:20.020]  in solitary confinement for nine ten eleven months without even being able to have a trial
[1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:26.020]  this is incredible so roger stone is here to give us his exclusive take on being subpoenaed
[1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:30.420]  along with myself the top story of the united states held in japan and germany it was all
[1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:36.580]  over the world yesterday wasn't a radical black supremacist who said on twitter and instagram
[1:09:36.580 --> 1:09:40.980]  he was going to you know attack whites or only cowards were standing down attack whites need
[1:09:40.980 --> 1:09:46.100]  to be attacked because the written house verdict no no it wasn't 40 something people run over five
[1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:52.020]  of them killed little kids run over it wasn't that it was roger stone and alex jones are are
[1:09:52.020 --> 1:09:58.180]  oh our evil and and the january six committees on their tail and now we've gotten the subpoena
[1:09:58.980 --> 1:10:02.260]  all these questions about who have we talked to what have we done did we ever talk to a
[1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:06.420]  three percenter did we ever we want every document of the sun and of course if you don't comply right
[1:10:06.420 --> 1:10:12.340]  you go to jail unless you plead the fifth and then mark rendaza my chief legal counsel on all the
[1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:17.700]  flotilla democratic party civil suits is riding shotgun with us for the hour but let's first go
[1:10:17.700 --> 1:10:24.180]  to roger stone exclusively to give us his first video statement on where he stands and what's
[1:10:24.180 --> 1:10:28.260]  really going on roger i'm actually proud to be here with you being targeted to these people
[1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:32.660]  because we're pro america we're not in trouble because we're bad we're in trouble because we
[1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:38.980]  want back down to evil and we stand for freedom roger well alex you're absolutely right this
[1:10:38.980 --> 1:10:46.020]  is my first uh uh national statement on any medium right here at info wars just as in the
[1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:53.460]  hours after i was uh framed and charged in the mother witch hunt it was info wars where i did
[1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:58.820]  my very first interview to lay out the truth of that epic struggle and now alex whether you like it
[1:10:58.820 --> 1:11:03.140]  or not you're connected to me at the hip for the rest of your life we're kind of like butch
[1:11:03.140 --> 1:11:10.100]  cassidy and the sundance kid uh and here's the thing neither one of us did anything wrong uh
[1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:17.060]  this is a politically motivated witch hunt let's call it witch hunt 2.0 i've been disparaged
[1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:24.020]  and smeared as the promoter of an attack on the american capital on january 6th despite the fact
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:32.100]  that i wasn't there any assertion claim or implication to the contrary is categorically
[1:11:32.100 --> 1:11:38.740]  false there is no evidence or any witness who can honestly come forward and say otherwise
[1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:45.460]  dustin stockton i don't know who that is jennifer laurance don't know them taylor
[1:11:45.460 --> 1:11:53.540]  budovich don't know who that is so this is this is the same ongoing effort we've seen previously
[1:11:53.540 --> 1:12:00.020]  where you criminalize constitutionally protected political activity you know the reason i love
[1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:05.940]  america is because i love free speech in the constitution and the constitution guarantees
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:12.820]  us the right to freely assemble to petition our government and to speak freely on the issues
[1:12:12.820 --> 1:12:21.140]  of the day any activity that i engaged in on january 5th or 6th for that matter was constitutionally
[1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:29.140]  protected free speech i know nothing about unlawful activities at the capital period full stop
[1:12:29.140 --> 1:12:35.700]  there is nothing to turn over there is nothing to testify against it's a witch hunt and let me
[1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:42.020]  finally add the chairman of the committee has filed a civil suit against donald trump and therefore
[1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:49.300]  has proven that he is not an unbiased or honest arbiter this is this is gives macarthia bad name
[1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:55.700]  macarthia was a good guy comparing to these smear artists i totally agree roger and we need to
[1:12:55.700 --> 1:13:04.500]  focus on that again that this the head of the committee has sued trump and is going after him
[1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:11.940]  on a host of issues including january 6 how can he then be the judge over this this whole political
[1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:15.060]  we ask him but let me ask you the big question obviously i'm not nailing you down here but
[1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:21.700]  i intend to currently go with the fifth not that i have anything to hide but i saw how they
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:28.260]  set you up in the whole russia gate fraud and hoax and how i i was here when you were trying to get
[1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:31.700]  a son johnny when you give us the time of day we were all bummed out about it and they said oh you
[1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:36.340]  were secretly running a song and all this i knew it was a lack as i was there i saw them convict you
[1:13:36.340 --> 1:13:40.500]  in a kangaroo court so that got my attention i thought it was a joke back what was happening
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:44.500]  i said don't worry roger you've done nothing wrong no you were right you said it was serious
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:49.140]  and so i don't want to be roger stoned right now in this and that's why our forebears fought
[1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:53.140]  the british crown and defeated them for the fifth amendment and i think that's when i'm going here
[1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:57.060]  because these guys have no honor no matter what i give them or what i say they're gonna say it's a
[1:13:57.060 --> 1:14:03.300]  lie so why not just fifth amendment well that's absolutely true look we know the house democrats
[1:14:03.300 --> 1:14:10.740]  leak classified information with impunity uh they they uh illegally in my case consorted with the
[1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:17.780]  special prosecutor um there there's no integrity in this process it's not an honest unbiased content
[1:14:17.780 --> 1:14:22.900]  it's not that i've done anything wrong i'm not going to decide what i'm going to do today
[1:14:22.900 --> 1:14:29.300]  because there is a drop dead date on the subpoena of december 17th i believe other than to say
[1:14:29.940 --> 1:14:34.980]  we have a member of the house intelligence committee who was sleeping with a chinese spy
[1:14:35.620 --> 1:14:41.380]  now he has access to national security secrets as a member of the committee his office was
[1:14:41.380 --> 1:14:46.980]  penetrated by an employee who was working for that russian spy but they want to they want to
[1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:53.940]  investigate donald trump and roger stone uh this is an absurdity we have become clickbait i mean
[1:14:53.940 --> 1:14:59.700]  that's really what this is about i have nothing to do with this i know nothing about it are many
[1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:06.340]  things alice but i'm not stupid whoever would think that trespassing at the capitol or menacing
[1:15:06.340 --> 1:15:12.100]  lawmakers even though nobody was armed would benefit donald trump politically is either an
[1:15:12.100 --> 1:15:17.620]  idiot or an amateur exactly why would we cut blow our feet off it's a nice way of saying
[1:15:17.620 --> 1:15:23.060]  why would we put our dicks in a garbage disposal it's so ridiculous that we'd have a motive for this
[1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:28.340]  well in my place it would take a very large garbage disposal pretty bad
[1:15:30.180 --> 1:15:37.620]  with me it would take a pencil sharpener i'm not going there it's actually gigantic all right
[1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:46.340]  that's going to be the headline hold on that's all satire folks that's going to be the headline

[1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:09.380]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:14.420]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[1:19:14.420 --> 1:19:20.980]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet
[1:19:20.980 --> 1:19:28.580]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be
[1:19:28.580 --> 1:19:35.060]  necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lies and all
[1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:42.100]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end
[1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:46.980]  they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody
[1:19:46.980 --> 1:19:51.620]  keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god what the
[1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:57.140]  globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government
[1:19:57.140 --> 1:20:13.060]  and the mark of the beast they just announced you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:27.700 --> 1:20:34.820]  so the former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe disgraced we have the video we'll play it next
[1:20:34.820 --> 1:20:40.500]  segment because i watched it this morning and i forgot about it and then i'm telling roger hey
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:45.780]  what do you want to cover next he goes i'll talk about andrew mccabe saying that roger stone is at
[1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:51.860]  the center along with alex jones of this whole giant plan to attack the capital now this is even
[1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:56.900]  bigger hoax than the russia gate and and and so i'd forgotten about that that's a pretty big deal
[1:20:56.900 --> 1:21:01.300]  to have this guy out there claiming this fraud again uh not that we're russian agents but that
[1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:06.180]  but he but we're at the center of the plan to attack the capital uh so they're really telling
[1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:12.260]  us where they're going roger yeah this is this is laughable bullshit is what it is i mean let's
[1:21:12.260 --> 1:21:19.540]  be very clear uh i wasn't on the ellipse i didn't march to the capital i wasn't at the capital
[1:21:19.540 --> 1:21:26.020]  i never left the grounds of my hotel on january 6th and i know nothing about any illegal activities
[1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:32.500]  on the capital anywhere around the capital or in washington dc that day period andrew mccabe
[1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:38.420]  however is at the white house center of the russian collusion hoax and in fact on the day
[1:21:38.420 --> 1:21:45.060]  that i was uh convicted in a kangaroo cat style court uh you know a soviet show trial
[1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:51.460]  in washington dc the prosecutor in my case announced that andrew mccabe would not be
[1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:58.420]  prosecuted for lying to the fbi about the russian collusion hoax this is bizarro world the world is
[1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:06.020]  upside down what's the point alex it's just more lawfare grinds you down with legal fees
[1:22:06.020 --> 1:22:11.300]  drag your name through the mud oh i gotta admit a lot of these pictures of you and i together
[1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:15.940]  look pretty damn cool well yeah they're saying like next thing we've got to do is kill batman
[1:22:15.940 --> 1:22:21.140]  like we're villains no we're like batman fighting the villains roger we got mark ron dazer he's
[1:22:21.140 --> 1:22:25.140]  got a lot of points and questions to ask he's rather subpoena he says it's beyond mccarthy i want
[1:22:25.140 --> 1:22:30.900]  to get his take on that but is it this about distracting from the inflation the record gas
[1:22:30.900 --> 1:22:36.980]  prices the federal reserve saying eat tofu not turkey that's a real headline uh and and the imploding
[1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:43.860]  borders and just all the crazy corruption of the democratic party well that's part of it but the
[1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:50.500]  other part of it frankly is just the bloodlust against me because i was pardoned and the bloodlust
[1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:57.380]  against you because you supported me in my epic fight for freedom so these guys hate us because
[1:22:57.380 --> 1:23:04.340]  as plato said no one is as hated as the truth teller they like to shut info wars down they'd
[1:23:04.340 --> 1:23:10.660]  like to just close you down so you can stop broadcasting the truth this is epically debilitating
[1:23:10.660 --> 1:23:19.460]  as you fight no financially all of these civil suits and i still face six more baseless unsubstantiated
[1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:26.580]  groundless but tremendously sensationalized civil suits and now i have to defend myself legally in
[1:23:26.580 --> 1:23:31.620]  this proceeding and we're going to talk about that before you leave but but this this we are seen as
[1:23:31.620 --> 1:23:36.900]  like go back to the roman standards like the standard of a legion if they can capture that
[1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:42.100]  that'll demoralize us and i'm not i'm trying to brag but it's true the left sees donald trump is
[1:23:42.100 --> 1:23:46.340]  the big standard roger stonel shone's other big standards they're really trying to seize us mark
[1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:51.620]  randaza i mean you said you got into legal stuff reading about mccarthy now you're here yeah you
[1:23:51.620 --> 1:23:57.220]  know i i'm an old school liberal and i haven't burst into flames as i've been here um you know
[1:23:57.220 --> 1:24:02.180]  and what that means is i believe in freedom of expression for everybody in fact especially for
[1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:07.060]  people i disagree with not just for people i agree with and you know when i started studying
[1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:12.900]  mccarthyism when i was in journalism school back at umass i remember looking at that and thinking
[1:24:12.900 --> 1:24:19.380]  boy you know why weren't more people courageous enough to stand up and say i hate communism but
[1:24:19.380 --> 1:24:24.980]  i hate the deprivation of civil liberties more and i thought boy you know it's it's a shame i wasn't
[1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:30.180]  alive back then well i i tell you i shouldn't have wished that i would have the ability to be in a
[1:24:30.180 --> 1:24:36.180]  fight like that because here i am you know right now i think that this is the closest thing to and
[1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:42.500]  in fact it improves upon if you if you can use that word it improves upon how mccarthy did things
[1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:49.140]  we have the same exact thing going on we have the press marshaled against people we have the
[1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:53.860]  government marshaled against people and why because you have the audacity to be political
[1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:59.780]  dissidents now the only thing different between you know the the populist right right now and the
[1:25:00.500 --> 1:25:05.220]  communists back then is at least the populist right here has a lot of public support the
[1:25:05.220 --> 1:25:10.740]  communists at the time had if anything a tiny sliver of support because we knew better we knew
[1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:16.100]  better as a country we knew that that was going to lead us to Stalinism or lead us to Maoism
[1:25:16.100 --> 1:25:22.820]  you know but here actually had a populist movement that grew up in alternative media when you had
[1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:28.660]  the mainstream corporate press i tell you i used to say it acts like pravda for the left but i think
[1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:36.260]  that's actually an inapt comparison it's probably more of an obscure comparison to radio mill colleen
[1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:42.020]  in rwanda before the genocide i mean i see the way that these people talk about you talk about
[1:25:42.020 --> 1:25:47.940]  roger talk about anybody who might agree with you and it is a concerted effort to dehumanize you
[1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:54.180]  and to drag you down so that we have no dissent in this country and damn it competition is what
[1:25:54.180 --> 1:26:01.220]  built america competition in the capital systems competition in industry competition in creativity
[1:26:01.220 --> 1:26:08.100]  competition in everything including the marketplace of ideas that is why we have a first amendment
[1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:12.180]  and when you want to go in there and shut down one of the carts in the marketplace of ideas
[1:26:12.180 --> 1:26:18.260]  you're no longer acting in good faith as an american and shame on this committee for how it's acting
[1:26:18.740 --> 1:26:23.300]  well amen to that and and because multinational corporations are taking over where where do
[1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:27.460]  we go next roger because when we talk about the fifth amendment not that we've done anything wrong
[1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:31.620]  but why should we have to pay a bunch of lawyers to dig through everything and then just have them
[1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:37.780]  say we lie the only answer is hey fifth amendment i think well i look i'm not gonna have decided
[1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:42.580]  what i'm gonna do about this subpoena i won't decide it has a return date i believe in december 17
[1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:48.180]  i'll decide between now and then but this is an effort in distraction congressman adam schiff
[1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:53.460]  told us that he had seen substantial evidence of russian collusion he's never produced a thing
[1:26:53.460 --> 1:27:01.140]  eric swalwell's office was penetrated by a chinese communist spy he was sleeping with jerry nadler goes
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:08.340]  crazy about non-existent doj interference in my case but now he wants the doj to interfere in the
[1:27:08.340 --> 1:27:14.420]  verdict in the kyle rittenhouse case these people are hypocrites and this is an effort to distract
[1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:20.500]  from their own lies and their own crimes you're absolutely right in fact next segment for tv viewers
[1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:24.980]  radio listeners can imagine and they're lucky they don't have to look at it i mean you look at the
[1:27:24.980 --> 1:27:31.620]  penguin daddler and you look at polosi and you look at swallows well they're a legion of morons
[1:27:31.620 --> 1:27:37.380]  these are ridiculous people perched on top america's back that have sold us out to china
[1:27:37.380 --> 1:27:44.340]  they should be very easy to get rid of politically all right look the real question is in 2022 will
[1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:50.580]  we have a fair honest transparent election if we do these people are toast i mean gas prices are
[1:27:50.580 --> 1:27:55.220]  heading to eight dollars a gallon before it's over you're going to see far far more deaths
[1:27:55.220 --> 1:28:01.940]  and injuries from the covid-19 vaccination as they attempt to make it mandatory compulsory you
[1:28:01.940 --> 1:28:08.820]  have us being pushed around around the world by the chinese by the north koreans again the russians
[1:28:08.820 --> 1:28:16.740]  are masked on the borders of Crimea why because joe biden exudes weakness and our adversaries can
[1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:22.500]  see that are you around alex do you remember any food shortages under president donald j
[1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:28.980]  trump did we have high gas prices under donald j we having to beg gasoline from the russians in
[1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:36.100]  the soles no so they want to they want to distract from the the horrific conditions in america
[1:28:36.100 --> 1:28:42.420]  under this incompetent and probably illegitimately elected president i totally agree with you this
[1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:47.460]  is a ruling class out of control collapsing rotting dying and they're projecting their own
[1:28:47.460 --> 1:28:51.940]  death fears onto us trying to bring america with us into their death spiral we're sorry
[1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:57.940]  they're all physically dying but they all will be dead soon we'll be right back attention radio

[1:33:07.780 --> 1:33:16.260]  so
[1:33:22.740 --> 1:33:30.260]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:38.100]  all right welcome back roger stone riding shotgun one of this global exclusive
[1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:45.140]  and mark randall is a top first amendment lawyer and more but during the little short break
[1:33:45.140 --> 1:33:48.660]  i said why do you think they're doing this he just did this two-minute rant to me
[1:33:49.300 --> 1:33:53.620]  that was absolutely on target and amazing can you repeat i know it's hard to repeat
[1:33:53.620 --> 1:34:00.260]  genius again on q but i mean repeat what you just said during the break when in 2008
[1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:07.620]  i actually donated to and volunteered on the obama campaign and we laughed at the fact that
[1:34:07.620 --> 1:34:12.900]  the republicans didn't really understand the internet at that point and you know we just
[1:34:12.900 --> 1:34:17.860]  looked at the internet as uh as as digital massachusetts there was no point in putting much
[1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:23.060]  effort into it because the republicans weren't even going to show up well in 2016 and those
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:27.060]  intervening eight years a lot of people on the right learned how to use the internet
[1:34:27.060 --> 1:34:33.860]  and then all of a sudden this this alternative media is what came into play people who weren't
[1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:39.220]  in the mainstream corporate press that mainstream corporate press has acted hand in hand with the
[1:34:39.220 --> 1:34:46.740]  democratic party for decades so you know democrats watched their own news feed their own pravda and
[1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:51.620]  all that got regurgitated back to them was what a joke the trump campaign was what a joke people
[1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:56.900]  like you were what a joke all it was and they didn't they just weren't prepared for it they were as
[1:34:56.900 --> 1:35:02.180]  shocked as anybody was the next morning when they woke up and they saw that trump had won
[1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:06.500]  and i think they looked at that and they swore they'd never be caught like that again
[1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:12.100]  now what a real american would do at that point is say how did we lose in the marketplace of ideas
[1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:17.060]  how do we retool our arguments how do we get to connect with the american people these people
[1:35:17.060 --> 1:35:22.740]  who are patriotic who believe in america who believe in the constitution but instead they
[1:35:22.740 --> 1:35:27.780]  looked to the other direction and they decided that they were going to try to win the marketplace of
[1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:32.820]  ideas by shutting down the opposing store in that marketplace they want the classic purge
[1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:38.820]  authoritarian model just come out shut down opposing media and you you notice that first
[1:35:38.820 --> 1:35:43.060]  they started with people that it was easy to start with you know they tested the waters with
[1:35:43.060 --> 1:35:48.580]  milo and then they they kept moving along and they kept hitting other people and as one by well just
[1:35:48.580 --> 1:35:52.580]  say it they demonized me particularly so that roger schoen and i got banned people wouldn't
[1:35:52.580 --> 1:35:56.820]  stand for us and then every domino fell so we'll talk about the way to counter that one by one
[1:35:56.820 --> 1:36:00.900]  so i want to get your take on how we counter that in a moment but roger responding what randaza just
[1:36:00.900 --> 1:36:05.380]  said you're right what you said is so important before break i cannot stress this enough this
[1:36:05.380 --> 1:36:09.540]  is all the distraction from the gisling max will pedophile trial this is all the distraction from
[1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:14.900]  the open borders this is all a distraction from the dollar devaluation and uh biden dumping the
[1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:20.500]  strategic oil reserve on the market and oil prices didn't really go down i mean so so speak to that
[1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:26.820]  and where do they go when they're crashing and burning and national polls have 67 of people
[1:36:26.820 --> 1:36:32.180]  even in fake polls hating him it's probably 80 percent i've never seen such a cratering here
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:38.500]  as a long-term political hand what do you read the tea leaves well first of all let me say i have
[1:36:38.500 --> 1:36:45.300]  the highest possible regard for uh mark randazo's a man of integrity and is a great lawyer um in fact
[1:36:45.300 --> 1:36:50.820]  if you read m statin's book blacklisted by history which and culture called the second greatest book
[1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:57.220]  after the bible makes a pretty good case that there was communist subversion in america in the 1950s
[1:36:57.220 --> 1:37:02.740]  now it's mccarty's tactics we don't like and in this case these are the tactics of mccarty the
[1:37:02.740 --> 1:37:09.940]  tactics of smear the tactics of vilification uh and that's exactly the point we have become clickbait
[1:37:10.580 --> 1:37:16.500]  we're being attacked because it's it just makes the left drool the reason my wife was attacked
[1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:23.060]  outside our home last christmas uh by uh by some left-wing lunatic the reason that there's so much
[1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:30.500]  hatred i mean literally a a a a tsunami of hate on twitter against me against alex jones against
[1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:39.220]  owens shroyer is because we are cutting through the bias to tell people the truth there is a
[1:37:39.220 --> 1:37:45.060]  disproportionate amount of red chinese influence in our government today we have an authoritarian
[1:37:45.060 --> 1:37:50.740]  and politicized department of justice in which the fbi breaks into the home of journalists
[1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:57.380]  like james o' keith to try to determine who their sources are this is to have a chilling effect
[1:37:57.380 --> 1:38:03.460]  on every other journalist in america you know those guys at the new york times in the washington
[1:38:03.460 --> 1:38:09.540]  post who may be chortling you better be very careful because they may be next freedom of the
[1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:15.860]  press is out the window in fact their answer to being challenged on any intellectual basis
[1:38:16.420 --> 1:38:23.060]  is censorship is deplatforming is in fact outright cancellation and then it's trying
[1:38:23.060 --> 1:38:26.500]  to put you in prison like you're doing to you and i over and over again i mean let's not forget
[1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:31.460]  you got pardoned and again i i like roger roger is a really smart funny guy to hang out with
[1:38:31.460 --> 1:38:35.220]  great insights always very careful about being accurate people always say he's this big villain
[1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:39.940]  liar i remember saying you want to job at him for us am i trying to act tough like oh he wanted
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:43.700]  to job but he did obviously want to get paid you know he's a capitalist and i'm like listen i love
[1:38:43.700 --> 1:38:48.740]  you as a show i love you as a guest but i want juliena sange and i want this and that and then
[1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:54.260]  if you can get big guests for the show i will pay you the nice sum he wanted and he goes i'll get on
[1:38:54.260 --> 1:38:59.220]  it i'm talking to this randy credit code and they tell me it's big so i already knew that roger told
[1:38:59.220 --> 1:39:04.820]  the truth to congress i knew he didn't have a contact with sange and i was there and then i
[1:39:04.820 --> 1:39:10.260]  watched them convict him of something he didn't do because i was laughing at roger before i thought
[1:39:10.260 --> 1:39:14.420]  it was a i mean he's to get mad at me he said listen serbian you need to watch out and he was
[1:39:14.420 --> 1:39:18.820]  right so now i listen roger but uh that's why i take this very serious this time even though we're
[1:39:18.820 --> 1:39:26.260]  totally innocent because these people are crazy well look on november 3rd 2020 only because buzz
[1:39:26.260 --> 1:39:31.940]  feed brought lawsuit robert mother and the department of justice were forced to to release the last
[1:39:31.940 --> 1:39:37.860]  remaining long hidden redactions in their secret report in which they admitted that there was quote
[1:39:37.860 --> 1:39:44.260]  no factual evidence tying me to russian collusion wiki leaks collaboration or the fishing and
[1:39:44.260 --> 1:39:49.860]  publication of john podesta's highly embarrassing emails so what then was my motive to lie what
[1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:58.100]  was i lying about any statement i made before congress was irrelevant immaterial hid no underlying
[1:39:58.100 --> 1:40:05.460]  crime now we see dr anthony fouchie lies his ass off before congress ran paul does a spectacular
[1:40:05.460 --> 1:40:13.060]  job of nailing him but when will he be charged when 29 fbi agents storm his home at six o'clock
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:18.340]  in the morning uh and march his wife out of the house uh in her nightgown so let me ask you this
[1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:24.740]  question then mark ronda's uh why do intelligent people with high accused i'm not bragging but
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:29.780]  we're obviously not low IQ here i think we're all above 100 i think it's fair to say why do we get
[1:40:29.780 --> 1:40:34.740]  chivalry like let's not break rules let's have agreed upon let's not do dirty things not because
[1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:39.860]  we're just wimps but because we know it'll be done to our family why are they breaking all the rules
[1:40:39.860 --> 1:40:43.620]  doing all this not knowing it's going to summon their own destruction i i just think they're
[1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:49.620]  they don't think a few moves ahead roger well except i think you have to recognize the single
[1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:57.220]  greatest trait they have is arrogance they're extraordinarily arrogant uh and that permeated
[1:40:57.220 --> 1:41:04.180]  the mother investigation it permeated uh the special counsel's office it permeates today
[1:41:04.180 --> 1:41:10.820]  the biden justice department they are the law uh and that means that they cut corners look i'm
[1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:14.660]  being sued by the biden department i mean look at these guys in the video talking about us i mean
[1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:19.940]  they look like look at the arrogance of both all of them i mean look at these people you wouldn't
[1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:24.420]  have these people over for dinner you would they all look like they look like super villains they
[1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:29.620]  just think they're radiating evil well you can always tell when they're lying you see their
[1:41:29.620 --> 1:41:34.180]  lips are moving that's the car i know that's mccabe right there i know the bimbo in the middle but
[1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:39.460]  who is the who is the guy that looks like dr evil over here i don't know he looks brain dead to me
[1:41:39.460 --> 1:41:44.580]  uh he's like an arrogant son of a bitch to me yeah i know he attacked me a couple weeks ago i can't
[1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:49.300]  even remember his name but right now i don't want to boost his name id and give him more followers
[1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:55.380]  you know this is this whole thing is an absurdity so yesterday i thought about it you know what the
[1:41:55.380 --> 1:42:02.340]  house uh january 6th committee been there done that i've gotten the t-shirt it says roger stone
[1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:07.780]  did nothing wrong alex the greatest single problem here as you know is the enormous expense look what
[1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:13.220]  you're going through in the sandy hook case look what i'm going through fighting this my coffers
[1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:18.260]  are empty my legal defense fund is bail on hold on we're gonna both do a big plug to support us

[1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:27.940]  an investment to fund this operation i love my little house i'm not complaining i got my dodge car
[1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:34.340]  my f-150 i'm a happy gambler they can't i don't care about money but money keeps us in the war
[1:42:34.340 --> 1:42:37.300]  like if you've got an army you got to feed them you got to keep them closed you got to sharpen

[1:42:59.620 --> 1:43:06.740]  who is awake can clearly see why alex jones was the platform info wars was right above the target
[1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:12.580]  and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack three years later and info wars is
[1:43:12.580 --> 1:43:19.220]  still thriving thanks to the support of our audience but we are now facing the fiercest battle yet
[1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:24.740]  and we need you to help save info wars the enemies entrenched within our government
[1:43:24.740 --> 1:43:31.140]  are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against alex jones no crime no

[1:43:37.780 --> 1:43:45.060]  with their new ussa but we won't let them alex jones will have his day in court with your support

[1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:11.540]  air glad challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[1:44:11.540 --> 1:44:16.580]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[1:44:16.580 --> 1:44:22.500]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[1:44:22.500 --> 1:44:30.020]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:34.660]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[1:44:34.660 --> 1:44:39.140]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it to me it doesn't happen
[1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:45.540]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:51.380]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore
[1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:56.500]  you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:44:56.500 --> 1:45:05.780]  and god created each and every one of us with free will but we look at the world system now
[1:45:05.780 --> 1:45:11.380]  openly announcing the mark of the beast everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting
[1:45:11.380 --> 1:45:17.460]  rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies our very
[1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:26.100]  productivity our very genetics our very future over to them they want control of procreation
[1:45:26.100 --> 1:45:31.300]  they want control of the relationships between men and women they want to bring a form of living
[1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:38.340]  death to our society in our civilization all of us were formed and made in god's mind and god's
[1:45:38.340 --> 1:45:44.420]  image and given free will and make no mistake all of you alive today were created by god to be alive
[1:45:44.420 --> 1:45:49.940]  in this special time so that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil
[1:45:49.940 --> 1:45:56.980]  and then for eternity win the great birthright prize of being aligned with god
[1:45:59.940 --> 1:46:04.500]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[1:46:04.500 --> 1:46:16.100]  do
[1:47:04.500 --> 1:47:33.500]  You know, Rick Lenkletter is a nice guy and he called me up twenty-seven years ago, and
[1:47:33.500 --> 1:47:40.500]  then I got a bunch of movie offers after that and I had no thrill seeing myself on the big
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:41.500]  screen.
[1:47:41.500 --> 1:47:44.500]  I don't care about being on the national news, I don't care about meeting powerful rich
[1:47:44.500 --> 1:47:49.500]  people, but I love being on the zeitgeist fighting tyranny and knowing all of these
[1:47:49.500 --> 1:47:54.500]  listeners and all these great people and folks that stand against tyranny.
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:58.500]  That to me is exciting and you are the real rock stars in my life.
[1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:00.500]  I mean, I like, I love Ted Nugent's music.
[1:48:00.500 --> 1:48:04.500]  He's got some of the best music out there, but the fact that he's been fighting him since
[1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:08.500]  the seventies and is a trailblazer I admire.
[1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:15.500]  It's not about the great guitar he plays, it's about how he stands up for what's right.
[1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:17.500]  Now, let's talk about Andrew McCabe.
[1:48:17.500 --> 1:48:23.500]  He's won back full FBI pension after being fired under Trump, the Hill reports, and all his
[1:48:23.500 --> 1:48:24.500]  legal bills paid.
[1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:26.500]  Wow, I never got my legal bills paid.
[1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:33.500]  The Democratic Party, the same folks that bankrupted Remington filed six Sandy Hook suits.
[1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:37.500]  We're down to four of them right now and we got two others we're dealing with.
[1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:39.500]  Okay, that's the level.
[1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:42.500]  People say, well, you know, I'm like a baby bird begging for money here.
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:44.500]  Yeah, folks, we're the tip of the spear.
[1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:50.500]  If you want us to keep fighting, if you want us to stand up, I mean, we are the champions
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:54.500]  of freedom and I'm not up here like some arrogant son of a bitch going because that's bad luck.
[1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:56.500]  Oh, man, I'm your champion.
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:57.500]  I'm the big daddy.
[1:48:57.500 --> 1:48:58.500]  No, I'm not the big daddy.
[1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:02.500]  I'm somebody that couldn't battle their evil and wouldn't go away and understood they were
[1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:04.500]  evil and that had to be resisted.
[1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:06.500]  So that's why I want you to spread the word about us.
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:07.500]  I want you to pray for us.
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:09.500]  I want you to support us at m4shore.com.
[1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:11.500]  I want you to support Roger Stone.
[1:49:11.500 --> 1:49:14.500]  Everybody in America should be wearing a Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt.
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:17.500]  Otherwise, you got new t-shirt designers that were always great, but I'm jealous.
[1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:21.500]  The new one he's got from big daddy distributors, Big Daddy and Lemon, the big gun company in
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:22.500]  Florida.
[1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:25.500]  We're going to talk about those in a moment because we got to stay on air.
[1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:27.500]  You got to, you know, show your colors loud and proud.
[1:49:27.500 --> 1:49:30.500]  And let me tell you, we're in an Info War shirt, a Roger Stone shirt.
[1:49:30.500 --> 1:49:32.500]  You can't be more avant-garde.
[1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:33.500]  You can't be more Americana.
[1:49:33.500 --> 1:49:35.500]  You can't be more populist.
[1:49:35.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  You can't be more rebel.
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:37.500]  You can't be more outlaw.
[1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:41.500]  I mean, they called Willie Nelson and Willem Jennings, who I love, outlaw country because
[1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:45.500]  they moved to Austin instead of Nashville and saying like they wanted to.
[1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:48.500]  We're taking on the new world order, folks, and we need your support.
[1:49:48.500 --> 1:49:53.500]  But here is what Roger Stone was talking about, McCabe, the disgraced former deputy director
[1:49:53.500 --> 1:49:58.500]  that lied to Trump, lied to Congress, everything up there talking about us being his enemies.
[1:49:58.500 --> 1:50:03.500]  So the good news is, if this big, powerful man is up late at night wanting to put us
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  in prison, that shows he's not as powerful as this criminal claims.
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:08.500]  And yeah, I call him a criminal.
[1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.500]  Here it is.
[1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:13.500]  Out front now, Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI and LA Honig, who was
[1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:16.500]  an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District here in New York.
[1:50:16.500 --> 1:50:21.500]  Director McCabe, both Alex Jones and Roger Stone, of course, were in Washington on the
[1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:23.500]  day of the insurrection, the day before.
[1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:27.500]  They were both incredibly vocal proponents of pushing the big lie about the election,
[1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:29.500]  rigged hoax, all of that.
[1:50:29.500 --> 1:50:33.500]  They have longstanding ties to Steve Bannon, who is the one who convinced Trump to come
[1:50:33.500 --> 1:50:36.500]  back to Washington for January 6th.
[1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:41.500]  So how central to this could they be?
[1:50:41.500 --> 1:50:46.500]  Well, Aaron, I think they could be right at the red-hot center of it.
[1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:52.500]  And I think we've, you know, the committee has kind of telegraphed what they're thinking
[1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:56.500]  with each round of subpoenas that we see coming out.
[1:50:56.500 --> 1:51:03.500]  And for my money, what seems clear is they are focused intently, not on specifically
[1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:10.500]  the mayhem of the insurrection on January 6th, but on the days leading up to January 6th.
[1:51:10.500 --> 1:51:15.500]  They are trying to get to who was at the center of planning this activity.
[1:51:15.500 --> 1:51:17.500]  How was it funded?
[1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:19.500]  Where were those communication networks?
[1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:20.500]  Who was involved?
[1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:21.500]  Who was talking to who?
[1:51:21.500 --> 1:51:23.500]  And how does this potentially get back to the White House?
[1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:28.500]  And of course, the ultimate question was the violence part of the plan.
[1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:34.500]  And I think these subpoenas are a great way of closing down the loop on those questions
[1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:36.500]  and really getting to the center of it.
[1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:37.500]  Right, right.
[1:51:37.500 --> 1:51:40.500]  You can't listen anymore to this.
[1:51:40.500 --> 1:51:42.500]  Roger, only two folks can respond to this in the world.
[1:51:42.500 --> 1:51:45.500]  You and I, were we the big, hot, juicy red center?
[1:51:45.500 --> 1:51:47.500]  That was a pink center.
[1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:53.500]  But actually Andrew McCabe is the White Hot Center of the Russian Collusion Hokes.
[1:51:53.500 --> 1:51:58.500]  He's the one who knows the steel dossiers of fraud, but allows it to be used the rationale
[1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:00.500]  for an illegal investigation.
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:04.500]  Then she says, I'm a close associate of Steve Bannon's.
[1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  What planet does she live on?
[1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:10.500]  She testified against me at my trial, falsely purging himself to help Robert.
[1:52:10.500 --> 1:52:13.500]  Yeah, I've asked you, even though I know he did that, to just drop it.
[1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:16.500]  You attack him like a piranha on the show.
[1:52:16.500 --> 1:52:17.500]  They all know that.
[1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:19.500]  I mean, your feud is famous.
[1:52:19.500 --> 1:52:22.500]  Well, it's not some minor political scuffle.
[1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:25.500]  They were trying to give me seven to nine, and he was trying to help them.
[1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:28.500]  So you can see how I might be somewhat upset about that.
[1:52:28.500 --> 1:52:29.500]  That's not the point here today.
[1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:32.500]  The point is, she's a damn liar and knows it.
[1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:34.500]  Well, that is exactly true.
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:38.500]  There's one other guy here that has to be mentioned, and that is Owen Schreuer.
[1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:41.500]  You can go to GiveSendGo.com right now.
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:46.500]  We're only $2,000 short of raising a quarter of a million dollars for his legal defense.
[1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:48.500]  He's done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:52.500]  From what I can see, and I've read his indictment, it's a fraud.
[1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:56.500]  Owen Schreuer deserves your support, because he too is a truth teller,
[1:52:56.500 --> 1:53:01.500]  and he too is being smeared and disparaged and vilified when he did nothing illegal.
[1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:05.500]  Absolutely, and InfoWars will continue to solicit support, and we appreciate that.
[1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:09.500]  But Roger, let's talk about you, because your wife's got stage 4 cancer,
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:10.500]  in a way she gets better.
[1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:13.500]  They beat her up outside at your apartment where you live.
[1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:15.500]  They celebrate, they took your house away.
[1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:17.500]  And again, you're that standard they're trying to seize.
[1:53:17.500 --> 1:53:19.500]  I love the new t-shirt designs.
[1:53:19.500 --> 1:53:23.500]  Where will people find all these new great Roger Stone t-shirts and support what you're doing?
[1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:28.500]  Well, they can go to RogerStoneStore.com, RogerStoneStore.com.
[1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:31.500]  They can go to StoneCoach.com in the store.
[1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:36.500]  But most importantly, I need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:53:36.500 --> 1:53:41.500]  By law, those funds can only be used for my legal defense.
[1:53:41.500 --> 1:53:46.500]  I need lawyers, new lawyers, because I'm not going to roll over to the deep state,
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:50.500]  and I will never plead to something that I didn't do.
[1:53:50.500 --> 1:53:53.500]  As you know, I was pressured to bear false witness against the president.
[1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:56.500]  I could have gotten off the hook by doing that.
[1:53:56.500 --> 1:54:00.500]  I refused because Michael Cohen, I am not.
[1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:04.500]  And by the way, they want to make examples of us to destroy us,
[1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:06.500]  to intimidate anybody else that might stand up.
[1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:08.500]  That's why we don't just want to survive.
[1:54:08.500 --> 1:54:10.500]  We want to thrive. That's why if you want to save America,
[1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:12.500]  you should support RogerStone.
[1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:15.500]  You support InfoWars. You should do it right now.
[1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:18.500]  Mark Rundazza comments on what we're seeing with Andrew McCabe,
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:21.500]  the disgraced former deputy director that lied to Congress up there trying to say
[1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:23.500]  that we're the hot red center of this.
[1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:25.500]  Look, I just don't see it.
[1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:27.500]  They were reds like communists, too.
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:33.500]  Look, I've seen you guys say things that were politically incendiary,
[1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:36.500]  say things that are politically dissenting,
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:39.500]  and that's the point of America, dammit.
[1:54:39.500 --> 1:54:42.500]  I don't know how many people have seen this movie,
[1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:45.500]  but there was a movie that came out during the Bush administration
[1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:48.500]  that was supposed to be an oblique attack on its excesses,
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.500]  and I think it had some excesses as well.
[1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:53.500]  Good night and good luck. It was about the McCarthy era.
[1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:55.500]  It was about Edward R. Murrow.
[1:54:55.500 --> 1:55:00.500]  But you can watch that, and that is a parable that fits any political excess.
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:05.500]  And if you watch that, watch that now and watch it and look at what they're doing now.
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:07.500]  It's way worse than McCarthy.
[1:55:07.500 --> 1:55:10.500]  You know what I don't agree with, and I respectfully disagree with both of you.
[1:55:10.500 --> 1:55:12.500]  This is supposed to be a distraction.
[1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:15.500]  I don't think it is. I think it's the main event.
[1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:20.500]  I think they want a civil war, but they want it in a very elegant way.
[1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:24.500]  They want it against unarmed opponents. They want it against the indefensible.
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:29.500]  They want to limit the people who are willing to stand up to them to a tiny small group
[1:55:29.500 --> 1:55:34.500]  and then eliminate them, and then all the people are sort of right in the middle or...
[1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:36.500]  No, no, I agree with you that they want to...
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:38.500]  They want to scare them. It's a psychological...
[1:55:38.500 --> 1:55:41.500]  In June, Biden said the new terror threat isn't Islam or anything.
[1:55:41.500 --> 1:55:44.500]  It's American citizens that protest and soccer moms.
[1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:47.500]  And so, yeah, you're right. You're right. I actually agree with you.
[1:55:47.500 --> 1:55:50.500]  They're trying to kick off a war against the American people.
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:54.500]  An American president saying the greatest threat is other Americans.
[1:55:54.500 --> 1:55:58.500]  If you've got other Americans that aren't in favor of the government,
[1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:01.500]  the government's not doing its job the right way.
[1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:04.500]  Yeah, it's the government of the people. For the people.
[1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:05.500]  Why the people?
[1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:09.500]  We have to do... One thing I hear from a lot of people that agree with you.
[1:56:09.500 --> 1:56:12.500]  A lot of people come up to me and they say, hey, don't tell anybody this,
[1:56:12.500 --> 1:56:14.500]  but I think Alex is right.
[1:56:14.500 --> 1:56:17.500]  I'm like, hey, why are you saying it that way? Say it loud.
[1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:20.500]  If you believe... If you agree with Alex, say it loud.
[1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:23.500]  If you don't agree with him, say it loud.
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:26.500]  Don't be cowed by, you know, I just don't want to get in any trouble
[1:56:26.500 --> 1:56:29.500]  because that kind of silence is what's causing this
[1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:33.500]  because at least half this country doesn't believe
[1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:35.500]  that this is how the country should be governed.
[1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:38.500]  You know, I think that they are acting in a way that they think
[1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:42.500]  that they might have the ability to make that final coup de grace,
[1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:46.500]  that final move, and they're acting without honor.
[1:56:46.500 --> 1:56:48.500]  Oh, there's no doubt. This is an authoritarian takeover.
[1:56:48.500 --> 1:56:49.500]  Great points, Mark Randolph.
[1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:52.500]  And it's terrifying, you know, and frankly, look,
[1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:56.500]  I represent so many different people from so many different walks of life
[1:56:56.500 --> 1:56:59.500]  and so many places in that marketplace of ideas,
[1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:01.500]  and I don't care what they have to say.
[1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:06.500]  In fact, the more I disagree with somebody, the more I'm happy to represent them.
[1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:10.500]  And, you know, I want to tell you just a tale of something happy.
[1:57:10.500 --> 1:57:12.500]  Stay there. We've got to come back.
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:14.500]  Fifteen more minutes with Mark Randolph,
[1:57:14.500 --> 1:57:16.500]  and of course, the great Roger Stone,
[1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:18.500]  and then we've got Jake Ducey coming in here.
[1:57:18.500 --> 1:57:20.500]  I've got all the CIA, man control documents, stuff we've never covered.
[1:57:20.500 --> 1:57:23.500]  Literal, the most powerful stuff we've ever covered

[1:58:57.500 --> 1:59:01.500]  on the fact that those of you that have supported
[1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:03.500]  my broad guest at Info Wars over the years
[1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:05.500]  have changed the world in incredible ways.
[1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:09.500]  And now as 2021 prepares to end,
[1:59:09.500 --> 1:59:12.500]  and 2022 begins to dawn,
[1:59:12.500 --> 1:59:14.500]  it is more important than ever
[1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:16.500]  that you realize how important you are
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:18.500]  and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:20.500]  The tip of the spear is band.billion.
[1:59:20.500 --> 1:59:23.500]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty
[1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:25.500]  is infowarstore.com.

[1:59:32.500 --> 1:59:34.500]  at saveinfowars.com.
[1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:36.500]  At saveinfowars.com.
[1:59:36.500 --> 1:59:38.500]  And continue to go to infowarstore.com.
[1:59:38.500 --> 1:59:41.500]  Where right now we've got Turbo Force sold out for months,
[1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:44.500]  10 hours of energy, back in stock for free shipping,
[1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:59.500]  40% off and so many other great projects.
[1:59:59.500 --> 2:00:14.500]  So we have a corrupt out of control political system
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:17.500]  that's sold out American power in the last 40 years of China.
[2:00:17.500 --> 2:00:19.500]  One side of deals.
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:21.500]  I'll be all about doing trade deals.
[2:00:21.500 --> 2:00:23.500]  We build everybody up.
[2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:25.500]  That's not how it worked because they had an axe to grind
[2:00:25.500 --> 2:00:27.500]  politically wanting to deindustrialize the nation
[2:00:27.500 --> 2:00:29.500]  and control.
[2:00:29.500 --> 2:00:31.500]  How do I know?
[2:00:31.500 --> 2:00:33.500]  It's in Zabina Brzezinski books.
[2:00:33.500 --> 2:00:35.500]  The bastard wrote.
[2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:37.500]  Burn in hell.
[2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:39.500]  You and your daughter.
[2:00:39.500 --> 2:00:41.500]  And people say, oh, God, Alex is so mean.
[2:00:41.500 --> 2:00:43.500]  They literally destroyed the industrial base of the country
[2:00:43.500 --> 2:00:45.500]  so they could control us and put on welfare.
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:47.500]  I hate these people.
[2:00:47.500 --> 2:00:49.500]  I don't want to kill them.
[2:00:49.500 --> 2:00:51.500]  And I don't want to wish any violence against them.
[2:00:51.500 --> 2:00:53.500]  I'm putting up with them.
[2:00:53.500 --> 2:00:55.500]  So Mark Rundaz, a First Amendment lawyer here with us,
[2:00:55.500 --> 2:00:57.500]  you said you had a happy story to tell.
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:00:59.500]  I do.
[2:00:59.500 --> 2:01:01.500]  I represent, like I was saying before the break,
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:03.500]  I represent people all across the political spectrum.
[2:01:03.500 --> 2:01:05.500]  I'll have one person that hates the other one
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:07.500]  that I'm representing at the same time.
[2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:09.500]  And I represent a group of very conservative Christians
[2:01:09.500 --> 2:01:11.500]  called Church Militant.
[2:01:11.500 --> 2:01:13.500]  I also happen to represent the Satanic Temple.
[2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:15.500]  And Church Militant
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:17.500]  was trying to have a rally in Baltimore.
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:19.500]  But Baltimore is currently under what I call
[2:01:19.500 --> 2:01:21.500]  woke rule.
[2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:23.500]  And Baltimore tried to base it.
[2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:25.500]  And woke rule.
[2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:27.500]  And Baltimore tried to ban them from being there.
[2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:29.500]  And we fought them.
[2:01:29.500 --> 2:01:31.500]  We fought them all the way to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:33.500]  And I am proud to say that we won.
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:35.500]  But when we got up to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals,
[2:01:35.500 --> 2:01:37.500]  you know who came in to file an amicus brief
[2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:39.500]  on the Christian side?
[2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:41.500]  The Satanic Temple.
[2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:43.500]  So when you got Satanists coming up saying,
[2:01:43.500 --> 2:01:45.500]  hey, we want to stand up for the principles
[2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:47.500]  of people that we hate.
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:49.500]  We disagree with them so fundamentally.
[2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:51.500]  Sure.
[2:01:51.500 --> 2:01:53.500]  But when you get up the fact that you've done that,
[2:01:53.500 --> 2:01:55.500]  if you don't support everybody's free speech,
[2:01:55.500 --> 2:01:57.500]  it doesn't exist. It's like the Second Amendment.
[2:01:57.500 --> 2:01:59.500]  I don't care whether you're a Christian
[2:01:59.500 --> 2:02:01.500]  or whether you are an agnostic or a devil
[2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:03.500]  or you have a right to a gun.
[2:02:03.500 --> 2:02:05.500]  You have a right to use it on me unless I attack you.
[2:02:05.500 --> 2:02:07.500]  So I get that.
[2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:09.500]  I mean, either you agree to free will because God
[2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:11.500]  agrees with free will.
[2:02:11.500 --> 2:02:13.500]  I believe so.
[2:02:13.500 --> 2:02:15.500]  When somebody asked me, you know,
[2:02:15.500 --> 2:02:17.500]  how can you represent these people?
[2:02:17.500 --> 2:02:19.500]  Where is the line at which you wouldn't...
[2:02:19.500 --> 2:02:21.500]  I'll tell you where the line is for whose speech
[2:02:21.500 --> 2:02:23.500]  I would stand up to. I don't have one.
[2:02:23.500 --> 2:02:25.500]  There is no way because if you have one,
[2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:27.500]  then you don't believe in free speech.
[2:02:27.500 --> 2:02:29.500]  What you believe in is your tribe
[2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:31.500]  and you just use it.
[2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:33.500]  Good point. Where is all this going?
[2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:35.500]  Let me tell you some more of this story.
[2:02:35.500 --> 2:02:37.500]  What's great about it?
[2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:39.500]  Here's the star-spangled flying sparks of it.
[2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:41.500]  They came in.
[2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.500]  They helped those Christians win the right
[2:02:43.500 --> 2:02:45.500]  to have their rally.
[2:02:45.500 --> 2:02:47.500]  Then they had their rally.
[2:02:47.500 --> 2:02:49.500]  They went up to protest against that rally.
[2:02:49.500 --> 2:02:51.500]  Some of the Christians got a little upset
[2:02:51.500 --> 2:02:53.500]  and I said, hold on, and I explained to them,
[2:02:53.500 --> 2:02:55.500]  these people fought for your right
[2:02:55.500 --> 2:02:57.500]  to be here, too.
[2:02:57.500 --> 2:02:59.500]  They said, well, why are they protesting against us?
[2:02:59.500 --> 2:03:01.500]  And I said, because that is what America is all about.
[2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:03.500]  Sure, they were all about the...
[2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:05.500]  And most Satanists are really libertarians
[2:03:05.500 --> 2:03:07.500]  trying to dress up in that gold.
[2:03:07.500 --> 2:03:09.500]  And everybody was peaceful.
[2:03:09.500 --> 2:03:11.500]  Even Antifa showed up to protest against it
[2:03:11.500 --> 2:03:13.500]  and they did so peacefully.
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:15.500]  Sure, we need to rediscover those American values.
[2:03:15.500 --> 2:03:17.500]  What bothers me, Alex, is
[2:03:17.500 --> 2:03:19.500]  I cannot allow it to get into
[2:03:19.500 --> 2:03:21.500]  the specifics of the subpoena,
[2:03:21.500 --> 2:03:23.500]  but essentially what they're trying to do
[2:03:23.500 --> 2:03:25.500]  is take constitutionally protected
[2:03:25.500 --> 2:03:27.500]  political activities
[2:03:27.500 --> 2:03:29.500]  and somehow criminalize them.
[2:03:29.500 --> 2:03:31.500]  Yes, I did urge people to go to a rally
[2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:33.500]  to support President Donald Trump.
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:35.500]  Yes, I did question the extraordinary
[2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:37.500]  number of irregularities
[2:03:37.500 --> 2:03:39.500]  and anomalies in the 2020 election results.
[2:03:39.500 --> 2:03:41.500]  I have an absolute
[2:03:41.500 --> 2:03:43.500]  constitutional right to do so.
[2:03:43.500 --> 2:03:45.500]  But they want to criminalize
[2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:47.500]  what here and for has been
[2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:49.500]  constitutionally protected
[2:03:49.500 --> 2:03:51.500]  political activity.
[2:03:51.500 --> 2:03:53.500]  And that's the slippery slope.
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:55.500]  One day it's James O'Keefe's
[2:03:55.500 --> 2:03:57.500]  home that they are reading.
[2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:59.500]  The next day, who knows?
[2:03:59.500 --> 2:04:01.500]  Anybody who's a journalist should realize
[2:04:01.500 --> 2:04:03.500]  the chilling effect that this has.
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:05.500]  They're trying to suppress truth.
[2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:07.500]  They're trying to suppress the free press.
[2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:09.500]  They're trying to suppress free speech.
[2:04:09.500 --> 2:04:11.500]  Everything I did
[2:04:11.500 --> 2:04:13.500]  on January 5th
[2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:15.500]  proves nothing about January 6th.
[2:04:15.500 --> 2:04:17.500]  Yeah, I spoke at a rally
[2:04:17.500 --> 2:04:19.500]  that was actually sponsored by Women for Trump.
[2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:21.500]  Oh, that was sponsored by the 3%ers.
[2:04:21.500 --> 2:04:23.500]  You know what, Alex?
[2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:25.500]  I never heard of the 3%ers before this.
[2:04:25.500 --> 2:04:27.500]  I was about to say, they're asking me about
[2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:29.500]  all contacts.
[2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:31.500]  I've seen patches that say 3%.
[2:04:31.500 --> 2:04:33.500]  I know that means 3%
[2:04:33.500 --> 2:04:35.500]  fought the Revolutionary War.
[2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:37.500]  3%ers are motorcycle gangs.
[2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.500]  That's it.
[2:04:39.500 --> 2:04:41.500]  Are you now? Let's talk about that when we come back.
[2:04:41.500 --> 2:04:43.500]  That's the point you brought up.
[2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:45.500]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[2:04:45.500 --> 2:04:47.500]  And look at these new headlines.
[2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.500]  The January 6th committee comes for
[2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:51.500]  Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[2:04:51.500 --> 2:04:53.500]  They're coming for us.
[2:04:53.500 --> 2:04:55.500]  They're coming for America.
[2:04:57.500 --> 2:04:59.500]  Infowars, get prepared.
[2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:01.500]  There are so many crappy brands
[2:05:01.500 --> 2:05:03.500]  of energy products, energy drinks,
[2:05:03.500 --> 2:05:05.500]  energy powders, energy pills.
[2:05:05.500 --> 2:05:07.500]  And look, almost all of them
[2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:09.500]  work, but they're toxic
[2:05:09.500 --> 2:05:11.500]  and they've got incredible downsides.
[2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:13.500]  Horrible crashes
[2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:15.500]  and, again,
[2:05:15.500 --> 2:05:17.500]  so many toxins on them.
[2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:19.500]  All of the Neutropic products
[2:05:19.500 --> 2:05:21.500]  that we sell at InfowarsTour.com
[2:05:21.500 --> 2:05:23.500]  are clean, are pure,
[2:05:23.500 --> 2:05:25.500]  are highest quality, and they're
[2:05:25.500 --> 2:05:27.500]  long-lasting, and they
[2:05:27.500 --> 2:05:29.500]  help focus your mind.
[2:05:29.500 --> 2:05:31.500]  And right now, our strongest product
[2:05:31.500 --> 2:05:33.500]  of the three Neutrobics we have,

[2:05:41.500 --> 2:05:43.500]  TurboForce has been sold out
[2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:45.500]  for more than six months.
[2:05:45.500 --> 2:05:47.500]  It's back in stock with free shipping,
[2:05:47.500 --> 2:05:49.500]  40% off. It is
[2:05:49.500 --> 2:05:51.500]  10 hours of clean
[2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:53.500]  energy,
[2:05:53.500 --> 2:05:55.500]  clean energy without the big crash,
[2:05:55.500 --> 2:05:57.500]  and it's available right now, and it funds the Infowar
[2:05:57.500 --> 2:06:09.500]  A3.
[2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:11.500]  I don't know how all this is gonna end,
[2:06:11.500 --> 2:06:13.500]  but if you want to fight,
[2:06:13.500 --> 2:06:15.500]  you better believe
[2:06:15.500 --> 2:06:17.500]  you got one.
[2:06:17.500 --> 2:06:19.500]  Boy, they hate that.
[2:06:19.500 --> 2:06:21.500]  They put that in the subpoenas.
[2:06:21.500 --> 2:06:23.500]  They attack it. Obviously,
[2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:25.500]  when I say you want to fight a political cultural fight,
[2:06:25.500 --> 2:06:27.500]  or
[2:06:27.500 --> 2:06:29.500]  like a football game, or two corporations,
[2:06:29.500 --> 2:06:31.500]  or Ford versus Ferrari,
[2:06:31.500 --> 2:06:33.500]  I was gonna say,
[2:06:33.500 --> 2:06:35.500]  come arm, take over the capital,
[2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:37.500]  that would have been the plan. We would have done it.
[2:06:37.500 --> 2:06:39.500]  We would have taken it back from the communists, but we didn't do that.
[2:06:39.500 --> 2:06:41.500]  So the globalists are trying to say
[2:06:41.500 --> 2:06:43.500]  we're violent and have to be shut down.
[2:06:43.500 --> 2:06:45.500]  All right, those last 10 minutes
[2:06:45.500 --> 2:06:47.500]  with the legendary Roger Stone
[2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:49.500]  and Mark Rondaz, the First Amendment lawyer,
[2:06:49.500 --> 2:06:51.500]  prominent First Amendment lawyer,
[2:06:51.500 --> 2:06:53.500]  closing points the 10 minutes we have, Roger.
[2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:55.500]  What else is on your radar screen?
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:06:57.500]  Now, you want to talk about Rittenhouse,
[2:06:57.500 --> 2:06:59.500]  this attack up in
[2:06:59.500 --> 2:07:01.500]  with the suicide killer.
[2:07:01.500 --> 2:07:03.500]  I mean, he didn't suicide, but he killed so many people.
[2:07:03.500 --> 2:07:05.500]  What else is on your radar screen?
[2:07:07.500 --> 2:07:09.500]  You know, it's amazing now.
[2:07:09.500 --> 2:07:11.500]  So you have Black Lives Matter activists
[2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:13.500]  saying now they're furious
[2:07:13.500 --> 2:07:15.500]  because they have to worry about getting shot
[2:07:15.500 --> 2:07:17.500]  when they go out to kill somebody.
[2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:19.500]  This is an outrageous thing.
[2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:21.500]  What's great about the Rittenhouse verdict
[2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:23.500]  is it proves that the system
[2:07:23.500 --> 2:07:25.500]  can still work.
[2:07:25.500 --> 2:07:27.500]  That the fundamental judicial system
[2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:29.500]  set up by our founding fathers
[2:07:29.500 --> 2:07:31.500]  really can work.
[2:07:31.500 --> 2:07:33.500]  God bless him.
[2:07:33.500 --> 2:07:35.500]  But that goes to the larger point, Alex,
[2:07:35.500 --> 2:07:37.500]  and that is I'm only here
[2:07:37.500 --> 2:07:39.500]  by the grace of God.
[2:07:39.500 --> 2:07:41.500]  I'm only here because
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:43.500]  I reaffirmed my commitment to Jesus Christ.
[2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:45.500]  I'm only here because I confess
[2:07:45.500 --> 2:07:47.500]  that I was a sinner and I got right with Christ.
[2:07:47.500 --> 2:07:49.500]  Because they were going to frame me
[2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:51.500]  and hang me
[2:07:51.500 --> 2:07:53.500]  after gagging me
[2:07:53.500 --> 2:07:55.500]  in a Soviet style show trial.
[2:07:55.500 --> 2:07:57.500]  So God is good.
[2:07:57.500 --> 2:07:59.500]  God has the protection of this nation.
[2:07:59.500 --> 2:08:01.500]  We do know how this comes out.
[2:08:01.500 --> 2:08:03.500]  You know why?
[2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.500]  We read the Bible. That's why.
[2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:07.500]  We know that good triumphs
[2:08:07.500 --> 2:08:09.500]  in the end. That's why.
[2:08:09.500 --> 2:08:11.500]  We just don't know how it happens.
[2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:13.500]  You want to make God laugh?
[2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:15.500]  Tell him you have a plan.
[2:08:15.500 --> 2:08:17.500]  No, he has a plan for this nation.
[2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:19.500]  It's on our money.
[2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:21.500]  In God we trust.
[2:08:21.500 --> 2:08:23.500]  Of course, they want to take that off too.
[2:08:23.500 --> 2:08:25.500]  Oh yeah, General Flynn said
[2:08:25.500 --> 2:08:27.500]  I don't care what religion you are.
[2:08:27.500 --> 2:08:29.500]  You got to believe in God.
[2:08:29.500 --> 2:08:31.500]  We need to believe in God to save the country.
[2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:33.500]  And they spun it and said we want a state run religion.
[2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:35.500]  He didn't say that.
[2:08:35.500 --> 2:08:37.500]  No, General Flynn is one of the greatest
[2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:39.500]  men of this century.
[2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:41.500]  He's a man of destiny.
[2:08:41.500 --> 2:08:43.500]  He's a man of the Constitution.
[2:08:43.500 --> 2:08:45.500]  He's a man of Bible.
[2:08:45.500 --> 2:08:47.500]  The media and they say,
[2:08:47.500 --> 2:08:49.500]  oh no, he belongs to a satanic cult.
[2:08:49.500 --> 2:08:51.500]  He's a Roman Catholic, by the way.
[2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:53.500]  He's also pro-life.
[2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:55.500]  There's an ABC story that they keep recycling
[2:08:55.500 --> 2:08:57.500]  constantly where he says
[2:08:57.500 --> 2:08:59.500]  it's decided law. Well, guess what, folks?
[2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:01.500]  As of today, it is
[2:09:01.500 --> 2:09:03.500]  decided law. Doesn't mean we like it that way.
[2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:05.500]  Doesn't mean we aren't going to work
[2:09:05.500 --> 2:09:07.500]  to change that. They manipulate and lie about everything.
[2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:09.500]  Randall's got a point to make.
[2:09:09.500 --> 2:09:11.500]  The reason that they
[2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:13.500]  are against that.
[2:09:13.500 --> 2:09:15.500]  They are against him expressing that.
[2:09:15.500 --> 2:09:17.500]  And the reason I think it's great
[2:09:17.500 --> 2:09:19.500]  for you to have strong families
[2:09:19.500 --> 2:09:21.500]  and even, you know, I'm not a very religious person
[2:09:21.500 --> 2:09:23.500]  but I think it is a great thing when people are
[2:09:23.500 --> 2:09:25.500]  because you should always have
[2:09:25.500 --> 2:09:27.500]  another loyalty.
[2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:29.500]  What they want is you to have your only
[2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:31.500]  loyalty be to the state.
[2:09:31.500 --> 2:09:33.500]  Dissolve your loyalty to your church.
[2:09:33.500 --> 2:09:35.500]  Dissolve your loyalty to your family
[2:09:35.500 --> 2:09:37.500]  and eliminate that so that
[2:09:37.500 --> 2:09:39.500]  all you are is a subject
[2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:41.500]  of a state. And then
[2:09:41.500 --> 2:09:43.500]  you can erode the resistance in some
[2:09:43.500 --> 2:09:45.500]  other, you know, in the opposition
[2:09:45.500 --> 2:09:47.500]  party. And then what they wind
[2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:49.500]  up is a one party state where you have
[2:09:49.500 --> 2:09:51.500]  but one loyalty.
[2:09:51.500 --> 2:09:53.500]  That was the whole point of Marx's
[2:09:53.500 --> 2:09:55.500]  the religion is the opiate of the people.
[2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:57.500]  Yeah, sure, it distracts people from bad things
[2:09:57.500 --> 2:09:59.500]  but isn't that a good thing? Isn't it good
[2:09:59.500 --> 2:10:01.500]  that you have faith in something larger than
[2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:03.500]  your, larger than your government,
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:05.500]  larger than your community? Well, that's it.
[2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:07.500]  It makes the states not the top thing. You reach out
[2:10:07.500 --> 2:10:09.500]  you have larger ideas and then
[2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:11.500]  logically it shows people that pray and believe
[2:10:11.500 --> 2:10:13.500]  in God have had a live longer
[2:10:13.500 --> 2:10:15.500]  get over illnesses. I mean, it's reaching
[2:10:15.500 --> 2:10:17.500]  out to the infinite. I mean, look, I don't
[2:10:17.500 --> 2:10:19.500]  care what you believe in. You know, I would
[2:10:19.500 --> 2:10:21.500]  fight for your right to believe in anything
[2:10:21.500 --> 2:10:23.500]  but it should have something you can
[2:10:23.500 --> 2:10:25.500]  believe in. Or even if you want to give
[2:10:25.500 --> 2:10:27.500]  that up voluntarily, give that up
[2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:29.500]  voluntarily. But you know, you
[2:10:29.500 --> 2:10:31.500]  have a right to that. Absolutely.
[2:10:31.500 --> 2:10:33.500]  I had a question we came out. Nobody answered
[2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:35.500]  and I forget what it was but
[2:10:35.500 --> 2:10:37.500]  Roger, what do you expect the authoritarians
[2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:39.500]  to do next? Is they're trying to intimidate everybody?
[2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:41.500]  They're trying to raid and ensue
[2:10:41.500 --> 2:10:43.500]  and indict and
[2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:45.500]  you know, charge and just go after
[2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:47.500]  everybody that's a prominent American.
[2:10:47.500 --> 2:10:49.500]  I see this wearing thin but they don't seem
[2:10:49.500 --> 2:10:51.500]  to want to stop. They're in their own bubbles. What do
[2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:53.500]  they do next? No, I think they're
[2:10:53.500 --> 2:10:55.500]  trying to engender violence. You see, we're
[2:10:55.500 --> 2:10:57.500]  opposed to violence. We believe
[2:10:57.500 --> 2:10:59.500]  in the democratic system. For
[2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:01.500]  40 years I've worked in elections.
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:03.500]  That's how we bring change. But
[2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:05.500]  if our elections are not fair, free
[2:11:05.500 --> 2:11:07.500]  and transparent,
[2:11:07.500 --> 2:11:09.500]  if no judicial body
[2:11:09.500 --> 2:11:11.500]  or legislative body or
[2:11:11.500 --> 2:11:13.500]  regulatory body will examine
[2:11:13.500 --> 2:11:15.500]  the elections, it's like
[2:11:15.500 --> 2:11:17.500]  a pressure cooker. They would like
[2:11:17.500 --> 2:11:19.500]  us to fire the first shot.
[2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:21.500]  They'd like us to throw the first punch.
[2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:23.500]  But we're not going to do that because that's
[2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:25.500]  what they want. They use the January
[2:11:25.500 --> 2:11:27.500]  6th routine, which
[2:11:27.500 --> 2:11:29.500]  I frankly think is a false flag
[2:11:29.500 --> 2:11:31.500]  operation. There's an enormous amount
[2:11:31.500 --> 2:11:33.500]  of evidence that this was
[2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:35.500]  engendered by the FBI.
[2:11:35.500 --> 2:11:37.500]  Even the New York Times admits
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:39.500]  that there were FBI informants
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:41.500]  riddled throughout
[2:11:41.500 --> 2:11:43.500]  the protesters. Whoever thought it
[2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:45.500]  was a good idea to trespass and amend
[2:11:45.500 --> 2:11:47.500]  its lawmakers doesn't understand
[2:11:47.500 --> 2:11:49.500]  America. And Roger, let me ask you this.
[2:11:49.500 --> 2:11:51.500]  I wrote this down and forgot to ask you. I'm glad you raised this.
[2:11:51.500 --> 2:11:53.500]  I put out a video this morning that's going viral
[2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:55.500]  at Band-Aid video where I said,
[2:11:55.500 --> 2:11:57.500]  listen, I don't know if I'm going to come to this committee
[2:11:57.500 --> 2:11:59.500]  because it's a kangaroo committee with a bunch of
[2:11:59.500 --> 2:12:01.500]  neocons and Democrats on it
[2:12:01.500 --> 2:12:03.500]  who've lied about me in the past and people connected
[2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:05.500]  to the Russiagate hoax. But if it was
[2:12:05.500 --> 2:12:07.500]  a real congressional committee
[2:12:07.500 --> 2:12:09.500]  with fair Republicans and Democrats on each side,
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:11.500]  I would come because I want a real investigation.
[2:12:11.500 --> 2:12:13.500]  Trump asked for National Guard, didn't do it.
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:15.500]  They sent away half the Capitol Police that day
[2:12:15.500 --> 2:12:17.500]  to do traffic control. They ended up standing down.
[2:12:17.500 --> 2:12:19.500]  They waved people in. I want to know all
[2:12:19.500 --> 2:12:21.500]  that because clearly they were trying to set
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:23.500]  us up that day. I want an investigation
[2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:25.500]  of the Secret Service. I'm not saying they're all
[2:12:25.500 --> 2:12:27.500]  bad, but about who wanted me to be at the
[2:12:27.500 --> 2:12:29.500]  front. I'm not stupid now. In hindsight
[2:12:29.500 --> 2:12:31.500]  they were trying to set us up, as you've said.
[2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:33.500]  I want a new January 6 investigation
[2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:35.500]  that's bipartisan and real.
[2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.500]  Does Roger Stone call for that?
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:39.500]  I totally agree with that. Alex, I was
[2:12:39.500 --> 2:12:41.500]  right after the president spoke, as I have said previously,
[2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:43.500]  in my hotel room
[2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:45.500]  at the Willard, and by the way, if there was
[2:12:45.500 --> 2:12:47.500]  a war room of some type at the Willard,
[2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:49.500]  I don't know about it. I wasn't in it.
[2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:51.500]  I was certainly not with Steve Bannon
[2:12:51.500 --> 2:12:53.500]  or with Mayor Giuliani. I know
[2:12:53.500 --> 2:12:55.500]  nothing whatsoever about it.
[2:12:55.500 --> 2:12:57.500]  But just because I was staying in that hotel,
[2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:59.500]  you get lumped in.
[2:12:59.500 --> 2:13:01.500]  This is the ABC News Technique
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:03.500]  of guilt by association.
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:05.500]  Oh, here's a picture of Roger Stone with one of
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:07.500]  the proud boys out in front of his hotel.
[2:13:07.500 --> 2:13:09.500]  Yeah? So what?
[2:13:09.500 --> 2:13:11.500]  What does that prove? Well, that's pure McCarthyism
[2:13:11.500 --> 2:13:13.500]  again to say. Well, there was one communist
[2:13:13.500 --> 2:13:15.500]  at the bank of a hundred employees, so you must be.
[2:13:15.500 --> 2:13:17.500]  Look,
[2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:19.500]  I'd never joined, and I'm not a big joiner.
[2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:21.500]  You know, just seeing them
[2:13:21.500 --> 2:13:23.500]  try to target you saying,
[2:13:23.500 --> 2:13:25.500]  well, are you now or have you ever been a member
[2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:27.500]  of? I want to join whatever
[2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:29.500]  that sentence is. I don't care what it is,
[2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:31.500]  because Roger was absolutely right.
[2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:33.500]  Earlier, he said, I was inspired
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:35.500]  by what he said. He said he had a right to do
[2:13:35.500 --> 2:13:37.500]  this, a right to say what he wanted to say
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:39.500]  about the election, a right to organize,
[2:13:39.500 --> 2:13:41.500]  a right to assemble,
[2:13:41.500 --> 2:13:43.500]  and that is what's under attack.
[2:13:43.500 --> 2:13:45.500]  And you know what? When you use
[2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:47.500]  that analogy, you talk about being under attack,
[2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:49.500]  I want both of you to realize something,
[2:13:49.500 --> 2:13:51.500]  and that is the saying that, you know, you always
[2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:53.500]  get the most flack when you're directly over
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:55.500]  the target. You two are over the target
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:13:57.500]  right now, gentlemen.
[2:13:57.500 --> 2:13:59.500]  Well, you said it, and we can't get into
[2:13:59.500 --> 2:14:01.500]  the deposition things, but hey, we're going to win
[2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:03.500]  these Sandy Hook cases, and I said they're going to default.
[2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:05.500]  That's why, and that's why they can't give us a real
[2:14:05.500 --> 2:14:07.500]  jury trial, because what they're saying is it true.
[2:14:07.500 --> 2:14:09.500]  Look, I'm not going to comment on any of your
[2:14:09.500 --> 2:14:11.500]  existing cases, except to say that
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:13.500]  I have faith things are going to
[2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:15.500]  work out. I really do, and it looks
[2:14:15.500 --> 2:14:17.500]  dark, but you know what? Well, you've been up my
[2:14:17.500 --> 2:14:19.500]  ass looking at everything. Is most of what they say
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:21.500]  true?
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:23.500]  Alex, you are the most lied about person
[2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:25.500]  in America.
[2:14:25.500 --> 2:14:27.500]  I will say that. Roger might be
[2:14:27.500 --> 2:14:29.500]  the silver medalist. You guys are competing
[2:14:29.500 --> 2:14:31.500]  for that, but, you know, I just know
[2:14:31.500 --> 2:14:33.500]  about you, and I know
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:35.500]  that any time I'm talking to anybody
[2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:37.500]  who doesn't know you, it is lies.
[2:14:37.500 --> 2:14:39.500]  And, you know, I just
[2:14:39.500 --> 2:14:41.500]  things that they say that you say, it didn't
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:43.500]  say. When they say, well, you're just
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:45.500]  reading from biased news. Well, what about you?
[2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:47.500]  You know, I hear people. There's no
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:49.500]  pre-planning. We're just here covering
[2:14:49.500 --> 2:14:51.500]  our opinion. This is the most chaotic thing
[2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:53.500]  I've ever, you know, I talk more to Barbershop.
[2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:55.500]  I come on set here and I'm like, I have had
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:57.500]  more planned conversations take place
[2:14:57.500 --> 2:14:59.500]  around a campfire with a bunch of people
[2:14:59.500 --> 2:15:01.500]  drinking beers and smashing bottles. So,
[2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:03.500]  no, this is.
[2:15:03.500 --> 2:15:05.500]  Hey, Roger, one more time. How do folks
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.500]  support a real warrior,
[2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:09.500]  a real Trojan, a real
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:11.500]  300 to fight against tyranny?
[2:15:11.500 --> 2:15:13.500]  Look, I need help at
[2:15:13.500 --> 2:15:15.500]  stonedefensefund.com
[2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:17.500]  to fight these subpoenas,
[2:15:17.500 --> 2:15:19.500]  to fight the various harassment,
[2:15:19.500 --> 2:15:21.500]  baseless, meritless
[2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:23.500]  lawsuits against us. The coffers are bare, folks.
[2:15:23.500 --> 2:15:25.500]  I'll never quit.
[2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  I will always fight, but I can't do it without
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:29.500]  your help. Exactly. You'll never give up, but
[2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:31.500]  you could give out like an old horse and me
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:33.500]  too. And because we're both old horses in
[2:15:33.500 --> 2:15:35.500]  this fight and it's made us stronger. But,
[2:15:35.500 --> 2:15:37.500]  folks, we need support. We're your champions
[2:15:37.500 --> 2:15:39.500]  infowarstore.com, saveinfowars.com
[2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:41.500]  and one more time, Roger, where?
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:43.500]  StoneDefenseFund.com
[2:15:43.500 --> 2:15:45.500]  God bless you, Alex, and thanks for
[2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:47.500]  your support and God bless America.
[2:15:47.500 --> 2:15:49.500]  Exactly. And so much is happening.
[2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.500]  Join us. We'll go ahead.
[2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:53.500]  One thing, too. You know, a lot of people.
[2:15:53.500 --> 2:15:55.500]  We're out of time. We're out of time. Come back tomorrow.
[2:15:55.500 --> 2:15:57.500]  Come back tomorrow. If you're concerned about the power grid.
[2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.500]  Today, anyone who is awake
[2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:01.500]  can clearly see why Alex Jones
[2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:03.500]  was deep platform.
[2:16:03.500 --> 2:16:05.500]  Infowars was right above the target
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:07.500]  and the globalists were a year
[2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:09.500]  out from launching their attack.
[2:16:09.500 --> 2:16:11.500]  Three years later, an Infowars
[2:16:11.500 --> 2:16:13.500]  is still thriving thanks to the
[2:16:13.500 --> 2:16:15.500]  support of our audience.
[2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:17.500]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle
[2:16:17.500 --> 2:16:19.500]  yet and we need you
[2:16:19.500 --> 2:16:21.500]  to help save Infowars.
[2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:23.500]  The enemies entrenched within our
[2:16:23.500 --> 2:16:25.500]  government are breaking the justice system
[2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:27.500]  more than ever in their attack
[2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:29.500]  against Alex Jones. No crime,
[2:16:29.500 --> 2:16:31.500]  no evidence, no
[2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:33.500]  jury, no trial. We
[2:16:33.500 --> 2:16:35.500]  don't think so. They want to kill the messenger
[2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:37.500]  in a kangaroo trial with their
[2:16:37.500 --> 2:16:39.500]  new U.S.S.A.
[2:16:39.500 --> 2:16:41.500]  But we won't let them. Alex Jones
[2:16:41.500 --> 2:16:43.500]  will have his day in court.
[2:16:43.500 --> 2:16:45.500]  With your support, go to
[2:16:45.500 --> 2:16:47.500]  saveinfowars.com
[2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:49.500]  now and give your donation
[2:16:49.500 --> 2:16:51.500]  to save the First Amendment.
[2:16:51.500 --> 2:16:53.500]  Saveinfowars.com
[2:16:53.500 --> 2:17:13.500]  and God bless America.
[2:17:23.500 --> 2:17:25.500]  I also need you to wear
[2:17:25.500 --> 2:17:27.500]  masks and I also need you
[2:17:27.500 --> 2:17:29.500]  to only shop
[2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.500]  at mega corporations.
[2:17:31.500 --> 2:17:33.500]  That way we can
[2:17:33.500 --> 2:17:35.500]  consolidate control
[2:17:35.500 --> 2:17:37.500]  and bankrupt the world economy.
[2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:39.500]  Leaving companies that only
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:41.500]  I own.
[2:17:41.500 --> 2:17:43.500]  Profitable. You will then
[2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:45.500]  be my slaves.
[2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:47.500]  Oh, and then you'll get
[2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:49.500]  that special shot of
[2:17:49.500 --> 2:17:51.500]  freedom from Oprah. It will remove
[2:17:51.500 --> 2:17:53.500]  your immune system.
[2:17:53.500 --> 2:17:55.500]  So you'll be depended on me for the rest
[2:17:55.500 --> 2:17:57.500]  of your miserable lives.
[2:17:57.500 --> 2:17:59.500]  The average person on the face
[2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:01.500]  of this incredible planet is still unaware
[2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:03.500]  that there's a war between free individuals
[2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:05.500]  and nation states on one side
[2:18:05.500 --> 2:18:07.500]  and the globalist on the other
[2:18:07.500 --> 2:18:09.500]  who are literally trying to create
[2:18:09.500 --> 2:18:11.500]  a post-human world.
[2:18:11.500 --> 2:18:13.500]  For the United States to Brazil,
[2:18:13.500 --> 2:18:15.500]  and of course triggered by the Briggs in the UK,
[2:18:15.500 --> 2:18:17.500]  nations were pulling out of the private
[2:18:17.500 --> 2:18:19.500]  corporate fascist world government.
[2:18:19.500 --> 2:18:21.500]  That's why they launched their great reset
[2:18:21.500 --> 2:18:23.500]  and their program after collapsing us
[2:18:23.500 --> 2:18:25.500]  of Build Back Better.
[2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:27.500]  This is nothing more
[2:18:27.500 --> 2:18:29.500]  than a top-down
[2:18:29.500 --> 2:18:31.500]  vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[2:18:31.500 --> 2:18:33.500]  Because they couldn't take our guns
[2:18:33.500 --> 2:18:35.500]  and because we wouldn't bow.
[2:18:35.500 --> 2:18:37.500]  Because the left, which is the ideology
[2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:39.500]  of this world government system, couldn't win.
[2:18:39.500 --> 2:18:41.500]  They released a biological
[2:18:41.500 --> 2:18:43.500]  weapon on us.
[2:18:43.500 --> 2:18:45.500]  Now we know two years ago
[2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:47.500]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:18:47.500 --> 2:18:49.500]  It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our
[2:18:49.500 --> 2:18:51.500]  free speech and our guns.
[2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:53.500]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[2:18:53.500 --> 2:18:55.500]  and you know the rest is history.
[2:18:55.500 --> 2:18:57.500]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:18:57.500 --> 2:18:59.500]  There is very little
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:01.500]  contemporary study
[2:19:01.500 --> 2:19:03.500]  in the world of the planet's
[2:19:03.500 --> 2:19:05.500]  ruling class.
[2:19:05.500 --> 2:19:07.500]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico,
[2:19:07.500 --> 2:19:09.500]  not in the United States, not
[2:19:09.500 --> 2:19:11.500]  anywhere. Is there a real
[2:19:11.500 --> 2:19:13.500]  study of the planet's
[2:19:13.500 --> 2:19:15.500]  ruling class? And that's done by design.
[2:19:15.500 --> 2:19:17.500]  The large central banks
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:19.500]  that basically control the planet
[2:19:19.500 --> 2:19:21.500]  will penalize and target any academics
[2:19:21.500 --> 2:19:23.500]  that look into, say,
[2:19:23.500 --> 2:19:25.500]  the Anglo-American establishment
[2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:27.500]  the founder of the Bilderberg group, the
[2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:29.500]  Trilateral Commission of the United Nations,
[2:19:29.500 --> 2:19:31.500]  the whole project of the Rock Charles and the
[2:19:31.500 --> 2:19:33.500]  Rockefellers. Until 10 years ago
[2:19:33.500 --> 2:19:35.500]  the media said the
[2:19:35.500 --> 2:19:37.500]  control corporate media of the Bilderberg group
[2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:39.500]  didn't exist. Well now the Bilderberg group
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:41.500]  is public in its former head,
[2:19:41.500 --> 2:19:43.500]  still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab
[2:19:43.500 --> 2:19:45.500]  and he has set up the great reset
[2:19:45.500 --> 2:19:47.500]  in global government. And
[2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:49.500]  if as a liberty movement worldwide
[2:19:49.500 --> 2:19:51.500]  we don't address the globalist head on
[2:19:51.500 --> 2:19:53.500]  about the fact that they are worldwide
[2:19:53.500 --> 2:19:55.500]  authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a
[2:19:55.500 --> 2:20:23.500]  problem, we can expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:42.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this live November
[2:20:42.980 --> 2:20:45.940]  23rd, Tuesday transmission.
[2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:53.660]  This show, this broadcast, this transmission, this human expression of freedom was not supposed
[2:20:53.660 --> 2:20:57.300]  to be on air right now, we're supposed to already be off air, we're supposed to roll
[2:20:57.300 --> 2:21:02.340]  over like everybody else, the globalist enslaved and dumbed down and killed, but that's not
[2:21:02.340 --> 2:21:03.340]  been happening.
[2:21:03.340 --> 2:21:06.940]  Well, good friend of mine, Jake Ducey is here, and he is a very well known bestselling author
[2:21:06.940 --> 2:21:14.020]  and also does so many other great works out there, but he's really helped me in my research
[2:21:14.020 --> 2:21:18.780]  and with everything we're doing with the launch of the next level of the info war, which
[2:21:18.780 --> 2:21:25.660]  is resetwars.com, because we were sympatico because I helped wake him up decades ago,
[2:21:25.660 --> 2:21:28.380]  and his dad's a big fan and the rest of it.
[2:21:28.380 --> 2:21:33.740]  And so we're now here, but before we do the next hour and a half, because we cover so
[2:21:33.740 --> 2:21:38.580]  much incredible stuff, I mean, you get exclusives on every front, you get cutting edge, you get
[2:21:38.580 --> 2:21:42.860]  tomorrows news today, because we want you to know what's going on, the enemy knows what's
[2:21:42.860 --> 2:21:45.740]  going on, they just want to keep you in the dark and enslave you, I'm not interested in
[2:21:45.740 --> 2:21:51.540]  farms of slaves that I can fly over and laugh at you because I feel big, you not being empowered
[2:21:51.540 --> 2:21:54.940]  makes me feel like crap, you understand how that works?
[2:21:54.940 --> 2:21:59.380]  So I want to see you fly like a birdie, because I'm connected to you and you're connected
[2:21:59.380 --> 2:22:03.380]  to me and I have children in this world that are going to live with your children and I
[2:22:03.380 --> 2:22:07.020]  have ancestors that lived with your ancestors, you got it?
[2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:10.700]  I'm an individual, I'm my own soul, but I'm connected to you.
[2:22:10.700 --> 2:22:15.580]  And when stuff happens to you, it hurts me, you understand, I'm not a Satanist, I'm the
[2:22:15.580 --> 2:22:21.100]  opposite, I'm not all about me, I'm not all about how I got power over people, I want
[2:22:21.100 --> 2:22:28.260]  you to have power, you understand that, that's what I want, unlimited consciousness and the
[2:22:28.260 --> 2:22:33.100]  enemy knows we have that fire in our hands and Jake Ducey's here, let's talk about it,
[2:22:33.100 --> 2:22:41.260]  but to understand the good, you've got to understand the bad and in reset wars, we cover
[2:22:41.260 --> 2:22:45.460]  the good, something I don't spend enough time on and the keys to resisting this and decoding
[2:22:45.460 --> 2:22:54.060]  it, but to understand the good, you must understand the bad and so today, we're going to look
[2:22:54.060 --> 2:22:59.180]  at the bad, it's covered some in the six plus hour transmission that's coming out in early
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:04.580]  December, but I wanted to just get Jake here to talk about this so that you'd understand
[2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:08.220]  some of the research that went into this, I mean, most people don't sit around and read
[2:23:08.220 --> 2:23:12.940]  800 pages as you classified MK Ultra files, I read them decades ago, he just recently
[2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:16.860]  read them again, he just recently the last few days went back over them and I want you
[2:23:16.860 --> 2:23:20.260]  to understand that when you see reset wars, you think, well, this is just never heard
[2:23:20.260 --> 2:23:24.860]  this in church, never heard this on the two news because they don't want you to know this
[2:23:24.860 --> 2:23:28.740]  because then they can enslave you, but when you read the CIA documents and then you see
[2:23:28.740 --> 2:23:33.660]  what we're doing, you'll understand this is the opposite, this is how they did it, now
[2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:37.380]  there is a, there isn't, there is one little evil shadow to this, but that's the problem
[2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:42.900]  with knowledge, it's good and evil, it's free will, could somebody take this knowledge
[2:23:42.900 --> 2:23:45.620]  and use it to enslave people, yeah, they already have.
[2:23:45.620 --> 2:23:49.420]  So justice be done by the heavens fall, they want to talk about the knowledge of good
[2:23:49.420 --> 2:23:54.380]  and evil, well, the good don't know about the evil, so now we're here exposing how they
[2:23:54.380 --> 2:23:57.620]  operate and what's going on, so spend five minutes before we go to break and come back
[2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:02.180]  and go through the main meat of this, current admissions, what's going on, the actual documents
[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:06.220]  and then what's coming next with Jake Ducey from resetwars.com, Jake.
[2:24:06.220 --> 2:24:11.660]  Yeah, what I say is we're all a part of this massive MK Ultra experiment that is society
[2:24:11.660 --> 2:24:17.300]  and I've had the honor to actually go through six times and watch Alex's brand new course
[2:24:17.300 --> 2:24:19.060]  that's coming out here real soon.
[2:24:19.060 --> 2:24:22.980]  If you are a fan of Alex, if you're a fan of Infowars, this is the next level because
[2:24:22.980 --> 2:24:28.700]  the way that the great reset officially is accomplished is by trapping us into subconscious
[2:24:28.700 --> 2:24:34.780]  patterns, convincing us we're just these little bodies and using everyday mind control weapons
[2:24:34.780 --> 2:24:40.340]  that they have and Alex breaks down an 11 step process exactly how to break out of that
[2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:47.260]  so everyone, open up another browser, go to resetwars.com right now, that's resetwars.com
[2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:51.420]  right now, sign up for the early bird list because everyone knows Alex has always been
[2:24:51.420 --> 2:24:57.260]  at the head of their list of persecution, but here's the thing, just learning all the
[2:24:57.260 --> 2:24:59.780]  news isn't going to how we're going to be able to change it.
[2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:03.460]  How we're going to be able to change it is when we finally depattern ourselves, we learn
[2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:08.900]  how the mind control works, we erase it and then we tap in to that real spiritual power
[2:25:08.900 --> 2:25:14.460]  that they don't want us to know about, so it's resetwars.com and that's the real power
[2:25:14.460 --> 2:25:16.140]  right, that's what they don't want us to know.
[2:25:16.140 --> 2:25:20.860]  And we address it from their perspective which is actually real, they understand there's
[2:25:20.860 --> 2:25:24.820]  the real us that we were born with that God gave us our soul, they create a facsimile
[2:25:24.820 --> 2:25:30.140]  and then erase the real us, but the real us is still there, they erase the real us template
[2:25:30.140 --> 2:25:34.340]  for interfacing with the universe, we're going to show the CIA documents coming up, so how
[2:25:34.340 --> 2:25:36.380]  do we rediscover that person inside of us?
[2:25:36.380 --> 2:25:39.980]  Well first we have to recognize that they already know all about this right, and that's
[2:25:39.980 --> 2:25:45.740]  what they actually use the term depatterning in their CIA documents, they use that word
[2:25:45.740 --> 2:25:48.220]  in the MKUltra experiments, D-pattern.
[2:25:48.220 --> 2:25:51.260]  They describe what that means, we'll cover it next segment, but it means erasing the
[2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:52.660]  real you.
[2:25:52.660 --> 2:25:56.660]  Erasing the real you, and that's the way this whole control system works, in resetwars you
[2:25:56.660 --> 2:26:02.460]  talk about the emotional control grid, we exist on three planes, we exist on the physical,
[2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:06.260]  the mental emotional and the spiritual, the emotional control grid is all the craziness
[2:26:06.260 --> 2:26:09.980]  happening in the world, lock us into fear, lock us into anchor, lock us into our lower
[2:26:09.980 --> 2:26:15.460]  consciousness, our lower emotions, and that's the simulation right, Zuckerberg's creating
[2:26:15.460 --> 2:26:20.980]  the metaverse, but we're already in a simulation, and that's how the whole control system works,
[2:26:20.980 --> 2:26:25.580]  and that's what fascinated me about your work, is once I went into the declassified documents,
[2:26:25.580 --> 2:26:30.020]  what struck me more than anything was wow, we live in a simulation, all of reality is
[2:26:30.020 --> 2:26:34.460]  controlled through subconscious patterning, they already know this and I thought to myself
[2:26:34.460 --> 2:26:40.260]  well what happens, if I literally reprogram my entire mind, if I literally program everything,
[2:26:40.260 --> 2:26:46.620]  I erase all the viruses and resetwars you taught, you liken the mind to an operating system,
[2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:51.540]  the programs, the viruses, it's the fake identity, and that's why I'm so excited about it because
[2:26:51.540 --> 2:26:55.060]  and then we get CIA documents and they admit that, that they know we have an innate from
[2:26:55.060 --> 2:26:59.420]  our ancestors, our spirit, who we are, they try to create this facsimile and then they
[2:26:59.420 --> 2:27:03.100]  try to erase who we were, but they didn't really erase it, they create a false thing
[2:27:03.100 --> 2:27:07.300]  that we then follow, this is what Christ talks about about being born again because we're
[2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:12.220]  already in Christ, we're already real before, we fell, we got programmed, now we're born
[2:27:12.220 --> 2:27:13.220]  again, we come out of it.
[2:27:13.220 --> 2:27:18.060]  And think about what's interesting in that quote in the Bible is to not be conformed
[2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:23.220]  by the pattern of the world, they use the same word in the MKUltra documents, don't
[2:27:23.220 --> 2:27:27.020]  be conformed by the pattern of the world, what's the pattern of the world, it's the
[2:27:27.020 --> 2:27:32.900]  entire mind control system that they use predictive programming and unconscious hypnosis to control
[2:27:32.900 --> 2:27:33.900]  us.
[2:27:33.900 --> 2:27:35.620]  And let me say this, you're gonna have the floor when we come back, but I want to explain
[2:27:35.620 --> 2:27:39.580]  to everybody something, big leftist yesterday when I did a little piece on this, put it
[2:27:39.580 --> 2:27:43.980]  clips in, look at Jones, a con man, he says he knows God and has the secret, obviously
[2:27:43.980 --> 2:27:47.020]  we all have the secret of the connection to God, obviously him forwards is the tip of
[2:27:47.020 --> 2:27:51.140]  the spear, we're not playing games, I, listen leftist, you're caught off from God, you don't
[2:27:51.140 --> 2:27:56.060]  get it, I am connected to God, to me this is real, they sit there and act like, oh look
[2:27:56.060 --> 2:28:01.020]  Jones is telling us listers, he's got a connection to God, the blah blah blah, no, it's real,
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:04.620]  this really will change the universe if people know it and understand it, and that's why
[2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:08.460]  your bosses are so scared, because they're not like you, some brainwashed minion, they're
[2:28:08.460 --> 2:28:12.260]  aware of this and using this against us and we're here to set the cap as free with Jesus
[2:28:12.260 --> 2:28:13.700]  Christ power.
[2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:18.460]  And that's the entire way throughout history, the control system has always operated, that's
[2:28:18.460 --> 2:28:22.420]  why they hid certain books of the Bible, that's why the Vatican has underground libraries,
[2:28:22.420 --> 2:28:27.140]  the way tyranny always controls people is cutting them off from their higher spiritual
[2:28:27.140 --> 2:28:31.140]  faculties, convince them they're just a body, even though your body is just a rental car,
[2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:34.340]  that house is your soul, I'm here in Austin right now, I use a rental car, it's not my
[2:28:34.340 --> 2:28:38.220]  car, I'm just using it, your body is just a rental car, the whole goal is to cut it
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:43.660]  off, I'm a huge fan of Alex, have been for many years and I know you are too, go to resetwars.com
[2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:46.100]  right now and sign up, this is going to be the most powerful thing you've ever created.

[2:28:49.500 --> 2:28:56.140]  the news, and we love that, you're not going to stop us Satan, we'll be right back.
[2:28:56.140 --> 2:28:57.140]  If you're concerned about...
[2:28:57.140 --> 2:29:03.500]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy
[2:29:03.500 --> 2:29:08.740]  pills, and look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible
[2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:17.460]  downsides, horrible crashes and again so many toxins on them, all of the Neutropic products
[2:29:17.460 --> 2:29:23.780]  that we sell at mfoldwarstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're

[2:30:11.620 --> 2:30:15.900]  big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:30:57.460 --> 2:31:03.020]  Today anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deep platform.
[2:31:03.020 --> 2:31:07.900]  Infowars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching
[2:31:07.900 --> 2:31:08.900]  their attack.
[2:31:08.900 --> 2:31:14.900]  Three years later, an infowars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience, but
[2:31:14.900 --> 2:31:21.060]  we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save infowars.
[2:31:21.060 --> 2:31:25.340]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[2:31:25.340 --> 2:31:28.420]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[2:31:28.420 --> 2:31:32.740]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[2:31:32.740 --> 2:31:33.740]  We don't think so.
[2:31:33.740 --> 2:31:38.980]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't
[2:31:38.980 --> 2:31:39.980]  let them.
[2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:42.820]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[2:31:56.740 --> 2:32:01.780]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[2:32:01.780 --> 2:32:05.380]  is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:32:05.380 --> 2:32:09.500]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[2:32:09.500 --> 2:32:14.780]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for relaxation and euphoric
[2:32:14.780 --> 2:32:15.780]  effects.
[2:32:15.780 --> 2:32:21.420]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:32:21.420 --> 2:32:25.420]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:32:25.420 --> 2:32:30.420]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:32:30.420 --> 2:32:31.620]  loosen up a little.
[2:32:31.620 --> 2:32:36.220]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:32:36.220 --> 2:32:42.540]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[2:32:42.540 --> 2:32:48.620]  herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and balearion
[2:32:48.620 --> 2:32:49.620]  root.
[2:32:49.620 --> 2:33:15.900]  We expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:22.900]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:26.700]  Going back four or five, six months ago, and going back two months ago, we were working
[2:33:26.700 --> 2:33:29.540]  on this film project, Reset Wars.
[2:33:29.540 --> 2:33:37.420]  I told Jake Doocy, who's a very successful Mazzone writer, best-selling author and researcher,
[2:33:37.420 --> 2:33:41.700]  motivational speaker, that they're going to come at us for this.
[2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:46.820]  Now you see, they are really worried about this because we're explaining what the enemy
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:50.980]  knows and that you don't see on any TV channels, in any newspapers anywhere.
[2:33:50.980 --> 2:33:57.180]  David I is the only other person that conceptualizes it, but we go into the actual nuts and bolts
[2:33:57.180 --> 2:34:04.140]  and then show you in the CIA's own admissions that they're aware of this, and then the Bible
[2:34:04.140 --> 2:34:09.220]  literally being quoted by the CIA and how they control people.
[2:34:09.220 --> 2:34:11.900]  So Jake, I want to hit all these articles and documents and everything, we've got it
[2:34:11.900 --> 2:34:15.180]  over an hour, 20 minutes coming up, but I want you to have the floor here again to talk
[2:34:15.180 --> 2:34:18.100]  about how big this is, and again, no one raised this.
[2:34:18.100 --> 2:34:26.580]  I always raise a converse side or the flip side or the parallax view in that, yeah, if
[2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:29.460]  you teach somebody how to use a gun, they might kill somebody one day, or you teach
[2:34:29.460 --> 2:34:32.820]  somebody how to drive a car, they might run over somebody one day.
[2:34:32.820 --> 2:34:36.980]  This is all done on a good will, free will, happiness to empower because good people don't
[2:34:36.980 --> 2:34:37.980]  know about this.
[2:34:37.980 --> 2:34:40.900]  The evil people know about this, they use it for control.
[2:34:40.900 --> 2:34:44.900]  So we're showing you how your control, we're showing you the magic trick right now.
[2:34:44.900 --> 2:34:50.780]  But yes, we leave it to the Holy Spirit to guide you because this is the real, not technology,
[2:34:50.780 --> 2:34:53.540]  but this is the real keys to how it all works.
[2:34:53.540 --> 2:34:54.700]  So Jake Ducey, please continue.
[2:34:54.700 --> 2:34:59.180]  Yeah, I mean, that's why, why did they hate Jesus so much?
[2:34:59.180 --> 2:35:03.020]  Why do they hate all these individuals that truly break free so much?
[2:35:03.020 --> 2:35:08.020]  And it's because they're teaching people how to actually break free of the entire control
[2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:13.580]  system that is perpetuated off of us, literally thinking we are just a body.
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:17.100]  And when we think we're just a body, they have all this advanced weaponry, which we're
[2:35:17.100 --> 2:35:21.980]  going to talk about, electromagnetic field manipulation on how to influence the brain
[2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:23.420]  and the emotions.
[2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:28.060]  But the most fascinating part really pops in to MKUltra.
[2:35:28.060 --> 2:35:34.220]  And there's a document in the declassified MKUltra that after I got to watch Alex film
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:39.300]  his Reset Wars course, I was reading back through these documents and I, and I showed
[2:35:39.300 --> 2:35:42.660]  him this document and it's from Dr. Cameron's notes.
[2:35:42.660 --> 2:35:48.100]  And it's about a woman who's been asleep for 16 days because I have her on drugs.
[2:35:48.100 --> 2:35:52.900]  They have her with subliminals, all these control systems going on.
[2:35:52.900 --> 2:35:55.780]  And part of the note says she is sleeping well.
[2:35:55.780 --> 2:36:03.220]  She is disoriented as to time only and is probably in her second stage of deep patterning.
[2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:08.780]  And I was like, wow, you're, you know, you'll see a lot of people cover MKUltra, even the
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:11.560]  mainstream New York Times, all these places, but what do they say?
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:17.980]  The headlines are horrific use, government overreach, scary stuff.
[2:36:17.980 --> 2:36:20.820]  But the question is never asked, why are they doing it?
[2:36:20.820 --> 2:36:25.140]  And they're doing it because they realize the mind is literally a computer operating
[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:26.140]  system.
[2:36:26.140 --> 2:36:29.060]  We live in a simulation that's controlled through unconscious consciousness and they
[2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:31.740]  figured out how to manipulate and control it.
[2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:35.940]  And in the same way, the only way that we're going to win is to de-pattern ourselves.
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:39.260]  And I used to think I was awake when I would listen to you and then I realized, well, I'm
[2:36:39.260 --> 2:36:40.940]  an MKUltra patient.
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:41.940]  I know what's happening.
[2:36:41.940 --> 2:36:46.020]  I know about the New World Order, but I'm controlled in my business and my success and
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:47.420]  my finances and my happiness.
[2:36:47.420 --> 2:36:51.540]  By the way, you're not just saying that the globalist brag, they're externalizing mind
[2:36:51.540 --> 2:36:52.540]  control.
[2:36:52.540 --> 2:36:53.540]  That's what the media is.
[2:36:53.540 --> 2:36:55.900]  We are under MKUltra attack.
[2:36:55.900 --> 2:36:56.900]  Absolutely.
[2:36:56.900 --> 2:37:00.700]  And the entire system is perpetuated off of one simple phrase.
[2:37:00.700 --> 2:37:01.700]  I love to say it.
[2:37:01.700 --> 2:37:06.380]  It says, brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[2:37:06.380 --> 2:37:08.900]  Brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:10.940]  And that's the entire de-patterning system.
[2:37:10.940 --> 2:37:16.580]  And in extreme examples, Dr. Cameron actually says in one of the documents, they say that
[2:37:16.580 --> 2:37:23.140]  Cameron believed that breaking down a patient's mind was akin to a childlike state that would
[2:37:23.140 --> 2:37:28.540]  allow him to work from a clean slate whereby he could then program the patients.
[2:37:28.540 --> 2:37:34.020]  His term was psychic driving de-patterning, psychic driving de-patterning, which meant
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:39.460]  playing recorded messages to patients for up to 20 hours, whether they were asleep or
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:40.460]  whether they were awake.
[2:37:40.460 --> 2:37:46.540]  And in extreme examples, this woman, Esther Schreyer, was so, quote, completely de-patterned,
[2:37:46.540 --> 2:37:49.140]  she was mute and had trouble swallowing.
[2:37:49.140 --> 2:37:51.700]  Literally, they erased her mind so much.
[2:37:51.700 --> 2:37:54.180]  Give them some background real quick.
[2:37:54.180 --> 2:37:56.980]  Back before they took over History Channel 20-something years ago, they would admit all
[2:37:56.980 --> 2:38:00.460]  this, show the documents to three-hour documentaries on it, but I went and looked at the National
[2:38:00.460 --> 2:38:01.460]  Archives.
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:02.460]  It's all there.
[2:38:02.460 --> 2:38:03.460]  It wasn't made up.
[2:38:03.460 --> 2:38:08.220]  He kidnapped over 10,000 children in the U.S. and Canada and other programs used CPS
[2:38:08.220 --> 2:38:13.700]  to get them and would keep people asleep sometimes for months with LSD, PCP.
[2:38:13.700 --> 2:38:15.660]  They had video goggles.
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:16.660]  You think that's new?
[2:38:16.660 --> 2:38:23.300]  They had earphones programming them, creating, quote, the ultimate assassin.
[2:38:23.300 --> 2:38:27.380]  And so the stuff they released in 77 with the church committee, the MKLTRA, was only
[2:38:27.380 --> 2:38:29.940]  a small part of this.
[2:38:29.940 --> 2:38:34.620]  And again, this is just 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago.
[2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:36.980]  Imagine what they're doing now.
[2:38:36.980 --> 2:38:37.980]  Imagine what they're doing now.
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:42.580]  And I think the most amazing part of the whole thing is we now know, and this is why I'm
[2:38:42.580 --> 2:38:49.020]  so excited about Reset Wars and why I say everybody literally go right now, open a browser,
[2:38:49.020 --> 2:38:55.420]  go to resetwars.com because throughout history, the way tyranny always wins is to stop us
[2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:57.100]  from spiritual awakening.
[2:38:57.100 --> 2:39:01.700]  As long as they trap us in the third dimension, they make us live in an animalistic state
[2:39:01.700 --> 2:39:05.620]  of consciousness, believe we're just our physical bodies attached to this little tiny spectrum
[2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:07.700]  of visible light, then they win.
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:12.260]  But as soon as people start to actually wake up, not just wake up to, hey, pharmaceutical
[2:39:12.260 --> 2:39:18.500]  corruption, hey, financial corruption, but actually wake up to who they really are, then
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:20.020]  the whole game's over.
[2:39:20.020 --> 2:39:23.540]  Because that's what Bill Gates, that's what Klaus Schwab, they all fear people spiritually
[2:39:23.540 --> 2:39:24.540]  awakening.
[2:39:24.540 --> 2:39:28.740]  And that's why they want to target children so young to screw up their normal trajectory
[2:39:28.740 --> 2:39:32.100]  towards reaching Christ and the connection to the infinite.
[2:39:32.100 --> 2:39:34.820]  And the point I was going to make earlier, and I always get one thought and jump to the
[2:39:34.820 --> 2:39:40.420]  next, is Dr. Ewing Cameron was the head of MKLTRA.
[2:39:40.420 --> 2:39:41.420]  That's declassified.
[2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:47.540]  Who was this adjunct, his aide to camp, his number two, Jolly and West, who was Tim McVeigh's
[2:39:47.540 --> 2:39:52.260]  psychologist when he was on Death Row, and who was Theodore Kaczynski's psychologist.
[2:39:52.260 --> 2:39:56.660]  By the way, I will later will show you LA Times saying that Theodore Kaczynski, all
[2:39:56.660 --> 2:40:02.900]  of McVeigh, all mind control, they had all been deeply grabbed for years, disappeared,
[2:40:02.900 --> 2:40:07.460]  family didn't see him, put in bays, put in pods like the Matrix and programmed.
[2:40:07.460 --> 2:40:14.140]  And Alex, even the Vegas shooter, who knows if it's true, but he claims that his mind
[2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:18.900]  was erased and hacked, and he has text messages that he sent to his wife claiming, who knows
[2:40:18.900 --> 2:40:22.780]  if it's true, claiming that they were able to erase his mind, and we're going to get
[2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:24.660]  to some of those declassified documents.
[2:40:24.660 --> 2:40:26.420]  We know he was the governor for the CIA.
[2:40:26.420 --> 2:40:29.460]  And the reason that that's so significant is because when we are going through more
[2:40:29.460 --> 2:40:33.300]  of these, they call them non-lethal energy weapons.
[2:40:33.300 --> 2:40:40.260]  They say, they admit, the Pentagon admits that they can use microwaves and electromagnetic
[2:40:40.260 --> 2:40:45.660]  frequencies to literally control someone's brain and change their emotions.
[2:40:45.660 --> 2:40:47.260]  And we're going to show you the patents.
[2:40:47.260 --> 2:40:51.300]  We're going to show you the news articles, U.S. News and World Report, 20, 30 years ago.
[2:40:51.300 --> 2:40:53.300]  When you read the patents, it's 5G.
[2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:56.540]  5G is a mind control system.
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:40:58.180]  Absolutely.
[2:40:58.180 --> 2:41:02.300]  And I think the whole thing ultimately shows us one simple thing.
[2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:05.940]  The way that we win is when we realize who we really are.
[2:41:05.940 --> 2:41:06.940]  We are not bodies.
[2:41:06.940 --> 2:41:09.180]  This is a rental car that I have, that you have.
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:11.140]  We're spiritual beings in a physical body.
[2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:15.140]  And when we do that, that's when we get, in the course, you talk about inspiration,
[2:41:15.140 --> 2:41:16.980]  being inspired.
[2:41:16.980 --> 2:41:19.740]  And that's when we tap into that type of place, being inspired.
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:22.860]  Tell them what that means in the Latin.
[2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:25.140]  Inspiration means in spirit.
[2:41:25.140 --> 2:41:30.640]  And when we're in spirit, whereas Jesus said, we are in this world, but not of it.
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:34.540]  So the whole control system, Alex uses the term, it's called the emotional control grid
[2:41:34.540 --> 2:41:35.540]  in the course.
[2:41:35.540 --> 2:41:39.700]  Emotional control grid, you define it, I watch a course like six times now, you define
[2:41:39.700 --> 2:41:43.780]  it as a mental and emotional plane that they trap you into your emotions.
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:45.900]  They trap you into your nervous system.
[2:41:45.900 --> 2:41:48.260]  So you think you are of this world.
[2:41:48.260 --> 2:41:51.580]  So being inspired is being connected to spirit.
[2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:53.100]  It's when we realize we aren't powerless.
[2:41:53.100 --> 2:41:55.900]  If you're a doctor, you can go start your own private practice.
[2:41:55.900 --> 2:41:58.820]  If you're a teacher, you can go start a new education system.
[2:41:58.820 --> 2:42:02.620]  If you're a broadcaster like Alex, you can become one of the most powerful broadcasters
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:03.620]  in the world.
[2:42:03.620 --> 2:42:06.900]  Alex started in a closet, in a closet.
[2:42:06.900 --> 2:42:10.620]  And when we're inspired, they don't want us to ask, how can God speak through me right
[2:42:10.620 --> 2:42:11.620]  now?
[2:42:11.620 --> 2:42:12.620]  Oh, I totally was led by God.
[2:42:12.620 --> 2:42:13.620]  It wasn't me.
[2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:14.980]  I was like channel.
[2:42:14.980 --> 2:42:19.020]  And when we let go of our mind and our attachment to ourself, that's how we win.
[2:42:19.020 --> 2:42:22.500]  And the whole control system is keeping us in our emotions.
[2:42:22.500 --> 2:42:26.220]  And if we get stuck, it's trying to get us to give our mind to them and a lower state
[2:42:26.220 --> 2:42:29.100]  instead of giving it up to God, because you're going to give it up.
[2:42:29.100 --> 2:42:31.500]  You're going to serve somebody like Bob Dylan says, you're going to give it to God or the
[2:42:31.500 --> 2:42:32.500]  devil.
[2:42:32.500 --> 2:42:33.500]  Right.
[2:42:33.500 --> 2:42:34.500]  Give it to the metaverse.
[2:42:34.500 --> 2:42:35.500]  Give it to Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:42:35.500 --> 2:42:36.500]  Give it to the financial systems.
[2:42:36.500 --> 2:42:37.500]  You believe you can't make any money.
[2:42:37.500 --> 2:42:40.740]  Are you going to give it to God that made you?
[2:42:40.740 --> 2:42:43.900]  Give it to God, ladies and gentlemen, and God will do it.
[2:42:43.900 --> 2:42:44.900]  There's no doubt.
[2:42:44.900 --> 2:42:47.980]  And God is now the runner, this total attack that's coming for the children.
[2:42:47.980 --> 2:42:49.380]  God is unlocking the weapons.
[2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:52.180]  We weren't even given this technology until they made the move against the children the
[2:42:52.180 --> 2:42:53.180]  last few months.
[2:42:53.180 --> 2:42:54.780]  That's when we all had this giant awakening.

[2:43:58.820 --> 2:44:02.180]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:44:02.180 --> 2:44:06.500]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:44:06.500 --> 2:44:11.220]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:44:11.220 --> 2:44:15.740]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com.
[2:44:15.740 --> 2:44:20.580]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:44:20.580 --> 2:44:26.300]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide
[2:44:26.300 --> 2:44:32.300]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:44:32.300 --> 2:44:38.940]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:43.540]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:49.300]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:44:49.300 --> 2:44:52.140]  facts that pertain to reality.

[2:45:16.980 --> 2:45:23.140]  How did I know they would do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their
[2:45:23.140 --> 2:45:25.580]  own reports and internal meetings were leaked?
[2:45:25.580 --> 2:45:30.660]  You see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab
[2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:35.100]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this
[2:45:35.100 --> 2:45:36.100]  great reset.
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:37.820]  Well we're now living in it.
[2:45:37.820 --> 2:45:41.860]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, none attached to the
[2:45:41.860 --> 2:45:43.860]  tyrannical corporate world government.
[2:45:43.860 --> 2:45:49.580]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally more
[2:45:49.580 --> 2:45:55.580]  and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[2:45:55.580 --> 2:45:58.220]  This is what info wars is fighting, we're fighting for the future.
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:04.700]  I know you're humble, I know you're like me, but I really want you to sit back and cogitate
[2:46:04.700 --> 2:46:11.460]  or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and info wars
[2:46:11.460 --> 2:46:14.340]  over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:23.540]  And now as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that
[2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:27.700]  you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[2:46:27.700 --> 2:46:29.900]  The tip of the sphere is band up.
[2:46:29.900 --> 2:46:35.100]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is info wars.com and we can't stay
[2:46:35.100 --> 2:46:36.340]  on air without your support.
[2:46:36.340 --> 2:46:41.180]  So thank you all for your support, donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air

[2:47:00.180 --> 2:47:26.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:43.620]  I'm just going to say, this is very close to what the devil did in the Garden of Eden
[2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:46.540]  that we're doing on air right now.
[2:47:46.540 --> 2:47:49.540]  And I just got to be honest with the listeners, that's what this is, but it's the other
[2:47:49.540 --> 2:47:50.540]  way back.
[2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:54.180]  You see they already did it to us before to forget who we were, now we got to wake up
[2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:55.180]  to that fact.
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:58.100]  I'll tell you that story again.
[2:47:58.100 --> 2:48:03.100]  This is like the snake coming down the tree, talking to Eve and talking to Adam.
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:09.300]  We were perfect because we're following God's pattern and then a new pattern was put in.
[2:48:09.300 --> 2:48:13.780]  But it feels dirty even go back to that moment to be there at the tree and to say, Hey, you
[2:48:13.780 --> 2:48:18.500]  want to get rid of this pattern, you could have God's pattern, but that's what this
[2:48:18.500 --> 2:48:19.500]  is.
[2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:20.500]  You got to serve somebody.
[2:48:20.500 --> 2:48:25.260]  My whole will, everything I am is about being straight with you.
[2:48:25.260 --> 2:48:27.380]  That's why they say Alex Jones is never wrong.
[2:48:27.380 --> 2:48:31.340]  No, I'm right about 97% of the time.
[2:48:31.340 --> 2:48:35.820]  Sometimes I get distorted or get sped up or get something wrong or see it wrong and later
[2:48:35.820 --> 2:48:36.820]  I tell you I'm wrong.
[2:48:36.820 --> 2:48:37.820]  I'm wrong.
[2:48:37.820 --> 2:48:38.820]  I'm wrong.
[2:48:38.820 --> 2:48:39.820]  I'm wrong.
[2:48:39.820 --> 2:48:40.820]  But I mean, you're right 97% of the time.
[2:48:40.820 --> 2:48:42.220]  You know what's going on.
[2:48:42.220 --> 2:48:46.260]  You know, you know, comment, you don't, you already innately don't need the news to tell
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:47.260]  you.
[2:48:47.260 --> 2:48:52.500]  Your spirit, your spirit's so old, so powerful, so real, made by God, man, you were built
[2:48:52.500 --> 2:48:55.420]  by the most amazing things ever been.
[2:48:55.420 --> 2:49:04.340]  You rolled off the assembly line, like smoking hot and we're here simply trying to get everybody
[2:49:04.340 --> 2:49:09.060]  to realize we can fight all the enemies attacks, we can fight all the racism and all the sexism
[2:49:09.060 --> 2:49:12.900]  and all the stuff they spew in the name of stoppin' it, or we can just reach up to the
[2:49:12.900 --> 2:49:15.820]  divine and grasp what was already given to us.
[2:49:15.820 --> 2:49:20.660]  We're given the false apple of I'll tell you about the universe, just do this with me over
[2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:24.580]  instead of like, no, you got to reach up even higher and God's hand is reaching down.
[2:49:24.580 --> 2:49:25.580]  So let's start.
[2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:29.820]  We got a whole other hour coming up, Jake Ducey here, but let's start getting into the documents
[2:49:29.820 --> 2:49:30.820]  and the facts here.
[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:37.180]  But the point is, we're not, all the churches and all the systems, the Islamics, the main
[2:49:37.180 --> 2:49:44.420]  line Christians, all the big systems, Hollywood, all of it is about going through them and
[2:49:44.420 --> 2:49:48.100]  they know you're already looking, but they want you to try to, Jesus was like, no more
[2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:51.580]  temples, no more priests, pray in the middle of the night at 3 a.m.
[2:49:51.580 --> 2:49:53.780]  I read that when I was a kid, so what does that mean in Sunday school?
[2:49:53.780 --> 2:49:55.660]  That's when I get the transmissions at 3 a.m.
[2:49:55.660 --> 2:49:56.660]  I wake up at 3 a.m.
[2:49:56.660 --> 2:50:00.380]  That's when I always get the big, whatever reason, I mean, I mean, even the, even the
[2:50:00.380 --> 2:50:04.820]  yogi, abavetics, all those people tell you, that's 3 a.m., whatever goes on then.
[2:50:04.820 --> 2:50:07.780]  This is about your relationship with God who created the infinite.
[2:50:07.780 --> 2:50:12.220]  I'm going to stop ranting, the point is, this is what they don't want.
[2:50:12.220 --> 2:50:16.300]  This is what they don't want you to understand, and it's not something we have that we're
[2:50:16.300 --> 2:50:21.540]  giving to you, this is something we want you to realize is already there that will end
[2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:25.580]  Claus Schwab and Bill Gates the moment you begin down that real path.
[2:50:25.580 --> 2:50:29.820]  Yeah, well, the reason that it's, I think, reset war is going to be so powerful and why
[2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:34.580]  I think they're really going to be mad when it's out is because you even think about
[2:50:34.580 --> 2:50:39.540]  the race-baiting, everything that happens, all the division, it's perpetuated off of
[2:50:39.540 --> 2:50:43.540]  one simple idea, and that's to convince us that we're just our bodies.
[2:50:43.540 --> 2:50:47.820]  There wasn't, it wasn't that long ago if you asked me who I was, I would have said, my
[2:50:47.820 --> 2:50:53.020]  name's Jake Ducey, I'm six foot three, this is I blew eyes, this is how long my hair is,
[2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:54.020]  this is who I am.
[2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:57.860]  But this is just a rental car, it's a fingernail to who I really am.
[2:50:57.860 --> 2:51:00.100]  And how empowering is it once you realize that?
[2:51:00.100 --> 2:51:03.700]  It's incredibly empowering, and here's what's something that's so interesting, I sent you
[2:51:03.700 --> 2:51:10.940]  this text the other day on my YouTube channel, someone left a comment and they said, as a
[2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:19.020]  black man, I don't know how this blonde hair blue eyed guy's videos popped up, but I don't
[2:51:19.020 --> 2:51:24.060]  want to watch you because legacy media has told me, because you're white, you're a racist,
[2:51:24.060 --> 2:51:29.220]  you're evil, you're the devil, but while I'm listening to your video right now, I have
[2:51:29.220 --> 2:51:37.340]  this deep fear that actually we all come from the same source and they've been lying to
[2:51:37.340 --> 2:51:38.340]  me.
[2:51:38.340 --> 2:51:39.340]  He knows.
[2:51:39.340 --> 2:51:40.340]  He was waking up.
[2:51:40.340 --> 2:51:41.340]  He doesn't need you.
[2:51:41.340 --> 2:51:42.340]  We're just saying, look at the light.
[2:51:42.340 --> 2:51:43.340]  Exactly.
[2:51:43.340 --> 2:51:48.740]  And that's why I said tyranny only works if you convince people that they're just a body
[2:51:48.740 --> 2:51:55.420]  and that you make them subconsciously habitually conform to the patterns of this world.
[2:51:55.420 --> 2:51:56.420]  And that's why I love.
[2:51:56.420 --> 2:51:57.420]  Come back to the Bible, pull up the verse.
[2:51:57.420 --> 2:51:59.660]  We're just like, don't conform to the pattern of the world.
[2:51:59.660 --> 2:52:05.540]  It's be not conformed by the pattern of the world, but be transformed by the renewing
[2:52:05.540 --> 2:52:06.540]  of your mind.
[2:52:06.540 --> 2:52:09.220]  And in the course, you talk about transform.
[2:52:09.220 --> 2:52:11.900]  Trans is beyond and form, meaning the physical world.
[2:52:11.900 --> 2:52:13.700]  That's why they create a counterfeit of trans.
[2:52:13.700 --> 2:52:15.500]  Take chemicals, cut your penis off.
[2:52:15.500 --> 2:52:16.500]  No.
[2:52:16.500 --> 2:52:17.900]  Transformation is the energy.
[2:52:17.900 --> 2:52:18.900]  Absolutely.
[2:52:18.900 --> 2:52:21.220]  And how does this whole control system work?
[2:52:21.220 --> 2:52:23.580]  And this is why reset wars is so powerful.
[2:52:23.580 --> 2:52:26.020]  And that's why everyone needs to open up a web browser.
[2:52:26.020 --> 2:52:30.820]  Go to resetwars.com and sign up because we have this all in government documents.
[2:52:30.820 --> 2:52:34.740]  And we now know through new neuroscience that shows us how this whole thing works.
[2:52:34.740 --> 2:52:38.500]  Every time you have an emotion, you activate cells in your brain through Hebb's law, which
[2:52:38.500 --> 2:52:39.500]  is termed neuroscience.
[2:52:39.500 --> 2:52:42.260]  It says that cells that fire together, wire together.
[2:52:42.260 --> 2:52:45.580]  Every time you have an emotion, you activate cells that build a neurological connection.
[2:52:45.580 --> 2:52:46.580]  They're programming your brain.
[2:52:46.580 --> 2:52:47.580]  Yeah.
[2:52:47.580 --> 2:52:48.580]  And they know it.
[2:52:48.580 --> 2:52:52.820]  Here's a document from the U.S. Army College of War.
[2:52:52.820 --> 2:52:59.340]  And they say, quote, the mind has no innate firewall to protect itself from electromagnetic
[2:52:59.340 --> 2:53:00.500]  weapons.
[2:53:00.500 --> 2:53:01.900]  What's an electromagnetic weapon?
[2:53:01.900 --> 2:53:03.540]  Well, what's anything?
[2:53:03.540 --> 2:53:05.940]  This is just an electromagnetic field.
[2:53:05.940 --> 2:53:08.540]  There's no such thing as matter in your in your course.
[2:53:08.540 --> 2:53:13.260]  Describe us in the Pentagon documents from the 60s and 70s that we are these energy creatures
[2:53:13.260 --> 2:53:14.260]  they're controlling.
[2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:15.260]  They say it.
[2:53:15.260 --> 2:53:16.260]  We're going to show all this.
[2:53:16.260 --> 2:53:20.580]  And they have all the, I mean, there's hundreds and that, I mean, it's kind of freaky non-lethal
[2:53:20.580 --> 2:53:21.900]  electromagnetic weapons.
[2:53:21.900 --> 2:53:22.900]  All these things.
[2:53:22.900 --> 2:53:23.900]  So you think, what are you?
[2:53:23.900 --> 2:53:27.860]  Well, it looks like I stopped right here and Alex stops right here, but you and I are
[2:53:27.860 --> 2:53:28.860]  a field of energy.
[2:53:28.860 --> 2:53:32.180]  My field goes about right there in our field's joint.
[2:53:32.180 --> 2:53:33.500]  Everything is just a field.
[2:53:33.500 --> 2:53:36.740]  And Max Planck, the father of quantum physics, you quote him in your course.
[2:53:36.740 --> 2:53:41.700]  He says, as a man who's devoted, he won the Nobel Prize in 1913, he says, as a man who's
[2:53:41.700 --> 2:53:45.420]  devoted his entire life to the most clear-headed science in the world, the study of atoms,
[2:53:45.420 --> 2:53:47.420]  I can tell you this much.
[2:53:47.420 --> 2:53:50.460]  There's no matter as such.
[2:53:50.460 --> 2:53:53.340]  So the electromagnetic weapons are important because what are we?
[2:53:53.340 --> 2:53:55.340]  We're an electromagnetic field of energy.
[2:53:55.340 --> 2:53:59.340]  And the key is its observation, which is the quantum physics.
[2:53:59.340 --> 2:54:01.180]  Other than microwaves that'll physically kill you.
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:05.220]  If you're aware of the attack, you can defeat it, but you've got it because your will controls
[2:54:05.220 --> 2:54:06.220]  the field.
[2:54:06.220 --> 2:54:08.420]  Not some stupid machine firing it.
[2:54:08.420 --> 2:54:11.220]  And that's why I love to say that we're all MK ultra patient.
[2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:15.820]  Once we realize this, it is our responsibility to de-program, de-pattern ourselves.
[2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:18.140]  Just going and yelling and protesting isn't going to change it.
[2:54:18.140 --> 2:54:19.900]  We all have to change ourselves.
[2:54:19.900 --> 2:54:25.140]  And so it says, in these sections of the Army documents, they talk about how the mind has
[2:54:25.140 --> 2:54:26.260]  no firewall, right?
[2:54:26.260 --> 2:54:30.100]  One of the things China has is a firewall on their internet, and it's something that
[2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:34.340]  we don't have, that Robert Spaulding who wrote the Stealth War about China and the US talks
[2:54:34.340 --> 2:54:38.180]  about, and he talks about how we don't have a firewall.
[2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:44.180]  So we're susceptible to cyber attacks, but we don't have a firewall on our own minds.
[2:54:44.180 --> 2:54:51.740]  And once we realize that, and we realize they've got all these low-frequency, elf radiation
[2:54:51.740 --> 2:54:57.100]  waves, electromagnetic weapons, and that can influence the brain and the mind, they say
[2:54:57.100 --> 2:54:58.100]  it.
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:05.060]  The head of DARPA, the old head of DARPA says that they figured out how to use electromagnetic
[2:55:05.060 --> 2:55:08.500]  weapons to, quote, induce the brain to release behavioral regularity.
[2:55:08.500 --> 2:55:13.300]  And they describe the frequency they were using in the 70s and its 5G.
[2:55:13.300 --> 2:55:14.580]  That's a 70s, right?
[2:55:14.580 --> 2:55:19.140]  Yeah, imagine folks, I mean, this is, they're literally putting mind, I've got the Baltimore
[2:55:19.140 --> 2:55:23.220]  Sun article in the stack here, we'll cover it next hour, where they were saying in the
[2:55:23.220 --> 2:55:28.580]  90s, oh, cell towers are going to also calm the public like Prozac.
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:32.780]  I mean, that's what I'm saying is this is happening.
[2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:41.140]  And that's why it's so important that we all take a breath, realize we're not a body,
[2:55:41.140 --> 2:55:43.980]  because you could feel the energy all the time.
[2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:46.420]  If you just go, is there life in my hands?
[2:55:46.420 --> 2:55:50.700]  And don't ask your mind is a yes or no question, but bring your attention to your hand.
[2:55:50.700 --> 2:55:51.780]  Can I feel the energy?
[2:55:51.780 --> 2:55:53.940]  Can I feel the life in my hands?
[2:55:53.940 --> 2:55:55.700]  That's the moment I really woke up, right?
[2:55:55.700 --> 2:55:59.820]  I was watching Endgame, I was doing all these things, and I was a freshman in college, and
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:03.740]  I was listening to an audio book, and the guy said, is there life in your hands?
[2:56:03.740 --> 2:56:05.460]  Can you feel the energy in your hands?
[2:56:05.460 --> 2:56:08.140]  And it was the first time I ever separated from my mind.
[2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:12.140]  Yeah, your brain connects and goes, my brain's in control of this, and there's something
[2:56:12.140 --> 2:56:14.340]  beyond my mind that's in control of it.
[2:56:14.340 --> 2:56:16.300]  That's when you actually stand up.
[2:56:16.300 --> 2:56:18.660]  Yeah, that we aren't our thoughts.
[2:56:18.660 --> 2:56:19.660]  We aren't our thoughts.
[2:56:19.660 --> 2:56:20.660]  We are in control.
[2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:24.140]  And we're in control of it, just like a computer operating system.
[2:56:24.140 --> 2:56:28.500]  That's what I love about the Reset Wars course, because you go step by step, and you liken
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:29.500]  the mind.
[2:56:29.500 --> 2:56:33.140]  We're in a simulation, and you liken the mind to a computer operating system.
[2:56:33.140 --> 2:56:37.780]  They have installed the operating system and the viruses into our computer.
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:42.820]  What's happened for so long that we believed all the emotions and all the thoughts, we'd
[2:56:42.820 --> 2:56:45.500]  memorized the pattern through our nervous system.
[2:56:45.500 --> 2:56:46.500]  So we think it's who we are.
[2:56:46.500 --> 2:56:47.500]  We think we aren't confident.
[2:56:47.500 --> 2:56:50.740]  We think we aren't as powerful as Elon Musk, as Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:56:50.740 --> 2:56:55.900]  There's so many people that look up to Alex Jones, and they want to be powerful and make
[2:56:55.900 --> 2:57:00.180]  a difference in the world like Alex Jones, but they think Alex is somehow more powerful.
[2:57:00.180 --> 2:57:06.380]  We all have to wake up to the fact that we are connected to this divine power.
[2:57:06.380 --> 2:57:09.180]  And through inspiration, we can transform our mind.
[2:57:09.180 --> 2:57:11.940]  We can think and feel greater than our environment.
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:13.700]  That's how we access new ideas.
[2:57:13.700 --> 2:57:14.700]  That's how we change the world.
[2:57:14.700 --> 2:57:18.780]  We must come out of the world, and then get into spirit, and then take over the world.
[2:57:18.780 --> 2:57:20.660]  In this world, but not out of it, right?
[2:57:20.660 --> 2:57:21.660]  Absolutely.
[2:57:21.660 --> 2:57:22.660]  And that's why it's so cool.
[2:57:22.660 --> 2:57:27.900]  It's like Alex Jones put together, reverse engineered all their secret studies.
[2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:32.060]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is weaponized mind control, but to free people.
[2:57:32.060 --> 2:57:33.980]  This is the keys to MKUltra.
[2:57:33.980 --> 2:57:37.740]  This is the keys to MKUltra and all these other documents that they're using, they want
[2:57:37.740 --> 2:57:38.740]  you to feel alone.
[2:57:38.740 --> 2:57:40.860]  And if you do, hold on, let's start the fourth hour.
[2:57:40.860 --> 2:57:46.140]  We'll cover all the documents straight ahead.
[2:57:46.140 --> 2:57:52.540]  For a fraction, there are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy
[2:57:52.540 --> 2:57:54.380]  powders, energy pills.
[2:57:54.380 --> 2:58:00.180]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides,
[2:58:00.180 --> 2:58:05.580]  horrible crashes, and, again, so many toxins on them.
[2:58:05.580 --> 2:58:12.020]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at mfoldwarstore.com are clean, are pure,
[2:58:12.020 --> 2:58:17.700]  are highest quality, and they're long lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[2:58:17.700 --> 2:58:23.140]  And right now, our strongest product, the three new tropics have, Rainforce Plus, Rainforce
[2:58:23.140 --> 2:58:30.260]  Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at mfoldwarstore.com.
[2:58:30.260 --> 2:58:33.660]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[2:58:33.660 --> 2:58:36.500]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[2:58:36.500 --> 2:58:44.180]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available
[2:58:44.180 --> 2:58:46.780]  right now, and it funds the mfoldwar, a 360 win.
[2:58:46.780 --> 2:58:48.180]  I know you're humble.
[2:58:48.180 --> 2:58:50.020]  I know you're like me.
[2:58:50.020 --> 2:58:57.140]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you
[2:58:57.140 --> 2:59:02.540]  that have supported my broadcast and mfoldwarstore over the years have changed the world in incredible
[2:59:02.540 --> 2:59:03.540]  ways.
[2:59:03.540 --> 2:59:12.100]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end in 2022, begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that
[2:59:12.100 --> 2:59:16.220]  you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[2:59:16.220 --> 2:59:20.820]  The tip of the spear is banned on video, the very front lines of the fight for human liberty
[2:59:20.820 --> 2:59:22.700]  is mfoldwarstore.com.
[2:59:22.700 --> 2:59:27.580]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[2:59:27.580 --> 2:59:32.980]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at savemfoldwarstore.com, at savemfoldwarstore.com,
[2:59:32.980 --> 2:59:38.660]  and continue to go to mfoldwarstore.com, where right now we've got TurboForce sold out for
[2:59:38.660 --> 2:59:44.100]  months, 10 hours of clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many
[2:59:44.100 --> 2:59:48.660]  other great products.
[2:59:48.660 --> 2:59:55.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:55.180 --> 3:00:18.540]  All right, some stations do not pick up this first five minutes, we're gonna hit the pool
[3:00:18.540 --> 3:00:24.620]  right now, I'm coming up here in about six minutes, but Jake Ducey's here with us.
[3:00:24.620 --> 3:00:29.860]  This is, yeah, don't let them mold your mind, take control of your mind, be aware of how
[3:00:29.860 --> 3:00:34.420]  they manipulate your mind, you'll be stronger, don't go to some psychologists and psychiatrists
[3:00:34.420 --> 3:00:39.060]  in the system telling you're a failure, you're weak, it's over, they got pills for you, give
[3:00:39.060 --> 3:00:42.940]  me a break, ladies and gentlemen, transcend at all, don't be a victim, but I got a compilation
[3:00:42.940 --> 3:00:48.060]  of Fauci flip-flop statements and comments on masks, and then Dr. Robert Malone, the
[3:00:48.060 --> 3:00:52.300]  future of global totalitarianism is here.
[3:00:52.300 --> 3:01:00.740]  This is so incredibly powerful, these two clips that go it together, so I hope that you share
[3:01:00.740 --> 3:01:05.100]  this information right now, Jake Ducey is our guest, we're gonna come right back on
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:10.140]  the other side of this break and lay it all out today, and believe me, I don't, you know,
[3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:15.020]  I don't tell you stuff that's BS, we're not about hoaxes, we're about reality, so stay
[3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:16.020]  with us.
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:22.740]  Let me just state for the record that masks are not theater, wearing a mask might make
[3:01:22.740 --> 3:01:28.140]  people feel a little bit better, and masks are protective, but it's not providing the
[3:01:28.140 --> 3:01:30.940]  perfect protection that people think that it is.
[3:01:30.940 --> 3:01:36.220]  There has not been any indication that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable
[3:01:36.220 --> 3:01:41.660]  period of time has any deleterious effects, there are unintended consequences, people
[3:01:41.660 --> 3:01:44.620]  keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
[3:01:44.620 --> 3:01:48.380]  Then can you get some schmutz sort of thing inside there?
[3:01:48.380 --> 3:01:53.300]  You do not need to wear a mask indoors if in fact you've been vaccinated, good that
[3:01:53.300 --> 3:01:58.300]  you're vaccinated, but in a situation where you have people indoors, particularly crowded,
[3:01:58.300 --> 3:01:59.740]  you should wear a mask.
[3:01:59.740 --> 3:02:04.700]  So even if you are vaccinated, you should wear a mask, if in fact you are vaccinated,
[3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:09.860]  fully vaccinated, you are protected, and you do not need to wear a mask, outdoors or indoors.
[3:02:09.860 --> 3:02:14.420]  When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks.
[3:02:14.420 --> 3:02:19.300]  You know, if you look at children outside, particularly when they're with the family,
[3:02:19.300 --> 3:02:24.740]  walking down the street, playing a game or what have you, do not have to wear a mask.
[3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:29.580]  The Academy of Pediatric actually makes that recommendation that children should be wearing
[3:02:29.580 --> 3:02:32.900]  masks from two years old onward.
[3:02:32.900 --> 3:02:37.660]  You're asking now, if your child is a member of your household, can you walk outdoors with
[3:02:37.660 --> 3:02:40.060]  your child without a mask?
[3:02:40.060 --> 3:02:42.620]  According to that chart, the answer is yes.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:45.340]  But the child can't, not to beat it to death.
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:46.340]  Yes, yes.
[3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:49.980]  Now the CDC says, I mean, I think I've got this right.
[3:02:49.980 --> 3:02:52.140]  One mask is better than zero masks.
[3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:56.260]  Two masks is better than one mask, but you don't have to have double masks.
[3:02:56.260 --> 3:02:57.260]  Is that right?
[3:02:57.260 --> 3:02:58.260]  I mean...
[3:02:58.260 --> 3:03:02.580]  It became clear that cloth coverings, that you didn't have to buy in a store, that you
[3:03:02.580 --> 3:03:06.900]  could make yourself adequate, and then you want it to fit better.
[3:03:06.900 --> 3:03:11.740]  So one of the ways you could do it if you would like to is put a cloth mask over, which
[3:03:11.740 --> 3:03:18.860]  actually here and here and here, where you could get leakage in, is much better contained.
[3:03:18.860 --> 3:03:20.500]  Are you a double mask or Dr. Fauci?
[3:03:20.500 --> 3:03:22.060]  It looks like you are.
[3:03:22.060 --> 3:03:33.540]  In terms of the virus, the virus really seems increasingly to be a platform in the jab for
[3:03:33.540 --> 3:03:36.780]  advancing other agendas, including political agendas.
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:41.700]  I like to say, and please quote me on this, the future of global totalitarianism.
[3:03:41.700 --> 3:03:45.780]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[3:03:45.780 --> 3:03:52.300]  What we're seeing in Canada, Australia, Austria now is the most egregious example.
[3:03:52.300 --> 3:04:01.260]  Sounds like we may be seeing it in Germany soon, is the deployment of a totalitarian
[3:04:01.260 --> 3:04:06.380]  approach to this whole thing, and it is amazingly coordinated.
[3:04:06.380 --> 3:04:10.420]  That's another half an hour discussion about how this is happening.
[3:04:10.420 --> 3:04:17.300]  But what I think we're seeing with the governments like Austria is the symptom of what Professor
[3:04:17.300 --> 3:04:22.300]  Matthias Desmit is talking about more and more, and many of us find a lot of traction
[3:04:22.300 --> 3:04:23.300]  in his thoughts.
[3:04:23.300 --> 3:04:26.100]  It's called mass formation psychosis.
[3:04:26.100 --> 3:04:32.180]  Basically, it's the madness of crowds would be a simple way to put it, and a lot of these
[3:04:32.180 --> 3:04:39.100]  governments have been overtaken by this form of psychosis or hypnosis.
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:42.300]  They believe that these vaccines are effective.
[3:04:42.300 --> 3:04:43.300]  They're clearly not.
[3:04:43.300 --> 3:04:48.700]  They are impervious to data, just in the same way that we're seeing our own government
[3:04:48.700 --> 3:04:55.860]  impervious to actual facts.
[3:04:55.860 --> 3:04:56.860]  There are so many.
[3:04:56.860 --> 3:04:57.860]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[3:04:57.860 --> 3:04:58.860]  Go ahead.
[3:04:58.860 --> 3:04:59.860]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[3:04:59.860 --> 3:05:00.860]  Good, bro.
[3:05:00.860 --> 3:05:01.860]  Great last caller.
[3:05:01.860 --> 3:05:04.860]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[3:05:04.860 --> 3:05:11.860]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, the moralization,
[3:05:11.860 --> 3:05:12.860]  and absurdity.
[3:05:12.860 --> 3:05:15.860]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:16.860]  All right.
[3:05:16.860 --> 3:05:17.860]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:18.860]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[3:05:18.860 --> 3:05:19.860]  Go ahead.
[3:05:19.860 --> 3:05:20.860]  Hey, Alex.
[3:05:20.860 --> 3:05:21.860]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:05:21.860 --> 3:05:23.860]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[3:05:23.860 --> 3:05:24.860]  The XQ does wonders.
[3:05:24.860 --> 3:05:25.860]  I recommend it to everybody.
[3:05:25.860 --> 3:05:26.860]  You're on the fence about it.
[3:05:26.860 --> 3:05:27.860]  Get off the fence.
[3:05:27.860 --> 3:05:28.860]  Get the product.
[3:05:28.860 --> 3:05:29.860]  Support the info war.
[3:05:29.860 --> 3:05:30.860]  Tyler in Maine.
[3:05:30.860 --> 3:05:31.860]  You're on the air.
[3:05:31.860 --> 3:05:32.860]  Thanks for rolling.
[3:05:32.860 --> 3:05:33.860]  Go ahead.
[3:05:33.860 --> 3:05:34.860]  Hey, Alex.
[3:05:34.860 --> 3:05:35.860]  It's great to be on with you.
[3:05:35.860 --> 3:05:36.860]  It's an honor.
[3:05:36.860 --> 3:05:37.860]  Honored talk to you.
[3:05:37.860 --> 3:05:38.860]  Awesome.
[3:05:38.860 --> 3:05:43.860]  So, first thing I wanted to do was to say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[3:05:43.860 --> 3:05:45.860]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[3:05:45.860 --> 3:05:46.860]  All right.
[3:05:46.860 --> 3:05:47.860]  It helps with the bedroom.
[3:05:47.860 --> 3:05:49.860]  So, just number one for a few of us there.
[3:05:49.860 --> 3:05:50.860]  That only works.
[3:05:50.860 --> 3:05:51.860]  It's not a joke.
[3:05:51.860 --> 3:06:06.860]  All right.
[3:06:06.860 --> 3:06:17.860]  All right.
[3:06:17.860 --> 3:06:29.180]  Let's start getting into all these documents, the history, the controlling, what they admit
[3:06:29.180 --> 3:06:32.540]  they're doing, how they're trying to erase our personalities.
[3:06:32.540 --> 3:06:35.460]  They were beta testing in the 50s, 60s, 70s.
[3:06:35.460 --> 3:06:37.860]  The last time it was declassified was 77.
[3:06:37.860 --> 3:06:42.180]  We can see it now all on a mass scale and I've got a bunch of articles where they admit
[3:06:42.180 --> 3:06:44.060]  they're currently doing it to us.
[3:06:44.060 --> 3:06:49.060]  So, shouldn't people be aware of what's currently being done to them?
[3:06:49.060 --> 3:06:50.060]  Yeah.
[3:06:50.060 --> 3:06:51.060]  This one's fascinating.
[3:06:51.060 --> 3:06:53.820]  This one is from Richard Cesaro.
[3:06:53.820 --> 3:07:00.060]  He's the deputy director was the deputy director of the Pentagon's advanced research projects,
[3:07:00.060 --> 3:07:01.060]  DARPA.
[3:07:01.060 --> 3:07:02.060]  This is an actual quote.
[3:07:02.060 --> 3:07:08.740]  He says, quote, in our experiments, we did some remarkable things and there was no question
[3:07:08.740 --> 3:07:14.060]  in my mind that you can get into the brain with microwaves.
[3:07:14.060 --> 3:07:20.900]  If you really make the breakthrough, you've got something better than any bomb ever built
[3:07:20.900 --> 3:07:26.620]  because when you finally come down the line, you're talking about controlling people's
[3:07:26.620 --> 3:07:27.620]  minds.
[3:07:27.620 --> 3:07:29.100]  So, that's their argument.
[3:07:29.100 --> 3:07:35.220]  Put it in the 5G so no one riots, so no one's bad, but their depopulation is doing it.
[3:07:35.220 --> 3:07:40.700]  It'd be bad enough if good guys put this in, but these are bad guys that put this in.
[3:07:40.700 --> 3:07:45.220]  And that's how the whole entire control system continues to perpetuate itself.
[3:07:45.220 --> 3:07:50.140]  And that's why everything is designed to trap us into the, as you talk about in the course,
[3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:53.660]  the emotional control grid, the emotional control grid.
[3:07:53.660 --> 3:07:58.180]  When we were, I was laughing when we were watching that clip of the masks because I was thinking
[3:07:58.180 --> 3:08:03.940]  even masks are another example of trapping you into your physical body.
[3:08:03.940 --> 3:08:08.060]  It's another anchor that brings you back into lower emotions.
[3:08:08.060 --> 3:08:11.860]  You're afraid of dying, even though you can't die because everything's energy and energy
[3:08:11.860 --> 3:08:13.060]  is never created or destroyed.
[3:08:13.060 --> 3:08:14.580]  It's only transferred to different states.
[3:08:14.580 --> 3:08:16.060]  First law of thermodynamics.
[3:08:16.060 --> 3:08:21.060]  Yeah, so you can't die, but the whole system has to get you into the emotion of fear.
[3:08:21.060 --> 3:08:25.340]  So the mask just traps you back into the matrix, into the third dimension, so you think you're
[3:08:25.340 --> 3:08:26.580]  just a little physical body.
[3:08:26.580 --> 3:08:27.580]  You've got to be...
[3:08:27.580 --> 3:08:29.700]  It's the symbol of that you're a prisoner.
[3:08:29.700 --> 3:08:34.220]  And it's just another example of moving you back into the matrix.
[3:08:34.220 --> 3:08:39.140]  And that's why I think they're going to be so mad when they find out that you broke everything
[3:08:39.140 --> 3:08:45.300]  down step by step by step in reset wars because this whole thing isn't just off of us waking
[3:08:45.300 --> 3:08:48.540]  up because so many people that are awake still think we're powerless.
[3:08:48.540 --> 3:08:49.740]  They still think we can't win.
[3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:50.740]  There's still debt slaves.
[3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:52.140]  That's a key point you make.
[3:08:52.140 --> 3:08:53.140]  No, no, we're awake.
[3:08:53.140 --> 3:08:55.140]  We're powerful.
[3:08:55.140 --> 3:08:56.140]  And that's what has to happen.
[3:08:56.140 --> 3:09:01.100]  We have to realize that we are powerful.
[3:09:01.100 --> 3:09:04.180]  And that's how the entire game operates.
[3:09:04.180 --> 3:09:08.940]  And that's why reset wars is so powerful.
[3:09:08.940 --> 3:09:11.140]  You got it coming out at the beginning of December.
[3:09:11.140 --> 3:09:18.060]  Everybody go to resetwars.com, sign up right now, resetwars.com, and sign up right now
[3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:20.860]  for the early bird list because, look, they've got all these.
[3:09:20.860 --> 3:09:31.660]  They say DARPA, quote, the aim of the program is to remotely disrupt political dissonance
[3:09:31.660 --> 3:09:40.040]  and extremism by employing transcranial magnetic stimulation in tandem with sophisticated propaganda
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:41.540]  based on this technology.
[3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:42.540]  And then you read it.
[3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:43.540]  It's 5G basically.
[3:09:43.540 --> 3:09:44.540]  Yeah.
[3:09:44.540 --> 3:09:47.300]  So the entire, I mean, and think about that.
[3:09:47.300 --> 3:09:50.740]  Think about what the metaverse probably actually has, right?
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:54.940]  Zuckerberg wants to duct tape this mask onto your head and use 24 hours a day.
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:09:55.940]  We stay in it.
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:09:59.860]  We only break out of it to eat some cricket protein, ground up cricket protein powder
[3:09:59.860 --> 3:10:01.300]  or something like that.
[3:10:01.300 --> 3:10:05.780]  And that's the way this whole, it's just to get into our brainwave state.
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:09.660]  And that's why all of this is so powerful because at the end of the day, it brings us
[3:10:09.660 --> 3:10:10.660]  back to what?
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:13.980]  It brings us back to brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[3:10:13.980 --> 3:10:14.980]  As long as...
[3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:18.060]  By the way, they just typed in what you said from a 1970s document.
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:21.220]  There was mainstream news, the army doing it to the troops.
[3:10:21.220 --> 3:10:22.220]  And they used to cover it.
[3:10:22.220 --> 3:10:23.220]  Yeah.
[3:10:23.220 --> 3:10:26.140]  All of these things have like New York Times, Associated Press.
[3:10:26.140 --> 3:10:27.140]  Yeah.
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:28.420]  Like even 10, 20 years ago, they'd cover it.
[3:10:28.420 --> 3:10:29.420]  Now they don't.
[3:10:29.420 --> 3:10:30.420]  Yeah.
[3:10:30.420 --> 3:10:33.700]  Now they don't cover it at all, but you can still find the old documents.
[3:10:33.700 --> 3:10:36.380]  Well, see that metaphysically, that was their fine print.
[3:10:36.380 --> 3:10:40.220]  It's kind of like when you're going to demolish a house or take over, you publish it in the
[3:10:40.220 --> 3:10:41.220]  paper, you're doing it.
[3:10:41.220 --> 3:10:43.020]  They kind of tell you.
[3:10:43.020 --> 3:10:45.740]  They tell you 20 years before, then they do it.
[3:10:45.740 --> 3:10:51.340]  And that's what's so powerful about all this, because all you did is find the entire playbook
[3:10:51.340 --> 3:10:52.820]  of how reality is created.
[3:10:52.820 --> 3:10:56.140]  I mean, we haven't even touched on quantum physics.
[3:10:56.140 --> 3:10:57.140]  We know everything.
[3:10:57.140 --> 3:10:58.780]  We'll do that in the last segment of the sound.
[3:10:58.780 --> 3:11:01.380]  But let's look at some of these overhead shot please, guys.
[3:11:01.380 --> 3:11:03.780]  Here's a small smattering of these.
[3:11:03.780 --> 3:11:05.260]  Here's the one in Telegraph.
[3:11:05.260 --> 3:11:11.980]  Use of fear to control behavior in COVID crisis was to tell a terrarian scientist admit government
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:17.780]  mind control systems were used, including classified systems to ensure compliance.
[3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:19.900]  Wonder what that was.
[3:11:19.900 --> 3:11:24.300]  The next step outbreak, why we're not ready.
[3:11:24.300 --> 3:11:28.940]  Medical and psychological emergency units.
[3:11:28.940 --> 3:11:34.860]  Lockdown is the world's biggest psychological experiment, and we will pay the price.
[3:11:34.860 --> 3:11:38.140]  The biggest psychological experiment history is running now.
[3:11:38.140 --> 3:11:39.140]  Scientific American.
[3:11:39.140 --> 3:11:43.380]  They admit like you're an animal, they're doing this through publications.
[3:11:43.380 --> 3:11:51.060]  And it goes on and on and on how they're running these operations and how they prepared it
[3:11:51.060 --> 3:11:52.340]  and how they admit it.
[3:11:52.340 --> 3:11:58.900]  The CIA secret quest for mind control, torture, LSD, and a poisoner in chief.
[3:11:58.900 --> 3:12:03.820]  I've only started to get into all this, okay?
[3:12:03.820 --> 3:12:05.380]  Yeah.
[3:12:05.380 --> 3:12:11.780]  And again, the entire thing is to convince you that you are your thoughts and that you
[3:12:11.780 --> 3:12:18.940]  are your body because they can use electromagnetic warfare to control your thoughts, to control
[3:12:18.940 --> 3:12:23.500]  your emotions, and thus control your body.
[3:12:23.500 --> 3:12:29.460]  And that's why I say we're all a part of a massive MK ultra experiment called society.
[3:12:29.460 --> 3:12:32.220]  We think of all these horrific things that they did to people, but they're using all
[3:12:32.220 --> 3:12:35.660]  these same technologies in order to control us.
[3:12:35.660 --> 3:12:40.700]  And what really changed my life wasn't just waking up to what you've been talking about
[3:12:40.700 --> 3:12:42.700]  in Endgame for so many years.
[3:12:42.700 --> 3:12:49.300]  What changed my life was when I said, well, how am I hypnotized?
[3:12:49.300 --> 3:12:51.820]  And I realized I was controlled financially.
[3:12:51.820 --> 3:12:52.820]  It controlled my career.
[3:12:52.820 --> 3:12:54.500]  I didn't think I could become that successful.
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:12:57.500]  I didn't think I could achieve a lot.
[3:12:57.500 --> 3:13:00.460]  I thought I couldn't be happy because there was all these bad things happening in the
[3:13:00.460 --> 3:13:01.460]  world.
[3:13:01.460 --> 3:13:06.180]  Well, if consciousness creates reality, which it does, and we know from the Zerber effect
[3:13:06.180 --> 3:13:10.620]  that consciousness influenced reality down to the subatomic level, and that 95 percent
[3:13:10.620 --> 3:13:14.260]  of our life is subconscious, it's a habitual pattern plan.
[3:13:14.260 --> 3:13:17.100]  They're programming us as engines of builders.
[3:13:17.100 --> 3:13:22.540]  We're like spiritual nanotech that if they can program us, they can use us as slaves
[3:13:22.540 --> 3:13:24.100]  to build their new system.
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:29.580]  So these demons, these creatures, whatever they are, are trying to enslave us to be their
[3:13:29.580 --> 3:13:31.940]  slaves, building whatever it is they want.
[3:13:31.940 --> 3:13:35.860]  Instead, God's saying, no, break free, be your own individual.
[3:13:35.860 --> 3:13:42.100]  And the funny thing is that actually, we are the ones ultimately creating our own enslavement
[3:13:42.100 --> 3:13:43.100]  unconsciously.
[3:13:43.100 --> 3:13:48.180]  They're just using all of this warfare in order to influence our consciousness, but we're
[3:13:48.180 --> 3:13:49.860]  unaware that it's taking place.
[3:13:49.860 --> 3:13:54.220]  So we unconsciously accept the viruses in the operating system, and then they run out
[3:13:54.220 --> 3:13:55.220]  of office.
[3:13:55.220 --> 3:13:56.220]  Because we're in a false reality.
[3:13:56.220 --> 3:14:00.500]  One of us is sentient conscious beings, made the image of God with free will, and then
[3:14:00.500 --> 3:14:01.860]  do what we want.
[3:14:01.860 --> 3:14:07.300]  We have to stop submitting the outside stimuli, and that's what Reset Wars exposes is.
[3:14:07.300 --> 3:14:09.740]  They've got their reset to stop us from awakening.
[3:14:09.740 --> 3:14:11.620]  This is the real reset.
[3:14:11.620 --> 3:14:13.740]  And imagine if everybody realizes that.
[3:14:13.740 --> 3:14:17.340]  Imagine if the nurse that's in the medical system that's fed up with it, but thinks she's
[3:14:17.340 --> 3:14:21.620]  powerless, realizes she can create her own private practice, and it can eventually become
[3:14:21.620 --> 3:14:23.980]  the biggest private practice in Texas.
[3:14:23.980 --> 3:14:30.460]  Imagine if the English teacher realizes that she can create one of the most powerful schools
[3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:31.460]  in California.
[3:14:31.460 --> 3:14:33.300]  And you just start going down the line.
[3:14:33.300 --> 3:14:37.700]  You realize the broadcaster that wants to be like Alex Jones and Owen, can actually
[3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:43.580]  tap in to the same spiritual energy that's moving through all of us, and they can utilize
[3:14:43.580 --> 3:14:46.260]  that to become incredibly powerful, to become the next one.
[3:14:46.260 --> 3:14:49.620]  And we're not going to get upset they're successful because they're freeing us.
[3:14:49.620 --> 3:14:53.020]  They're creating a wider ocean in which our spirit swims.
[3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:57.180]  And the only way that we're ever going to win this, the only way the great reset is defeated,
[3:14:57.180 --> 3:14:59.780]  is by exactly that.
[3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:03.540]  That's what consciousness that God gave us is its art.
[3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:08.500]  God created us with free will to be able to create new ideas, create new systems, create
[3:15:08.500 --> 3:15:11.780]  new frontiers, and experience consciousness.
[3:15:11.780 --> 3:15:16.820]  And the only way, first Einstein said, God does not play at dice, then he said, no, I'm
[3:15:16.820 --> 3:15:17.820]  wrong.
[3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:18.820]  God's real.
[3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:19.820]  God only plays at dice.
[3:15:19.820 --> 3:15:25.780]  God's playing dice constantly, just only creating free will is new when you're omnipresent.
[3:15:25.780 --> 3:15:29.180]  What else is new when you're omnipresent, creating new free will creatures?
[3:15:29.180 --> 3:15:30.540]  There's a quote by Iris Murdoch.
[3:15:30.540 --> 3:15:34.980]  She says, we live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion, and the great task in life is
[3:15:34.980 --> 3:15:36.740]  to find reality.
[3:15:36.740 --> 3:15:37.740]  What is real?
[3:15:37.740 --> 3:15:41.340]  Well, what is real is that consciousness creates reality.
[3:15:41.340 --> 3:15:43.700]  These people don't have any control over us.
[3:15:43.700 --> 3:15:45.660]  They're actually at a lower level of consciousness.
[3:15:45.660 --> 3:15:51.620]  Why are we following these Democratic and Republican politicians like Nadler?
[3:15:51.620 --> 3:15:53.060]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[3:15:53.060 --> 3:16:00.620]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[3:16:00.620 --> 3:16:05.980]  got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[3:16:05.980 --> 3:16:11.660]  And clout swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[3:16:11.660 --> 3:16:16.780]  once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[3:16:16.780 --> 3:16:21.740]  you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when
[3:16:21.740 --> 3:16:27.020]  you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies
[3:16:27.020 --> 3:16:31.100]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax
[3:16:31.100 --> 3:16:33.460]  you with a carbon tax for it.
[3:16:33.460 --> 3:16:37.060]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:16:37.060 --> 3:16:40.620]  This is the takeover in humanity, better wake up and say no.
[3:16:40.620 --> 3:16:42.060]  Only folks are starting to wake up.
[3:16:42.060 --> 3:16:45.740]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the charts along with Info Wars, but it's
[3:16:45.740 --> 3:16:46.740]  not enough.
[3:16:46.740 --> 3:16:50.580]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[3:16:50.580 --> 3:16:51.580]  to justice.
[3:16:51.580 --> 3:16:55.940]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.

[3:17:57.220 --> 3:18:02.740]  Today anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was the platform.
[3:18:02.740 --> 3:18:07.620]  Info Wars was right above the target and the globalists were a year out from launching
[3:18:07.620 --> 3:18:08.980]  their attack.
[3:18:08.980 --> 3:18:14.620]  Three years later and Info Wars is still thriving thanks to the support of our audience, but

[3:18:20.820 --> 3:18:25.140]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[3:18:25.140 --> 3:18:28.220]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:34.900]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial, we don't think so, they want to kill the messenger
[3:18:34.900 --> 3:18:39.780]  in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't let them.
[3:18:39.780 --> 3:18:42.620]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[3:19:58.940 --> 3:20:08.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:08.940 --> 3:20:30.140]  Take a journey to the bright midnight or kill the children, we've got ABC News reporting,
[3:20:30.140 --> 3:20:34.020]  I said last week, I said now that Fauci says we're going to inject newborns, they're
[3:20:34.020 --> 3:20:39.340]  playing, there's outbreaks of newborns, they're all dying, it's very easy to predict, sure
[3:20:39.340 --> 3:20:46.700]  as the sun came up this morning, COVID-19 Live Updates, ABC News, pediatric COVID cases
[3:20:46.700 --> 3:20:55.620]  ride for third week, babies need shots and I've got the articles right here from all
[3:20:55.620 --> 3:20:59.820]  over the world where people that take the shots are double likely to die.
[3:20:59.820 --> 3:21:03.500]  Why do you think Jake did a great research, we'll get back into the mind control and how
[3:21:03.500 --> 3:21:08.860]  to counter it, they just want to kill so many people now, I guess they just figure statistically
[3:21:08.860 --> 3:21:13.980]  there's a giant awakening just to just kill them, but if we kill them with the military,
[3:21:13.980 --> 3:21:16.380]  they'll rise up and defeat us, we got to do it through medicine.
[3:21:16.380 --> 3:21:22.180]  Well, I mean even Bezos had that really bizarre speech the other day or quote the other day
[3:21:22.180 --> 3:21:25.340]  when he was talking about how they're going to turn earth into a nature preserve and everyone's
[3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:31.060]  going to live in space, I mean, they realize they don't really need most people, right,
[3:21:31.060 --> 3:21:35.460]  and that's what this is all about and when we go into all these documents, it can be
[3:21:35.460 --> 3:21:39.060]  a little scary, right, it's like, oh my gosh, they have all these psychological warfare
[3:21:39.060 --> 3:21:45.180]  weapons they're using on us, but I want to say that's why Alex put together reset wars.
[3:21:45.180 --> 3:21:49.860]  You're conscious of their operation, it's game owner, like what does GI Joe say, knowing
[3:21:49.860 --> 3:21:51.140]  is half the battle.
[3:21:51.140 --> 3:21:56.540]  Knowing is half the battle and so when you go to reset wars, this is exactly what Mark
[3:21:56.540 --> 3:22:00.100]  Zuckerberg, Klaus Schwab, this is exactly what they don't want us to know and that's
[3:22:00.100 --> 3:22:03.900]  why the world's getting crazier because they're trying to move us back into the matrix to
[3:22:03.900 --> 3:22:06.180]  stop the spiritual awakening.
[3:22:06.180 --> 3:22:12.620]  So keep create Alex put a step by step guide to show you exactly how they use the warfare,
[3:22:12.620 --> 3:22:16.860]  how to break out of it, how to deep pattern reprogram your mind, connect on your own,
[3:22:16.860 --> 3:22:21.020]  not through Alex, but connect on your own to God, the spirit to your higher purpose.
[3:22:21.020 --> 3:22:25.480]  So look, I've been a fan of Alex for a long time, I think this is better than even end
[3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:28.900]  game, the greatest work he ever did because this is the final step.
[3:22:28.900 --> 3:22:31.460]  This is the final step for everyone to wake up.
[3:22:31.460 --> 3:22:36.540]  So please go to resetwars.com and sign up right now.
[3:22:36.540 --> 3:22:42.220]  You were telling me recently about maybe 10, 12 years ago, you were going to write a book
[3:22:42.220 --> 3:22:49.140]  and with some big author and when the publishing houses and CNN, they tried to shut your book
[3:22:49.140 --> 3:22:50.140]  down.
[3:22:50.140 --> 3:22:53.980]  And then so what we figured out is one, now you've got something even more powerful.
[3:22:53.980 --> 3:22:58.740]  This is step by step for you to find out how to break free from the physical and emotional
[3:22:58.740 --> 3:23:03.180]  planes, how to break free from the lack of purpose, how to break free from your financial
[3:23:03.180 --> 3:23:04.180]  health limitation.
[3:23:04.180 --> 3:23:07.580]  I'm going to cover that next segment with the quantum physics that they know of the
[3:23:07.580 --> 3:23:09.220]  observer effect.
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:14.500]  This is not like BS, this is scientifically backed up, we're about to cover.
[3:23:14.500 --> 3:23:18.300]  Notice we've given the globalists a big run for their money because I was subconsciously
[3:23:18.300 --> 3:23:20.660]  already using all this.
[3:23:20.660 --> 3:23:27.220]  And as a fan of your work for so long, the whole full circle is one step one was you
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:29.940]  woke everybody up to the new world order, right?
[3:23:29.940 --> 3:23:33.180]  And step number two is you woke everybody up to the great reset.
[3:23:33.180 --> 3:23:37.300]  Step number three is now we're waking people up to who they really are and giving reverse
[3:23:37.300 --> 3:23:39.300]  engineering the playbook of mind control.
[3:23:39.300 --> 3:23:42.300]  First you got to realize you're under attack, you got to realize what the agenda is, then
[3:23:42.300 --> 3:23:43.980]  you realize who you are to fix it.
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:44.980]  Exactly.
[3:23:44.980 --> 3:23:45.980]  That's how to fight it.
[3:23:45.980 --> 3:23:46.980]  Somebody comes up for no reason.
[3:23:46.980 --> 3:23:49.700]  You're like, okay, I just get in the head, okay, I'm going to fight this.
[3:23:49.700 --> 3:23:50.700]  I'm going to win.
[3:23:50.700 --> 3:23:51.700]  I'm going to fight.
[3:23:51.700 --> 3:23:53.380]  And then that's it.
[3:23:53.380 --> 3:24:00.220]  And that's why we're saying go right now, sign up to resetwars.com.
[3:24:00.220 --> 3:24:04.020]  Get on the early bird list because once Mark Zuckerberg sees this, he's kicking metaverse
[3:24:04.020 --> 3:24:05.020]  into high gear.
[3:24:05.020 --> 3:24:08.820]  He's going to be like, we must get metaverse set up to trap people into lower dimensions.
[3:24:08.820 --> 3:24:09.820]  I'll explain that.
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:13.820]  Notice it all happens at the same time we play on the six months.
[3:24:13.820 --> 3:24:17.060]  The reset wars is the answer to the metaverse.
[3:24:17.060 --> 3:24:21.300]  Quite literally because the metaverse, all it is is a simulation within a simulation.
[3:24:21.300 --> 3:24:25.900]  We're already in a simulation, people go, the zombie apocalypse is coming.
[3:24:25.900 --> 3:24:27.500]  The zombie apocalypse is already here.
[3:24:27.500 --> 3:24:28.500]  And guess what?
[3:24:28.500 --> 3:24:29.500]  I'm a zombie.
[3:24:29.500 --> 3:24:30.500]  You're a zombie.
[3:24:30.500 --> 3:24:31.500]  You're a zombie.
[3:24:31.500 --> 3:24:33.940]  We're all zombies because subconscious programming controls 95% of our life.
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:35.900]  And most of us have been controlled by other people.
[3:24:35.900 --> 3:24:39.660]  So all they're doing with the metaverse is creating another layer of a simulation within
[3:24:39.660 --> 3:24:40.660]  the simulation.
[3:24:40.660 --> 3:24:41.660]  And they know we know that.
[3:24:41.660 --> 3:24:42.660]  That's the big hit movie.
[3:24:42.660 --> 3:24:43.660]  He's free guy.
[3:24:43.660 --> 3:24:45.820]  He's the finally guy that gets it.
[3:24:45.820 --> 3:24:49.660]  But they know we have that hunger, so they want us to think the system will give us that.
[3:24:49.660 --> 3:24:50.660]  Exactly.
[3:24:50.660 --> 3:24:53.380]  They want us to further entrap us into our simulation.
[3:24:53.380 --> 3:24:54.860]  So this is like the real free guy.
[3:24:54.860 --> 3:25:01.180]  I mean, if people are looking for free guy, how to break your player out of the metaverse,
[3:25:01.180 --> 3:25:02.780]  then that's what reset wars is.
[3:25:02.780 --> 3:25:06.740]  And I told Alex, you know, Alex just wants to do his show.
[3:25:06.740 --> 3:25:09.740]  In an ideal world, Alex wouldn't promote anything and he would just do his show.
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:14.740]  But I said, Alex, reset wars, this course is literally going to be the thing where people
[3:25:14.740 --> 3:25:16.260]  are going to walk up to you and cry.
[3:25:16.260 --> 3:25:18.460]  And they're going to be like, this changed my life.
[3:25:18.460 --> 3:25:19.700]  I quit drinking.
[3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:21.700]  I broke out of my debt slavery.
[3:25:21.700 --> 3:25:24.380]  You've already shown up to a bunch of people and have had huge success.
[3:25:24.380 --> 3:25:26.380]  I've had friends quit drinking from it.
[3:25:26.380 --> 3:25:30.180]  I've had a friend that's been watching you for 15 years saying he's watched thousands
[3:25:30.180 --> 3:25:33.460]  of episodes and it was literally the most powerful thing that he'd ever seen you put
[3:25:33.460 --> 3:25:37.980]  together because you never, you know the stuff, but you've never put it together.
[3:25:37.980 --> 3:25:41.620]  You helped me sit down for months and write it all down.
[3:25:41.620 --> 3:25:44.700]  We met in meeting after meeting after meeting to write this out.
[3:25:44.700 --> 3:25:45.700]  You made me do it.
[3:25:45.700 --> 3:25:46.700]  I appreciate that.
[3:25:46.700 --> 3:25:52.700]  And so I wanted to come on today just in honor of that because look, I was telling Alex,
[3:25:52.700 --> 3:26:00.220]  I'm like, info wars is tomorrow's news today, but reset wars is tomorrow's wisdom today.
[3:26:00.220 --> 3:26:05.940]  This is historically what tyrants always try to stop everybody from finding out.
[3:26:05.940 --> 3:26:11.300]  So you better believe that when they actually find out that they put reset wars together,
[3:26:11.300 --> 3:26:13.740]  there's a good chance that they're going to try to shut it down.
[3:26:13.740 --> 3:26:15.620]  They're going to try to shut the website down.
[3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:20.380]  That's why you got to go right now and sign up at reset wars.com.
[3:26:20.380 --> 3:26:22.300]  Alex has it coming out in early December.
[3:26:22.300 --> 3:26:23.620]  It's going to be massive.
[3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:25.700]  And then the, here's the exciting thing.
[3:26:25.700 --> 3:26:26.700]  We're all energy.
[3:26:26.700 --> 3:26:27.700]  We're all electromagnetic fields.
[3:26:27.700 --> 3:26:29.860]  We're all connected to higher consciousness.
[3:26:29.860 --> 3:26:32.460]  And we all tap into a collective unconsciousness.
[3:26:32.460 --> 3:26:36.620]  Once you wake up and you show how to break out of debt slavery, it's the hundredth monkey
[3:26:36.620 --> 3:26:37.620]  effect.
[3:26:37.620 --> 3:26:38.860]  It's the hundredth monkey effect.
[3:26:38.860 --> 3:26:42.780]  And so what happens is when you go, well, how do you have such a great life?
[3:26:42.780 --> 3:26:43.780]  How'd you do X, Y and Z?
[3:26:43.780 --> 3:26:45.340]  That's why there's so panic.
[3:26:45.340 --> 3:26:47.740]  We don't want to use this knowledge in slavery.
[3:26:47.740 --> 3:26:51.060]  We want to use this knowledge to empower you because we're selfish.
[3:26:51.060 --> 3:26:52.620]  We want to rise with you.
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:53.780]  These globalists are mentally ill.
[3:26:53.780 --> 3:26:57.180]  They want to suppress you so they're on top of a singing ship.
[3:26:57.180 --> 3:27:00.580]  No, we want to be on top of a rocket with you.
[3:27:00.580 --> 3:27:08.500]  And it's the, we are not going to win by just yelling about in front of a, in front of a
[3:27:08.500 --> 3:27:09.500]  building.
[3:27:09.500 --> 3:27:11.060]  No, no, the pilgrims had to leave the Netherlands.
[3:27:11.060 --> 3:27:12.500]  They had to build a new country.
[3:27:12.500 --> 3:27:13.500]  We've got to build the new thing.
[3:27:13.500 --> 3:27:14.500]  And this is it.
[3:27:14.500 --> 3:27:20.620]  And once everybody realizes one by one, we go, oh my gosh, consciousness creates reality.
[3:27:20.620 --> 3:27:22.380]  I've been programmed to believe I'm not that smart.
[3:27:22.380 --> 3:27:23.380]  I can't make money.
[3:27:23.380 --> 3:27:24.500]  I'm not that good at this.
[3:27:24.500 --> 3:27:28.100]  I've been programmed through an emotional pattern that's been memorizing my brain and
[3:27:28.100 --> 3:27:32.500]  nervous system that I have a tendency towards depression.
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:37.260]  Once we break out of that entire software system and re-engineer it, that's when it's
[3:27:37.260 --> 3:27:38.260]  game over.
[3:27:38.260 --> 3:27:39.260]  That's when the entire...
[3:27:39.260 --> 3:27:40.260]  Exactly.
[3:27:40.260 --> 3:27:41.260]  We have confidence in you folks.
[3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:42.260]  We believe in empowering you.
[3:27:42.260 --> 3:27:43.260]  And let's go back six months ago.
[3:27:43.260 --> 3:27:47.460]  When I really liked you, nor do you, you were, a lot of my family were listeners and fans.
[3:27:47.460 --> 3:27:53.780]  You were pitching me on a history course, maybe to do, or a cryptocurrency course or
[3:27:53.780 --> 3:27:54.780]  political course.
[3:27:54.780 --> 3:27:57.860]  And I said, no, I want to do spirit wars, mind wars.
[3:27:57.860 --> 3:28:00.340]  And I'm not taking credit away from you.
[3:28:00.340 --> 3:28:05.740]  But the, once we decided on that topic, you have been such an inspiration and more than
[3:28:05.740 --> 3:28:07.020]  half of what we put together.
[3:28:07.020 --> 3:28:08.020]  So Jake, great job.
[3:28:08.020 --> 3:28:11.940]  But it's just crazy that we had to argue about making the spirit wars, mind wars.
[3:28:11.940 --> 3:28:13.980]  And I was like, no, that's the first chapter.
[3:28:13.980 --> 3:28:15.300]  And now don't you see that's the key?
[3:28:15.300 --> 3:28:18.580]  Folks, I got to, I got to officially argue with Alex Jones.
[3:28:18.580 --> 3:28:19.580]  Who gets to say that?
[3:28:19.580 --> 3:28:20.580]  No, but reset.
[3:28:20.580 --> 3:28:21.580]  It does.
[3:28:21.580 --> 3:28:22.580]  I'm not that smart.
[3:28:22.580 --> 3:28:25.780]  The point is, the point is, is that we talked about a lot of things to help people.
[3:28:25.780 --> 3:28:26.780]  Let me say this.
[3:28:26.780 --> 3:28:29.180]  We got a lot of great, but if you don't get your mind free, you're done.
[3:28:29.180 --> 3:28:30.180]  Let me say this.
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:31.660]  So you call it reset wars.
[3:28:31.660 --> 3:28:33.620]  Go to the website right now and sign up.
[3:28:33.620 --> 3:28:35.620]  Please go to the website and sign up.
[3:28:35.620 --> 3:28:39.900]  I'll tell you this the most powerful thing because this is mind wars and spirit wars.
[3:28:39.900 --> 3:28:44.740]  Because the great reset is about a psychological and spiritual war.
[3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:47.860]  Psychological to brainwash you, spiritual to convince you you're a physical body, cut
[3:28:47.860 --> 3:28:49.300]  you off from God.
[3:28:49.300 --> 3:28:53.380]  Reset wars is a step by step playbook to find out and it's coming soon.
[3:28:53.380 --> 3:28:54.380]  resetwars.com.
[3:28:54.380 --> 3:29:01.460]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was the platform.
[3:29:01.460 --> 3:29:06.340]  Info wars was right above the target and the globalists were a year out from launching
[3:29:06.340 --> 3:29:07.340]  their attack.
[3:29:07.340 --> 3:29:13.340]  Three years later, an info wars is still thriving thanks to the support of our audience, but
[3:29:13.340 --> 3:29:19.420]  we are now facing the fiercest battle yet and we need you to help save info wars.
[3:29:19.420 --> 3:29:23.740]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than
[3:29:23.740 --> 3:29:26.820]  ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[3:29:26.820 --> 3:29:31.100]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial.
[3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:32.100]  We don't think so.
[3:29:32.100 --> 3:29:37.380]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A. but we won't
[3:29:37.380 --> 3:29:38.380]  let them.
[3:29:38.380 --> 3:29:42.620]  Alex Jones will have his day in court with your support.
[3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:49.580]  Go to saveinfowars.com now and give your donation to save the first amendment.
[3:29:49.580 --> 3:29:55.220]  Save info wars.com and God bless America.
[3:29:55.220 --> 3:30:01.580]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy
[3:30:01.580 --> 3:30:02.580]  pills.
[3:30:02.580 --> 3:30:08.620]  And look, almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[3:30:08.620 --> 3:30:13.580]  Horrible crashes and again, so many toxins on them.
[3:30:13.580 --> 3:30:20.420]  All of the new tropic products that we sell at infowars.com are clean, are pure, are highest
[3:30:20.420 --> 3:30:25.700]  quality and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[3:30:25.700 --> 3:30:30.020]  And right now our strongest product, the three tropics we have.
[3:30:30.020 --> 3:30:38.580]  Turbos Plus, our Enforce Ultra and Turboforce are back in stock at infowars.com.
[3:30:38.580 --> 3:30:41.820]  Turboforce has been sold out for more than six months.
[3:30:41.820 --> 3:30:44.660]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[3:30:44.660 --> 3:30:52.580]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash and it's available right
[3:30:52.580 --> 3:30:55.780]  now and it funds the Enfo War, a 360 win.
[3:30:55.780 --> 3:31:03.540]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[3:31:03.540 --> 3:31:08.780]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna
[3:31:08.780 --> 3:31:14.140]  and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies
[3:31:14.140 --> 3:31:19.260]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[3:31:19.260 --> 3:31:22.940]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting
[3:31:22.940 --> 3:31:27.020]  any circulation, it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find it on
[3:31:27.020 --> 3:31:29.300]  places like Instagram or Twitter, it's just crazy.
[3:31:29.300 --> 3:31:35.020]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't
[3:31:35.020 --> 3:31:39.740]  hurt anybody, your conspiracy theorists if you say it, it's just crazy.
[3:31:39.740 --> 3:31:43.020]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines
[3:31:43.020 --> 3:31:47.780]  are going to cause heart problems and they gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[3:31:47.780 --> 3:31:51.540]  That's why Enfo Wars is on air because if we weren't on air they'd get away with even
[3:31:51.540 --> 3:31:52.700]  more of this crap.
[3:31:52.700 --> 3:31:53.700]  This is just insane.
[3:31:53.700 --> 3:31:55.100]  These people are killers.
[3:31:55.100 --> 3:32:02.300]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[3:32:02.300 --> 3:32:08.460]  And look, almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[3:32:08.460 --> 3:32:13.500]  Horrible crashes and again so many toxins on them.
[3:32:13.500 --> 3:32:19.860]  All of the Neutropic products that we sell at EnfoWarsTour.com are clean, are pure, are
[3:32:19.860 --> 3:32:25.580]  highest quality and they're long lasting and they help focus your mind.
[3:32:25.580 --> 3:32:30.900]  And right now our strongest product, the three Neutrobics we have, Rain Force Plus, Rain
[3:32:30.900 --> 3:32:38.140]  Force Ultra and Turbo Force are back in stock at EnfoWarsTour.com.
[3:32:38.140 --> 3:32:41.700]  Turbo Force has been sold out for more than six months.
[3:32:41.700 --> 3:32:44.540]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[3:32:44.540 --> 3:32:52.420]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash and it's available right
[3:32:52.420 --> 3:33:18.460]  now at EnfoWarsTour.com.
[3:33:18.460 --> 3:33:24.540]  We're depressed, we're failed, we're fallen, we're racist, we're here telling you you're
[3:33:24.540 --> 3:33:29.340]  amazing made of the image of God and you've got to simply realize the programming and
[3:33:29.340 --> 3:33:30.340]  transcendence.
[3:33:30.340 --> 3:33:34.860]  So yeah, we're hammering the hell out of it because under pressure the great answers
[3:33:34.860 --> 3:33:35.860]  come.
[3:33:35.860 --> 3:33:40.900]  And I knew all this my whole life but never really consciously took it in so that's why
[3:33:40.900 --> 3:33:47.180]  Jake is so excited about this and hammering preset wars because we were there six months
[3:33:47.180 --> 3:33:51.300]  ago thinking how do we really help people, how do we do something positive, he's a big
[3:33:51.300 --> 3:33:55.900]  positive guy so he interviewed me and I said, hey, we ought to do something positive.
[3:33:55.900 --> 3:34:00.660]  We ought to went out to dinner, his dad came and visited some of his crew and I went on
[3:34:00.660 --> 3:34:03.660]  a show and I was like, you know, I really like what you do, I'm a failure with your
[3:34:03.660 --> 3:34:05.540]  work, a lot of my family are fans.
[3:34:05.540 --> 3:34:06.540]  What do we do that's positive?
[3:34:06.540 --> 3:34:14.700]  I'm like, well, let's do financial or let's do and we settled on mental reset wars, spiritual
[3:34:14.700 --> 3:34:17.980]  reset wars because that's the beginning of it all.
[3:34:17.980 --> 3:34:22.620]  And then we went, yeah, we had the same understanding was like was meant to happen, God was doing
[3:34:22.620 --> 3:34:23.620]  it and now here we are.
[3:34:23.620 --> 3:34:27.300]  Got a bunch of these documents to go over and a bunch of the evidence where they talk
[3:34:27.300 --> 3:34:32.500]  about how you've got your real self, how they program your subconscious to wall off your
[3:34:32.500 --> 3:34:35.260]  real self and create a new subconscious.
[3:34:35.260 --> 3:34:36.500]  They call that de-pattering.
[3:34:36.500 --> 3:34:38.140]  These are MK ultra documents.
[3:34:38.140 --> 3:34:43.300]  I mean, this, this because we've finished the course and then you're like, wait a minute,
[3:34:43.300 --> 3:34:48.220]  this is everything we independently were saying because they already know you can give it
[3:34:48.220 --> 3:34:53.060]  whatever name you want or label it, but, but every school of thought is just looking at
[3:34:53.060 --> 3:34:55.580]  what's actually going on and giving it its term.
[3:34:55.580 --> 3:34:56.580]  Yeah.
[3:34:56.580 --> 3:35:02.660]  I mean, none of this system operates, none of this slave system operates unless they
[3:35:02.660 --> 3:35:04.540]  keep people patterned.
[3:35:04.540 --> 3:35:09.500]  You can't have a debt based monetary system where 80 something percent of people live
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:12.740]  their entire life in credit card debt.
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:18.340]  Yes, you keep people from thinking they can ever wake up unless you keep people from realizing
[3:35:18.340 --> 3:35:22.180]  that they're actually more powerful that just like anything else.
[3:35:22.180 --> 3:35:26.740]  I remember when I was 16 years old and had my first couple jobs, I would get credit cards
[3:35:26.740 --> 3:35:27.740]  every month.
[3:35:27.740 --> 3:35:30.620]  As soon as I got credit and didn't want debt, never get them sent.
[3:35:30.620 --> 3:35:32.660]  They were like catching me early.
[3:35:32.660 --> 3:35:33.660]  Exactly.
[3:35:33.660 --> 3:35:34.660]  And it's not just that.
[3:35:34.660 --> 3:35:41.860]  It's every single area is designed to make us think we're just these little bodies and
[3:35:41.860 --> 3:35:46.300]  we're not capable that much and they control everything.
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:54.620]  And unless all of us realize that we have access to these higher levels of awareness
[3:35:54.620 --> 3:35:59.940]  and as you, as you talk about in the reset wars course, there's a term Alex uses in
[3:35:59.940 --> 3:36:03.260]  the course is called your emotional control grid.
[3:36:03.260 --> 3:36:08.020]  And the emotional control grid is when they literally trap us into a false identity.
[3:36:08.020 --> 3:36:12.260]  We attach to it through our nervous system over and over, so we memorize our own thoughts
[3:36:12.260 --> 3:36:13.740]  and feelings for so long.
[3:36:13.740 --> 3:36:15.980]  We think it's who we really are.
[3:36:15.980 --> 3:36:21.260]  We think our personality pattern is cutting us from our original program to the new program.
[3:36:21.260 --> 3:36:22.260]  Exactly.
[3:36:22.260 --> 3:36:27.420]  And they are you, you know, in the deep patterning in this MK ultra document, they talk about
[3:36:27.420 --> 3:36:32.440]  how they have people asleep for weeks on end and they're just filling them with millions
[3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:38.700]  of suggestions from, from affirmations, subliminals, putting them into hypnotic states and then
[3:36:38.700 --> 3:36:39.700]  they can later.
[3:36:39.700 --> 3:36:43.940]  That's the joke like in the movies, like code name cobra belly and you go out and kill
[3:36:43.940 --> 3:36:44.940]  somebody.
[3:36:44.940 --> 3:36:45.940]  That's because that was real.
[3:36:45.940 --> 3:36:49.060]  They were programming them with a term finally to wake up once that happened and do what
[3:36:49.060 --> 3:36:50.560]  they're told.
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:51.560]  Exactly.
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:57.420]  And once we realize we are all a part of MK ultra on a social level, whether it's fluoride
[3:36:57.420 --> 3:37:04.060]  in the water, whether it's the algorithms, whether it's keeping us in a fear state, every
[3:37:04.060 --> 3:37:08.700]  single thing is designed to put us in a hypnotic state.
[3:37:08.700 --> 3:37:13.820]  And that's why I say brainwash yourself before the world brain washes.
[3:37:13.820 --> 3:37:14.820]  That's right.
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:19.460]  So, so be aware of the programming, be aware of the systems, be calm about it, and trust
[3:37:19.460 --> 3:37:24.540]  God to guide you out of it and then just realize that this stuff exists and that's how you
[3:37:24.540 --> 3:37:25.540]  transcend it.
[3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:29.580]  And that's really what reset wars is and we go through examples and the history of it
[3:37:29.580 --> 3:37:30.900]  and how to do it.
[3:37:30.900 --> 3:37:37.580]  And you know, when Alex was, was filming this, you know, Alex is, Alex doesn't like to promote
[3:37:37.580 --> 3:37:41.900]  promote stuff, but I just think that reset war is the greatest thing you ever did.
[3:37:41.900 --> 3:37:46.620]  But one of the things that I found was really interesting and why I'm saying like you guys,
[3:37:46.620 --> 3:37:49.140]  your life is going to be changed literally by reset wars.
[3:37:49.140 --> 3:37:51.060]  You've never heard Alex talk like this.
[3:37:51.060 --> 3:37:56.540]  Go open, open a new tab right now, go to reset wars.com and sign up right now, literally
[3:37:56.540 --> 3:38:01.380]  right now, because you're going to find some amazing stuff and they're like, I had no idea
[3:38:01.380 --> 3:38:04.820]  that you were a kid starting your career.
[3:38:04.820 --> 3:38:08.700]  Now Alex Jones, obviously one of the most powerful broadcasters in the world, I had no
[3:38:08.700 --> 3:38:10.500]  idea you started in a closet.
[3:38:10.500 --> 3:38:16.660]  I had no idea that repeatedly the rug got pulled over you over and over and over again.
[3:38:16.660 --> 3:38:22.140]  And it just shows that if you understand the power of consciousness and you live from an
[3:38:22.140 --> 3:38:27.300]  inner vision, you can not only change your personal reality, but you might be able to
[3:38:27.300 --> 3:38:31.260]  never any, cause I was in line with God, no matter what they threw in front, I would just
[3:38:31.260 --> 3:38:32.980]  get stronger power through it.
[3:38:32.980 --> 3:38:35.340]  It would take a while, but I'll, it was, it was inextrable.
[3:38:35.340 --> 3:38:38.860]  It wasn't going to stop and talk about destiny.
[3:38:38.860 --> 3:38:45.180]  Talk about, because once you realize these, these systems that Alex breaks down and reset
[3:38:45.180 --> 3:38:49.860]  wars, you're going to find yourself, there's a quote by Patanjali and he says, once you're
[3:38:49.860 --> 3:38:55.340]  inspired by some great purpose, some or extraordinary bond, all your barriers break their limitations
[3:38:55.340 --> 3:38:59.340]  and you find yourself to be a more powerful person than you ever imagined.
[3:38:59.340 --> 3:39:01.380]  And let me break that down.
[3:39:01.380 --> 3:39:05.300]  It's like people think lightning comes from the ground up or the sky down.
[3:39:05.300 --> 3:39:07.420]  It's actually ground up.
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:08.660]  It's an electrical connection.
[3:39:08.660 --> 3:39:12.180]  Once you have will and you reach out towards God, God's free will.
[3:39:12.180 --> 3:39:15.500]  God doesn't strike you with the lightning of awakening without you reaching up.
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:17.500]  But once you start doing it, it starts happening.
[3:39:17.500 --> 3:39:23.180]  What I'm saying is once you reach out, pass what CNN tells you to do and forget them and
[3:39:23.180 --> 3:39:27.940]  their, you know, Jim Acosta and all that and, and, and Barack Obama and, and, and, and all
[3:39:27.940 --> 3:39:32.700]  these people, once you reach out to the universe to God, God's going to answer.
[3:39:32.700 --> 3:39:38.500]  And not just Barack Obama or CNN, think about the idea of this Newtonian model of physics
[3:39:38.500 --> 3:39:40.580]  that we're still so attached to.
[3:39:40.580 --> 3:39:44.780]  There's Newtonian model of physics is everything is physical in the universe and energies,
[3:39:44.780 --> 3:39:46.820]  this unexplainable side phenomena.
[3:39:46.820 --> 3:39:50.820]  Max Planck already showed us he won the Nobel Prize studying atoms and he said there's no
[3:39:50.820 --> 3:39:55.700]  matter as such that matter jumps back and forth under spectrometers into another dimension
[3:39:55.700 --> 3:39:56.700]  and back.
[3:39:56.700 --> 3:39:59.140]  It disappears and comes back and fluxes.
[3:39:59.140 --> 3:40:04.380]  And that's why what if people realize the secrets of quantum physics and how to harness
[3:40:04.380 --> 3:40:08.860]  the power of consciousness, if we already know the observer effect shows us that subatomic
[3:40:08.860 --> 3:40:13.820]  particles are sometimes particles and sometimes their waves, their energy that moves into
[3:40:13.820 --> 3:40:17.220]  another dimension and what's everything, it's made up of the same energy.
[3:40:17.220 --> 3:40:20.260]  So your bank account is an observer effect.
[3:40:20.260 --> 3:40:25.020]  Once thousands of people realize this and they all break out of debt servitude.
[3:40:25.020 --> 3:40:30.500]  Once thousands of people realize that they could change the, the, the, the health system,
[3:40:30.500 --> 3:40:34.900]  you can build private practices, you can change the education system, the tech system.
[3:40:34.900 --> 3:40:40.260]  Once people start using the power of consciousness to experiment on this reality and go, if all
[3:40:40.260 --> 3:40:45.860]  of energy is affected, all of reality is affected by subatomic particles that consciousness
[3:40:45.860 --> 3:40:47.140]  creates reality.
[3:40:47.140 --> 3:40:51.340]  I can de-pattern myself from the world, be transformed by the renewing of your mind and
[3:40:51.340 --> 3:40:55.700]  then I can use the power of consciousness to do thought experiments to start to recreate
[3:40:55.700 --> 3:40:56.700]  my life.
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:40:59.700]  And I think that's the next step that they don't want us to know.
[3:40:59.700 --> 3:41:05.260]  They don't want us to start to test the power of consciousness and say, uh, can I create
[3:41:05.260 --> 3:41:07.420]  this new business, this new movement?
[3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:08.980]  Can I change education system?
[3:41:08.980 --> 3:41:13.020]  Can I get out of debt and create my business bigger and better than ever before?
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:20.260]  And that's why I'm pounding the table saying go to resetwars.com right now is the key.
[3:41:20.260 --> 3:41:24.900]  If people go get resetwars when it comes out in just a few weeks, if they research it,
[3:41:24.900 --> 3:41:29.380]  if they put it in a function, it will change the world because this is what the global
[3:41:29.380 --> 3:41:33.260]  circles are aware of, but they're using it against you instead of you knowing how it
[3:41:33.260 --> 3:41:34.260]  really works.
[3:41:34.260 --> 3:41:36.420]  And it's, it's incredible.
[3:41:36.420 --> 3:41:43.020]  So real quick here, Alex, as we, as we come to the end of this segment, first of all,
[3:41:43.020 --> 3:41:46.100]  if you haven't yet, like I said, open up your browser and do this.
[3:41:46.100 --> 3:41:47.100]  You honestly will.
[3:41:47.100 --> 3:41:51.220]  No, I mean, you're right, Jake, we have to hype this up because this really is the key.
[3:41:51.220 --> 3:41:55.660]  People need to go to resetwars.com, put in your email so you hit, hit with the notifications
[3:41:55.660 --> 3:41:59.740]  first, the videos, reports, everything when it comes out, because if we don't make a big
[3:41:59.740 --> 3:42:01.780]  deal about this, nobody's going to care.
[3:42:01.780 --> 3:42:02.860]  This is a big deal.
[3:42:02.860 --> 3:42:06.980]  This is a serious weapon, but they want to arrest us while they want to put us in prison
[3:42:06.980 --> 3:42:09.580]  because they don't want you out of the prison.
[3:42:09.580 --> 3:42:12.500]  And they think, well, we'll just threaten you with jail if you don't shut up, but we're
[3:42:12.500 --> 3:42:13.500]  not shutting up.
[3:42:13.500 --> 3:42:15.060]  We're not going to join you globalists.
[3:42:15.060 --> 3:42:18.740]  We're going to stand against you because look, I've got a daughter.
[3:42:18.740 --> 3:42:20.540]  She's 16, 17 months old.
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:24.780]  I'm concerned about what everything's happening to, but just finding out the secrets of the
[3:42:24.780 --> 3:42:26.980]  pharmaceutical industry isn't going to save us.
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:30.860]  The next step to actually defeat the great reset is we have to realize we are energetic
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:33.020]  spiritual beings in a physical body.
[3:42:33.020 --> 3:42:37.380]  There's no such thing as death where the imagination of ourselves, we're already in a simulation,
[3:42:37.380 --> 3:42:39.860]  but we control that reality.
[3:42:39.860 --> 3:42:42.900]  And that's exactly what reset wars is showing.
[3:42:42.900 --> 3:42:43.900]  It's very simple.
[3:42:43.900 --> 3:42:46.420]  We are no longer NPCs.
[3:42:46.420 --> 3:42:49.420]  We are real players as Christ intended us to be.
[3:42:49.420 --> 3:42:50.420]  All right.
[3:42:50.420 --> 3:42:52.820]  Go to resetwars.com right now.
[3:42:52.820 --> 3:42:53.820]  Sign up.
[3:42:53.820 --> 3:42:58.540]  It's time to show them what info wars get prepared.

[3:43:57.140 --> 3:44:02.660]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:44:02.660 --> 3:44:08.340]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:44:08.340 --> 3:44:12.580]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:44:12.580 --> 3:44:17.700]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[3:44:17.700 --> 3:44:22.540]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[3:44:22.540 --> 3:44:26.980]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:31.860]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[3:44:31.860 --> 3:44:34.980]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:44:34.980 --> 3:44:38.340]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:44:38.340 --> 3:44:42.980]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[3:44:42.980 --> 3:44:43.980]  an end.
[3:44:43.980 --> 3:44:49.940]  So we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival

[3:45:57.940 --> 3:46:06.780]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[3:46:06.780 --> 3:46:11.980]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[3:46:11.980 --> 3:46:12.980]  in place.
[3:46:12.980 --> 3:46:18.460]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[3:46:18.460 --> 3:46:23.940]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[3:46:23.940 --> 3:46:26.860]  faces from the light of the sun.
[3:46:26.860 --> 3:46:35.020]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[3:46:35.020 --> 3:46:41.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[3:46:41.420 --> 3:46:42.420]  is upon us.
[3:46:42.420 --> 3:46:46.380]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[3:46:46.380 --> 3:46:49.180]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[3:46:49.180 --> 3:46:53.900]  Things only get worse from here if we submit, they only get better if we resist and say
[3:46:53.900 --> 3:46:54.900]  no.
[3:46:54.900 --> 3:46:59.060]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[3:46:59.060 --> 3:47:06.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:06.060 --> 3:47:16.380]  You know, folks, I could have sold out to the lovelace, I could have done so many deals
[3:47:16.380 --> 3:47:21.380]  with them to push their propaganda and made money, but you hear me foaming at the mouth
[3:47:21.380 --> 3:47:26.580]  promoting reset wars, it's because I know if you actually listen and watch and see what's
[3:47:26.580 --> 3:47:29.180]  going on, you'll understand that, and you've seen a prelude here today.
[3:47:29.180 --> 3:47:33.500]  This is the secrets of how it all works, and it's just really true that, like David Ike
[3:47:33.500 --> 3:47:38.580]  yesterday explained, we're like Russian dolls where there's our larger 12th dimension
[3:47:38.580 --> 3:47:43.940]  consciousness, 11th dimension, 10th dimension, 9th dimension, 8th dimension, 7th dimension,
[3:47:43.940 --> 3:47:48.020]  6th dimension, right down to where we are, and they're trying to suck us into a false
[3:47:48.020 --> 3:47:54.340]  silicon division that's like a subset of the 3rd dimension.
[3:47:54.340 --> 3:47:58.460]  I mean their whole thing is about, oh no, don't see that, don't be involved, and then
[3:47:58.460 --> 3:48:02.580]  I read white papers where they're admitting it, because they don't want humanity to get
[3:48:02.580 --> 3:48:07.020]  out of their control, I'm sorry, I want you out of control.
[3:48:07.020 --> 3:48:12.860]  And so Satan is attacking our free will, Christ said you must be born again, and you must
[3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:17.700]  be aware of how you operate and who you really are, and that you are eternal and connected
[3:48:17.700 --> 3:48:21.860]  to God to be born again, and so that's what reset wars is all about, and everything I've
[3:48:21.860 --> 3:48:26.060]  done is about freeing humanity, everything I've done is about fighting tyrants, everything
[3:48:26.060 --> 3:48:30.260]  I've done is about standing against them, but we only got like 10 minutes left here
[3:48:30.260 --> 3:48:35.020]  with Jake Ducey here, and so I want to continue here with some of these articles because there's
[3:48:35.020 --> 3:48:36.020]  so many and-
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:40.140]  This one's fascinating, Alex.
[3:48:40.140 --> 3:48:49.420]  So this is about beamed energy to affect human behavior, and it says quote, while initial
[3:48:49.420 --> 3:48:56.820]  attention should be toward degradation of human performance through thermal loading
[3:48:56.820 --> 3:48:59.020]  and electromagnetic field effects-
[3:48:59.020 --> 3:49:01.100]  That makes heat in the brain up.
[3:49:01.100 --> 3:49:04.660]  And electromagnetic field effects, remember, we are all just an electromagnetic field.
[3:49:04.660 --> 3:49:08.980]  All those documents you have on that are mainline declassified say they manipulate our electrical
[3:49:08.980 --> 3:49:09.980]  field.
[3:49:09.980 --> 3:49:15.300]  That's what it's saying right here, that this is a non-lethal energy weapon to directing
[3:49:15.300 --> 3:49:22.620]  and interrogating mental function using externally applied fields within the possibility of revolutionary
[3:49:22.620 --> 3:49:28.540]  capability to defend, and it goes on, it says, by using very low frequency electromagnetic
[3:49:28.540 --> 3:49:34.140]  radiation, the waves way below radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum, they found
[3:49:34.140 --> 3:49:38.940]  they could induce the brain to release behavior regulating chemicals, which is what you were
[3:49:38.940 --> 3:49:43.860]  talking about earlier, subduing the crowds with electromagnetic fields, and they could
[3:49:43.860 --> 3:49:46.220]  put people into a stupor.
[3:49:46.220 --> 3:49:52.500]  And it goes on to say that many of the non-lethal weapons under consideration utilize infrared
[3:49:52.500 --> 3:50:00.100]  sound and electromagnetic energy, including lasers, microwave, or radio frequency radiation
[3:50:00.100 --> 3:50:03.380]  or visible light pulsed at brainwave frequency.
[3:50:03.380 --> 3:50:05.540]  Welcome to the 5G world.
[3:50:05.540 --> 3:50:07.580]  It's not about controlling robots.
[3:50:07.580 --> 3:50:08.580]  That's a side issue.
[3:50:08.580 --> 3:50:11.700]  It's about controlling us.
[3:50:11.700 --> 3:50:16.300]  But if you're conscious in their own documents and are aware of it, it can actually make
[3:50:16.300 --> 3:50:20.500]  you get even more upset and outside their control.
[3:50:20.500 --> 3:50:23.580]  You want to submit to this or go along with us a question?
[3:50:23.580 --> 3:50:28.540]  And that's why this whole battle of the great reset is ultimately a battle of consciousness,
[3:50:28.540 --> 3:50:33.740]  and that's why Alex said, look, if we're going to do the first part of reset wars, it needs
[3:50:33.740 --> 3:50:37.220]  to be mind wars and spirit wars, because this is a mind war and a spirit war.
[3:50:37.220 --> 3:50:39.580]  It's an attack on your mind, which is what these are all about.
[3:50:39.580 --> 3:50:42.500]  You agree now, right? You've done a great job helping me research this.
[3:50:42.500 --> 3:50:44.180]  That was the best sports to do first.
[3:50:44.180 --> 3:50:45.660]  And I think it's the whole...
[3:50:45.660 --> 3:50:49.420]  Look, I was depressed for a while looking at everything that's happened, and especially
[3:50:49.420 --> 3:50:51.940]  having a baby and saying, we're screwed.
[3:50:51.940 --> 3:50:54.140]  And to be honest, I'm more optimistic than I ever was.
[3:50:54.140 --> 3:50:55.140]  I agree.
[3:50:55.140 --> 3:50:56.140]  It forced us.
[3:50:56.140 --> 3:50:57.140]  I was the same way.
[3:50:57.140 --> 3:50:58.140]  We're all together.
[3:50:58.140 --> 3:50:59.140]  Everyone's being forced into the answer.
[3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:02.220]  Because the left's like, oh, Jones claims right while we take over, he's been given
[3:51:02.220 --> 3:51:03.220]  the answer.
[3:51:03.220 --> 3:51:04.220]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[3:51:04.220 --> 3:51:07.380]  And it's like, these people are such gaslighters.
[3:51:07.380 --> 3:51:12.580]  Just as declassified documents, they talk about de-patterning somebody's mind to the
[3:51:12.580 --> 3:51:17.220]  extent where they were literally putting a new operating system into people's minds.
[3:51:17.220 --> 3:51:20.900]  They talk about electromagnetic frequency energy waves to influence...
[3:51:20.900 --> 3:51:22.900]  And we're saying what you said.
[3:51:22.900 --> 3:51:23.900]  God made us.
[3:51:23.900 --> 3:51:24.900]  We have free will.
[3:51:24.900 --> 3:51:26.340]  You're allowed to mind control yourself.
[3:51:26.340 --> 3:51:27.460]  You own your body.
[3:51:27.460 --> 3:51:28.620]  You own your soul.
[3:51:28.620 --> 3:51:29.620]  You have free will.
[3:51:29.620 --> 3:51:32.500]  Mind control yourself before somebody else does.
[3:51:32.500 --> 3:51:33.500]  Is that your quote?
[3:51:33.500 --> 3:51:34.500]  Yeah, brainwashed yourself.
[3:51:34.500 --> 3:51:38.380]  There's a teacher that says that, mind control yourself before somebody else does.
[3:51:38.380 --> 3:51:39.380]  Because that's true.
[3:51:39.380 --> 3:51:41.580]  Use your freaking free will before they do this.
[3:51:41.580 --> 3:51:42.740]  My God, that is...
[3:51:42.740 --> 3:51:44.780]  Jake, that is so powerful.
[3:51:44.780 --> 3:51:48.620]  I said, brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[3:51:48.620 --> 3:51:51.100]  And I thought I was awake.
[3:51:51.100 --> 3:51:53.780]  And then I realized, while I knew all this stuff...
[3:51:53.780 --> 3:51:56.140]  Wasn't it crazy how we tried to do research for this?
[3:51:56.140 --> 3:52:00.580]  And then it was like, was it going to be on a financial thing or like a survival video
[3:52:00.580 --> 3:52:01.820]  and it turned into this?
[3:52:01.820 --> 3:52:03.220]  That was the Holy Spirit.
[3:52:03.220 --> 3:52:04.220]  Yeah.
[3:52:04.220 --> 3:52:09.740]  Because look, the reason I'm so optimistic now is because this is the secret.
[3:52:09.740 --> 3:52:14.060]  It's not a coincidence that the Metaverse came out like right when we were about to
[3:52:14.060 --> 3:52:15.060]  publish this stuff.
[3:52:15.060 --> 3:52:19.700]  They don't want you to be renewed by the transforming of your mind.
[3:52:19.700 --> 3:52:21.820]  Yeah, you're not in his artificial reality.
[3:52:21.820 --> 3:52:23.140]  You make reality.
[3:52:23.140 --> 3:52:24.140]  Literally.
[3:52:24.140 --> 3:52:25.740]  We're already in a simulation.
[3:52:25.740 --> 3:52:29.060]  Once we understand, this is the most fascinating stuff of all.
[3:52:29.060 --> 3:52:33.380]  Once we understand we create reality, they do not control us.
[3:52:33.380 --> 3:52:38.140]  But the whole way this works is through predictive programming and unconscious collective hypnosis.
[3:52:38.140 --> 3:52:42.580]  Give us to surrender our free will, get us to feel helpless, and if subatomic particles
[3:52:42.580 --> 3:52:47.260]  that create all reality are influenced by consciousness, we are creating our own enslavement
[3:52:47.260 --> 3:52:48.260]  by saying, we're screwed.
[3:52:48.260 --> 3:52:49.260]  We can't do it.
[3:52:49.260 --> 3:52:50.540]  Klaus Schwab's controlling us.
[3:52:50.540 --> 3:52:52.820]  So that's why I'm saying, open up your browser.
[3:52:52.820 --> 3:52:53.820]  No, I agree.
[3:52:53.820 --> 3:52:57.140]  Don't just give, don't just give Klaus Schwab the power.
[3:52:57.140 --> 3:53:02.020]  Open up your browser to God and say, God, I want help surviving this and not just surviving
[3:53:02.020 --> 3:53:03.340]  but thriving during this.
[3:53:03.340 --> 3:53:04.540]  We didn't get to all these stacks.
[3:53:04.540 --> 3:53:05.540]  Hold on.
[3:53:05.540 --> 3:53:07.740]  I mean, well, this one's crazy right here.
[3:53:07.740 --> 3:53:11.780]  And I was going to say, open up your browser and go to resetwars.com, not it, but open
[3:53:11.780 --> 3:53:14.020]  up your browser and go to God might even be better.
[3:53:14.020 --> 3:53:15.460]  But check this one out.
[3:53:15.460 --> 3:53:25.420]  This is a US patent number 5159703, silent subliminal presentation system dated October
[3:53:25.420 --> 3:53:33.220]  27, 1992, quote, a silent communication system in which non-oral carriers in the very
[3:53:33.220 --> 3:53:40.380]  low or very high audio frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum.
[3:53:40.380 --> 3:53:48.380]  And it goes on to say that all of this is for the inducement into the brain typically
[3:53:48.380 --> 3:53:51.760]  through loudspeakers, earphones, on and on and on.
[3:53:51.760 --> 3:53:53.380]  What is this designed to do?
[3:53:53.380 --> 3:54:00.340]  It's literally designed, it says right here, using supercomputers to analyze human emotional
[3:54:00.340 --> 3:54:02.180]  EEG patterns.
[3:54:02.180 --> 3:54:09.060]  They're replicating human brain wave patterns so they can get direct access into the human
[3:54:09.060 --> 3:54:16.180]  electrical field by mirroring the same exact electromagnetic frequency patterns of the
[3:54:16.180 --> 3:54:17.340]  human brain.
[3:54:17.340 --> 3:54:21.100]  That's why even if you think you know what's going on, you watch info wars every day.
[3:54:21.100 --> 3:54:22.860]  We are still under mind control.
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:28.380]  And this is why I'm beating at the drum to open your web browser, go to resetwars.com,
[3:54:28.380 --> 3:54:30.900]  sign up right now because this is how we win.
[3:54:30.900 --> 3:54:34.380]  Well, this is literally how people break free and we're going to do this on air, we're going
[3:54:34.380 --> 3:54:35.380]  to break it down everywhere.
[3:54:35.380 --> 3:54:40.180]  But that's what this is and they admit with the fluctuations in the music, the concerts,
[3:54:40.180 --> 3:54:44.260]  it's all a test, try to put you in a trance and it feels really good when they're putting
[3:54:44.260 --> 3:54:47.940]  you in a trance, but folks, it is total control.
[3:54:47.940 --> 3:54:51.500]  You know, you're supposed to leave today and fly back to your family on Thanksgiving.
[3:54:51.500 --> 3:54:53.740]  We didn't get to the documents, Jake.
[3:54:53.740 --> 3:54:57.340]  Well, we have so many of them, I mean, it's could take us 15 hours.
[3:54:57.340 --> 3:55:01.220]  Yeah, but I mean, this is the admissions of what's crazy is they're in the news admitting
[3:55:01.220 --> 3:55:02.220]  it.
[3:55:02.220 --> 3:55:03.220]  Yeah, go.
[3:55:03.220 --> 3:55:07.700]  Why do you think they metaphysically admit they're doing all this to everybody?
[3:55:07.700 --> 3:55:15.900]  I think that there's something weird with black magic in that they leave the clues.
[3:55:15.900 --> 3:55:18.260]  The same thing they did with event 201, right?
[3:55:18.260 --> 3:55:22.940]  It's like they published event 201, Bill Gates goes on now and he says, beware of the next
[3:55:22.940 --> 3:55:30.580]  smallpox and or maybe it's their own stupidity and it's God making sure it's a rule.
[3:55:30.580 --> 3:55:34.300]  You have to publish when you're in demolish a building or take property, you got to publish
[3:55:34.300 --> 3:55:35.300]  it in the newspaper.
[3:55:35.300 --> 3:55:36.300]  It's a galactic rule.
[3:55:36.300 --> 3:55:39.500]  They've got to tell you what they're about to do.
[3:55:39.500 --> 3:55:44.420]  But the funny thing is, all it takes, they didn't think Alex would ever stop and put
[3:55:44.420 --> 3:55:45.980]  something like this together.
[3:55:45.980 --> 3:55:50.220]  They're just trying to attack them so much, they thought they'd attack us to keep us all
[3:55:50.220 --> 3:55:54.740]  balanced from where we were already going, they just made us get there quicker.
[3:55:54.740 --> 3:55:55.740]  Exactly.
[3:55:55.740 --> 3:55:57.300]  And I mean, this is what...
[3:55:57.300 --> 3:56:01.340]  Again, the reason I bring back to who's idea was, this isn't about your idea, my idea.
[3:56:01.340 --> 3:56:06.220]  We were literally doing other stuff and this just came out, it just, it was there.
[3:56:06.220 --> 3:56:08.740]  And that's why I feel so inspired.
[3:56:08.740 --> 3:56:13.580]  If you're watching this right now and you don't feel that optimistic, you feel angry,
[3:56:13.580 --> 3:56:19.140]  you feel afraid, you feel doubtful that we're going to win, just remember who you are.
[3:56:19.140 --> 3:56:23.020]  You're a spiritual being in a physical body, your body is a rental car.
[3:56:23.020 --> 3:56:26.260]  It's literally a rental car for your soul.
[3:56:26.260 --> 3:56:31.740]  Energy's never created or destroyed and when all of us start to wake up and you go to resetwars.com
[3:56:31.740 --> 3:56:36.740]  right now, open up your browser and sign up and we start being renewed by the transforming
[3:56:36.740 --> 3:56:42.860]  of our mind, we will realize we create reality, they do not control us and they cannot win.
[3:56:42.860 --> 3:56:49.020]  That's why we called it reset wars because this is the war and we are going to win because
[3:56:49.020 --> 3:56:51.100]  this is a battle of consciousness.
[3:56:51.100 --> 3:56:55.260]  Bill Gates, these individuals are very low level creatures of consciousness.
[3:56:55.260 --> 3:56:59.500]  They're totally disconnected from their spiritual self and that's why the whole psychological
[3:56:59.500 --> 3:57:04.380]  warfare is to trap you back into the emotional control grid, which is a term that Alex coined
[3:57:04.380 --> 3:57:06.940]  in the course, the emotional control grid.
[3:57:06.940 --> 3:57:12.580]  But they're, the thing they fear most is that we invite God, we invite spirit into our lives.
[3:57:12.580 --> 3:57:13.580]  That's right.
[3:57:13.580 --> 3:57:14.580]  All right.
[3:57:14.580 --> 3:57:20.700]  We're going to be breaking it all down a lot more in the future at resetwars.com.
[3:57:20.700 --> 3:57:22.140]  I was going to release it December 7th.
[3:57:22.140 --> 3:57:23.140]  They're trying to shut us down.
[3:57:23.140 --> 3:57:24.140]  When should we release this?
[3:57:24.140 --> 3:57:25.140]  What do you think?
[3:57:25.140 --> 3:57:27.460]  We got this coming out very, very, very soon.
[3:57:27.460 --> 3:57:31.980]  Look, I'm just as big of a fan of Infowars and Alex as you are.
[3:57:31.980 --> 3:57:34.620]  I have to say, this is the greatest thing he's ever created.
[3:57:34.620 --> 3:57:36.660]  It's coming sooner than you think.
[3:57:36.660 --> 3:57:38.100]  Open up your browser.
[3:57:38.100 --> 3:57:39.100]  Show Alex.
[3:57:39.100 --> 3:57:40.100]  I know you're excited.
[3:57:40.100 --> 3:57:41.100]  They are, they are.
[3:57:41.100 --> 3:57:45.220]  Whatever you do, share this information, war room coming up for a fraction.
[3:57:45.220 --> 3:57:46.620]  I know you're humble.
[3:57:46.620 --> 3:57:53.740]  I know you're like me, but I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the
[3:57:53.740 --> 3:57:59.620]  fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and Infowars over the years have
[3:57:59.620 --> 3:58:01.260]  changed the world in incredible ways.
[3:58:01.260 --> 3:58:10.500]  And now as 2021 prepares to end at 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that
[3:58:10.500 --> 3:58:14.660]  you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[3:58:14.660 --> 3:58:16.860]  The tip of the spear is band.billion.
[3:58:16.860 --> 3:58:21.140]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is infowars.com.
[3:58:21.140 --> 3:58:23.300]  And we can't stay on air without your support.
[3:58:23.300 --> 3:58:25.700]  So thank you all for your support.
[3:58:25.700 --> 3:58:30.620]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at saveinfowars.com.
[3:58:30.620 --> 3:58:31.620]  That's saveinfowars.com.
[3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:36.780]  I can tell you to go to infowarsstore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force sold
[3:58:36.780 --> 3:58:42.500]  out for months, 10 hours of energy, back in stock of free shipping, 40% off and so many
[3:58:42.500 --> 3:58:46.380]  other great products.
[3:58:46.380 --> 3:58:51.780]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[3:58:51.780 --> 3:58:53.180]  happening in the atmosphere.
[3:58:53.180 --> 3:58:57.140]  But if you look at all the different studies reports about my NASA and other governments
[3:58:57.140 --> 3:59:01.700]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the client.
[3:59:01.700 --> 3:59:07.260]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[3:59:07.260 --> 3:59:11.980]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[3:59:11.980 --> 3:59:15.340]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't
[3:59:15.340 --> 3:59:18.460]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[3:59:18.460 --> 3:59:24.380]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[3:59:24.380 --> 3:59:28.300]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:59:28.300 --> 3:59:29.300]  They have.
[3:59:29.300 --> 3:59:34.140]  They control trees from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very
[3:59:34.140 --> 3:59:35.140]  long time.
[3:59:35.140 --> 3:59:39.380]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[3:59:39.380 --> 3:59:42.100]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:59:42.100 --> 3:59:48.580]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[3:59:48.580 --> 3:59:59.660]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
