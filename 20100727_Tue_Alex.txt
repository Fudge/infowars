[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.040]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.040 --> 00:31.160]  jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is tuesday the 27th day of
[00:31.160 --> 00:39.160]  july 2010 this year is already getting along in the tooth we've got chuck bold
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.760]  one constitution party presidential candidate 2008 joining us to talk about
[00:44.760 --> 00:51.280]  his article dc declares war on the states coming up in the last 30 minutes
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.800]  of the broadcast today we're going to cover a ton of vitally important news
[00:56.800 --> 01:04.520]  as the acceleration towards war with iran and venezuela accelerates we're
[01:04.520 --> 01:09.120]  also going to get into the latest wiki leaks developments as we get more intel
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.320]  on that and also we had a caller yesterday in the middle of the second
[01:14.320 --> 01:20.160]  hour from texas who said he was at fort hood and to come back from iraq in the
[01:20.160 --> 01:24.480]  last few months and that while he was there they were training austin swat
[01:24.480 --> 01:31.960]  team commander and others in how to set up martial law checkpoints and search
[01:31.960 --> 01:38.520]  everybody's cars and to go door-to-door for basically gun confiscation now I
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.960]  noticed that had been posted to our youtube account within just a few hours
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.800]  of the show being over yesterday and that the commenters were saying that he
[01:46.800 --> 01:52.360]  was a liar so I knew that some police in the u.s. are being sent to iraq to be
[01:52.360 --> 01:56.120]  trained for this and covertly the military is illegally running checkpoints
[01:56.120 --> 01:59.400]  all over the country already that's even come out in the mainstream news and
[01:59.400 --> 02:02.880]  they've announced brigade homeland that they want to have 400,000 trips on the
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.600]  streets so we understand that whole backstory and of course this year we
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.120]  released the film police state for the rise of fema had made a police state
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.280]  film in nine years and this documentary breaks all of those developments that
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.120]  have happened since then so I believed the caller just because I was already
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.600]  where some of that was going on but I searched the term Austin police Iraq and
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.200]  I found a bunch of mainstream news articles including this one that we
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.480]  added to that youtube video little seven-minute clip with the caller it's an
[02:35.480 --> 02:42.720]  article brave at rifles train with APD and it talks about the Austin police
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.960]  and judges and others learning how the military basically takes over society
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.160]  and they spin it to say that the police are training the military but the bottom
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.840]  of the article they admit actually the military is training us and the the
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.240]  commander of the Austin SWAT team and the commander of the Austin intelligence
[03:01.240 --> 03:07.120]  police intelligence were sent to Baghdad they talk about it here so exactly who
[03:07.120 --> 03:10.440]  the caller said was there the head of the SWAT team and the head of
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.160]  intelligence they're right here with photographs their high-res photos you
[03:15.160 --> 03:21.840]  can blow it up and look at their faces at the Fort Hood Sentinel so it's real
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.800]  it's true everything the caller said documented okay in your face and even
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.440]  after we posted this article under the video the disinfo operatives are in that
[03:30.440 --> 03:39.920]  video you know soldier says Austin SWAT team training for checkpoints in US they
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.480]  are there saying it isn't true even though there's an article from mainstream
[03:43.480 --> 03:50.280]  news interviewing the SWAT team commander saying it so that is the spirit
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.200]  of denial that has infested this country and is bringing this country down
[03:54.200 --> 03:57.840]  we're in a depression they're getting ready for world war three publicly
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.440]  that's in the news today they're openly saying they're gonna censor and take
[04:02.440 --> 04:11.040]  over the internet the kill switch is now past the Senate committee and people
[04:11.040 --> 04:19.160]  are in denial so coming up in the next hour I'm gonna get into this Fort Hood
[04:19.160 --> 04:26.160]  situation and break that down but first I want to get into this Reuters

[08:20.120 --> 08:34.040]  thank you for joining us we are live 27th day of July 2010 let's go ahead and
[08:34.040 --> 08:39.560]  get into the top stories Ahmed denigide says he expects the US to attack
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.960]  midi soon he said this in a televised address Iran expects the United States
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.560]  to launch a military strike on at least two countries in the Middle East in the
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.760]  next three months Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejid told state-run
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.240]  press TV in an interview recorded on Monday Ahmed energy did not specify
[08:57.240 --> 09:00.840]  whether he thought Iran itself would be attacked nor did he say what
[09:00.840 --> 09:05.400]  intelligence led him to expect such a move well maybe it's the former CIA
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.960]  director Hayden saying that they're going to attack maybe it's the Israeli
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.840]  leader Benjamin Netanyahu coming out and saying that maybe it's the fact that
[09:15.840 --> 09:20.960]  that's been all over u.s. British and European newspapers in the last month
[09:20.960 --> 09:27.240]  and u.s. aircraft carriers and other fleets are massing and bunker busting
[09:27.240 --> 09:33.040]  weapons have been publicly moved into Diego Garcia maybe that's why Ahmed
[09:33.040 --> 09:36.480]  denigide thinks that and of course they're also massing troops in and
[09:36.480 --> 09:43.440]  around Venezuela the United States and Israel have refused to rule out military
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.600]  action against Iran's nuclear program that they fear could lead to it making a
[09:47.600 --> 09:53.400]  bomb something Iran denies continuing they have decided to attack at least two
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.600]  countries in the region in the next three months Ahmed energy said an excerpts
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.880]  broadcast on the Rolling News channel on Tuesday Israel which refuses to
[10:03.880 --> 10:07.480]  confirm or deny the existence of its own nuclear arsenal has a history of
[10:07.480 --> 10:11.800]  preemptive strikes against suspected nuclear targets and 81 destroyed Iraq's
[10:11.800 --> 10:17.720]  only nuclear reactor in 2007 bombed a suspected site in Syria Israeli Prime
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.080]  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran the
[10:22.080 --> 10:27.800]  ultimate terrorist threat his deputy Mozi Yilan has said Israel has improved
[10:27.800 --> 10:32.440]  military capability which could be used against its foes in Gaza Lebanon Syria or
[10:32.440 --> 10:41.000]  Iran so this is extremely serious what we're dealing with here let's get
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.040]  exactly what the state-run press TV had to say in their interview with the
[10:46.040 --> 10:53.560]  president of Iran headline US Cy war or psych war plan includes two hot wars or
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.440]  physical wars the Iranian president says the United States and Israel plan to
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.520]  attack two countries in the Middle East as part of a conspiracy to apply
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.080]  pressure on Iran we have precise information the Americans have devised
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.360]  a plot according to which they seek to launch a psychological war on Iran
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.480]  Ahmed energy stated an exclusive interview with press TV on Monday they
[11:11.480 --> 11:14.680]  plan to attack at least two countries in the region in the next three months he
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.760]  added he said the US seeks to achieve two main objectives with the scheme first
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.320]  of all they want to hamper Iran's progress and development since they are
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.160]  opposed to our growth and secondarily they want to save the Zionist regime
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.880]  because it has reached a dead end and the Zionist believe they can have the
[11:31.880 --> 11:37.040]  save through a military confrontation he went on to say he also advised US
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.840]  president Barack Obama not to follow the policies of George W. Bush in addition
[11:41.840 --> 11:45.040]  he warned Russian officials to avoid playing into the hands of Washington
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.520]  because that would go against their national interest commenting on the
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.960]  nuclear issue Ahmed energy said Iran will resume nuclear talks with the West in
[11:53.960 --> 11:57.680]  September adding that Iran wants Turkey Brazil to participate in the
[11:57.680 --> 12:05.120]  negotiations you notice everything is heating up and what did Wayne Madsen
[12:05.120 --> 12:07.880]  say here yesterday he thinks there's a good chance they're gonna strike in the
[12:07.880 --> 12:11.120]  next three months that's what Tarpoli saying that's basically what the
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.080]  White House has been alluding to and so right now they are preparing to strike
[12:16.080 --> 12:22.680]  Iran and the consequences of this run from bad to worse but here's Bloomberg's
[12:22.680 --> 12:28.520]  headline North Korea warns of nuclear response to naval exercises North
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.120]  Korea said it would counter US and South Korean joint naval exercise with
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.880]  nuclear deterrence after the Obama administration said that the government
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.200]  in a pion gang shouldn't take any provocative steps North Korea will
[12:40.200 --> 12:45.240]  quote legitimately counter their powerful nuclear deterrence the largest
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.240]  ever nuclear war exercise to be staged by the US and South Korea puppet forces
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.480]  the National Defense Council said according to North Korean Central News
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.760]  Agency the maneuvers which involve 20 vessels and 20 and 200 aircraft from the
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.080]  US and South Korea pose a threat to the country sovereignty and security
[13:02.080 --> 13:09.280]  Rai Tong ill an official with North Korea's delegation to the Asian Security
[13:09.280 --> 13:15.280]  Forum told reporters in Hanoi yesterday and it just goes on from there
[13:15.280 --> 13:22.520]  continuing along this line Hugo Chavez threatens to cut off oil to the United
[13:22.520 --> 13:30.480]  States in Columbia dispute because there are US forces massing in the
[13:30.480 --> 13:35.480]  surrounding areas and in the ocean off their coast Venezuelan president Hugo
[13:35.480 --> 13:39.800]  Chavez threatened to cut oil supplies the United States in case of a military
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.560]  attack from Columbia as the dispute escalated over charges his country
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.040]  harbors Colombian rebels a vocal and frequent critic of the United States
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.640]  Chavez broke off diplomatic relations with Columbia last week over the claims
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.880]  by the outgoing government of president Alvaro Ubre a close ally the United
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.840]  States if there was an armed aggression against Venezuela Chavez said from
[14:04.840 --> 14:12.080]  Colombian territory or from elsewhere promoted by the Yankee Empire we would
[14:12.080 --> 14:16.760]  suspend oil shipments the United States even if we have to eat stones here he
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.720]  said we would not send a drop more they supply about 25% of our oil to US
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.920]  refineries he said to a roar of approval from thousands of supporters at a
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.400]  rally for a socialist party meanwhile the new British Prime Minister calls the
[14:32.400 --> 14:38.120]  Gaza strip a prison camp and that's gotten angry responses from Israel
[14:38.120 --> 14:43.760]  speaking of oil BP oil spill cleanup crews can't find crude in the gulf as
[14:43.760 --> 14:49.520]  the size of the switch shrinks experts say oil is breaking up staying below the
[14:49.520 --> 14:55.200]  surface well I mean why is it breaking up why is it staying below the surface
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.560]  because they sprayed 40 plus million gallons of different dispersants like
[14:59.560 --> 15:07.160]  core exit on it and all of the experts have said this is much worse than just
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.920]  letting the oil float around even come into shore because it's releasing the
[15:10.920 --> 15:14.840]  methane from the oil it's sending in underwater it's causing even more
[15:14.840 --> 15:22.760]  devastation to the Gulf ecosystem and it is creating giant dead zones so that's
[15:22.760 --> 15:27.840]  the news on that front and it's clear now it's all over the news reported this
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.680]  week and a half ago that there are giant oil leaks in and around in a
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.080]  several mile area of the original well that they claim they capped a week and
[15:38.080 --> 15:44.120]  a half ago and that it simply caused other ruptures deeper down in the
[15:44.120 --> 15:48.280]  ground beneath the surface and that it's coming out in other areas and so
[15:48.280 --> 15:52.400]  there's a big cover up there with the government BP trying to claim that
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.240]  everything is fixed and that that's other oil wells nearby that are leaking
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.480]  massive amounts of oil though there are no oil wells in that two mile area where
[16:00.480 --> 16:08.760]  there are multiple fishers leaking I'm gonna get more into what this means
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.840]  having the war drums being beaten louder and louder with more intensity the
[16:13.840 --> 16:19.120]  sabers not just being rattled but clearly out of their scabbards with Iran
[16:19.120 --> 16:26.280]  with Venezuela with Syria Lebanon and other areas and why the globalist are
[16:26.280 --> 16:29.700]  wanting to move towards war and it's not because they want to stop Iran from
[16:29.700 --> 16:33.360]  supposedly getting a nuclear weapon the CIA admits they're nowhere near getting
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.520]  it they even tried to have Western countries like France and Turkey and
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.120]  then even Brazil to take all their uranium under UN inspection and refine
[16:42.120 --> 16:45.360]  it to a level nowhere near what they need for weapons because they do want
[16:45.360 --> 16:48.080]  to have their own power supply people then say well they have lots of oil they
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.920]  only have half the refining capacity roughly they need an import about half
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.920]  their gasoline and diesel and that's on record and the West wants to have war
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.920]  with them five years ago they had a soft line leader and the UN had said that no
[17:00.920 --> 17:04.640]  one had ever allowed inspections to this level they totally rolled over and then
[17:04.640 --> 17:08.560]  the West said well now you can't even have peaceful reactors and so the then a
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.200]  hardliner augment energy got put into power I mean I mean that's the facts and
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.400]  well I'm gonna cover it coming up at the bottom of the hour I want to get to
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.880]  some other important news before then and I also want to open the phones up 1
[17:22.880 --> 17:30.400]  800 2 5 9 92 31 wide open phones and I would hope that you would want to at
[17:30.400 --> 17:36.080]  least comment on any of the stories that I have raised here today 1 800 2 5 9
[17:36.080 --> 17:44.800]  92 31 coming up later in the next hour I want to get into a caller to the show
[17:44.800 --> 17:50.120]  yesterday and that short seven-minute discussion is posted at the young Jones
[17:50.120 --> 17:59.000]  channel on YouTube also the entire show at prisonplanet.tv but he called in and
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.540]  said I was in Iraq I just came back and the last few months and there were
[18:03.540 --> 18:07.720]  Austin SWAT team there training for basically martial law that was his
[18:07.720 --> 18:11.840]  words and for setting up checkpoints searching everybody's cars and doing
[18:11.840 --> 18:17.440]  door-to-door gun confiscation and about a third of the commenters or so were
[18:17.440 --> 18:24.520]  saying he was a liar well I did a simple search engine search of Austin police
[18:24.520 --> 18:30.480]  Iraq or Austin SWAT Iraq and found a bunch of mainstream news articles the
[18:30.480 --> 18:35.760]  first link is the Fort Hood Sentinel from March 11th and it said that the
[18:35.760 --> 18:43.200]  Austin SWAT team commander and others had just returned from Iraq so and it's
[18:43.200 --> 18:49.680]  got photos of them so that's the main newspaper at Fort Hood and in the
[18:49.680 --> 18:54.980]  surrounding area they're in Colleen so you it's a fact okay SWAT teams
[18:54.980 --> 19:00.120]  interviewed it's real okay just like I get emails all the time and oh you're
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.560]  lying about Marines running checkpoints and I don't even bother to send them
[19:04.560 --> 19:08.640]  articles out of Tennessee mainstream news or articles out of California
[19:08.640 --> 19:12.520]  mainstream news or articles out of Kentucky or Alabama with them at
[19:12.520 --> 19:16.520]  checkpoint searching people photos in the newspaper newscast showing it
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.740]  because they don't want to know they're they want us and most of mark government
[19:20.740 --> 19:25.040]  agents that's what's sad they're just citizens who've got their heads so deep
[19:25.040 --> 19:30.720]  in the sand that they may never pull them out but you know what we don't need
[19:30.720 --> 19:37.800]  those timid souls who want to live in denial and believe the lie what we need
[19:37.800 --> 19:42.480]  is people who will face the facts and understand history and look at what's
[19:42.480 --> 19:45.440]  happening to us I want to come back and give you the latest developments
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.320]  dealing with wiki leaks the picture is really coming into clear focus now of

[24:22.760 --> 24:30.640]  a.m. has run a story about defense can't account for 8.7 billion this is a
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.080]  complete whitewash I just search engine the term 2.3 trillion missing that's 2
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.440]  trillion 300 billion and pulled up CBS Associated Press and others from
[24:42.440 --> 24:53.280]  September 10th 2001 now by hearings in 2004 that we posted clips of from C
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.320]  span and played here on air it was over four trillion missing and we have
[24:57.320 --> 25:03.080]  clips of Rumsfeld saying I won't tell you where it went we don't know that was
[25:03.080 --> 25:08.760]  in those famous exchanges with former congresswoman Cynthia McKinney I'm
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.840]  surprised she's still breathing she has a lot of courage I may disagree with her
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.760]  on a lot of issues but I admire her courage so that is coming up in the
[25:16.760 --> 25:22.800]  next segment I've really had some time to research WikiLeaks over the last year
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.320]  or so and I think they've done good work releasing the footage from three years
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.280]  ago of the gunships the apaches killing Reuters reporters and shooting children
[25:33.280 --> 25:40.040]  and laughing about it they have indicted the army private who they think leak
[25:40.040 --> 25:46.160]  that information and that concerns me about how they protect their sources
[25:46.280 --> 25:52.200]  they have released 92,000 documents overnight 2,000 documents this time
[25:52.200 --> 25:57.480]  they gave it to their spiegel the Guardian in the New York Times it's the
[25:57.480 --> 26:04.360]  biggest news story of the week and the media is spinning it instead of talking
[26:04.360 --> 26:09.640]  about what's in the documents the media is talking about should the documents
[26:09.640 --> 26:12.560]  have been released that's how they're how they're spinning this but but I'm
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.560]  more concerned about what the media is focusing in on in these documents now
[26:17.560 --> 26:22.480]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is saying more revelations are to come
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.760]  also blowing site WikiLeaks says it has a backlog of further secret material
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.480]  after publication of Afghanistan war logs now exactly what our guest said
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.640]  yesterday both John Young and Wayne Madsen they said this is not really top
[26:37.640 --> 26:42.960]  secret this is it best secret these are mid-level battlefield communiques
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.640]  being sent by mid-level army officers to the State Department the CIA as well as
[26:49.640 --> 26:54.840]  the Defense Department and these are famously filled with propaganda fake
[26:54.840 --> 27:01.640]  body counts fake atrocity reports about the enemy and government loves to have
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.080]  these reports then call through them decide what they're going to leak to a
[27:05.080 --> 27:11.320]  source like Assange who may be a good guy probably is and then the media can
[27:11.320 --> 27:15.080]  focus in on what they want to to paint a picture and they've done that they're
[27:15.080 --> 27:19.400]  saying Pakistan's working with the Taliban but Steve Watson's has written
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.040]  detailed reports so is Curtin Emo both at prison planet dot com and info wars
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.040]  dot com they posted last night two different reports going over the
[27:26.040 --> 27:31.400]  history of it being on record that the CIA and Defense Department since 79 and
[27:31.400 --> 27:35.640]  right through to today have been funding Pakistani ISI they're trying to blame
[27:35.640 --> 27:41.800]  General Hameed ghoul right now by the way contacted us two years ago and gave
[27:41.800 --> 27:49.760]  us an exclusive interview that was bizarre from Islamabad in Pakistan and
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.400]  he at the time on my show said I'm coming out because I'm not going to be
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.520]  blamed for the attack on Mumbai this was the CIA Mossad and British
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.840]  intelligence and what came out in the Chicago Tribune a few months ago and
[28:02.840 --> 28:10.400]  other papers headline US government agent was a leader of Mumbai attack
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.360]  well that's what the head of Indian intelligence said the day of the attack
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.280]  while it was going on he told the press I've got to go in there and you know run
[28:20.280 --> 28:25.520]  my commando raid against these people but they've infiltrated Indian
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.720]  intelligence and this is a Western operation and by the way he was not a
[28:30.720 --> 28:34.440]  Muslim believe it he was a Hindu from memory but you go look it up so he
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.800]  wasn't like some Muslim you're lying and he was killed that day you notice the
[28:39.800 --> 28:45.080]  head of Indian intelligence led the the raids against him and he was killed
[28:45.080 --> 28:49.760]  remember Mumbai them attacking the shopping mall and it was guys running
[28:49.760 --> 28:53.200]  around out of their minds I saw a video of them and they look like they were
[28:53.200 --> 28:57.480]  completely insane and they weren't wearing turbans they didn't have beards
[28:57.480 --> 29:00.680]  and I said they looked like they were on drugs and then it came out in the
[29:00.680 --> 29:05.680]  Associated Press they were on LSD PCP peyote and other drugs they just shot
[29:05.680 --> 29:11.120]  some lunatics up sent them out commandos from a Western intelligence
[29:11.120 --> 29:14.360]  operation through a bunch of hand grenades and shots and people then
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.920]  changed clothes and disappeared and they grabbed one lunatic hopped up on drugs
[29:18.920 --> 29:23.560]  who'd clearly been dumped out of a mind control operation the point is it came
[29:23.560 --> 29:28.480]  out that was true this is what the globalists do they go shoot up a school
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.480]  or a church or a shopping mall they kill a few of the supposed people they're
[29:32.480 --> 29:37.440]  gonna blame they usually hang one patchy out to dry like Lee Harvey Oswald or
[29:37.440 --> 29:42.920]  Tim McVeigh and I mean it came out this was the case but we'll continue with
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.280]  WikiLeaks then I'll get into the missing trillions not the missing 8.7
[29:47.280 --> 29:52.400]  billion that's a whitewash red herring stay with us we're on the March the

[33:06.480 --> 33:08.920]  network
[33:14.480 --> 33:19.720]  I'm going to continue getting into the latest developments with wiki leaks and
[33:19.720 --> 33:24.880]  when I think surely going on here from a historical perspective and I do smell
[33:24.880 --> 33:30.480]  something rotten in the state of wiki leaks that doesn't mean the people
[33:30.480 --> 33:34.760]  involved in it are bad but they're clearly being used that's evident bare
[33:34.760 --> 33:39.480]  minimum the system is spinning the information that was released and it
[33:39.480 --> 33:45.520]  appears to be disinfo being fed out to them but that's coming up in a moment
[33:45.520 --> 33:50.080]  then I'm going to get into the situation with the trillions and trillions that
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.360]  have been stolen by the Pentagon and their contractors on record you won't be
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.400]  hearing this from Alex Jones you'll hear it from Donald Rumsfeld coming up
[33:58.400 --> 34:02.120]  here in a few minutes and this is one of the big forgotten stories that has
[34:02.120 --> 34:07.440]  just reared its head again one of the top links on drudge today is defense can
[34:07.440 --> 34:14.640]  account for 8.7 billion well I'm gonna have Kurt or Steve Watson write an
[34:14.640 --> 34:17.920]  article about this and hopefully drudge a link to it saying it's trillions that
[34:17.920 --> 34:25.440]  are missing not just 8.7 billion and break down the history of that and just
[34:25.440 --> 34:30.240]  how corrupt this is some of the worst corporate welfare that we have in this
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.400]  nation what's bankrupting this country not just the banks that own the
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.320]  military industrial complex with their derivatives but also the trillions and
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.560]  trillions spent every year on budget the trillions stolen every year off budget
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.520]  and how they do that and how the military industrial complex has taken our
[34:48.520 --> 34:51.520]  society over and of course that was president Eisenhower that warned us
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.120]  about that but what doesn't get as much attention is in his 45 minutes farewell
[34:56.120 --> 35:05.680]  address speech in January 17th 1961 is where he talks about a technocratic
[35:05.680 --> 35:12.560]  technological elite taking over society so that is coming up as well but before
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.240]  I go any further we're gonna get rid of this special by next Monday so I would
[35:17.240 --> 35:20.760]  encourage you to take advantage of it you really want a tool to wake people up
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.480]  you know the Obama deception has been censored quite a bit and they've
[35:24.480 --> 35:27.680]  attempted to keep the public from seeing it you can get four copies of the
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.400]  Obama deception for 1995 so that's a little less than $5 a piece until next
[35:33.400 --> 35:37.400]  Monday we're gonna take it down off of the shopping cart next Monday and of
[35:37.400 --> 35:40.720]  course part two of it is fall of the Republic we have big discounts on the
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.240]  films they have a lot of other combos and specials where you buy a t-shirt and
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.240]  you get a ball cap free or you buy one film with another film for you get

[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  the last year it doubled the year before that so it's more than exponential but

[37:31.000 --> 37:35.560]  also some other persecution we've been going through that's very intense but
[37:35.560 --> 37:39.640]  I've not decided whether I want to go public with it at this time but it's
[37:39.640 --> 37:44.280]  extremely expensive and time-consuming and I'm not going to let anything get in
[37:44.280 --> 37:49.200]  the way of our mission so I'm deciding whether to go completely ape and
[37:49.200 --> 37:54.440]  publicly expose how we're being persecuted or whether that'll be used as
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.960]  a distraction it's been linked directly to Obama and Michelle Obama and I'll
[37:58.960 --> 38:04.280]  tell you in the shower this morning I actually started shaking and it it wasn't
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.040]  a shaking of fear it was it was shaking and trembling of my nervous system my
[38:09.040 --> 38:14.760]  brain recognizing that this is only the beginning of the persecution and the
[38:14.760 --> 38:20.200]  beginning of what I've got to go through and it's a sign of our success and I
[38:20.200 --> 38:29.160]  thank God for it but I'm just gonna leave it at that I I I'm having to in the
[38:29.160 --> 38:37.560]  last week really cogitate and and and think about this and I'll make my
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.080]  decision by next week I have a tendency to procrastinate because I'm doing so
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.840]  many other projects just like I've been procrastinating about even doing you
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.360]  know the tour of the new studio I just I can't and I'm not complaining I just
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.080]  can't do it all there's so many special emergency videos I want to put out
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.000]  there's a film I'm trying to make that is just so time-consuming because I won't
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.080]  put out crud and I just you know that whole saying I wish I wish I could give
[39:04.080 --> 39:08.320]  more I I'm not complaining I'm complaining about myself I just can't do
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.680]  it all and I'm weak and I was thinking about how weak my flesh is this morning
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.560]  and and and how I'm trying to be more professional and more focused and more
[39:17.560 --> 39:23.080]  serious and and we're all human you know none of us are perfect but it's just
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.320]  really hit me how real all of this is and and I've always known it's real but
[39:27.320 --> 39:31.040]  it's it's one thing to know it intellectually it's another thing to
[39:31.040 --> 39:36.200]  experience it and to experience the death threats and the Cointel pro and the
[39:36.200 --> 39:42.440]  media attacks and the lies and the dirty tricks and the other things and to
[39:42.440 --> 39:46.600]  know I'm on the White House enemies list a year ago that's been in the news
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.800]  when I'm number 13 to know I'm on the ADL Southern Prairie Law Center enemies
[39:52.800 --> 40:00.880]  list and to know that we're right about all of this I mean we understand what's
[40:00.880 --> 40:06.400]  happened I wish every day I was wrong I wish every day but then when I hear my
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.640]  show rebroadcast or I watch a video we've made it I get mad at myself because
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.280]  it's worse than what I can even present I cannot the whole spectrum of society
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.920]  and life and government and corporations and the new evils and and
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.880]  corruptions that are invented by these people as my knowledge grows I realize
[40:24.880 --> 40:33.320]  how fathomless how how deep these chasms or these bottomless pits of wickedness
[40:33.320 --> 40:46.840]  are that I guess the overwhelming thought what's in my spirit is why does it
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.960]  have to be this way why why can't I wake up more police and military why aren't I
[40:52.960 --> 40:56.920]  effective enough why why if I can see the truth and know it and have studied
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.520]  history and have all the government documents admitting to all of this and
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.280]  all the lies and corruption that have been proven and we know where this road
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.640]  leads we know where tyranny goes we know this is tyranny and it's so horrible
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.000]  for all of us and they get all these government and corporate minions who
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.440]  are compartmentalized and on power trips and feel like they're part of the
[41:18.440 --> 41:24.960]  winning team to just do things that are fundamentally wrong and fundamentally
[41:24.960 --> 41:30.840]  corrupt and fundamentally toxic but I've always likened it to cancer cells
[41:30.840 --> 41:47.280]  if cancer was conscious not saying it is but but if malfunctioning cells we're
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.760]  conscious they would look at you know I've spread from the liver I've spread
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.280]  to the kidneys I've spread to the spinal cord I've spread to the blood I've
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.280]  spread to the brain I've spread to the lungs I've spread to the bone marrow I've
[41:59.280 --> 42:07.440]  spread to the skin I've spread to the the intestines the stomach and boy I'm
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.240]  winning man I'm doing a great job look nothing can stop us we we because you
[42:12.240 --> 42:16.280]  break the rules because you're ruthless because you're corrupt because you're
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.720]  not following God's code you're not following common sense you're not
[42:20.720 --> 42:27.440]  following goodness you think it's tough to be wicked you're in a form of arrested
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.920]  development you're childlike so many of these evil people are wicked and have a
[42:32.920 --> 42:38.240]  taste for blood and oppression and dominance but at the same time they're
[42:38.240 --> 42:43.720]  very they're very arrested and if they could see what I see if they could know
[42:43.720 --> 42:50.960]  history if they could have experienced if if I could somehow reach out to them
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.640]  through all their programming and brainwashing we could turn the tide
[42:54.640 --> 43:11.560]  against this and I look how far we've come I look how far we've come and I know
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.280]  that we can defeat this and also know that the Bible has been manipulated the
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.080]  way it's interpreted and that everybody's been taught going back hundreds of
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.520]  years to lay down to corrupt empires to lay down to corrupt armies to lay down
[43:25.520 --> 43:29.480]  to corrupt governments thinking it's the end of the world and it's God's will
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.440]  when the Bible clearly states it's God's will that whether you're gonna lose
[43:33.440 --> 43:40.680]  win or draw you are being tested in this one life to live in this earth suit that
[43:40.680 --> 43:46.400]  we all inhabit that our spirits inhabit we are being tested and that it doesn't
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.000]  matter whether we even have a chance of winning which we do that we've got to
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.800]  stand up to evil and it's like Jonah going to Nineveh and Nineveh getting a
[43:55.800 --> 44:02.000]  hundred year per reprieve the only way evil is allowed to get away with what
[44:02.000 --> 44:09.000]  it's doing and to spread like a cancer is by you being disempowered and sitting
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.480]  on the bench and not being the empowered incredible creature you are
[44:13.480 --> 44:20.120]  living on a gorgeous planet that is just a total blessing infused with the life
[44:20.120 --> 44:26.920]  force of the universe given to it by the creator I mean what is there outside the
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.480]  universe what made life what created the planets and the solar system and the
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.520]  galaxies and black holes what is there I mean if you if you don't realize that
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.520]  there is something larger than just this narrow perception that we're able to see
[44:42.520 --> 44:52.520]  smell and touch and taste you're blind spiritually blind and I don't want you
[44:52.520 --> 44:57.880]  to be blind I have empathy for dumbed-down brainwashed SWAT team people
[44:57.880 --> 45:02.920]  that are being bathed in evil and and being twisted to the dark side I have
[45:02.920 --> 45:09.360]  empathy for the unconscious people serving the New World Order for the
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.000]  bureaucrats for the school teachers for all of them they've all been given a
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.040]  false download a false template of why they're doing what they're doing they've
[45:17.040 --> 45:20.040]  all been given cover stories for what they're doing and they just willfully
[45:20.040 --> 45:26.840]  accept whatever they're told I don't want you to be destroyed I don't want
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.480]  your intellect to be destroyed and and and and and program with lies I don't
[45:31.480 --> 45:38.640]  want you to lose your destiny I don't want you to lose knowing the truth and
[45:38.640 --> 45:43.480]  being empowered I don't want you to lose your soul the globalists believe
[45:43.480 --> 45:55.840]  they traffic in your soul they believe in the occult they are occultist you know
[45:55.840 --> 46:00.960]  what success means for me though success means greater danger success means
[46:00.960 --> 46:11.600]  greater responsibility and this morning in the shower it was a shudder went
[46:11.600 --> 46:18.520]  through me it was I just felt it at a spiritual level passing another
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.960]  threshold another line you know that message my psyche telling me if you
[46:24.960 --> 46:30.760]  don't pull out now if you don't stop now if you don't drift off into the
[46:30.760 --> 46:38.000]  sunset now you are entering a whole other level of danger you are having an
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.360]  effect you have extreme power like all of you have I'm here to have you
[46:44.360 --> 46:53.840]  recognize the power you've got innate in you through God and this happens every
[46:53.840 --> 47:00.120]  few years I feel it myself pass another threshold another circle that I've gone
[47:00.120 --> 47:10.120]  through closer to the top of the pyramid in realization and understanding and it
[47:10.120 --> 47:16.120]  makes me shudder for the responsibility it makes me shudder for the danger not
[47:16.120 --> 47:21.120]  just to myself but to my little ones and my wife and of course I made the
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.680]  conscious and spiritual decision to not grudgingly step across that next line
[47:26.680 --> 47:32.400]  that next threshold but to do it with all my will and supplication before the
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.600]  creator of the universe and I simply said to God in that shower a few hours
[47:36.600 --> 47:43.240]  ago I said God I am weak and I am a sinner and I am I am dirty rags and you
[47:43.240 --> 47:49.960]  know it but if this is your will empower me to do what I have to do and
[47:49.960 --> 47:55.840]  wherever the road leads I am ready as God was telling me then you are probably
[47:55.840 --> 48:01.720]  going to be killed is this what you want is this what you want and I say yes I
[48:01.720 --> 48:08.960]  say yes I am committed I am going all the way I will not serve evil I will not
[48:08.960 --> 48:14.560]  go along I will not in be involved in half measures I will stand up for the
[48:14.560 --> 48:21.040]  weak and the innocent that are being enslaved and destroyed but all I ask is
[48:21.040 --> 48:27.960]  God to help remove the thorn in my side the flesh to take as much of it away as
[48:27.960 --> 48:37.680]  God can because the evil Alex Jones cannot go down this road and every one
[48:37.680 --> 48:43.960]  of you is evil too and you know it and the first step towards sanctification
[48:43.960 --> 48:50.800]  is admitting that you are evil and that you have problems and that you are sick
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.080]  because if you can't recognize the bad in yourself you're not going to
[48:55.080 --> 48:58.600]  recognize the good and reach for it and I didn't mean to start preaching here
[48:58.600 --> 49:07.920]  today but we are on the verge of World War 3 we are on the verge of a total
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.520]  collapsed oppression and if we stand up and speak out and get our head screwed
[49:12.520 --> 49:17.480]  on straight and face the facts of what we are in we have a chance at a reprieve
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.520]  but I'll tell you the slack-jawed weak decadent population and I see out there
[49:22.520 --> 49:27.480]  are like sheep being fed to wolves
[49:29.480 --> 49:35.880]  blind sheep legless sheep the New World Order wants to kill you deader than a
[49:35.880 --> 49:41.840]  hammer they want full spectrum dominance they want to wipe you out they
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.040]  don't want to just brainwash you or dominate you or use you as a slave they
[49:46.040 --> 49:49.680]  don't need you with robotics and technology they think this is their
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.880]  planet they're here to kill steal and destroy and you better get that through
[49:55.880 --> 50:00.480]  your heads out there this is a gut check this is real and every one of you out
[50:00.480 --> 50:05.400]  there is in just as much danger as I am and that's the mind trick I realized
[50:05.400 --> 50:11.360]  through discernment that it's all a trick once you decide to commit and go
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.640]  past the fear once you decide to commit and to try to be as pure as you can and
[50:16.640 --> 50:20.240]  to ask God to help you you realize you were always in danger and you were in
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.920]  the greatest danger of losing your eternal soul what does it profit a man
[50:25.920 --> 50:29.280]  if he gains the whole world and loses his soul would you sell out would you
[50:29.280 --> 50:32.560]  take a billion dollars for your eyes would you take a billion dollars for
[50:32.560 --> 50:41.600]  your life would you take a billion dollars for your soul you know you've got a spirit
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.200]  it's written on you you know it and you know this planet is a test you understand
[50:47.200 --> 50:54.480]  that fundamentally and so all you've got to do is make the decision to open your
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.800]  eyes that's all you've got to do and you'll see it it's all around you make
[50:58.800 --> 51:07.440]  that decision today this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are
[51:07.440 --> 51:11.080]  on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means

[54:30.080 --> 54:33.160]  I'll be gone like I said
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.720]  you would say the same old thing let's do this let's run through calls in this
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.840]  segment the next then I'll get finished up with wiki leaks the Trillian's
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.560]  missing at the Defense Department open announcements that they're planning to
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.200]  strike Iran it's all coming up and I want to get into the fact that they're
[54:50.200 --> 54:53.240]  training police departments for martial law around the country that's
[54:53.240 --> 54:59.680]  confirmed let's go to Bryce in Missouri you're on the air Bryce thanks for
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.240]  taking my call you bet and and don't apologize for preaching on the air man
[55:05.240 --> 55:10.400]  because I think a lot more people need to hear that type of stuff you and I
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.400]  both know that the end of the rabbit hole is Satan and I don't want to get
[55:15.400 --> 55:21.520]  religious or anything but I just want to get your take on the solution that we
[55:21.520 --> 55:28.120]  need is Christ in our lives and the disease that we all have a sin as you
[55:28.120 --> 55:35.720]  said and we must first change within so that way we can go out there and fight
[55:35.720 --> 55:39.880]  that new world order we can't but the reason I covered mainly just the news
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.680]  so people can make their own decisions because the church is so corrupt and so
[55:44.680 --> 55:48.240]  many false teachers that when the average person hears us talking about
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.960]  Christ they think about some hypocrite glitterbug preacher on television
[55:52.960 --> 56:00.920]  right right and and so I just wanted to say thank you for pointing out the truth
[56:00.920 --> 56:06.320]  man I mean that's that's what it's about well Veritas is Veritas and it just
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.600]  comes out of me and I'm just I was talking about my personal relationship
[56:10.600 --> 56:16.400]  and you know it's not you know part of any sect or part of any group it's just
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.440]  my relationship with the Creator and the fact that people need to learn to
[56:22.440 --> 56:26.720]  recognize good from evil and if they can't do that they have no hope I mean
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.960]  we know what's happening to this society is the opposite of a free society we
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.400]  know we're being converted over to a corrupt tyranny by any historical yard
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.000]  stick and we're in trouble and that was the point I was trying to make right
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.240]  yeah and I agree with you and and so but but I really think that you know
[56:48.240 --> 56:52.000]  sometimes you know because I don't think that if the end of the rabbit hole is
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.160]  Satan you know or the evil one or the master of deception I don't think he
[56:56.160 --> 56:59.600]  really even cares about the elite as a matter of fact if the Rockefellers the
[56:59.600 --> 57:04.200]  Rothschilds the Illuminati the Council of 300 or whatever you know die away
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.040]  there's gonna be somebody else to take its place you know and this has been
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.760]  going on and on and on over history so yes we need to stop what's going on now
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.400]  but people also need to give their life right with God what do you think about
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.040]  that I agree with you Bryce let's talk to Roger in Missouri Roger you're on the
[57:21.040 --> 57:32.680]  air yes sir yes did you happen to your coast to coast last night no George had
[57:32.680 --> 57:42.600]  the first time I had the clip hobbies and they used the webbot guy no he had a

[58:09.680 --> 58:13.960]  British government all saying they're getting ready to hit Iran so I mean it's
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.080]  it's there and and so they are intending to strike them in the next three
[58:18.080 --> 58:25.680]  months the other question is will we get the word out and stop this anything

[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.120]  mainstream media is reporting on 8.7 billion missing that's coming up we've
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.000]  confirmed the Austin SWAT team is training for martial law checkpoints and
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.280]  gun confiscation at a call about it yesterday I searched the term found in
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.400]  the news they are over there training in Iraq to see how they set up martial law
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.160]  that is coming up but right now let's go back to your calls let's talk to Tim
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.760]  in Washington you're on the air hello how's it going today Alex I have just a
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.440]  couple questions for you real fast have you explored the topic of whitening and
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.920]  corrects it in the golf under her key to I was watching some YouTube videos and
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.200]  they're saying that it's extremely volatile to the point where if you add an
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.040]  organic solution that it just explodes in the beakers well I mean core exit they
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.440]  first of they said they used a couple million gallons now they reported it's
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.640]  40 plus million gallons but still diluted in the tens of trillions of
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.440]  gallons of water that you have I'm not even sure the volume of the Gulf of
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.440]  Mexico but it's mega massive and a lot of that core exit and oils now going out
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.160]  of the Atlantic even bigger and I know a lot of people are saying you know it when
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.960]  it all blows in with the hurricanes it's gonna be the end of the world I think
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.800]  it's gonna cause some problems but I don't think it's gonna cause evacuations
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.120]  you know 50 to 100 miles 200 miles in though the government may use that
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.000]  going into the election that's during the hurricane season as a pretext for a
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.720]  political distraction they use Katrina to confiscate guns so I think it is a
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.880]  serious issue but you know weather tends to disperse that stuff all over the
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.880]  place it doesn't just uniformly come in but yes we have covered core exit a lot
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.280]  here on the broadcast well I'm just mainly just the aspect of lightning
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.920]  strikes and what happens if it's actually hit by lightning well you all
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:17.600]  going up to ignite you know I've done a little research on that and again it
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:25.240]  pushes the oil under water and makes the oil break up and the dispersion is
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:31.120]  flammable and they have been burning the oil as well but I've heard about you
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.240]  know for two months methane bubbles and we're all dead and it's gonna be as big
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.200]  as a nuke but I really think that that's being hyped to the power of 10 but
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.960]  we'll see what happens I mean I think anything's possible okay and also one
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.640]  last thing I was in Portland Oregon about a month and a half ago and the
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.880]  census came to my door seven times looking for the previous president and
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.320]  he stated that you'll never know when you'll have to separate the races you
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.080]  know and and I was wondering where you think would this fit in with what
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.880]  martial law well I know that it's on record congressional hearings and you
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.400]  know just search the term census used to back do that right now folks thanks
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.040]  census used to round up Japanese and Italian Americans and German Americans
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.520]  during World War two so I mean it's always been used for that and they now
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.720]  admit it's being used to track people and they want to make it where the
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.680]  census is yearly and then monthly and you have a fifth amendment against self
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.560]  incrimination you don't have to answer government questions all you've got to
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.520]  say is how many people live there but they of course give them an inch they
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.200]  take it a thousand miles they're trying to expand their control I appreciate your
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.400]  call let's talk to Abe in Ohio a 770 a.m. listener Abe you're on the air
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.800]  hi Alex Colin from here in Eastern Ohio and last night I finished one of my
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.960]  summer readings that I played on reading a Huxley's and Brave New World and after
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.960]  reading that and already read 1984 I see short term making before long term
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.520]  definitely Brave New World I'm just gonna get one to get your take on that well
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.360]  you ought to read well Huxley said in speeches and in his book Brave New
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.120]  World revisited it's nonfiction that a lot he was telling you what you Genesis
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.000]  like his brother the head of the UN UNESCO program what they were actually
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.040]  planning of course he wrote the book in 33 but he wrote Brave New World revisited
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:28.360]  what in the late 50s he died in 62 I'm going from memory on that but I've read
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  both books we were actually rereading it last night for quotes in the film that
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.160]  we're making right now but I know it's very very hard-core that's what they
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.560]  plan for society anything else Abe yeah I've been telling my friends this I've
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.480]  been a supporter of yours since a couple years and they just don't believe me as I
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.480]  told them about their the depression coming two years ago and then they're
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.960]  now the name that I was right and they still can't take anything that I say
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.720]  with any validity well they don't have respect for themselves that's why they
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.800]  believe that they're just spectators in life
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:10.640]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says

[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.120]  we're back live again thank you for joining us the last 30 minutes of the
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.280]  next hour we've got Chuck Baldwin presidential candidate Constitution
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.360]  party 2008 joining us to talk about his article that he wrote the federal
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:30.800]  government declares war on the states that is coming up later in the next
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.480]  hour let me go ahead and start news blitzing right now I've done more
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.720]  research on WikiLeaks I don't believe that doesn't mean I'm sure but I don't
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:45.560]  believe they're bad that Julian Assange is bad but analyzing the latest
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.480]  information they've released the government now claims they they're
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.240]  eyeing an analyst who they think released it but the issue here is this is not top
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.000]  secret information it's secret that's the classification below that and they
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.600]  classify the CIA even classifies mainstream news articles you know that's
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.080]  been in congressional hearings that they'll classify Washington Post articles
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.160]  as if it's classified inside the CIA and Defense Department meaning they don't
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:17.440]  want their other analysts reading it which is a crazy but these are basically
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.840]  92,000 battlefield reports from kernels and majors and others and the Pentagon is
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.440]  famous in planting especially for internal intelligence and Pentagon hearings
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.280]  with Congress to paint a false image or picture they will lie about body counts
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.080]  when nobody's killed they'll claim that they killed 100 of the enemy or 200 of
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.440]  the enemy or a thousand of the enemy they'll create fake reports they'll
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:49.320]  create fake reports about bin Laden the CIA will create fake bin Laden videos
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.080]  which they now two months ago admitted in the Washington Post that they did
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.000]  create a fake bin Laden video the famous fat bin Laden that we told you was fake
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.440]  anybody could look at it even look like him just not even computer generators to
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:07.320]  fake fat guy so looking at these documents it does show some massacres
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.360]  some cover-ups but that had already come out but mixed in there they claim
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.080]  Pakistan runs al Qaeda in the Taliban well our own government created the ISI
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.120]  and funds them we've got big articles up on info wars.com and prisonpundit.com
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:29.040]  breaking that down and so it pushes this idea that oh look bin Laden is real
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.160]  and the CIA knows where he is and oh there's intelligence that bin Laden did
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.680]  do 9-11 but that's secret and so the public and the media then grabs this
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.480]  like it's special information here's the mail today the mail online glimpses of
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.240]  bin Laden now WikiLeaks reveals al Qaeda boss was seen at village meetings
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.720]  despite CIA claims they were clueless so this is a way for the CIA and the
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.440]  globalist to basically blackmail people they don't like threaten people with
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:07.680]  other intelligence they want to release it's creating a conduit to do that so
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.000]  they go on now WikiLeaks reveals al Qaeda boss was seen at village meetings
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.560]  despite CIA claims that they were clueless see oh it's all real
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:20.880]  Afghanistan war logs shows how US Marines sanitized record of bloodbath war
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.560]  logs show a Marines gave cleaned up accounts of incident which they killed
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.800]  19 civilians I mean you had private Gruckheimer and the Ithaca times eight
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.960]  years ago come home and say or seven and a half years ago and say oh we go into
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.800]  villages and kill everyone including children including babies and the
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.160]  Pentagon was on Fox saying well let's clarify only certain villages do we
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:50.160]  kill everyone meanwhile Assange is annoyed by 9-11 truth I'm constantly
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.160]  annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9-11 when
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.320]  all around we have evidence of real conspiracies for war or mass financial
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:07.200]  fraud I mean you've got all these former presidents the former Italian
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.400]  president who was also the former head of their intelligence shing 9-11's an
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.520]  inside job the former German defense minister Andres von Bülow saying it all
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.040]  these architects all these engineers the official story is a lie I mean they blew
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.240]  up building seven in front of us and said get back we're blowing it up on CNN
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.840]  and Fox 30 minutes before building seven fell they were on CNN and we'll see in
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.920]  an hour before 25 minutes before on two separate channels with the exact same
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.600]  script shing building seven has fallen in its own footprint you know it's now
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.360]  been declassified our government stage hundreds of bombings in Europe in the
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.560]  50s 60s 70s and 80s to blame on their political enemies Wikileaks who did
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.080]  relief two years ago that army field manual where army captains and above
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.440]  who were in black ops were taught how to stage false flag attacks I mean this is
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.840]  a dirty business therein our military brass West Point has been trained for
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:06.760]  the gambit where you sacrifice a pawn to win the game to draw out your enemy
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.960]  you know they'll send troops off on missions where thousands die knowing
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:17.440]  it's going to draw the enemy out that's part of their strategic system of
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:22.360]  control and of course they'll stage terror attacks we have operation
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.160]  Northwoods that's real that's ABC news associated press Baltimore Sun that's
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:34.680]  not debated operation gladio operation Ajax all of these are on record but
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.440]  Assange says you know it's irritating you know he doesn't want to talk about
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:43.280]  those documents continuing the Pentagon is eyeing an accused analyst over
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.680]  WikiLeaks data this is the Wall Street Journal military investigators are
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.720]  checking computers used by Bradley Manning a US Army intelligence analyst
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.400]  charged this month with the classified information to see if he is a source of
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.680]  thousands of military documents published by WikiLeaks what they are is a
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.680]  bunch of propaganda filled garbage pushing the official story and blaming
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.240]  Hamid Ghoul who was the big star of the CIA as they had a Pakistani
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.200]  intelligence fight in the Russians in Afghanistan who contacted this radio show
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.480]  two years ago or right after the Mumbai attacks happened almost two years ago to
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.120]  say Western intelligence carried this out and then it came out in mainstream US
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:27.440]  papers in the last three months that a US intelligence agent was the quote
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.400]  commander of the attacks in India and they had a Pakistani intelligence excuse
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.160]  me the head of Indian intelligence who was killed that day in those attacks
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.400]  said that day it was a staged event as it started to the major newspapers like
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.840]  the Times of India here's a curtain demo story that breaks this down WikiLeaks
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:53.800]  Docs target Pakistan very well-written article detailing how if Pakistani
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:00.640]  intelligence is funding Al Qaeda and Taliban will who funds them the West so
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:09.680]  that's the information on that front let me now get into this article this is
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:16.720]  out of federal news radio 1500 a.m. top story on drugs at least it was an hour
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.760]  ago and we're glad drudge is linking to this the point is the media is focusing
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:28.000]  on eight point seven billion billion missing and not focusing on congressional
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.200]  hearings in 2001 2003 4 and 5 and you can just search Rumsfeld being grilled
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.120]  about missing trillions you can see the C-span clips on YouTube we uploaded them
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.720]  that's how I know they're there and he says yeah I'm not gonna tell you where
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.080]  the trillions are and then he has the head of the office of budget from the
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.840]  Pentagon dr. Chew and Chew says that you know he won't say he looks like a bad
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  guy from a James Bond movie but I found an archive clip that somebody in 2006 put
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.240]  on YouTube from a 2001 CBS news clip it's very bad quality but you can now
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.240]  just search for the headline for this video and finally that headline in a
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.760]  moment let's go ahead and play a short clip of the big issue because while
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:24.040]  you're busy worrying about 8.7 billion it was 2.3 then it was 4 then it was 5
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.360]  last time they had a hearing in 2005 it was over 5 trillion missing because
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.120]  they've rated the Pentagon pension funds that's why they're announcing they
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.720]  don't want to give health care and Obama didn't want to wanted to make
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.960]  veterans pay for their own insurance remember that we had the head of the
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.520]  VFW on last year about it he was in a meeting with Obama when he proposed it
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.640]  because they've stolen all your money that was put in there to pay for things
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.960]  there's not just the 2 trillion a year of the 1 trillion 200 billion on budget
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.160]  the 100 billion off budget then all the black budget money there's all the other
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.160]  in Pentagon investments they buy stocks and bonds and derivatives and it's all
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.400]  been stolen and it's as big as the banking heist let's go ahead and play
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:10.720]  this clip from eight plus years ago from September 10th 2001 almost nine years
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:17.720]  ago here it is Pentagon the day before 9-1-1 Secretary of Defense Donald
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.600]  Rumsfeld declared war not on foreign terrorists the adversary is closer to
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.840]  home it's the Pentagon bureaucracy he said money wasted by the military poses a
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.560]  serious threat in fact it could be said that it's a matter of life and death
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:40.040]  Rumsfeld promised change but the next day the world changed and in the rush to
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.840]  fund the war on terrorism the war on waste seems to have been forgotten my
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:52.640]  o3 budget calls for more than 48 billion dollars in new defense spending more
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.520]  money for the Pentagon when its own auditors admit the military cannot
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:01.280]  account for 25% of what it already spends according to some estimates we
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:07.520]  cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions 2.3 trillion with a T
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.440]  that's $8,000 for every man woman and child in America to understand how the
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:17.720]  Pentagon can lose track of trillions consider the case of one military
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.840]  accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere 300 million we know
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.920]  it's gone but we don't know what they spent it on Jim Minnery a former
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.480]  Marine turned whistleblower Kurt Nemo is doing a story on this and we'll get
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.840]  that video posted up there on info wars.com you want to watch the whole
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.480]  thing but I played that because if I just read a CBS News headline to you
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.720]  you're not gonna believe it or if I read to you a Oregonian headliner or an AP
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:49.640]  article people like to see it and hear it so so there it is and the title is
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.920]  rumsfeld says 2.3 trillion missing from Pentagon if you want to watch that video
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.120]  good job guys pull mine up on short notice so while we're talking about 8.7
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.320]  billion he did that basically because he was involved in the cover up to look
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.640]  like he was going to investigate it once he got into power he covered the whole
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:12.440]  thing up and it was five plus trillion by the time they had the last hearing five
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.920]  years ago on it I don't know what it is now five trillion dollars plus missing
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.240]  and the media is talking about 8.7 billion missing today no it's over five
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.680]  trillion and growing I don't know what the new numbers are because now it's
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.600]  not even looked at and in Congress they say where's the money and they go we're
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:39.560]  not gonna tell you well where's the five trillion we're not gonna tell you that's
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:45.560]  just the end of it you understand slave see the government is above the law and
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.120]  corporations that feed from the troffer above the law but you the average
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.400]  citizen they're passing new laws all the time to make normal behavior illegal so
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.520]  they can get you into their system the only industry we've got left this
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.520]  country people working in private prisons competing with the private sector
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.560]  you worry but only because you're paying attention what's happening in the Gulf
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:09.160]  of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature a similar audacity called gmo or
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.640]  genetically modified organisms means that the quality of commercially grown
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.640]  food may be compromised with our health in the balance now that summer's here
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.840]  what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.960]  edible food let author Linda Runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.400]  that food is everywhere you look this summer for the cost of a good meal or
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.360]  two out you can literally starvation proof yourself and your loved ones
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.280]  against any future craziness and put up tons of free food to whatever
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.560]  experiment is being run on us you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.240]  staple foods aren't involved our foods are their enemy so go to of the field

[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.160]  question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.240]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.720]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two

[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.200]  through Friday we kick the broadcast off at 11 a.m. Central that is 12 noon
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.720]  Eastern we got Chip Balvin coming up the last 30 minutes of the next hour talk
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.680]  about his article the federal government declares war on the stage we'll
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:25:01.480]  break that down but I want to get back into the fact that the AP and Reuters
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.800]  are reporting that Ahmed Denizide says the next three months they have intel
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.880]  that the US and Israel are both going to attack their country and probably Syria
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.720]  you've got troops mashing in and around Venezuela and off the coast openly
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.480]  saying that they claim weapons are being given to Iran by Venezuela so they're
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.160]  gearing up for strikes on Venezuela this is looking like World War three and
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:30.120]  many analysts are calling it World War three meanwhile the Pentagon has
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.480]  trillions and trillions of dollars missing and this hasn't been in the
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.040]  news in five years oh they'll talk about some army officer who steals a
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.320]  computer or they'll they'll talk about waste and abuse and they'll talk about
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.560]  little corruption they don't talk about trillions and trillions and trillions
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.320]  disappearing out of the pension fund system disappearing out of the Pentagon
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.080]  and Armed Services investments remember water districts school districts
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.520]  counties cities states federal bureaucracies tens of thousands of them
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.200]  tens of thousands of counties alone are all investing your money in the global
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.880]  stock market then the bankers take that and use that to come in and buy up your
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.240]  roads and your infrastructure this is financial full spectrum dominance
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:21.400]  medical federalization but the profits are private full spectrum dominance the
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.920]  the police are being federalized full spectrum dominance and we're going to
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:30.080]  talk about that coming up in the next segment but Stuart Rhodes they posted a
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.280]  video the Oathkeepers did out of Oklahoma of him giving a very powerful
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.160]  nine and a half minute speech that I'm gonna play coming up at the second half
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:47.120]  of the next long segment but that will first dovetail that guys pull this up
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.200]  because I'm gonna play a little bit of his call it's on my Alex Jones YouTube
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:59.440]  channel that says you know Iraq vet says Austin police training to set up
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.360]  checkpoints it's even worse than that go door-to-door and basically confiscate
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.840]  guns I'm gonna play a short clip of that we come back because because people were
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.600]  in those comments about a third of them saying he was a liar and then it wasn't
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:19.160]  true in fact I'm gonna get into this right now here is the Fort Hood Sentinel
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.640]  here is the Fort Hood Sentinel biggest military base in the world about 45
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:32.280]  miles north of Austin north west of Austin and who did the callers say was
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.480]  there the head of the Austin SWAT team and someone with their intelligence
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.360]  group what does this article say it says the head of the SWAT team and the
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:48.760]  head of intelligence along with city officials and judges are being trained
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.760]  and this is even a cover story but it's still bad at the base and then as a
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.800]  footnote they say that the SWAT team commander and others had just returned
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.840]  from Iraq I had a unique perspective because I recently had gone to Iraq to
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.040]  evaluate law enforcement over there I was lucky to be able to volunteer and
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.840]  assist with the third ACR training we had the caller they were running real
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.400]  checkpoints they they call that training and searching people and then go on
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.960]  door-to-door gun confiscation drills we're showing the soldiers urban law
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.040]  enforcement so they can go and train the Iraqi police they always spin that no
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.760]  they were being trained he goes on to admit that he goes actually we were
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.800]  being trained listen to this the army obviously doesn't need any instructions
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.880]  from us on how to shoot engage in combat because they are the best in the
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.120]  world at doing that but having to go in with a softer approach and more of law
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.560]  enforcement type approach now that is maybe something we can show them
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:47.840]  reflecting on the training Denton added the training was symbolic we're a PD
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.440]  probably learned more than we were taught to a man all of these third ACR
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:57.440]  soldiers had been motivated energetic and bright so the caller exactly what he
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:04.120]  told us is what is in this article so there you have it and of course this is
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.800]  just an isolated incident you've got the Marines and the army and homeland
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.400]  security and the National Guard in Tennessee last year it's in police state
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:16.680]  for the rise of FEMA we had a state rep on the governor says you're shutting down
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.520]  highways and the army searching people don't do that and they said we're gonna
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.760]  do it anyway same thing in California with the Marines that drunk driving
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.320]  checkpoints with guns same thing when I've been in New York and a hundred yards
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.800]  away troops run over wearing 45 screaming don't videotape me you bleep and
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.760]  scum that's an in-game blueprint for global enslavement they are just openly
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.320]  integrating it and then you get the Mayak and homeland security reports that
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.040]  law enforcement gave us who were they training for even with the explorer
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.960]  scouts to take on his grunt of veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.680]  in the fetters get us out of the UN errors and barters we're on the march the
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:30:01.680]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.380]  Mike you're on the air hey Alex my name's Mike and I'm stationed here at
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:29.440]  Fortwood I'm originally from Dallas what I'm about to tell you might hit home so
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.200]  I'm sorry to do so you might already know about it but if you do this might
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:37.560]  verify I just got back from a tour in Iraq a few months ago and what I did
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.600]  there was a security escort gunner and the best way to describe that would be
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.560]  the opening scene of Iron Man the people taking Tony Stark around that's what we
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.680]  did of course none of the civilians were near as cool it was a little bit
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:53.240]  difficult most of them are doctors of agriculture and doctors of science we
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.640]  transport them all around but the most interesting thing and of course I've
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.360]  stories about that but for another time it's a little bit lengthy but most
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.240]  importantly one day we had a one of our mission briefings of the very early
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.320]  morning we had two guys come out and reading jumpsuits and that it looked
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.500]  like our mechanics jumpsuits but and they were wearing our gear as far as
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:17.120]  bulletproof Vesco and the IBAs and IOTVs and I saw on their patch over
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:24.880]  they didn't have American flags but they had Austin SWAT patches from yeah
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.560]  from Austin Texas yes from Austin Texas now these are veterans not veterans
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.000]  of our war but veterans of Austin Texas SWAT team that's right what they were
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.680]  doing there was training to learn how we set up our military police checkpoints
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.720]  and how we do raids on houses stay there stay there this is key info stay with us
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:50.000]  all right so then we came back and got more intel from him and literally people
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.280]  were in the comments saying it wasn't real well here's the Fort Hood Sentinel
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.520]  and you can type in police train with the military in Iraq and find hundreds of
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.040]  police departments doing this and what are they training for shutting down
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:07.240]  whole highways searching everyone and going door-to-door for gun confiscation
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.840]  now that is what they're training for the headline is brave rifles train with
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:18.560]  APD the number one threat to a free society if you studied history whether
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:24.640]  it was Rome 2000 and 60 something years ago would Julius Caesar or whether it's
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:30.280]  Venezuela or whether it's Nigeria or whether it was Nazi Germany is powerful
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:35.560]  forces using the military to overthrow the country under the guise of fighting
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.720]  a crisis remember what Smedley Butler two-time congressional of Medal of
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.880]  Honor winner he was in line to be the commandant of the Marine Corps and they
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.120]  asked him they said we want to make you the commandant we want you to lead the
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.840]  Marine Corps because he'd use the Marine Corps himself in more than 11
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.520]  nations to overthrow countries for the robber barons that were running our
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.000]  country he wrote the book war as a racket they brought him into meetings
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:05.560]  with George Herbert Walker Bush's father Prescott Bush and the Haramans and
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.400]  others and they said we're gonna overthrow America and have martial law
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.440]  and he went and blew the whistle to Congress and they had the McCormick
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.880]  Dixitne Committee hearings and we have clips of that in my film in-game
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.440]  blueprint for global enslavement but that's the issue and he played along
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.160]  with it got the intel and stopped it now that was a full frontal assault take
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:33.360]  over plan and it was so embarrassing they didn't prosecute
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:41.040]  Prescott Bush and others they just dropped it now this has been a long at
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:48.600]  least 30 year program this has been going on since the 80s to integrate the
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.960]  military and police and militarized police kill people and break things
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.520]  that's their job that's their training and if you studied history and have
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.680]  common sense there's no doubt they are brainwashing our military our police
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.280]  they're integrating them they're now saying they're gonna use them domestically
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:09.640]  to fight crime and do gun confiscations in Illinois that's Chicago Tribune the
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.480]  mayor of connected New York's calling for martial law their you know troops
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.720]  are at all these different high visibility events all to acclimate the
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.360]  population and a few minutes I'm gonna play a Stuart Rhodes clip that is so
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.000]  vitally important where he as the founder and head of Oathkeepers talks
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.120]  about why they're being demonized by the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center in the
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.880]  mainstream media why what they're doing is so important this is a message to all
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.720]  police all military you're trained and compartmentalized that you're doing a
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.600]  good job that you're given false reasons remember military police remember ten
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.000]  years ago why you were told all the training was going on they were told
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.840]  us for overseas now they're telling you it's for domestic I told you it was for
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.640]  domestic we got the army documents that's in my film police state to the
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.960]  takeover that it is for domestic takeover and it is targeted at the
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.720]  American people it has nothing to do with Hodges as they're called in the
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:12.280]  Pentagon kind of a racial slang they use that I find offensive and I don't

[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.680]  their intelligence reports they're given where they demonize Ron Paul in the
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.480]  Fedders returning veterans constitutionalist red-blooded Americans
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.080]  and Stuart Rhodes the founder of Oathkeepers two years ago has traveled
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.440]  the country and has reached millions of former servicemen and millions of
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.280]  police and they're really waking up and and learning what their sacred honor is
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.400]  all about and what that oath is really about and I saw this video it's posted
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:49.640]  up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com I saw this video that was just released
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:55.480]  yesterday and it's so pertinent to every issue that we're facing that if
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.320]  tyranny is gonna come to your door it's gonna come in a uniform and police and
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.520]  military and other people in government a lot of them who are on power trips and
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.000]  feel like they're part of a club and a winning team who feel like the public's
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.640]  against them and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy we then become against them they
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.120]  then you know start not liking us as they carry out more and more draconian
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.440]  things that are unconstitutional. We have to come together and they have to
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.760]  decide which side they're on in this key time in history so here is this key
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:30.120]  video with Stuart Rhodes from Oathkeepers here it is. When you took that oath
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.840]  every one of you were preserved in the military police or even fireflies were
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.920]  taking an oath when you take that oath that's where your decision is made right
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:44.600]  there in that spot you pledge you swear to God Almighty that you're gonna support
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.880]  and defend the Constitution United States at all costs all of us who served in
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.120]  military police this is our bond and firefighters too when we say those words
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.520]  it's not just something we say we know that it means we're writing a blank check
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:07.160]  made out to the people of the United States for an amount up to including our
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:13.040]  lives that's the difference you want to know the difference that's it when a
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.200]  firefighter goes into a burning building he knows he might not come out but
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:23.680]  he's duty bound to do it he took upon himself that responsibility I served as
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.080]  a volunteer firefighter in Montana only for about eight months I was just a
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:33.720]  rookie but I'll tell you what I saw some men of true character and courage those
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:39.000]  are the guys that run in when everybody else is running out that's the pure
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:46.040]  spirit of a guardian who's willing to sacrifice his life okay sadly enough
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.640]  though in this country people respect firefighters they still understand that
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:56.400]  that they're heroes they really are all too often nowadays they look at police
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.560]  and they don't see heroes anymore they look at them and they think these are
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.920]  the people that are gonna come kick down my door these are the guys you're gonna
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.680]  arrest me and tase me on some traffic stop these are the guys I see on YouTube
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.760]  doing doing things like like tasing some old lady or like in during Katrina
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.760]  tackling an old lady to the ground in her kitchen because she dares to hold a
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.400]  revolver in her hand with the cylinder open obviously no danger to anybody any
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.280]  idiot that understands guns whatsoever should know that an open cylinder an
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.120]  empty cylinder is no danger what she do speedload it in two seconds so they see
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.720]  these things and they start to see the police in this country as the enemy of
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:40.760]  the people as an occupying army there are all too many people in this country
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.840]  sincere lovers of liberty sincere constitutionalist who are becoming
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.680]  increasingly afraid of their own police officers I find that sad I find that
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.440]  tragic and I find it contemptible because you know where it's coming from
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:59.040]  there are people who want to put a divide a wall between the police in this
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.040]  country and the people they're doing this intentionally all these my act of my
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.960]  act reported that fusion center report from Missouri that labeled this about
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.720]  everybody the Constitution party a supporter of Chuck Baldwin potential
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.000]  terrorist a supporter of Ron Paul potential terrorist county Emmys
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.040]  awards you know a supporter of immigration control potential terrorist you
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.320]  know and was one of the police officers in Miami or in Missouri who saw that and
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.200]  said hey I don't like being called a potential terrorist and so that police
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.640]  officer leaked it and the same goes for the DHS report that smeared veterans
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:39.520]  as potential terrorists that was also leaked by a federal officer very good
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:45.720]  man and in addition same with the extremist lexicon was also leaked by a
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:53.240]  federal officer who did not like the pattern he saw of this wall separation
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:59.160]  of this attempt to make police officers think that the people are their enemy so
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:03.160]  they pull you over in their mind you're a potential enemy especially you have a
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:06.080]  Ron Paul sticker in your car a constitutional sticker in your car
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.480]  what's the other one live for your die what's the one guy he had a sticker in
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:15.240]  his car that got hassled glass in the flag you got pulled over and police
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.040]  officers sadly enough pulled reason why pulled you over is because that bumper
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.000]  sticker on your car that's a piece of American history right there this is the
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:33.440]  flag of our fathers our forefathers flew this flag as they gave their lives for
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:41.520]  our liberty and yet this flag now is seen as a sign of a terrorist of a law
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:49.680]  breaker of an enemy of the people of a killer of women and children contemptible
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.280]  there are people in this country who do not respect our Republic do not support
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.320]  the Constitution who desire to destroy this Republic and they are doing all
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:08.520]  they can to erase our heritage to make it off limits to dare to fly this flag
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:14.040]  to make it off limits to dare to stand lexicon green and simply renew the oath
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:20.760]  you swore by legal obligation they want it off limits for you to celebrate your
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:26.120]  heritage even talk about the Constitution even call yourself a
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:31.080]  constitutionalist I saw that the DHS Lexicon says constitutionalist equals
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.520]  militiaman equals extremist equals terrorist I thought oh my gosh I've been
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.880]  calling myself a constitutional for years I didn't know I had no idea it was
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:48.360]  extremist or a revelation or a terrorist yeah there's a conscious effort to put
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.160]  a divide between the police and the people they want the police to see you as
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:55.600]  the enemy they want you to see the police as the enemy is that true is that the
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:03.840]  truth no it's like the matrix in that movie it's false it's boulder dash it's
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.800]  nonsense okay and this is one of the big I'll tell you what I started this
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.480]  organization I already knew there were good police officers out there I'd
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.520]  I'd been a firearm instructor and met quite a few of them here a metro in the
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:20.560]  past and and gone to shooting schools with them under ranch you know gun
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:24.920]  sight whatever had a good time and I recognized that there was that bond
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:30.600]  there's a bond between military and police shouldn't be a surprise they're
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.400]  all willing to put on a rifle sling a rifle put on a pistol and go do what
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:38.000]  has to be done to defend their country and their neighborhoods and their and
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.760]  their friends and neighbors and their families they take that responsibility
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.440]  they're warriors it's that's it's that common bond others who've stepped up
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.080]  for active duty and even us veterans frankly who dare to stand up don't you
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.760]  think I'll put the big bulls on my forehead we're doing this I'm not
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.720]  exaggerating when Southern Pottery Law Center does all their smear stuff are
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.720]  they just saying that to be mean and be nasty and maybe a libel suit come out
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:12.600]  of it no it's potentially deadly they want the FBI DOJ ATF to come and
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:18.160]  investigate people like me that's their purpose smear you and marginalize you
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.080]  and then hopefully unleash the power of government against you to silence and
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.080]  suppress you they want them to come kick down my door in Mola night and body
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.640]  armor they want guys like me to come to my house they're not going to come do it

[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:45.200]  mp5 in his hand and kicked down my door he's a battering ram come through my
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:52.840]  door is he gonna point man behind the ram no he won't come do it himself he'll
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:59.640]  send someone like Chauncey or someone like Dave Freeman or someone like Bob
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.200]  back there big strong guy he wants someone like that to come to my house
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.040]  and kick in my door and put a submachine gun in my face in my
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:14.280]  children's face that's what he wants he wants them to think that I'm their
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:20.520]  enemy and vice versa he wants all of us to think that and then they expect why
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.960]  are they upset about us it's not because we're not racist it's not that they know
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:30.000]  it too it's not because we're terrorists celebrating Timothy McVeigh what
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.880]  they're upset about is the oath they don't like it when what they perceive as
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:40.880]  their minions and their toys even think for themselves their vision their
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:46.280]  perspective their opinion of the police and military is that they're just like
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:50.360]  toy soldiers you wind up instead of marching and they think because they
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.960]  don't believe in a republic they believe in this absolute rule whoever holds
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.360]  political power they believe we're a democracy there are people in this
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.400]  country when they hold political power they figure hey I won the election all

[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:36.760]  Constitution and to keep their oath to defend it don't do that don't talk to
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:42.760]  them why because I'm encouraging violence am I encouraging police and

[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:52.120]  all we are asking them to do is to stand down to refuse to comply with unlawful

[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:07.520]  now oh the SWAT teams are over in Iraq regular police departments like Austin

[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:33.400]  tyranny they don't care about me tyranny is for you tyranny is to take your
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.720]  pension funds and raise your taxes and have national compulsory service where
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.000]  the state uses your children like slaves and they've reintroduced the bill and
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.800]  it's now raced into committee for national service and Obama in a state of
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:50.000]  the Union said he wants it and Rahm Emanuel has said you will wear a
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.040]  uniform in high school and in college at least three months a year and you will
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:01.200]  serve in domestic cores and now we learn there's 854,000 private corporate spies
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.320]  with the highest level security clearance spying on the American people part
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:09.240]  of infraguard and other programs how many years ago did I tell you that was
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.480]  going on that a secret private corporate takeover was happening but there
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.920]  were spies everywhere because I'd seen intel pieces every all over the place
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:23.760]  this is all admitted and now it's out in the open they're not getting 854,000
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.600]  private spies with the highest level security clearances with license to
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:33.840]  kill orders that's mainstream news they're not setting all this up to play
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.200]  patty cake with you our government's become corrupt since 47 the CIA and the
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.040]  NSA have operated in total secrecy with unlimited funded they've been caught
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.320]  shipping drugs in over and over again they're totally corrupt if you own the
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:53.000]  business as the American people you run America and you went away from your
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  business for 20 years and gave somebody the keys to everything do you think when
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.480]  you came back in 20 years that they thought you weren't you know been lost
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.040]  at sea or something that that that they'd lock the doors when you got there
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.960]  and tell the cops to arrest you and that they tell everybody the business was
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:13.640]  theirs that's what's happened the country is dying liberty is the engine of
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:20.840]  wealth and happiness we need a sanctuary that's what our republic was for
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:27.320]  private property for freedom and we're losing that sanctuary we're losing that
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:32.520]  hedge of protection Nigeria's got on average as many resources as the
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:37.440]  United States but there are 300 million inhabitants or slaves
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.960]  Mexico's got at least triple the resources in every graphic graph you
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.920]  look at in every demographic you look at but they're totally poor because they
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.360]  have a corrupt elite but they have more billionaires in the US does they have an
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:54.800]  ultra-rich and a giant poor they use the fact that their population is poor by
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:58:02.400]  designed to control them this is feudalism neo-surfdom the bad guys of
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.920]  taking America over America isn't bad the bad guys took it over because we
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.480]  were the freest country in the world so we had all the wealth and power so
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:14.200]  private corporate interest came in took over the government and have set up an

[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.840]  well but it's just it is so incredible to realize this treason's going on and
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.160]  they're all macho in a military attitude and being militarily trained to
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:58.080]  kill people and break things here domestically so that is coming up let's
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.520]  go to your calls quickly Jack in South Dakota you're on the air yeah Alex
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.360]  hello yes sir yeah you know how you always say knowledge is power yes knowledge
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:12.720]  is not power courage is power if you have all the knowledge in the world you're
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.760]  in a coward you have nothing but you gotta have both because you gotta have
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.640]  courage and it comes from God you can't buy it you can't steal it you and listen
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:25.160]  another thing that's one in your side and why you're shaking in the shower is
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.080]  that real ID card you carry an Alex you have to take that out of your wallet go
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:34.840]  down and get a copy carry a paper copy of it if that's what gives you courage do
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:40.320]  not carry real ID real ID without that without real ID they cannot do health
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.720]  care they cannot do this banking system but you gotta use your weapons back on
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:49.600]  economic when I said that I it was more of a shutter of just realizing how real
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:55.080]  this is it isn't even fear it's more of a revulsion that the population doesn't
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.360]  know what's happening to them and I agree you've got to have knowledge and
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.080]  courage but but if you've just got courage you'll be manipulated to work
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.160]  for the New World Order thinking you're a good guy if you don't have knowledge
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:09.280]  courage you will stand against tyranny that's the only weapon we have an
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.680]  economic sanction okay you click you hey if the taxes are due on the 50th of
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:18.480]  April you don't file you stand with courage and let them put the penalties
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:21.880]  on you and pay them later it's worth the price to have the courage and another
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:30.520]  thing Alex is the 857,000 CSA workers over there them are free masons with a
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.480]  badge dude that is world global free masonry with a badge do you understand
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:38.520]  me well I have noticed it's a lot of masons they're recruiting into these
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:42.600]  positions and it's the mason's they are all free mason's Alex they are all the
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:47.960]  work of the devil listen prayer is the only weapon against the devil prayer is
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:51.000]  you got to pray to God to give you appreciate your call but I mean getting
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.320]  back to the masons most masons don't even understand how they're being used
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.000]  but it is true I keep noticing it's mason groups promoting the military and
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.960]  police merging getting kids DNA and they all think they're doing a good thing
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:06.240]  the low-level people good points Jack Nate in California you're on the air

[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:35.800]  up the Constitution and stuff like that yes a chiropractor he's really intelligent
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.640]  guy every time I bring it up oh you're one of those Constitution guys huh yeah
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.160]  which means you're an American I mean this is just more dirt if we don't have
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.000]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence might as
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:50.160]  well just be Nigeria or Venezuela you know that's what America is that's what
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.800]  the flag symbolizes and they hate the Gadsden flag don't tread on me they
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:01.000]  hate the Constitution because these people at their roots hate freedom yeah
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.560]  it's very very frustrating and then also you're talking about how they like to
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:08.240]  play God well I have somebody really close to me works on all the power lines
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:13.000]  and it brings him to military bases and one time he went there there was two
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.280]  people guarding this one area that he couldn't go into and one of these guys
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.600]  said that it was the one of the biggest magnets in the world and they didn't know
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:25.000]  what it was gonna do when they turn that on they didn't know if it's gonna throw
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.960]  our orbit off or anything like that and they still turned it on obviously didn't
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:32.520]  do anything but you saying that's what we know and well they got a lot of
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:36.120]  admitted super weapons and they're constantly testing them and meanwhile
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.720]  the environmentalists are saying put taxes on carbon dioxide that plants breathe
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:43.680]  and all the real threats are the genetic engineering open air release of it the
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:48.720]  super weapons the super nukes all of it I really great points Nate I'm gonna talk
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.440]  to Frank Karen and Randy quickly but now there's some phone lines open for
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.160]  police and military what do you think about the Austin SWAT team being trained
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.940]  for gun confiscation and coordinating shutting down cities we'll be right
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:05.640]  back the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:11.120]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:15.560]  Constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:18.600]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.720]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to

[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:40.920]  newspaper about the Austin SWAT team training for martial law and gun
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:45.960]  confiscation here's the toll-free number or are you too afraid because we're
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.800]  such a free country you know your phones being listened to a lot of people to

[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:15.160]  back to your calls Frank in Florida you're on the air God might have been
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:18.560]  speaking to you in the shower so I'll be praying for you and your safety more
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:22.840]  often I listen to you every day now but I used to be a right winger who believed
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:27.600]  that Muslims were our enemy I was for the war but I got completely woke up
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.120]  because of seeing 9-11 truth videos on YouTube and this was over a year ago and
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.760]  since then I've given out DVDs to all my friends and family I've posted links in
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:41.960]  Facebook the links from the Alex Jones channel are excellent but the problem is
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.040]  that everyone just ignores it I never get any response the people are too
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.920]  cowardly to watch the videos Facebookers just want to talk about complete
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.560]  nonsense and ignore the links it makes me sick and now the right wingers are
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:59.360]  all upset about some supposed mosque being built on ground zero as far as I'm
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:02.960]  concerned it's just a total distraction to keep these people from you know
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:06.360]  focusing on the bankers and keep them focused on Islam and they're worried
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.680]  about a mosque and I think it goes hand-in-hand with the official story
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:15.080]  which is a conspiracy theory if anyone wants to call us truth there is
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.760]  conspiracy theorists no it's the people who believe the official conspiracy
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:24.480]  theory well listen the majority of Americans and major polls say that
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.840]  they don't trust either political party and it's not awakening Democrats are
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:31.240]  waking up Republicans are waking up and saying I don't believe anything this
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:34.840]  government tells us and it's that awakening to the criminality that gives
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.160]  us a chance to reverse this but people have woken up but they haven't woken up
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.280]  to 1 1 hundred the most of them of just how bad it really is I appreciate your
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:49.040]  call Frank Karen in California you're on the air you're waking yourself in
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.080]  California and I'm a mother of five kids the youngest is 18 and I grew up in a
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.320]  military family and we had three months to get ready for this war so we need to
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:02.720]  fight and get ourselves ready and get it united and say a lot of us have been
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.800]  hurt so the majority of American people don't want this war and we need to do it
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.240]  now and we may back them off and we may back them off from launching an attack
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.840]  within the globalist may set a nuke off and blame it on foreign enemies as long
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:20.040]  as they can stage crises and get more power out of it you know what did Obama's
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.560]  advisor Robert Shapiro say in the Financial Times of London two weeks ago
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:28.240]  he said Obama needs an Oklahoma City or 9 11 event so he can look strong and if
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:31.400]  he doesn't have that it's over for him that's a paraphrase but he basically said
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:36.280]  that fact let's pull up the quote put it on screen now it was Financial Times of
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.680]  London headline but I don't that's so heavy I don't want to just claim it's
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.920]  there and not show people again even though we probably show people 15 times
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:49.920]  and so the issue here is that then if we beat them and back this off they're
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:53.560]  going to keep coming back we have to understand it's a long-term fight we're
[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:57.400]  in and then when we do back them off people say oh look everything's okay we
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.920]  have to realize that that's also the Psyop they're running
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:11.600]  I agree we also need to show our flags we need to start putting our flags back up and stop being afraid to be showing that this is our country our flags
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.280]  well we're seeing massive censorship on Facebook and at people's houses and
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.160]  other places with the Gadsden flag that don't tread on me that George Washington
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:22.840]  used that the Marine Corps uses what's wrong with an American saying don't
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.280]  tread on me I'm not a slave that upsets the globalist because they think they
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.240]  own the police they own the military they own the people we've got to say no
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.480]  you don't own me I mean they've got an effect will you guys print me Rob do's
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:38.360]  article about National Slave Bill Inters Committee that I think that was the
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:43.160]  M4s headline that bill is introduced for National Forest Service I appreciate
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:48.080]  your call Karen let's talk to John in Oklahoma who's police John thanks for
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:55.040]  joining us yes sir what's your take on the military training with the police
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:59.920]  for cordon and search and shut down of cities and gun confiscation like we
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:07.080]  saw in Katrina well I think it's an obvious violation the Constitution you
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:13.600]  can't do that it's an obvious I mean isn't there something called posse
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:21.160]  commentatus well they blown holes in it we can't do that absolutely I mean what
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.520]  your view as a police officer what are the other police saying are are they
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:29.840]  aware of this of the transformation taking place from what I can tell
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:34.520]  there's at least where I work there's there's not a lot of people that know
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:40.400]  what's going on but every once in a while I do run into one during training
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:44.760]  and so on and so forth what about a military culture being taught to police
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.360]  which is go out there and fight the enemy well that's just it I believe
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.720]  that's where it's coming from I think that that's how they're getting officers
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:59.120]  to go along with it is through training them that everyone wants to kill you and
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:02.760]  there's a there's an immediate threat around every corner and you know there's
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.880]  you know that that sort of thing possibly some people might refer to it as
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:12.840]  brainwashing well I've looked at my statistics the number one thing that's
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.840]  killing cops is police being told to patrol roads they don't have a big
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:20.760]  enough shoulder and I see police constantly hanging their butts out and I
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.120]  try to go around them and then I mean many more policing pull the numbers up
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:30.840]  get killed being run over by cars and they do by people shooting them and I've
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:37.080]  I watch police and I notice here in Austin they'll pull over you know one
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:41.520]  time two old ladies in a convertible car and the cop had his hand on his gun and
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:46.280]  was acting scared and I've had cops pull me over in their acting scared and and
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:51.960]  I just don't understand why and they've been taught to not and I want you to
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.760]  speak to this John and correct me if I'm wrong in your area to not just to not
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:01.600]  be able to discriminate and I don't mean by color but by using common sense you
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.720]  know of who looks like they're dangerous and who doesn't they're just taught and
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:08.080]  I've seen this in federal training manuals about that priest may be a
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.000]  killer that woman with a baby carriage you know it's who you least expect when
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.080]  actual reality shows it's the opposite and it actually gets more cops killed
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.360]  because they're just in a constant state of thinking everybody wants to kill them
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.560]  they lose their discernment any views on that
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:28.200]  absolutely you you pinned the tail on the on the donkey with that one that's
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:35.440]  exactly what's causing it there they're trying to to train officers that they're
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:40.960]  there's a constant threat of being murdered and it's not true that's how
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:44.520]  they're gonna get guys to go along with it and the government loves them and the
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.200]  feds have got training and they care about them but I mean are the police
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:53.800]  upset about the Mayak report federally written and issued to states Missouri was
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:57.960]  the first one that got leaked where they say returning vets gun owners I mean now
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.560]  the White House has said publicly this whole thing is for basically people that
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:07.920]  have a John Wayne portrait in their house well the problem is is most officers
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.040]  haven't even read the Constitution they don't know anything about the Mayak
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:20.760]  report you see what I'm saying no yes or I do break down any other points you've
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:26.800]  got for us or what you think about the police being trained for total shut
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.720]  downs of cities well I believe it's definitely going on there you can you
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:40.080]  can see officers from tiny eight you know three and four man agencies at SWAT
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:48.120]  schools and and you know these types of you know tactical type of training
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  schools you'll see them from all over you know they're not just doing it in
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:56.720]  metropolitan areas they're doing it in rural areas and they're now having
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.800]  SWAT teams in the last decades run these swarms we're on the highway they're in
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:05.200]  their gear searching people and it's all about intimidation police chiefs have
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:10.760]  said that just searching people in mass I went to down to the Comal River this
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:15.560]  weekend in New Braunfels and I don't know if I'll go back because there were
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.560]  checkpoints everywhere there were cops with cameras at high noon taking photos
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:24.000]  of people and they looked craze they look it looked like when I've been in
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:31.120]  Venezuela or Nicaragua or not Venezuela but Nicaragua or Mexico or on the
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.800]  border of Guatemala I mean I mean they look I mean you know what a third world
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:42.880]  looks like they look they look crazed yes yes that's exactly right I don't
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:48.520]  understand it I can't understand where they're getting these guys I was
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:54.240]  fortunate before I became a police officer I had I knew the truth I knew
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.240]  about the things that were going on and I was I was a listener of your program
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:04.920]  and so I'm fortunate not everybody has has been blessed with the gift of
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:10.000]  knowledge prior to becoming a police officer what would happen to you John if
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.560]  you started trying to educate the other officers would they demote you or run you
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:24.360]  out all they would try I suppose but you know I I think a lot of times when
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.320]  when officers know what's going on they're they're they're just kind of
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:33.480]  maybe ignored you know I've asked other officers if they would go along with
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:39.720]  with with gun confiscations and some have said yes and and every once in a
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:45.760]  while you'll you'll meet one that that will say no absolutely not you know but
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:49.680]  that's a no-brainer that's illegal I mean what happened in Katrina was illegal
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:52.800]  it came out it was illegal but still they accelerate the training I mean you
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.680]  can see the massive paramilitary buildup and its entire architecture is
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:02.240]  pointed at the American people and they admit it's for us I mean this is high
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.560]  treason and now they admit 854,000 private spies and they're gonna replace the
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.880]  police with private contractors I mean this is really happening and I just I
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.000]  just wish we could reach out to these cops but the average cop more and more
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.600]  is on a power trip that's you're right absolutely I see it I see it every time
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:30.200]  I go to work every night I'm sick of it they've replaced we're here for they
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:34.960]  replace they're we're supposed to help people well they replace the guardian
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:41.360]  spirit that is of God with this thug predator spirit and any other points I

[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:28.800]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:32.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:36.200]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:40.520]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:36.840]  on the air go ahead what's your view on the fact that America is going bad I
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.280]  mean this happens to most other countries they get overtaken by corrupt
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:45.120]  individuals the government is hyping up and getting the police and military
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.640]  ready for war with the people what's your view on this well just like anybody
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.120]  that you know I've seen I've watched this progression over the last 20 years or
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:59.080]  so and and I've seen it happening at you know whenever it's been the military
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:03.840]  way back when I was a kid all the way so now I'm in my mid-40s and it's
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.640]  amazing being in the you know in the law enforcement training area that I'm
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:14.360]  in where you see the elevation of the drug war and then the elevation of the
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.160]  laws on the other side of it and you see the only person that loses here is the
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:22.880]  is the middle of you know the middle class and you know it and you see the
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:27.360]  the police officers being more and more militarized and and it's and what I've
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.080]  seen lately and in our work and it's exactly kind of along the lines that
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:38.720]  you're talking about is the introduction of the federal fusion part where we
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.680]  bring in top recruits or top candidates from around the state and either state
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:49.640]  local or county police officers train them for a three-week process and the
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:54.960]  last week they have what's what's called kind of a disaster drill and each one of
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.400]  these individuals have to learn how to maintain continuity in government in
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:04.560]  other words they're the response team and then then they they then they work
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:08.760]  the federal government you know response team and they're really
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:14.280]  federalized and it's admitted the CIA is actually secretly managing all
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.920]  these threat fusion centers so there's a CIA officer over each one and then they
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:23.600]  go oh we're sending the Austin Travis County Fusion Center people to Iraq and
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.880]  they're sending county judges to Fort Hood to learn about martial law I mean
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:33.640]  this is admitted oh absolutely you know one of the things you have to I was
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.080]  Chuck Baldwin was on the phone right now because he I know he was 82nd airborne
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:42.120]  and I'm pretty sure he was but I know he was in Fort Benning for a while one of
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:48.600]  the top schools in America that really focuses on things of that nature is
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:52.000]  school of America's now it's under a different name they shut it down to
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.640]  rename it and they had not only trained the troops to learn how to torture and
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:58.400]  everything else oh that's counterinsurgency the whole nine yards
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:03.080]  it and and that is we have that I mean you know that was Pinochet all the way
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.800]  it all the way through in South America you know those those whole those all
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:10.280]  those print were branded to and now the police are getting the pain compliance
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:14.160]  training absolutely and you are you are dead on the nose with that and that's
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.240]  and what it's coming in subtle subtle and more subtle and then you have these
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:22.640]  these guys coming back reverting back to the to the mainland you know from from
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:27.120]  from these false foreign wars which you you and I totally re on and that's what
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:31.280]  Iraq is is a giant laboratory they send them there they bring them back they
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.920]  become police officers they've run martial law in Afghanistan in Iraq and
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:39.160]  now they're here and now the government admits that's what it's for I mean is
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:44.480]  this not diabolical it is now what even happens even further you see these the
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.960]  this big birthing of SWAT teams and special you know these ninjas running
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:51.160]  around in jumpsuit you know I mean it's basically but they're they're being
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.760]  fractionalized it's just like it's like if you were to set up a group of
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:58.240]  torturers the first thing you do is you individualize them or you fractionalize
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:05.360]  them away from you know the mainstream police force and they get into this
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:08.680]  this group where they are they're focused on and then and like you say
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:13.080]  they're they're radicalized and we I've seen this more and more and more
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:16.800]  especially here in Texas these cops realize they're part of a literal
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.160]  Soviet style brainwashing campaign to be stormtroopers to suppress the
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.000]  American people and the bankers totally bring us down I mean this is
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.480]  guaranteed their families America it's over this is literally Nazi Germany
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:34.080]  folks this is creeping illegal death and I mean we're not joking around here I
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.360]  think you I think you get you got into a minute ago with your bravery versus
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:43.080]  knowledge statement and I think what you see is a lot of brave guys are being
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:48.120]  they're being brought back here after being completely desensitized over and
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:52.040]  in these foreign these foreign wars and they just don't have the knowledge
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.400]  because I mean you know a nobody nobody learned anything about constitutional
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:29:02.880]  anything in the in the 80s other problem a lot of guys are smart or
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:07.120]  understand or have discernment they don't use them they can pick from this
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:12.160]  pool these cadres and then they expand the cadres to a full conversion to a
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.840]  paramilitary secret police intelligence a web that's already dwarfing East
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:22.920]  Germany per capita and and I wish I could talk to you for hours and and I
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.840]  want to go to Chris and and Clarence you know I'm gonna do a couple hours this

[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:06.400]  he's a leader and he's having an effect out there and he was demonized in the
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:09.280]  Mayak report along with Ron Paul and they said this is the enemy of the
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:12.880]  government this is who the police are being trained to take on and now we know
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:15.640]  from the Washington Post confirming what we'd already covered that there's
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:20.360]  854,000 private spies the threat fusion centers are merging the military and
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:24.960]  police the CIA is over that they're basically having school of America type
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:30.680]  secret police training for the police and it's so frightening it's being done
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:33.920]  by the offshore banks who want global government on record global
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.880]  government's now been announced it's happening and we've got to reach out to
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.320]  our military and police now we of course played a club of Stuart Rhodes talking
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:44.840]  about that in the last hour with Oathkeepers but I wanted to get into
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:49.040]  his new article DC declares war on the states will also jam in Chris and
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:52.760]  Arizona and Clarence and Oklahoma who want to do a former military want to
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:56.960]  comment on that we've confirmed the Austin SWAT team and others this is in
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:01.640]  the Fort Hood Sentinel are training the lockdown cities are training for gun
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:06.200]  confiscation in Iraq so this is so incredible what's happening they're
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.640]  trying to turn the military and police against us we've got to reach out to
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:13.680]  them now and educate them like our lives depend on it Chuck Baldwin great to have
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:17.440]  you on with us sir thank you Alex good to be with you again let's break down
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:20.920]  your concern with what's happening in our world the globalists are now out of
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:27.480]  the closet you've written an excellent piece DC declares war on the states yes
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:34.080]  and of course that's exactly what this lawsuit against Arizona is it is a
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:38.320]  declaration of war against the sovereignty and the independence of that
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:43.720]  state and by implication against every state in the country without a doubt the
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:47.040]  Obama administration and the administration before him quite frankly
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:54.240]  had no desire to honor the laws of our country and to do something substantive
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:59.760]  against illegal immigration they in fact under George W. Bush the floodgates
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:05.160]  were opened and over half I would guess of all of the illegal immigrants that
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:09.720]  are in this country today came across the border since George W. Bush became
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.720]  president and now that Arizona has stepped up the plate and said okay
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.920]  federal government you're not going to do it we're going to defend ourselves we
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:21.640]  are going to stop this invasion against our state against our citizens our
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:27.240]  people are being killed properties being destroyed we cannot afford the crime
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:31.000]  and everything else that goes along with this invasion and they did what any
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.760]  sensible people would do that is they decided to defend themselves and what
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:40.200]  does the federal government do it decides to file a lawsuit against the state
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:45.240]  now as far as I'm concerned that is a declaration of war against the state of
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:51.440]  Arizona oh I agree with you and I had Sheriff Babu on it made some
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:57.080]  state and national headlines last week and I said is it not treason when you
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:01.080]  have a crime wave Arizona is now the capital of kidnapping in the US starting
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:05.840]  to mirror Mexico City you have police being killed farmers ranchers being
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.760]  killed 80 plus miles of the state federal signs up saying don't go down
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:16.040]  this road don't go in this national park you have just just incredible crime
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:20.520]  waves Mexico is a failed state has collapsed the State Department even
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:23.920]  missed that and then Arizona says if we pull somebody over for speeding or
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:29.320]  drunk driving this is what the bill says and they aren't illegal alien upon
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:33.640]  first contact we're going to take him to jail and the feds say not only are we
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:38.600]  gonna sue you we're gonna support the sanctuary cities this is the SPP
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:43.440]  globalization is it not with Bush signing it Obama continuing it high
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:47.880]  treason the definition of high treason is is is siding with the foreign power
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:52.200]  against your sovereignty and your interest is it not high treason to be
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:55.880]  leaving our borders wide open and then trying to block a state when they're
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:00.800]  begging for aid and literally under attack I have no problem with your
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:05.320]  definition Alex I think that what has been going on in Washington DC for
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.640]  quite a while is nothing short of treason what you consider in Los
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:17.840]  Angeles 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide 95% in 2004 of the last
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:22.880]  year we have stats for this we're targeting illegal aliens up to two
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:28.320]  thirds of all fugitive felony warrants were for illegal aliens some report say
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:32.960]  that 83% of warrants for murder in Phoenix 86% of warrants for murder and
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:38.240]  Albuquerque New Mexico are for illegal aliens remember that illegal aliens
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:45.120]  killed something like 12 American citizens every single day and they
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.680]  killed more American citizens that have been killed in Iraq and
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:55.120]  Afghanistan combined and they kill that many each year and then they kill
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:00.840]  another 13 by drunk driving on the streets of America every day every single
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:06.120]  day and you think about the the death and carnage not to mention the the
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:10.920]  crimes that you alluded to a moment ago and that this this is a war this is war
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:14.960]  against the people of the United States of America and the border states
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.360]  are feeling the brunt of it and I thank God for Jan Brewer and the people there
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:23.480]  in Arizona and all the American people need to support these folks now
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:27.120]  meanwhile the feds are doing everything they can to leave illegal aliens alone
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:32.160]  it's on record in sanctuary cities they let them go for drunk driving assault
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:37.200]  just it's incredible in major cities like Oakland the police are announcing
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.480]  they're not going to respond to burglaries grand theft auto cutting
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.400]  power lines and 37 other crimes but there's unlimited federal money to
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:50.960]  federalized police and train them in intelligence meetings that we have video
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.280]  of that the founding fathers are bad I have that in my film Rotary that gun
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:00.680]  owners are bad that returning veterans and constitutionalist and Chuck Baldwin
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:05.840]  and Ron Paul are bad and the Gadsden flag is bad and the American flag on a
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:11.880]  car is bad I mean this is absurd this is like money python or something well
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:17.080]  yeah unfortunately this is a this is the world we live in today I just produced
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:21.080]  a column today Alex you should be getting a shortly called top secret
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:26.320]  America the rest of the story I take off on that Washington Post report that
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:30.920]  came out you know last week talking about the secret government of course they
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:36.240]  do more of a cover-up than anything else the Washington Post you can imagine but
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:42.680]  by virtue of what they do bring to light I think just gives verification just
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:46.560]  things that you and I've been talking about for a number of years and that is
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.280]  that there are elements within our federal government that have designs
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:56.520]  against the freedoms and the liberties of the people that do not want to uphold
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:01.160]  their office to you know to the Constitution and they are using the
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:09.480]  military establishment to train for the purposes of a potentially corralling
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:14.240]  and some doing the American citizenry I've got I give some quotes in my column
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:18.840]  today from Joel Scouson's World Affairs Brief who's done some some excellent
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.120]  research into what's been going on on the dark side of these federal police
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:28.320]  agencies and how they're training some of these people over in Iraq to find out
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:31.160]  which ones are going to be ruthless enough which ones are going to be
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:37.040]  unprincipled enough which ones can they use as little killing machines to turn
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:41.840]  on the American people whenever they feel it's necessary the NSA is involved in
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:47.000]  all kinds of dark and sinister activities and I go into some of that in
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.800]  my column today just the stuff that you've been talking about for a long time
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:55.960]  but now then as you said it's out in the open they used to try to hide it now
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.760]  they're not hiding it anymore I think more and more the American people are
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:02.360]  beginning to wake up quite frankly well again Chuck Baldwin presidential
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.640]  candidate 2008 Constitution Party joins us we'll give you his website in a moment
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:10.080]  to read his great columns we also carry them at info wars dot com and prison
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:14.760]  planet dot com but everything in that Washington Post report as you said as a
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:18.880]  whitewash it in regard is there they don't mention that with license to kill
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:23.160]  orders with tens of thousands at the time four years ago when it leaked it
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:28.040]  was it was 50,000 plus the clergy response teams we got that three years
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.400]  before it was mainstream news now they admit tens of thousands of preachers
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:38.640]  are giving FEMA teaching materials saying render under Caesar Romans 13 go
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:43.120]  to the FEMA camp turn your guns in take the inoculation this is a giant
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:49.880]  strategic secret program with millions of spies federalizing police using Iraq
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:54.640]  as a laboratory to create ruthless killers to then come back and tell them
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:59.200]  Chuck Baldwin Ron Paul they're the enemy you have the New York Times with
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:02.840]  explorer scouts and other reports saying they're training to take on
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:06.720]  disgruntled vets people laugh well those are 14-year-old kids well that came out
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:11.200]  two years ago in two years they're gonna be 18 you know they're 16 now it's
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:15.600]  happening nationwide the LAPD's taking over the Boy Scouts they're openly
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:19.760]  training them to wage war against the American people this this is how Germany
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:26.320]  fell this is how China fell this is what Russia did this is textbook 100% red
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.760]  alert and it's going on right behind the curtain and now the curtains coming
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:36.480]  back and we see it and I know I'm ranting sir I'm just so worried this is
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.200]  so real nobody thought we'd have government-run health care nobody thought
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.840]  they'd start all these new wars now you know one could believe all the
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:47.240]  surveillance and all and the bank stealing trillions but it's all
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:54.120]  happening sure and as I as I say in my column today you know basically all of
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:58.240]  the safeguards that were put in place by the founding fathers to protect our
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:03.120]  freedoms constitutionally have dissipated one by one and to the point
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:09.960]  that now as I see it Alex we only have two defenses left and I think number one
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:17.000]  we have state autonomy state sovereignty and I think to put Chad Brewer and her
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.880]  fellow Arizonans are doing is just the first shot across the bow it won't be
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.000]  the last and it's got the globalist scared and other states are lining up
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:30.480]  saying oh yeah I mean you look at Montana and Tennessee that you know past
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:33.880]  the firearms freedom act in their state you got a legislator in the state of
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:37.480]  Georgia who's passing similar legislation except it deals with all
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:42.000]  products not just firearms I mean I would guess to say what there are
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:48.480]  probably over 20 states right now that are in various stages of declaring
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:54.200]  independence and and sovereignty to resist this little bias and that's in
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.120]  Washington DC so that's the first thing and then the other thing of course is
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:01.600]  is what the founders said in the Second Amendment of the right of the people to
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:06.640]  keep their arms and that was not for the purpose of duck hunting or target
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:10.720]  shooting that was for the purpose of protecting ourselves against the
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.680]  totalitarian tendencies of our own central government because they had been
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.000]  through a tyranny absolutely they had lived it they'd experienced it they knew
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.160]  that the American people were not properly armed and prepared to defend
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:28.880]  themselves that they would not maintain freedom very long as I see it Alex those
[02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:35.240]  are the those are the two made major defense of the defenses that we have
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:38.480]  left at this point in time in our history and I think we need to start
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.320]  focusing on our state governments our governor's races are instead of getting
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:49.160]  60% turnout for a for a presidential election how about 60% locally and this
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:52.720]  is do or die and I want to talk more about solutions with you and then try to
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:56.520]  jam in a few calls with Chuck Baldwin today but but Chuck how do you see the
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:00.680]  globalist countering all of this because the pendulum is clearly swinging back
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:05.080]  there's a huge political realignment the the system even admits did you read the
[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:09.360]  Financial Times of London where Robert Shapiro told Obama you need an Oklahoma
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:14.120]  City or a 9-11 so that you can look like a powerful leader I'm really concerned
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:20.000]  Chuck about them staging crises I am too and Don Backelvaney I was with him in
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.560]  Denver just this past weekend and we had a great conference out there with some
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:28.920]  real terrific Patriots and he talked about that very thing as well he's
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:33.120]  concerned that there could be some kind of a false flag terrorist attack of some
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.560]  sort between now and the elections yeah I think what they're going to try to do
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:41.120]  it's what they've done and that is to try to you know demonize people like us
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.880]  like the Mayak report and these other things and they're gonna they're
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:50.840]  gonna go to their stooches there in Montgomery at the SLP and
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:55.360]  you know try to categorize us as nuts and so forth but the fact of the matter
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:01.240]  is I do believe that the pendulum is swinging toward state sovereignty state
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:05.560]  independence especially in some states not all the states of course some of
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.520]  the states are too far gone but but the states along the southwest and Oklahoma
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:13.840]  and even in Texas where you are though I know you got a big battle there with the
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:17.440]  big cities the big city governments that you're fighting but you go to
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:23.240]  Montana Wyoming Idaho the Dakotas you go down to Utah I mean there's even
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:26.760]  Tennessee South Carolina New Hampshire Vermont there's a lot of states around
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:31.800]  the country that are really really beginning to see increased activity
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:35.160]  among their people for the freedom fight and I really think it's going to
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.880]  continue and I'm not pessimistic at all Alex I do believe that we can win this
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:45.440]  thing well I agree with you and you know for those that just tuned in we're not
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:49.600]  joking about this this is so hardcore when you study the facts and what the
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.200]  feds even admit they're doing and they've already stolen so much money and
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:57.640]  done so many illegal things they're not backing off people you understand just
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:01.680]  like other countries have fallen to tyranny it's happening here and everybody
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:06.400]  needs to hit their knees and pray to God to also you know give them discernment
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.440]  and people need to realize all of you are leaders in this fight whatever you
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:14.080]  can do now to spread the word that what's happening in Washington is
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:18.720]  illegal and the solution is at the states and that the globalists are gonna
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:22.720]  pull out every dirty trick they can I had a caller earlier that trains law
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.880]  enforcement in Texas and he said what you had just said that in fact it's
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.560]  incredible he said that they're training at the fusion centers and getting the
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:34.280]  hardcore killers from Iraq and selecting you know kind of the lunatics
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:38.560]  that have been mentally you know broken down by three four five tours and that
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:44.480]  they are forging them as pretty much a school of Americas takeover operation
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:48.480]  secret police torture everything here in the United States and he wanted me to
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:54.120]  ask you about that in school of Americas well I've heard these I've heard these
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:50:00.840]  things and I certainly do not discount them and in fact Joel Scousen and his
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:05.920]  most recent newsletter he mentioned that as well and Joel as you know is as
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:12.720]  well researched as any man in America I think that that is going on but again I
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:17.880]  want to focus on what you just said and that is the answer is a resurrection a
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:23.200]  revival a resurgence of state independence and sovereignty the founders
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:29.880]  were so wise whenever the Constitution was created in 1787 the states did not
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:35.760]  surrender their sovereignty they still maintain their independence and I think
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:40.720]  that at the end of the day Alex it is going to be the state government so the
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:44.520]  governors and the leaders and the people of those states they're gonna stand up
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.640]  and they're gonna put this new world order in their place and I tell you I
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:52.320]  do think that they're worried about that and that means that we are on the
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:56.320]  right track God bless you stay there Chuck Balvin's our guest we'll give you his

[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:35.480]  secret America the rest of the story article out that's excellent I'm glad
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:39.240]  you reminded me about Joel Scalson of course Cleon Scalson his uncle wrote
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:42.320]  the naked communist or was the naked capitalist I forget exposing the whole
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:46.840]  banker takeover and he's a great guy I'm gonna get him on about his intel about
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:51.200]  using the troops in Iraq domestically but that's now all admitted but in
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:58.080]  closing Obama is dropping like a rock the globalist or cornered rats they're
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:01.960]  not invincible but so many Christian churches have been taught that it's the
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.400]  end of the world so we should just lay down and go along with Romans 13 as a
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:10.840]  pastor what's your view on that man you just hit my my hot button Alex I tell
[02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:15.160]  you what we would not be in the shape we're in today if the pastors in America
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:21.800]  had not just laid down on the job some of it's the 501c3 tax exempt status some
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:26.480]  of it is just plain old-fashioned laziness some of it is ignorance but
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:31.680]  whatever the reason you know they have used that Romans 13 mantra for so long
[02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:37.840]  to sedate the churches of this country and to cause them to be lethargic and
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:42.040]  they're using it against us and I'm sure that for some of them it's not
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:48.160]  intentional but boy that that result has been for the most part the church of the
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:54.280]  Lord Jesus has been totally ineffective in standing against the forces of evil in
[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:59.520]  this country and I don't see a lot of turnaround on the horizon in that regard
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:05.720]  either and that's why I think that God is raising up the people like Alex Jones
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:11.200]  and and the Ron Paul revolution and campaign for liberty and and a lot of
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:14.200]  these other groups that are out there that are standing against the new world
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:17.920]  order and they're they're standing for the things that are right if the churches
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:21.160]  and the preachers had have been doing it all along we wouldn't be in this shape
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:24.600]  but they're not doing it for the most part and that's why I've got a lot of
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:28.320]  people that watch me online Alex quite frankly we live stream our Sunday
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:32.240]  morning services every Sunday and we got people that's that watch us because they
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.560]  can't find a church in their hometown that they can go to and get the truth so
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.560]  you know whatever the whatever the reason you're right the pastors have just not
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:45.600]  been doing the job it you know if the colonial preachers in America at the
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.000]  founding era had acted and believed like the churches and the pastors are doing
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:56.880]  today America would not exist we would be a crown colony of England today with
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:00.840]  no bill of rights and very little freedom they led the rebellion against
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.920]  King George III absolutely without that what they called the black regiment
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:09.800]  that that group of the Patriot clergymen leading the way and preaching the
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:14.840]  sermons and giving them the inspiration and the information that they needed to
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:18.920]  to wage that fight for independence if they had not done that there is no
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:25.160]  question that the Revolutionary War would have never taken place in fact
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:28.800]  some of the first people killed at the start of the war were prominent pastors
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:34.760]  well let's remember that that the shot heard around the world there at
[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:42.600]  Concord and Lexington that was that those shots were fired by Christian men of
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:49.760]  one congregation the church at Lexington the pastor's name was Jonas Clark they
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:55.400]  were the militiamen they were the ones that came to the defense at Concord and
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:58:00.560]  Lexington first at Lexington and then a Concord Bridge of course and others came
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:05.840]  to their assistance as the as the battle grew but the first meant the first
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:11.520]  ones that stood up there at Lexington grain against the crowns forces that
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:17.320]  had come to arrest John Hancock and Sam Adams and take the guns was was that
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:25.280]  pastor and his congregation beautifully put Chuck Baldwin live.com we look
