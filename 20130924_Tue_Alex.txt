[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:35.000]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.920]  members of this committee have accused me of providing false information when I
[00:39.920 --> 00:43.720]  responded to questions about the IRS processing of applications for tax
[00:43.720 --> 00:53.360]  exemption I have not done anything wrong well there you go ladies and gentlemen
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.720]  Lois Lerner has not done anything wrong there she is in your face telling you
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.400]  that and of course now all the memos have come out well a small portion of
[01:04.400 --> 01:09.000]  memos have come out they're blocking 90% of them coming out and it shows that
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.720]  they were premeditatedly under White House orders her securing people for
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.800]  their pro-america pro-liberty ideas this is the essence of oppression the essence
[01:19.800 --> 01:25.120]  of tyranny the essence of criminality and now she's perjured herself because it
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.160]  doesn't matter if you take the fifth that means you don't talk whatever you say
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.240]  though in the testimony is then admissible and it is perjury to
[01:33.240 --> 01:39.560]  Congress a felony that's open and shut ladies and gentlemen I take the fifth but
[01:39.560 --> 01:43.680]  I did not murder that person and then it turns out you murdered them or I take
[01:43.680 --> 01:46.440]  the fifth I was not part of the bank robbery and they released footage of you
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.000]  part of the bank robbery you have committed perjury oh but instead she
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.200]  is reportedly going to get millions of dollars over the next decade hundreds of
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.480]  thousands a year of taxpayer money stolen from citizens as her pension so
[02:01.480 --> 02:09.580]  she has pulled the lever pulled the cord the rip cord on her golden taxpayer
[02:09.580 --> 02:15.280]  funded parachute and you read the memos that came out a few weeks ago it's I'm
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.000]  so scared of these tea parties they're so evil criticizing us we've got to shut
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.800]  them down they're scary they're not allowed to do that in America these
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.800]  people are just these knitting authoritarians that we all bow down to
[02:29.800 --> 02:36.040]  that we all begin groveling to so we're going to be going over some of that
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.760]  today and speaking of only 10% of the documents being released here is a
[02:39.760 --> 02:45.560]  CNS news report IRS has produced only 10% of Doc's response of the demand by
[02:45.560 --> 02:51.000]  Congress well you know why even the ones they've released have got them you know
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.760]  saying Obama wants this handled he's very angry at the tea party this is his
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.640]  wish because the underling she was over the tax exempt group one of the top
[03:00.640 --> 03:05.200]  IRS people were like a really this is pretty illegal I mean Nixon got in
[03:05.200 --> 03:08.240]  trouble for this he only had a couple hundred people on the list this is
[03:08.240 --> 03:14.800]  thousands these are dangerous scary people toilet safety police shoes off
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.760]  pants off I mean this is what they're up to and we make jokes about it these
[03:19.760 --> 03:26.360]  people are larceness and she needs to be sued civilly because here's the big
[03:26.360 --> 03:34.160]  issue you're not going to see the mafioso mr. brainwash the American people
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.840]  Eric Holder a fast and furious and all the other cover-ups going on you're
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.640]  not going to see him prosecute her now so she now escapes with all the loot and
[03:44.640 --> 03:52.000]  she had said that she was not going to resign ever ever ever ever she was proud
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.720]  of herself and I have done nothing wrong we have not tired of the tea party
[03:56.720 --> 04:04.520]  of proletariat such a lie I tell you lie about me and you know and I'm gonna lie
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.360]  cuz I take the fifth that taking the fifth means I come up here lie you that's
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.000]  the new fifth amendment I get on the stand and I tell you lies I didn't order
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.880]  anybody to target these groups how dare Congress say I did that how dare anybody
[04:18.880 --> 04:27.680]  these people liars and then meanwhile she gave the order but it doesn't matter
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.120]  cuz she's simpering and so it's okay I mean it's like Ted Turner said yesterday
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.840]  women should run everything of course they do run things in many respects look
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.360]  at Bloody Mary look at was late it bathed in blood over in the Transylvania what
[04:43.360 --> 04:46.400]  was her name I mean you know there's been a lot of women running things and they
[04:46.400 --> 04:49.240]  run the UN and they're running the Syria war right now and they're running the
[04:49.240 --> 04:55.320]  persecution of free speech so the answer is more women I tell you the tea party

[08:44.280 --> 08:53.520]  day of September 2013 worldwide broadcast we are going to be joined by the
[08:53.520 --> 09:01.280]  former agent a senior agent with the secret service to give us his take on
[09:01.280 --> 09:06.160]  the naval yard shooting and what just happened over in Nairobi Kenya Dan Bon
[09:06.160 --> 09:10.040]  Gino will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour and then
[09:10.040 --> 09:16.800]  Jim Mars investigative journalist will join us with a major whistleblower in
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.400]  fact Jim Mars we called me this weekend wanting to give us this exclusive was
[09:21.400 --> 09:25.560]  actually catching his breath and hyperventilating something I've never
[09:25.560 --> 09:32.960]  heard him do before over Tosh Plumlee joining us coming up in the third hour
[09:32.960 --> 09:38.720]  today and I'll give you a bigger description of that coming up so you'll
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.280]  definitely want to tell your friends and family to tune in to the third hour of
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.680]  the worldwide transmission today whether you listen on AM and FM affiliates XM
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.160]  the internet at info wars.com or whether you listen on WWCR global
[09:53.160 --> 10:00.800]  shortwave or other ways that are out there as well okay where to start we're
[10:00.800 --> 10:06.840]  to start here today the top story on info wars.com probably needs to have a
[10:06.840 --> 10:13.920]  breaking added to the front of it and needs to be red-linked because I walked
[10:13.920 --> 10:17.720]  in this morning when I saw I'm working on this and I said I hadn't thought about
[10:17.720 --> 10:23.080]  this and I haven't seen anybody else report this and so we are breaking this
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.320]  right now and the reason this is important that the story Kid Daniels
[10:27.320 --> 10:32.880]  just posted 10 minutes ago to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.160]  reason this is important is this is the type of thing that will kill Obamacare
[10:38.160 --> 10:44.680]  as people find out it's going to cost them an extra 7,800 bucks a year the
[10:44.680 --> 10:48.680]  congressional budget office is now saying in the first year as it begins to
[10:48.680 --> 10:57.240]  be implemented starting next week extra $7,000 a year and it's set to go up
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.280]  even more because the insurance companies wrote it to make you pay for it I
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.320]  mean if you've got a controlled market you've got to buy something and the
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.720]  Supreme Court has ruled its attacks Katie bar the door and of course as you
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.360]  know that's just one of the little nightmare facets of it and they're
[11:14.360 --> 11:20.640]  not letting people see what their insurance shopping choices are in the
[11:20.640 --> 11:24.920]  limited choices they give you kind of like at a prison mess hall you've got
[11:24.920 --> 11:30.040]  choice between rotten horse meat and you know rotten beef or something or
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.160]  stinking beans or stinking rice I mean you've got I guess a couple choices you
[11:34.160 --> 11:40.000]  can drink rotten milk or you can drink stale orange juice I don't know but
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.760]  they won't let you know until the day it's implemented and that's because the
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.160]  Obamacare bill is thousands of pages long tens of thousands and addendums and
[11:48.160 --> 11:54.120]  riders as you know last time I heard the final bill was over 10,000 pages if that
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.160]  guys looked that up see my memory serves the point is it was a big bill written
[11:57.160 --> 12:01.840]  by special interest NAFTA was 30 something thousand pages and it's
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.360]  written so all the big insiders are exempt like Congress and the big
[12:05.360 --> 12:09.360]  companies and the rest of them it's designed to small and medium corporations
[12:09.360 --> 12:15.160]  have to implement it as a handicap to them Obamacare regulations are eight
[12:15.160 --> 12:20.120]  times longer than the Bible that's CNS news and then how many pages is it
[12:20.120 --> 12:27.760]  actually that's 10,516 pages and that's in small print so my memory served we
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.720]  just do a little test here on the air to make sure I'm being accurate because
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.920]  I'm so neurotic about being accurate that I test my memory which sometimes is
[12:37.920 --> 12:43.840]  wrong and of course it was wrong there it was 10,000 plus pages I just said
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.280]  10,000 so people are now learning about the full horror and they don't want you
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.720]  to know how it's gonna be implemented fully until it hits you like if I was
[12:54.720 --> 12:57.560]  trying to run somebody over I wouldn't want them to know I was trying to run
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.040]  them over till it was too late so they want to have you dead politically and
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.040]  it's already hit you like a freight train so that you can't politically get
[13:06.040 --> 13:10.480]  involved to stop its implementation they want to just go ahead and run you over
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.440]  immediately and get that over with as quickly as possible kind of like the
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.920]  last five versions of the immigration bill under Bush and Obama senator
[13:19.920 --> 13:22.960]  Sessions God bless him always ends up leaking it and they say he violates
[13:22.960 --> 13:28.640]  Senate rules it's secret bills secret bills and whenever you get the bill it
[13:28.640 --> 13:34.200]  legalizes felons and actually gives them money that's in the news now again in
[13:34.200 --> 13:38.840]  the fifth or sixth of the fifth or sixth version as Obama's had two versions so
[13:38.840 --> 13:43.600]  Bush had for Obama's had to excuse me it's six versions the sixth version is
[13:43.600 --> 13:50.440]  the exact same one the first one Bush tried to get past eight years ago was it
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.240]  nine years ago time is just flying so it is the exact same thing just like
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.160]  Romney care written by the insurance companies and banks then becomes Obama
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.960]  care it's the same people running the puppet politicians it's just with
[14:02.960 --> 14:11.280]  Obama his cult like followers will do anything under the cult belief that he
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.400]  really cares about him while he absolutely rips them off and cons them
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.000]  and pimps them out they love it they love it I see so many I mean it's
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.600]  seeing more Obama stickers in Austin than I used to like I saw twice yesterday
[14:26.600 --> 14:34.480]  Obama 2012 their new stickers like hey we won we're winners we the bosses we the
[14:34.480 --> 14:44.400]  bosses to a quote the movie hop and Hillary 2016 and imagine they really
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.560]  think Hillary cares about them they really think Obama cares about them and
[14:47.560 --> 14:51.440]  they really think they're winning right now they really think that and they're
[14:51.440 --> 14:57.360]  gonna love this too the TSA has been found on average to be the most criminal
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.840]  the most abusive the most larcenist I mean the their I see articles of TSA
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.880]  agents being arrested every day for pedophilia every day for rape every day
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.200]  for child porn every day for robbing people in the parking lot every day for
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.920]  stealing prescription drugs out of people's bags every day they're being
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.680]  arrested every single day they are in fact the last week they're having
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.320]  stings all over the country busting just scores of TSA agents robbing people
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.360]  selling loot TSA agents have testified to Congress that many TSA agents steal
[15:34.360 --> 15:43.240]  up to a million dollars a year they run fencing operations they run hijacking
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.760]  operations of loot now that they're taking over port authorities the Viper
[15:48.760 --> 15:52.800]  teams you know my dad worked on the railroad a couple years when I was a
[15:52.800 --> 15:57.400]  baby at night and then went to dental school during the day old-fashioned
[15:57.400 --> 16:01.240]  hard-working American and I remember he was retelling the story to my son and
[16:01.240 --> 16:04.880]  my daughters we were on a fishing trip this weekend about how he would not
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.600]  steal televisions and stuff out of the trains at the big switchyard in Dallas
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.280]  and he got the job because his it was nepotism he was hard-working because his
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.280]  his grandfather had been the head of a particularly important stretch of railroad
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.800]  a railroad company I won't even get into a small railroad but even the he'd been
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.960]  the head of that we've been the mayor to of that town not Dallas on their town
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.040]  that's all a side issue point is he got that plum job it's like a union job and
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.880]  they wanted to killing they said they took they carried guns to they said
[16:36.880 --> 16:40.760]  listen well then most of them were like former Vietnam special forces people this
[16:40.760 --> 16:46.720]  was in like 1976 1977 they said we're basically gonna kill you if you don't
[16:46.720 --> 16:49.840]  take some of this loot it's like a surpoly story he just said look I'm not
[16:49.840 --> 16:53.160]  gonna you know just I'm gonna be a professional I don't want to do this and
[16:53.160 --> 16:56.560]  I know you've got sanctions from the top of what you're allowed to rob because
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.160]  they'd have what they call documents coming in billions in cash would come
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.000]  into to the Federal Reserve right there from all over the region so they didn't
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.160]  hit that they were told what they could rob I don't know if I'm allowed to tell
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.520]  this story actually I don't even know how I just digressed off into this the
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.040]  point is he quit that job early and was an exterminator for the last year of
[17:16.040 --> 17:21.280]  dental school does he make good money doing that in South Dallas my dad was
[17:21.280 --> 17:28.320]  an exterminator in South Dallas the last year of dental school but he had to
[17:28.320 --> 17:31.160]  quit that job because he went to higher ups people they just said this is the
[17:31.160 --> 17:35.000]  way it is but but I mean that's how America runs and and that was back in

[34:33.420 --> 34:38.860]  sky is blue and the planets spins through the heavens it is because of Nancy
[34:38.860 --> 34:45.900]  Pelosi don't you realize that and anyone that stands against it is a dangerous
[34:45.900 --> 34:51.300]  piece of filth just like Lois Lerner said who took the Fifth Amendment and
[34:51.300 --> 34:54.780]  then went on to say she hadn't spied on anybody and hadn't burst you to anybody
[34:54.780 --> 35:00.300]  and now all her orders from Obama are public and she's not going to prison
[35:00.300 --> 35:06.580]  because the Justice Department is captured and held by a mob don a man
[35:06.580 --> 35:11.900]  that gives public speeches about brainwashing the public because he's
[35:11.900 --> 35:18.260]  Eric Holder he knows best he's going to teach you and everyone falls to their
[35:18.260 --> 35:23.900]  knees and fear and bows to him because that's the American way oh yes
[35:23.900 --> 35:30.580]  whatever you say master whatever you want we give into you our souls are
[35:30.580 --> 35:36.460]  timid we bow to the biggest pile of garbage we can find we we we instinctively
[35:36.460 --> 35:40.620]  believe that we give into tyranny we're empowered even though history and all
[35:40.620 --> 35:45.620]  common-sense shows that's the worst most horrible course and it cowards should
[35:45.620 --> 35:49.980]  fight tyranny if they had any idea but they don't even have the stomach to be
[35:49.980 --> 35:56.420]  men and so what they fear will be visited upon them
[35:57.500 --> 36:03.420]  so close your eyes look deep inside go insane ladies and gentlemen and submit
[36:03.420 --> 36:09.420]  to the New World Order they love you they're there to help you drink extra
[36:09.420 --> 36:15.900]  fluoride water take all the shots eat all the GMOs eat all the lucky charms and
[36:15.900 --> 36:20.740]  support the drug war publicly run by the drug dealers themselves oh it's not enough
[36:20.740 --> 36:23.820]  to ship the drugs in they want to then catch you with what they sold to you and
[36:23.820 --> 36:27.580]  put you in one of their private prisons owned by banks that publicly bring in
[36:27.580 --> 36:33.260]  the drugs I mean it's so elementary it's what it's for our safety and then
[36:33.260 --> 36:37.100]  there's all the crime involved with drugs so they've got to expand all the
[36:37.100 --> 36:42.980]  paramilitary forces to counter that when in truth they're just corralling the
[36:42.980 --> 36:48.740]  domesticated crime culture they've created and they have MTV and movies
[36:48.740 --> 36:53.580]  glorify the drug dealers so all the idiot young people go and become drug
[36:53.580 --> 36:58.900]  dealers to supply the fodder for the system to go out into the streets as
[36:58.900 --> 37:05.380]  Jim Morrison said the streets are fields that never die oh they're just
[37:05.380 --> 37:10.340]  harvesting your children harvesting your money your house being robbed they

[38:06.780 --> 38:11.020]  you but if you just open your eyes ladies and gentlemen and see the enemy
[38:11.020 --> 38:14.420]  then you'd understand why I'm so freaked out because every day I got to sit

[38:18.300 --> 38:22.700]  all their tricks knowing all their games and watching you just lay down to these
[38:22.700 --> 38:26.580]  wolves so they can tear your guts out while you're still alive that's how

[38:41.100 --> 38:45.900]  they eat the awful inside the intestines and I sit there watching all the
[38:45.900 --> 38:49.340]  children they're giving autism the children they're maiming as they just
[38:49.340 --> 38:53.180]  tear chopping their heads off would be nicer but instead they want to just tear
[38:53.180 --> 38:57.740]  the guts out of them and suck their parents dry just like the bullets were
[38:57.740 --> 39:03.060]  designed the 223 to wound somebody and hurt them really bad so that they would
[39:03.060 --> 39:07.100]  cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of and create a moral
[39:07.100 --> 39:12.020]  breakdown in the society that's the same thing they just want to wound you make
[39:12.020 --> 39:16.060]  sure it kills you but takes a few decades so they can suck all that

[55:44.100 --> 55:47.940]  death threats and been physically attacked and stuff and then one of my

[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.700]  with breaking news we had an article yesterday he wrote exclusively for
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:09.380]  inforge.com giving you kind of a foray or a foretaste but he's got a big
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.460]  whistleblower who says he's gotten old enough where he doesn't care he's being
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.580]  called testified to Congress Fox News must listen to the show because Friday I
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:25.340]  barely mentioned Jim Mars and this connection to Benghazi and Fox News
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:31.180]  called him two hours after they're on the ball on this Benghazi thing I mean
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.820]  they are listening to this show I mean I already know that from insiders there
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:41.020]  but we get them first Tosh Plumlee I hate to even mention who's coming on as
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:47.460]  they might get to him and shut him up in fact I don't even believe where he's
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.300]  gonna be doing the show from but the point is is that big whistleblower big
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:01.380]  Iran contra figure he's gonna be joining us coming up at the start of the next
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.980]  hour but he's not gonna be with cell phone probably 10 15 minutes all he can
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:15.260]  all he can do they contacted me well actually Jim did and then we I kind of
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.940]  ass-hold around and didn't tell the guys when I wanted him on so we got him on
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.500]  the day so they're getting him on maybe tomorrow we could get him at his house
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.260]  from a phone she's actually gonna be at work but we'll see how that goes that's
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:32.300]  coming up that's coming up at the start of the next hour if you just joined us
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.500]  I'm hopping mad over this and actually went into a conniption earlier door to
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:41.420]  door identity theft likely under Obamacare as with the TSA a new wave of
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.820]  bureaucrats will abuse their power this time by stealing your identities and then
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:51.340]  I was reading the House committee that warned Obama about this on the 20th in a
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.780]  letter to the Health and Human Services the US House Committee on Energy and
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.980]  Commerce said they're worried about groups like Acorn that are gonna be given
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:07.300]  the contracts and given people's social security numbers and by the way this is
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:11.820]  about four days and we're breaking it and I cannot come up with a headline
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:18.060]  hardcore enough the corruption is so open so ridiculous so off the charts do I
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.700]  have to describe to people that now your medical info and your personal info

[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.020]  big and just as strong as our military to quote Obama that are Democratic Party
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:35.140]  goons given government power just like the Attorney General's gone to the
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.300]  churches and told them that as long as they're anti-gun pro-abortion anti-
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.740]  family do whatever they want here's government money government run
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:48.100]  churches faith-based initiatives started under Bush how bad that is to have

[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:34.020]  well continuing here off-duty soldier armed with handgun saves a hundred lives
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.900]  during mull siege you will not hear that in the US press it was a British Royal
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:42.420]  Marine off-duty and it looks like was not supposed to be carrying the handgun
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.980]  but still did it smart guy so he reportedly saved really over a hundred
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.500]  people Islamic terror groups are killing Christians all over the world and
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:56.980]  Obama wants to ally with them that's coming up it's all on info wars.com

[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.580]  to basically invade America says the world cannot stand idly by that's a
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:14.700]  quote just to show you what the UN treaty is all about and then lowest learner
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:20.980]  who said I take the fifth the head of the tax exempt section of the IRS one of
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:25.020]  the top five people and it's you want to say I did nothing wrong I didn't go
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.540]  after anybody we didn't do this it's not true you don't take the fifth and then
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.380]  go testify she perjured herself I don't have to be a lawyer or a cop to know
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.540]  that we've interviewed a lot of constitutional lawyers but I know the
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.220]  law I'm gonna ask a guy about the law right now and give get his take if he
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.900]  thinks I'm wrong then we're gonna get into what he's a real expert on running
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.500]  the international unit for the president when the president would go
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.940]  overseas and he obviously quit famously a few years ago or last year because he
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:57.420]  could no longer go along with the anti-American stuff he saw makes beauties
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.460]  got a book that's already going up the charts it's not even out yet but you can
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:06.180]  get it at Amazon pre-order life inside the bubble and of course he is a secret
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:10.980]  service former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino who working full-time the New
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.580]  York Police Department he completed both his bachelor's and master's degree in
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.540]  psychology during his 10-year special agent with the US Secret Service Dan
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.460]  Bongino completed his second graduate degree a master's a business
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.260]  administration at Penn State University where he tested the top of his class and
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.460]  he proudly joined the Secret Service in 99 and you can go to Bongino.com he's
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.100]  one of our favorite guests what a great patriot and we appreciate him having
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.900]  time to be with us when his books officially out I want to read it and
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.540]  get him back on to tell some of the stories that are in it but before we get
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:47.620]  into the naval shooting is why we wanted to get you on and now the Benghazi part
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:54.460]  two with the Al Qaeda people in Nairobi, Kenya and that situation what do you make
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:59.620]  of Lois Werner saying I take the fifth but I didn't do any of this the fifth
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.580]  doesn't mean you go testify and then you don't get in trouble for perjury right
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.220]  the fifth means you shut up correct well you know Alex not not when you're one
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:14.700]  of the let them eat cake aristocratic life inside the bubble politicians that
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.300]  just knows all the insides I mean if you and I were to do that God forbid Alex
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:23.340]  that we you know you were being put on trial for something you said folks I'm
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.060]  going to plead the fifth but before I do it let me just say I didn't do it I had
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.540]  nothing to do with it thanks to you later you'd probably be thrown in handcuffs
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.700]  and thrown back on the stand because you did not in fact plead the fifth you gave
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.500]  testimony but don't let that affect you folks remember when you're part of the
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:44.460]  political elite and you're in the board the new bourgeoisie don't worry you're
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:47.740]  connected the president will save you I mean think about this Alex I'm
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.060]  discussing is this right and by the way thank you to your audience for their
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.020]  incredible support I'm I'm pretty flatter every time I'm on your show my
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:59.180]  Facebook page it's like thousands of new likes though but I put a post up
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:03.900]  yesterday about this specific thing on my Facebook page and I wrote in there
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.300]  that isn't amazing I had a resign from the Secret Service had to leave had to
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.100]  leave my benefits my my pension everything behind just to run for office in a
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:17.700]  free country because of the hatchet okay that was the rule this woman targets
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.540]  people like you and me and anyone else that has any kind of libertarian or a
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:26.100]  small government leaning targets you admits to it apologizes for it gets a
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.180]  taxpayer-funded vacation since May and now this one gets a taxpayer funded
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:37.860]  retirement I mean are we in the United States anymore this is amazing now
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:41.460]  absolutely you're an expert in this but it looks like racketeering when you have
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:47.060]  an organization targeting individuals to violate their rights and and auditing
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.620]  them taking their money telling churches what they can pray persecuting and
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:56.020]  then perjuring isn't that organized crime I mean in my view studying a little
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:00.060]  bit of law isn't an organized crime when a big powerful organization gets
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.620]  together to deprive people of their money and their liberty and their freedom
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.660]  well you know I'm glad you don't try to take the edge off the this thing and
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.260]  play nice nice because there's too many people doing that I said the last time I
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.700]  was on your show that you want to stop this tomorrow you start bringing people
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.060]  out of there and handcuffed you start pulling people out of there and handcuffed
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.060]  tomorrow for violating not one not two but three or four a constitutionally
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:28.780]  protected liberty you know free speech fair trial due process you name it we
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.420]  can go down the line I mean even article one section one clause when you all
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.420]  legislative powers that'll be vested in the Congress not not really there all
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.100]  legislative powers seem to be vested where the per wherever the president
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.620]  said so I mean the the amount of violation that the stomping on the
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.340]  Constitution and the shredding of it in front of your very eyes I'm telling you
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.860]  yeah like you just said you want to stop this tomorrow start putting on the
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.620]  bracelet start doing it start perp walking people outside of government
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.500]  buildings for doing this and do real investigation this will stop tomorrow but
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.020]  no one's got the guts to tell you that because everybody's all bought into this
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.220]  system and unfortunately you know some are on the Republican side as well or
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.940]  just like well you know there's a lot of fights out there right now maybe we
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.340]  should just you know let this one go no maybe we should this is not what that
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:20.020]  flag represents or stands well Dan Bongino famous secret service agent who
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:26.100]  resigned over just the outrageous things he saw and is now coming out with a
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.500]  book and he's also running for office we're gonna talk about that before you
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.740]  leave us but I want to get into the whole situation first with the shooter
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.900]  and the tragedy there at the naval yard and the SWAT team being ordered to
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:39.860]  stand down now the ATF's not allowed in looks like a cover up here and then we've
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.540]  also got the situation with Obama connected to the radical Muslims in
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:48.180]  Kenya and then Odinga and then letting them in out of Somalia and this is
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:51.740]  really getting suspicious I want to get your take on that but just briefly back
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.340]  to tyranny here when criminals and when an attorney general who's guaranteed to
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.860]  not go after lowest learner get in there and are above the law and are
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.540]  untouchable that's when you get a stall in a Hitler Amal and I really think
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:10.060]  we're getting to that point where at least he resigned but with a golden
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.900]  parachute if we don't start seeing some people get arrested for I mean Nixon
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.740]  had to resign if the president doesn't resign when he's clearly gone way past
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:24.580]  Nixon we've set precedents here that will end this country right and now it's
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.940]  keep in mind Nixon had to be pardoned I mean we're not even she wasn't there was
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.060]  no pardon because there were no charges and and and the joke of this whole thing
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:37.220]  is the accountability review report the R bond lowest learner and the IRS
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.700]  scandal and let's call it a scam it's exactly what it is that the near
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.140]  criminality that occurred in this thing the big criminality was that in the
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.500]  report they don't really say she did anything wrong they dance they they do
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.860]  a little ballet around that everything's nicely choreographed and to this day
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:57.380]  they're saying there was no targeting well if there was no targeting then why
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.060]  did the IRS apologize I don't understand they apologize to try to get out in front
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.100]  of the thing and you're right you said it the fabric of a free Liberty Loving
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.780]  Society what has made us different throughout human history is the fact
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.820]  that everyone from the president of the United States of America to your
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:18.980]  congressman to the man or woman working his butt off for $10,000 a year has the
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:24.100]  absolute same constitutional protections under our law can you really say that
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:29.340]  now can you seriously look me in the eye and I know your answer but you do your
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:32.580]  audience can you look me in the eye and say oh yeah that's the kind of country
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:38.340]  we live in now really you sure about that I'm not it's so creepy the way they
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.340]  persecuted people this is real tyranny like you read about the Soviet Union and
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.740]  now it's like all business is usual amazing shifting gears Obama has said
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:51.300]  in two speeches as you know now we should restrict our guns it's our fault
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:57.460]  that people died at the Navy are when this guy had security clearances it was
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:01.940]  a victim disarmament zone with only MPs armed and he's now calling the Fort
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.260]  Hood shooting non-terror saying it's gun owners fault that that guy clearly with
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.460]  al-Qaeda did that this is crazy well you know it's funny I was at a second
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.780]  amendment rally yesterday in Annapolis my home state here in Maryland that I ran
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:17.900]  into a few of your supporters they had your bumper stickers out there but you
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.340]  got a loyal audience out there but at the rally I brought up this exact point
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:27.020]  I mean folks this argument is now getting absurd no one is defaulting to the
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:32.020]  natural answer to this question why in God's name and I mean that I might use
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:35.180]  this name in vain because he you have a right to self-protection given you by
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.580]  God not by a bureaucrat okay are we disarming our American military
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.180]  personnel on military bases we know our target to become sheep for the wolves of
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:48.940]  society can anybody answer me that question again with a straight face
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.220]  you go to two houses as a burglar you want to break in and your arm do you go
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.380]  to the home with the sign on the front door that says I can guarantee you this
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:00.620]  homeowner is a believes in liberal policies that does not have a gun or do
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.500]  you go to the next house that says come in here fire at your own will because I'll
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.260]  shoot you first we got a 12 gauge waiting for you I mean we laugh like oh
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.620]  that's a stupid question no it's not a stupid question it's a very practical
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:16.460]  question the gun control was a myth it's a mastery of the language is no such
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.820]  thing as gun control it is a mythical argument promulgated by the left is
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.020]  absolutely determined to make your self-protection right dependent on them
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:29.140]  and and branches of the government that can't possibly do it I love our cops I
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.300]  love our military I was a cop but Alex I'll tell you when you need one in five
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:37.700]  minutes it's very rare they get there with it in any less than 10 they're not
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.940]  there to protect you that everyone forced the law that the Supreme Court
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.020]  case everybody needs to understand that this is a ridiculous argument and he's
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:49.780]  like you said these these gun-free zone I mean it's this this is just a I mean
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:54.180]  it's beyond even reasoning it's only gone they're only gun-free for the good
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.820]  guy what do you think the sign stops the bad guy they pray that they actually
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:02.620]  target gun-free zone and the bloodshed is going to continue until Americans
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.740]  wake up and find out the fact that you have a God-given right to protect
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:10.300]  yourself using the same means the wolves among look at how Obama is using the
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:16.380]  inspector general and the Pentagon to block allowing military personnel who
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.180]  live on base to have firearms so that's another gun-free zone and then you have
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:26.500]  the act passed under Bush that they still have an implement where retired
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.780]  law enforcement has a reciprocal concealed carry all over the country I
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.220]  mean this is just outrageous these bureaucrats don't even trust the
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.100]  military when the Secretary of Defense goes to Afghanistan they take all the
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.260]  guns and all the ammo from them but I'll figure my kid I was a secret service
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:47.420]  agent for 12 years lead advanced agent for the president I think in an active
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.620]  war zone in Afghanistan I can't get a carry permit Maryland right now it's
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:56.540]  taken forever it's a day of a backlog but not to mention the secret service
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:59.580]  for some unknown reason I'm probably on their pay no mind list because they
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.260]  don't like me speaking out I guess still hasn't processed my paperwork for this
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:07.060]  it's been almost a year I mean it's ridiculous let's be clear you resign
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:11.940]  upstanding you know guy four degrees all the rest of it great family guy you
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:14.980]  who I know been getting threats and stuff because you've been exposing
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:19.580]  Obama you cannot have a gun to protect your family no I can't get a concealed
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.340]  no in Maryland it takes eon it is rationing by time and the secret
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:28.540]  service will not process my paperwork it's taking forever I put the paperwork
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.260]  in six months ago I mean this is I've gotten real legitimate threats I from
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:39.220]  real people in very real jail that I arrested documented threat on recording
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:43.380]  people threatening me for investigating this isn't some paranoia this is the
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.820]  real world I have a you know I have two daughters I mean this is absolutely keep
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.460]  in mind Alex if you just wanted to go be a lawbreaker and outlaw and violate
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.780]  but take you five minutes go get a gun go travel down to Glen Bernie down the
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:58.500]  road from where I live and pick up one off the street for $500 these people
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.740]  listen I can drive to a corner in East Austin right now and in 30 minutes by
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:08.540]  anything I want I have been in the bad parts of town before and had people try
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.540]  to sell me drugs and guns I walked out one time of a grocery store and they'd
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:18.580]  go up in a trunk up and had guns right there okay Alex it's a joke I was a cop
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:24.340]  I I've never once arrested anyone for a gun crime that had the gun wait legally
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:28.260]  ever yet you arrest these guys won't be Saturday night specials that'll kill you
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:32.100]  just as quickly and you said oh hey you guys know there was a gun law against
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:37.020]  you know it concealed carry in New York huh what they don't care they laugh they
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:41.580]  think we're idiots they think we are so stupid disarming the civilian populace
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:45.180]  taking away their liberty their god-given liberty while these guys again
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.700]  this they prey on us like a bunch of sheep and they laugh they think this is
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.340]  ridiculous these these bourgeoisie but you know lawmakers keep in mind Alex all
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:59.460]  protected by men with guns I mean the hypocrisy is so absurd I was I was
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:05.700]  reading they've got 20 SWAT guys in three shifts a day sometimes up to 40 at the
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:09.900]  Capitol but then meanwhile these guys won our guns just like their exempt from
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:13.380]  Obamacare let me ask you this because you're running for Congress I wonder if
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:16.900]  a congressman once you're a congressman from Maryland if you'll be able to have
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.140]  a gun probably then tell us about the campaign a little bit that I want to
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.780]  shift gears over to a world net daily and others have confirmed Obama through
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:29.100]  Odinga his cousin and others have been funding the radical Muslims in Kenya and
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:34.340]  using that to fund the radical Muslims in other areas of Africa like Egypt and
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:40.580]  what you think of the fact that our government's funding al-Qaeda in Syria
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:44.380]  right now that's finally mainstream news well first off what's your take on that
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.140]  and then we'll get into the the Congress run yeah Alex I mean what why don't we
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.940]  gonna learn I mean what is our success record on foreign interventions at this
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.300]  point I mean I have a vested interest in saying that's okay to your listeners
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.500]  this isn't some campaign slogan I'm not saying it's to get a campaign donation
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.900]  for me folks I lost an uncle in Vietnam before I was before I was even born my
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:10.860]  mother's though older brother changed our entire life my mother was never the
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.220]  same either with my grandmother ever ever the same I mean change their lives
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.700]  for for what you know what took down ultimately it's gonna take down via the
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.340]  capitalism you know we're involved in only our success record is almost nil
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:27.380]  and the same thing is that success record isn't paid for with electoral
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:30.700]  outcomes it's paid for by the blood of real American men and women who died
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:35.620]  doing it what are we doing what are we doing over there do you even have an end
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.220]  game this president's foreign policy arming al-Qaeda rebels al-Nusra in
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:45.020]  Syria are we kidding what's the record or success with that one 9-11 I mean are
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:49.140]  we kidding this is that there's I don't understand like how well government's
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.420]  full of supposedly bowtie wearing bureaucrats who are intelligent I hope
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.180]  these fancy degrees come to the conclusions fitting around a big wooden
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:01.060]  table that this is a good idea I mean this is the problem when we elect out of
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:06.180]  touch people who don't live in the real world and eat quagra for lunch and not
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.780]  oatmeal like I just had it was good old but I liked it I mean that that's the
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.020]  point folks that's why we need citizen representatives to understand the
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.860]  economy have an understanding of law but don't have to be lawyers who understand
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:21.660]  the bigger philosophical meanings to liberty understand the works of soul
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.700]  and Bastia my liberty matter because these fools just don't get it I mean what
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.460]  they don't get is that the value is being virtuous and having freedom and
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.540]  that's what builds great civilizations they think their kleptocratic insider
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:39.540]  gangs of government and special interest is power and you look at the CD people
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.620]  and all the things they do we are ruled more and more by kleptocratic criminals
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:49.060]  but the this is the issue and Eisenhower warned of it the military
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:53.020]  industrial complex and the big foreign banks that own and control it it's not
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.100]  good for American interest it's not good for our name it's not good for our
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:02.220]  debts but it is good for the weapons manufacturers and the big banks that
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.420]  take over these countries after we bomb into the Stone Age that's why we're
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.460]  doing this because it's good for the internationalist that's why we're
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:13.700]  backing al-Qaeda in Syria I couldn't agree with you more and that's been my you
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:17.820]  know I run as a Republican now that's my been my problem with the Republican
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.060]  party me I probably rail against them as much as I did the Democrats that's been
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.460]  my beef is that your government's bought and sold it yeah not to shamelessly
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:30.620]  plug this thing but in my book the life inside the bubble yeah if you take a
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.660]  look at it I'll get you guys in advance copy soon you'll see that I write
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:36.900]  extensively about this how your government's bought and sold on both
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.460]  sides don't and there are some good people there don't get me wrong I know a
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:44.060]  few of myself and I've met personally were good people but when I say a few I
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.660]  mean a few I mean you probably count on on a couple of hands how many how many
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.020]  good people up it's bought and sold you have military interests you have a
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.860]  finance interest and you know the real fight is not Republican Democrat it's
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:01.300]  we're not even libertarian versus liberal the real fight is elitist versus
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.820]  popular do you believe your government should be a representative popular
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.300]  PO constitutional republic or do you believe your government should be run
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.420]  by elitist finance the military industrial folks I mean that's the real
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:16.620]  fight regardless of your party label it's meaningless anymore because both sides
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.340]  have sold out I've been through a campaign I know how this works that's why
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:23.700]  I rely on grassroots support now I don't I don't go chilling to people but I
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.820]  don't need it and then I want to get into the campaign and see how that's
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.140]  going because you really want to get good libertarian constitutional type
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:33.900]  people in I see a huge crop of great folks that if people just get behind
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.060]  them we'll get into Congress 2014 could be the year to really turn the tide but
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:42.500]  three weeks ago judicial watch I don't know if you saw this it was on Drudge
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:48.340]  they got the documents where they're now teaching in the regular Army manual and
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.460]  we have a copy of it DOD training manual extremist founding fathers would
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:57.860]  not be welcome in today's military and they actually badmouth George Washington
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:04.660]  now that's Twilight Zone oh my gosh I mean at the FBI manual too and I saw it
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.020]  when I was in the Secret Service this political correctness we would have to
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:11.620]  take these online training courses you know the one click the link and you got
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.700]  to sit through these tedious courses some of the stuff in these PowerPoints you
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:19.620]  would watch was just amazing the political correctness you know we're not
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:24.020]  willing to call it terrorist the terrorist is general fear of if someone
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:28.460]  was an Islamic fundamentalist not practice Islam is it an Islamic
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:33.380]  you know a fanatic then you couldn't say that I mean that but you have to
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.420]  remember Alex as a criminal investigator that's a very salient point I
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:42.220]  mean there's a very real penalty for this atmosphere of political correctness
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:45.140]  and that investigations are going to go to die and real people are going to
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.180]  suffer because you can't say while we're looking into this group in this
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:54.140]  specific area because we can't say they may be fanatics that practice the reason
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:59.100]  is the criminal black ops groups that are running our country are
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.100]  running these groups and plan on using them they're protecting them Dan

[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:21.580]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:26.580]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.580]  It's not about food.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.580]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:36.580]  The Alex Jones Show
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:41.580]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.580]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:53.580]  And I'd like to hear from listeners out there, your take on Lois Lerner in her own memos.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.580]  They've only released one of her own memos.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.580]  She's been working on it for a long time.
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:03.580]  She's been working on it for a long time.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.580]  She's been working on it for a long time.
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:13.580]  Your take on Lois Lerner in her own memos, they've only released 10% of what Congress has ordered them to.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:20.580]  And the 10% they've released, it's her saying the Tea Party's dangerous, they're bad, we've got to stop them, we've got to go after them.
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:25.580]  They don't audit her, ask any socialist, liberal, communist group, nambla.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.580]  As long as you're degenerate and gross, they love you.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.580]  Literally.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:35.580]  But if you're pro-gun, pro-family, anti-abortion, basically if you're a good person, they hate you.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.580]  This is a ministry of evil.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580]  And she lied to Congress.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:41.580]  She said, I take the fifth, but I didn't do any of this.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.580]  The fifth doesn't mean that.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:46.580]  That I'm going to give you a fake testimony, but it's inadmissible.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.580]  It means you don't talk.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:49.580]  And that's on record.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:53.580]  And you heard the former Secret Service agent, Bongino, break that down with us.
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.580]  So I want to get your take on this.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:02.580]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599231.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:08.580]  And I'm going to get to some of the other top stories that are very important here in just a moment
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:14.580]  and play a clip where the state of Connecticut refuses to release Adam Lanz's medical records.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:19.580]  Assistant Attorney General says identifying any depressants Lanz was taking
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.580]  that caused a lot of people to stop taking their medications.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:23.580]  That's a quote.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.580]  And we'll try to cue that up and play it coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.580]  But first off, folks, I'm really excited about getting the sponsor.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:35.580]  The reason we have the sponsor is I've personally been looking into things to use,
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:41.580]  to, well, bury firearms and not get them ruined and not have to totally soak them in cosmoline.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:46.580]  People of all walks of life are preparing for economic problems and crises.

[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.580]  Not just for yourself, but to send to your friends and family on Facebook, Twitter,
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.580]  and all the other enemy platforms, the enemy platform YouTube, the enemy platform Google,
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.580]  use any enemy platform you can.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.580]  Because again, I've got a big stack of news we'll get to after some calls of where they're involved
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.580]  in all sorts of domestic propaganda.
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.580]  And to make you think you don't have power because you do have power.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:48.580]  If you all just do a little bit every day for love of your family,
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:51.580]  not for vicious hatred of the New World War,
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.580]  because I've been not been hateful for a while.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.580]  I've been settling down.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:58.580]  I'm having a lot of hate problems right now because I just am so sick of these people
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.580]  that if I just think about them, I go into a rage now.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.580]  It's like if you catch somebody raping your wife, I mean, it's just like,
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.580]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:12.580]  I just sit here and I look at this trash just dominating us and bullying us
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:17.580]  and persecuting people politically and saying they're preparing for war with gun owners
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.580]  and veterans and tea partiers and libertarians.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:23.580]  And it's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.580]  I have a former top secret service agent on.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:28.580]  And I go, have you heard how they're badmouthing the founding fathers?
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:30.580]  He goes, oh no, that was in our training.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.580]  I mean, it's like the government is captured.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:37.580]  A captured enemy would say that.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:41.580]  I mean, in Red Dawn, when they're torturing people at the reeducation camp,
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.580]  they're badmouthing the founding fathers in the background because it's so accurate
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.580]  off of Soviet propaganda.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:49.580]  Your American founding fathers are pig races.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:57.580]  And then you turn on MSNBC and it's like something out of Red Dawn.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:05.580]  I mean, it's so crazy that it makes me go crazy.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:09.580]  And they're not even well-meaning socialists that want to bankrupt everything to collect
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580]  and buy stuff to help the poor.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.580]  They want to make you poor on record.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.580]  They want to hurt poor people.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:20.580]  I want to build an economy, build jobs, build quality, build a future.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:27.580]  I have an instinct to want to hire people and pay them well so they can have a good life
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.580]  and feel good about the job they have.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:32.580]  And when you take jobs from people and take a future and make them dependent,
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.580]  so much of the workforce is ruined.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:39.580]  We have sifted through a lot of people and finally have a really first-rate crew
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.580]  across the board here, folks, but it has been living hell.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:47.580]  And I have worked with a lot of other people and they have the same issues.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.580]  It's hard to find people that will work and won't rob you at a hot dog stand,
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.580]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:59.580]  I mean, it is so bizarre to realize that the society is degenerating fast.
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.580]  And people aren't about long-term relationships.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.580]  People aren't about the future.
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.580]  They aren't about having a good name.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.580]  They think that's all stupid.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.580]  And then good people sit back and go, well, I've not been cheating and stealing.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:13.580]  What's wrong with me?
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:17.580]  Listen, don't cheat and steal from your fellow man.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.580]  But the government is illegitimate and occupied trying to steal from us.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.580]  Don't comply.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:23.580]  This is what I do.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:28.580]  And it's at your own risk, too, but the risk of going along is 100 times worse.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.580]  It's now time, folks.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.580]  It's now time for red-light cameras to...
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.580]  Well, it's now time for people to get really aggressive.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.580]  It's time for...
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.580]  You know what I'm talking about, folks.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:43.580]  It's time to not play games anymore against this with the civil disobedience.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:46.580]  And civil disobedience means don't hurt people,
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:51.580]  but it's time to start really getting aggressive.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:55.580]  That's what I'm talking about here, because these people are going out
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.580]  and arresting Tea Party people.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:58.580]  They're auditing them.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:02.580]  Telling pro-life groups don't go out and protest or will indict you for fraud
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:06.580]  as a tax-exempt foundation when you're absolutely authorized to do that
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:09.580]  and they're outside of their regulations and they know they are.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.580]  It's all fraud, and then they lie about it.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.580]  It is pure persecution to have the Attorney General telling socialist churches,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.580]  go out and be political.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.580]  You know, you're allowed to be, but telling conservative libertarian,
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.580]  you'll be arrested if you do.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:26.580]  And on top of it, the First Amendment says the IRS doesn't even have that jurisdiction.
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:30.580]  The Attorney General is just telling the black churches and others
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.580]  that they can do whatever they want because they could anyways.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.580]  He's actually telling them the truth,
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:41.580]  but then through color of law going after other people.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:45.580]  I ran into a Baptist preacher who I'd never met before,
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:49.580]  but I'd seen literature from his Baptist church that one of my friends gave me,
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.580]  one of my deceased friends.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:54.580]  I ran into his pastor and the guy said,
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.580]  listen to your show, it's pretty entertaining.
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.580]  I believed about half of it.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.580]  And I said, well, I hope you're right.
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.580]  I hope only half of it's true.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.580]  In fact, I hope none of it's true.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:04.580]  But I believe what I'm saying is as accurate as it gets.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.580]  I really try to be accurate.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.580]  And then I didn't even say it because I just didn't have time.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.580]  I wanted to say, and by the way,
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:17.580]  your Baptist church five years ago handed out those flyers to every practitioner.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.580]  It's a big church to not talk about politics at church events
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:25.580]  or in Bible study at home if it was a church deal or at lunch after church
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:29.580]  because it violated 501c3.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:34.580]  And I'm looking at this preacher who gave a good sermon when I was there.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.580]  And I'm listening to him.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.580]  It was just a couple of weekends ago.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:37.580]  It was at Raymond Teak's funeral.
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:38.580]  I'll just go ahead and say it.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:40.580]  And he's sitting there.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.580]  And if I remember, Raymond brought me the paper and showed me.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:49.580]  And the guy gave a good deal, but it was the same Baptist church, I believe.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.580]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.580]  Should have asked him to nail it down that was saying that.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.580]  And nothing against that guy.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.580]  This is at churches all over the place, folks.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:02.580]  If you go for Bible study or you're a Sunday school teacher at the Methodist church,
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:04.580]  the Baptist church, the Catholic church,
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.580]  people that are in all of them, they give you flyers.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.580]  We've shown them on air from Catholic churches.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:14.580]  Don't just, don't just not talk about politics.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.580]  We want tell your practitioners they should turn their guns in.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:24.580]  That was a Catholic church that one of my friends attends that gave me the document out in Lakeway.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.580]  And that's not a church now, folks.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.580]  That's a political system of the globalist.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:37.580]  And it just shows how crazy all of this stuff has gotten.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.580]  And it is so frustrating.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:48.580]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.580]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.580]  Let me just get to this now.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.580]  The story is up on infowars.com.
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:01.580]  State of Connecticut refuses to release Adam Lanz's medical records.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:04.580]  Assistant Attorney General identifying antidepressants.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:09.580]  Lanz who it was taking could cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications.
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.580]  What an Orwellian statement.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:14.580]  The state of Connecticut is refusing to release Sandy Hook,
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:19.580]  gum, and Adam Lanz's medical records over fears that divulging the identity
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.580]  of the antidepressants he was taking could cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:28.580]  According to Assistant Attorney General Patrick B. Kiwanashi,
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.580]  I think is how you pronounce, Kiwanashi.
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:34.580]  And I love how they're having this government meeting on tape
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.580]  like we're all idiots and won't see it.
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.580]  Because the national news isn't there.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:41.580]  I love how they all act like only national controlled media exists.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.580]  So they'll just say this stuff out in the open all the time.
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.580]  Like, Brzezinski gets up on the CFR and goes,
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.580]  we're having trouble dominating and enslaving everyone.
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:52.580]  It'll be cheaper to kill a million people soon than propagandize them.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]  We're losing the battle.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:54.580]  We don't have to go to harder measures.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.580]  I mean, it's like in a bad guy movie where you're trimming the bushes
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.580]  and like hear the evil neighbor talking and they're going to kill somebody.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:05.580]  But then nobody does anything though when you discover all this.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.580]  It's just like they're admitting what they're doing
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:11.580]  and then nothing happens, kind of like the lowest learner.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.580]  Let's persecute.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:15.580]  Obama wants us, this is the memos, persecute the Tea Party.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:16.580]  Go after them.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:18.580]  They're dangerous.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.580]  Well, of course, the sun is dangerous to a vampire.
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:24.580]  Of course, holy water is dangerous to a vampire.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.580]  Of course, silver bullets are dangerous to werewolves.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:29.580]  Of course, the law is dangerous to pedophiles.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:34.580]  Of course, a shotgun is dangerous to a wild hyena.
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:38.580]  I mean, it's just like these people are just up there,
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:41.580]  bad-mouthing freedom, running al-Qaeda.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:45.580]  And then you've got, see, he had family come out and say he was on
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:46.580]  at least three in a depressive.
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:47.580]  That's how we knew that.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.580]  But now here it is.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.580]  We don't want the public to notice when everybody to keep taking their medicine.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.580]  Who do you think runs the public schools and stuff now?
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.580]  It's the big pharma, runs the curriculum under new freedom.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.580]  The national recording industries now are brainwashing five-year-olds.
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.580]  Don't do a quote or what somebody else said, even if you attribute it.
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:09.580]  That's stealing.
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:12.580]  It's beyond just brainwashing them for copyright stuff.
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:16.580]  It's now teaching people that any type of communication isn't yours.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.580]  The AP threatened to sue people.
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.580]  In fact, they have overtaking one line of one of their stories.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.580]  And of course they lose in court.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.580]  They don't care.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580]  They just keep filing suits.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.580]  They just keep filing suits, filing suits, filing suits, filing suits.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:34.580]  That's what they do.
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.580]  That's how they operate.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:41.580]  And they are just a wall of corporate control freaks that are threatened by your liberty.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:46.580]  Whereas I absolutely worship your liberty.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.580]  These people don't want freedom.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:49.580]  They don't want prosperity.
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:53.580]  They want to run your life because they know they're sacks of garbage
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.580]  and couldn't hold a regular job.
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:58.580]  Let's go to the clip of the deputy attorney general saying, let's cover...
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.580]  I mean, they're not just covering up stuff.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:05.580]  They're now telling you why they're covering up.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:09.580]  That's how out of touch they are because no one can touch them now
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:16.580]  because all the major attorney generals are like holders now, folks, in most states.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.580]  It's a critical mass now where they're bragging, like facing the crowd
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.580]  at the end of that movie of what they're doing to us, in our faces.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:28.580]  As they take our money and buy thousands of armored vehicles a month,
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:33.580]  billions of rounds of ammo, train that we're the enemy, say we're the enemy.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:37.580]  Say our kids belong to them.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.580]  Block labeling of GMOs.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:41.580]  Just you name it, it's bad.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580]  They are bad.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.580]  So it's simply not legitimate.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:51.580]  And not only did they use the witcher proposing to put the information not legitimate,
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:57.580]  it is harmful because then you can cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications,
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:08.580]  stop operating with their treating physicians just because of the heinousness of what Adam Lanza did.
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:17.580]  And it shows the other bureaucrats looking around going holy tomato, Batman.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.580]  What are we going to do?
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:28.580]  Holy Chris Splendid Jordan, Batman, Toledo.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:32.580]  Oh my goodness.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:34.580]  Oh my goodness.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:39.580]  It's a little inside joke around here, folks.
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:41.580]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:42.580]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:46.580]  I mean, I just, and now they're all coming to our doors and demanding we get Obamacare.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.580]  They're going to give Acron and other groups our social security numbers.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.580]  That's up on infohorses.com.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:55.580]  And I mean, they're going to run our lives and they're going to say our kids are theirs and they're here.
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:49:01.580]  They're the creepiest, freakiest, sickest, most degenerate weirdos the planet's ever seen.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:08.580]  And we have a giant growing infestation of power-tripping government people run by corporations that are getting the contracts
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:13.580]  to absolutely gut this country 500 ways from Sunday.
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.580]  John, in California, you're on the air, sir.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.580]  Go ahead.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:24.580]  Alex, on the day of the shooting, I just want to, I sent you guys some links before,
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:28.580]  but there was a local talk show host in Los Angeles here.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:33.580]  He was talking, he said, oh, this report's just in that recording, I ran it,
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:40.580]  but he said that the weapons they found on the DC shooter, the Naval Yard shooter, weren't discharged.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:43.580]  He speculated that, oh, maybe there were other people involved.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:47.580]  That's why they said there were multiple shooters, because maybe they picked up the weapons that were actually being fired.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:51.580]  Well, look, they're not letting the ATF in, and that's their jurisdiction,
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:56.580]  and they held back the SWAT team that was there in five minutes in order to stand down.
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:00.580]  And from the people I talked to, very close to the SWAT team, mostly that at that,
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:07.580]  they are, quote, sick and feel dirty that they follow the orders, and they think there's a cover-up.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:13.580]  So, I mean, and that is, that is from, well, it's from the SWAT team.
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:14.580]  I'll just go ahead and say it.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.580]  So, I mean, they said I could say it, just don't say their names, but I want even further.
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.580]  And it's from the SWAT team, so.
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:23.580]  Anything else, sir?
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.580]  I'd like to see if anybody else had the original report.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:31.580]  You know, like, I don't know if anybody out there or listeners can, you know, remember that, or they find out what this guy was looking at.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:34.580]  It's obviously some police officer, somebody released that information.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:39.580]  Well, he was in Navy Secret Weapons, and he worked in that building, and that building was ELF,
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:45.580]  and he carved, here's my ELF weapon, on a gun, and reportedly, when they're in shot people, who knows if that's even true.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:51.580]  They sent the same FBI team that covered up the Boston bombing to it, so who knows.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.580]  But, I mean, they wouldn't lie to us, they love us.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:51:22.580]  We're going to come back and talk to Elaine, Scott, Max, Lindsay, and others straight ahead.

[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:16.580]  Then we've got a big whistleblower joining us with Jim Mars.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.580]  Look at this Washington Post article that just came out.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:26.580]  Brazil's president condemns NSA spying, but buried in the article.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:28.580]  Well, it's really the second paragraph, I wouldn't say buried.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:35.580]  America's spying efforts pose a threat to democracy throughout the world, she said,
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:41.580]  as she proposed UN regulation of cyberspace to ensure the integrity of the internet.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:47.580]  So see, the globalist out of the US set up the UN and then to counter themselves.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:53.580]  Oh, give the UN control, which they've been pushing for a decade.
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:57.580]  See how that works, folks. See how the globalist play both sides.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:00.580]  Incredibly outrageous.
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:01.580]  There you have it.
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.580]  And now China and Russia say they want their own internet.
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.580]  That's where all of this is going.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:10.580]  It is an information war.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.580]  Some of the other news that just broke on info wars.com.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.580]  I'm not kidding.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.580]  This is a mainstream news out of WAVY TV.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.580]  This is breaking nationally right now.
[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:26.580]  Seventh graders suspended for nine months for playing with toy gun at home.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:31.580]  A green and orange toy gun.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:34.580]  The parents are outraged saying not a school issue.
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:39.580]  Well, that is obviously a thought crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:43.580]  And this is the school saying your kids belong to them.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:46.580]  That is up on info wars.com.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.580]  This is the takeover by the state.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:53.580]  In fact, can we just add, tell one of the writers, just add to Steve's article,
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:58.580]  the link to the MSNBC host in the promo that says your kids belong to us.
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:03.580]  I want to just add that at the bottom to remind people if we can that this is that
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:06.580]  changeover that we're saying. Thank you.
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:11.580]  Let's go ahead and talk to Elaine in North Carolina.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.580]  You're on the air, Elaine. Go ahead.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:19.580]  Hi, Alex. I wanted to let you and all of your staff and your family know I pray for you
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:29.580]  daily for your safety that we're bulletproof until the Lord God is ready to take us.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.580]  Well ma'am, I appreciate your prayers.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:38.580]  About Lerner, I am ashamed of that woman. I can't wait.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:44.580]  I love your Baphomet Medusa scenario that fits her perfectly.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:50.580]  And I hope and pray that none of my tax dollars goes to her retirement.
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:55.580]  But I mean, what do you think about her saying that, you know, she didn't do all this
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.580]  and now it's come out that she did?
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.580]  She would look perfect in orange, you know.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:04.580]  She would look great in orange, but I just wonder how far they think they can go.
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:08.580]  I mean, we need to put pressure on the Attorney General, you know,
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:12.580]  just to show that he's not going to ever prosecute her for perjury.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:20.580]  I want to find a lawyer who will move in a class action against this government
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:26.580]  with 316 million class action participants.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:30.580]  Well, I'll tell you, if people do just start suing the government,
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:33.580]  that will actually, even if they're able to beat it with their fraud,
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.580]  that will get their attention.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.580]  Oh, if nothing else. I am so sick of this new world order.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:43.580]  They can have it. They can stuff their money all they want to.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:45.580]  It's not going to keep them out of hell.
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:47.580]  I hear you. God bless you, ma'am.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.580]  Well, they don't just want the money. They want to bankrupt everything,
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:51.580]  so we're under their control. That's the key.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:53.580]  That's the key to all this.
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:56.580]  Real fast, Lindsay in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:57:56.580 --> 01:57:59.580]  Yes, Mr. Jones, what a pleasure to speak with you, sir.
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:01.580]  I'm going to talk to you. What's on your mind, brother?
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.580]  Well, I'll tell you, I've been listening to you for years,
[01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:08.580]  and you're right on about everything you speak about.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.580]  But you know, just to digress briefly, yes, this woman is Baphomet,
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:16.580]  and no better than what is her name, James Clapper,
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.580]  or whatever his name is from the Director of National Intelligence
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:24.580]  that lied to Congress openly that the NSA wasn't retrieving any of our information.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:28.580]  But also, you know, to mention this recent incident with Alexis,
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:32.580]  you know, he was hit with wonder weapons from U.S. News & World Report,
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:37.580]  talked about in the July 7th, 1997 issue, Wonder Weapons.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:40.580]  Take a look. Stay there. I'm going to come right back to you.

[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:32.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:35.580]  We're talking to, who was I talking to?
[02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.580]  Lindsey in California, you were making a point.
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:39.580]  Yeah, there's all sorts of Pentagon documents
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:43.580]  about different magnetic weapons and mind control weapons they've got.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.580]  I mean, they can remote control rats now
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:49.580]  with waves, not just with actual chips in the brain.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:52.580]  And so, obviously, these control freaks are going to seek after that.
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:54.580]  But go ahead and make your point, sir.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.580]  Yeah, that's the whole thing there was.
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:58.580]  He said he had ringing in the ears now.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:00.580]  You're going to find trouble believing this,
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:03.580]  but I've had a falling out with one of these people you mentioned
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.580]  who's in power running things,
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.580]  and I've had ringing in my ears since that time,
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:10.580]  and I've had sleep deprivation.
[02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:13.580]  Well, I haven't worn air plugs enough shooting guns.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:17.580]  I've had ringing in my ears, but look, look, a lot of this,
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:19.580]  there's a lot of ultra low frequency.
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.580]  There's a lot of data over power lines.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:27.580]  There's a lot of other stuff that is affecting us biomechanically,
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:32.580]  electrochemically in all the studies without them trying to actually hurt us.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:36.580]  I mean, they know what cell phones and cell towers and all this radiation.
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:39.580]  Just the nuclear testing doubled the radiation
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.580]  conservatively in the Northern Hemisphere. Now it's gone up again
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:47.580]  because of Fukushima and Chernobyl since 1986.
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.580]  So there's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:49.580]  God bless you. Good to hear from you.
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.580]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.580]  But yeah, this is the naval yard.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.580]  There's definitely a cover up there.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:57.580]  We don't know of what.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:59.580]  Let's talk to Scott in Virginia.
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:01.580]  You're on the air.
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:02.580]  Hey, Alex.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:03.580]  Hey, buddy.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:06.580]  Hey, Brian, how you been doing?
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.580]  Oh, you know, I'm doing all right.
[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.580]  I'm just putting a little pen up on the wall.
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:11.580]  A lowest learner here.
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:14.580]  I think she's better looking than Marilyn Monroe.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.580]  That's a joke.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:19.580]  But anyways, I'm calling in regards to this amendment
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:23.580]  that Rand Paul's brought up against Obamacare.
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:30.580]  You know, if it's medicine and everything,
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:32.580]  Obamacare is good for us.
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.580]  Why isn't it good for them?
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:39.580]  I mean, it's glad he's brought that up about, you know,
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:44.580]  them being just as good as us.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:47.580]  We put our pants on just like they do.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:48.580]  I agree with you.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:50.580]  Hey, what's on the radio there in the background?
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.580]  Oh, I think it's you, buddy.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:55.580]  Oh, turn it up for me.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:57.580]  Now, let me hear the show.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:58.580]  Turn it up as loud as you can.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:02:59.580]  I want to see what part of the dojo.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:01.580]  Let's do it.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:04.580]  Rand Paul's brought up.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.580]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:06.580]  I ain't from Virginia.
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:07.580]  I'm from West Virginia.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:09.580]  Well, you know, most talk show hosts don't like radios
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:10.580]  on the background.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:11.580]  I like it.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:13.580]  Well, I wanted to hear you.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.580]  No, no.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.580]  I turned it up.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:16.580]  Listen, listen, I like hearing a delay.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.580]  Turn it up.
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.580]  Just be quiet for a minute.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:19.580]  Turn it all the way up.
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:22.580]  All right, hold on.
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:26.580]  Being there is as good as us.
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.580]  We put our pants on just like they do.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.580]  I agree with you.
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.580]  Hey, what's on the radio there in the background?
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:36.580]  I think it's you, buddy.
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:37.580]  Turn it up for me.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:38.580]  I don't miss it.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:39.580]  Now, let me hear the show.
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.580]  Turn it up as loud as you can.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:41.580]  Anyway, I don't miss it.
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.580]  I want to hear what part of the dojo.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:43.580]  All right.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:44.580]  All right.
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:47.580]  But Michael, hey, I mean, I ain't heard no more
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:48.580]  about that lately.
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:51.580]  I think he had some goods on the government,
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:53.580]  and they actually killed that boy.
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:54.580]  Oh, they would not.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:57.580]  You think this government would actually kill somebody?
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:58.580]  Absolutely.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.580]  They would just execute the press as they do on record.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:03.580]  Who would have, you mean, murderous gangsters
[02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:05.580]  that run giant child kidnapping rings
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.580]  on record at the UN and Dine Corps and the rest of it?
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:10.580]  You mean, if they'd grab little kids and sell them
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.580]  to foreign countries for snuff films,
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.580]  you mean they might do something bad?
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.580]  Yeah.
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:19.580]  My brother used to work for the UN back years ago.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.580]  He's back home now.
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:25.580]  He used to travel the globe as working for the UN
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.580]  as a policeman for him.
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:28.580]  Yeah, it was.
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:31.580]  But anyhow, also about the FEMA region three,
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:33.580]  I thought you might maybe get on there.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:35.580]  Oh, they're really taking over West Virginia, yeah.
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:36.580]  Heck yeah.
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:37.580]  Yeah.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:39.580]  Right here, I just live about three or four miles
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:42.580]  or six or eight miles away from Boy Scout Camp.
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:45.580]  Man, they just, like, a herd of cattle come in here
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.580]  from Boy Scouts.
[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:47.580]  That's something else.
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.580]  I never seen that in all my life.
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:51.580]  Yeah, they're using that to take over schools.
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:52.580]  They have helicopters, military,
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:54.580]  and it's all in the middle of a big drill,
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:56.580]  and they're using the Boy Scouts to test
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:57.580]  on FEMA camps.
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:26.580]  God bless you, sir.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:53.580]  Thank you.
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:06:19.580]  Thank you.
[02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:48.580]  They're the good guys.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:49.580]  Free.
[02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:52.580]  So don't waste your time dealing with scum.

[02:59:51.580 --> 03:00:00.580]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:22.580 --> 03:00:31.580]  Alright, I'm only doing five more minutes overdrive because I've got to go work on Obama Deception too.
[03:00:31.580 --> 03:00:39.580]  But Tosh Plumlee has testified before Congress multiple times in 1990, 1991 and back in the 70s, the church committee.
[03:00:39.580 --> 03:00:46.580]  And I'll tell you, I was going down to the beach last, I guess it was Friday.
[03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:51.580]  I was driving down there to meet my dad and my son who were down there alligator hunting and fishing.
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:57.580]  Yes, we're pretty redneck folks and maybe like Putin posing with that alligators.
[03:00:57.580 --> 03:01:05.580]  But the point is, is I was driving down there and Mars called and said, I want you to publish this story first and get Tosh Plumlee on.
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:07.580]  I said, I've heard that name. That's one of the Iran contract whistleblowers.
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:12.580]  He goes, yeah, this is really big. He's got sources on Benghazi, but it's really dangerous.
[03:01:12.580 --> 03:01:17.580]  Hours later, they get calls from Fox News.
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:24.580]  So I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, well, I'd first talked to him before I left that day here.
[03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:28.580]  And I mentioned on air, he's got some Benghazi news and Fox follows our show.
[03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:32.580]  You see him publish some of our stories. And so they're on it.
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:36.580]  I mean, this is a big deal. And Tosh only got like three minutes left.
[03:01:36.580 --> 03:01:40.580]  I appreciate all your time today. I want to get you back up very soon.
[03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:43.580]  And I guess you wanted to get this testimony out for your own safety.
[03:01:43.580 --> 03:01:50.580]  You're saying you talked to a high level NATO officer and he told you again in your own words, what happened at Benghazi?
[03:01:50.580 --> 03:01:59.580]  Because my intel is from multiple sources, they killed the ambassador and his crew because they were saying no to giving missiles to Al Qaeda.
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:03.580]  They were not only saying no to giving missiles to Al Qaeda. That was the second deal.
[03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:12.580]  We were giving a high impact weapon to the Syrian rebels. But then that group was somebody Al Qaeda members and so on like that,
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:16.580]  which built for those weapons and used them against our people.
[03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:21.580]  That's what the story is. That, in my opinion, is what the cover-up is.
[03:02:21.580 --> 03:02:28.580]  The story about someone doing a film that made the people go radical and go crazy over there with a cover story
[03:02:28.580 --> 03:02:35.580]  to cover a top secret ongoing operation of arms shipment to the Syrian rebels.
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:42.580]  Period. Before, our president, Commander-in-Chief, decided that we needed to arm the Syrian.
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:49.580]  I am not a conspiracy person. This information that I got comes from multiple sources.
[03:02:49.580 --> 03:02:55.580]  It is, in other words, I'm going to get my ass rained for talking to you the way that I'm talking.
[03:02:55.580 --> 03:02:59.580]  But that's the only thing that has kept people like me alive.
[03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:03.580]  They're going to come down on me like duck on crap. I know that.
[03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:07.580]  That's the reason I'm being so adamant to explain what happened to you.
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:12.580]  Back to Mrs. Smith. Tell her what happened to her son.
[03:03:12.580 --> 03:03:20.580]  Her son defended an ambassador that had uncovered tremendous arms shipments from the United States
[03:03:20.580 --> 03:03:26.580]  also through the direct commercial sales program that was supposed to be honored by the Blue Lantern Report
[03:03:26.580 --> 03:03:33.580]  who someone dropped the bottle someplace and those weapons were used to kill our ambassador.
[03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:37.580]  So it wasn't just weapons gotten from Qaddafi in a cover-up.
[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:45.580]  It was direct arming the rebels then, which Obama just signed in order to legalize two weeks ago, wasn't legal then.
[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:50.580]  All right, go in and get the fuel receipts of the C-130s that flew out of certain places
[03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:54.580]  like March Air Force Spaces, all like that. Get their flight plans. See where they went.
[03:03:54.580 --> 03:03:56.580]  They went to Jordan.
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:59.580]  There were other C-130s.
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:02.580]  Who's talking about Georgia on the Mediterranean? You're talking about...
[03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:03.580]  No, Jordan.
[03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:05.580]  How come there were so many of them?
[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:07.580]  Middle Eastern country.
[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:10.580]  You know what? I tell you what, Tosh, you better say everything.
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:16.580]  Have you said everything? Is there anything else? Because you know they'll probably kill you if you haven't said something else.
[03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:20.580]  Well, no, they're going to kill me. I mean, they're going to have to kill a bunch of other guys
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:24.580]  because I put this stuff out in a very safe place and those are my contacts from the NATO over there
[03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:26.580]  and those are my contacts from the high-level military.
[03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:28.580]  Listen, if you've got more time, this is too important.
[03:04:28.580 --> 03:04:31.580]  Can you do 15 more minutes because this is a short segment?
[03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:36.580]  Yeah, I'm here. As long as they don't fire these C-130s up in front of me so you can't hear me,
[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:40.580]  I'll sit here because, look, I'm not trying to get publicity.
[03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:44.580]  No, I know, I know, sir. This is big news here because I have my sources, but...
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:51.580]  All I'm trying to do is get information so that Mrs. Smith can go direct to our president
[03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:57.580]  and please ask for the documentation that the State Department has that concerns...
[03:04:57.580 --> 03:05:07.580]  Yeah, sure, sure. Stay there. Stay there. Coming back to you.

[03:08:12.580 --> 03:08:14.580]  Alright, Tosh Plumlee.
[03:08:14.580 --> 03:08:16.580]  I ran Contra Whistleblower. You name it.
[03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:20.580]  Flew guns back to Castro under CIA orders.
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:22.580]  Testified at the church committee.
[03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:27.580]  Just amazing that he's decided after years to go public and speak out again.
[03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:31.580]  Still flying aircraft at a U.S. military base right now.
[03:08:31.580 --> 03:08:35.580]  Earlier, they fired up a C-130 you could hear in the background.
[03:08:35.580 --> 03:08:40.580]  And he's had known as Extended Lunch Hour there on the cell phone talking to us.
[03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:44.580]  William Robert Tosh Plumlee, he goes by Tosh, is with us.
[03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:49.580]  We've got 12 minutes left. Jim Mars, you haven't talked a lot here.
[03:08:49.580 --> 03:08:56.580]  We're hearing some incredible info and we told everybody basically this a week after it happened
[03:08:56.580 --> 03:09:02.580]  from one Pentagon source that came on the air, Colonel Schaefer, who's run Black Ops all over the world.
[03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:05.580]  And then he got in a lot of trouble and said, well, I didn't mean exactly what I said,
[03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:08.580]  so we had to retract some things just so he didn't get in too much trouble,
[03:09:08.580 --> 03:09:10.580]  but he said what he said and he knows he said it on air.
[03:09:10.580 --> 03:09:13.580]  And then we had, I mean, he said, all hell broke loose.
[03:09:13.580 --> 03:09:17.580]  And then we were the first to report this, by the way. I'm not bragging. No bragging, just fact.
[03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:21.580]  Actually, I wish other people were the first to break this because we've had Saudi Arabian intelligence.
[03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:25.580]  That's clearly who it is, messing with my reporters, seeing a nice family,
[03:09:25.580 --> 03:09:30.580]  videotaping them in the street. We've been getting a lot of death threats of the serious type.
[03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:34.580]  They are hopping mad right now, folks, that we exposed the rebels.
[03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:37.580]  We're given chemical weapons by Saudi Arabian intelligence.
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:39.580]  I mean, we're on the cutting edge of this.
[03:09:39.580 --> 03:09:42.580]  I'm glad other people like Tosh Plumlee is going public,
[03:09:42.580 --> 03:09:47.580]  but I want Tosh to be able to finish up points and recap what he said. It's historic information here
[03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:51.580]  from multiple sources, including a NATO high-level military officer.
[03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:55.580]  But, and I want Jim Mars to have some final comments here in a moment.
[03:09:55.580 --> 03:10:00.580]  But Tosh, from what I've been told, this is finally woken up the entire military.
[03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:04.580]  That's why the Joint Chiefs went to Obama and said, you're not going to attack Syria.
[03:10:04.580 --> 03:10:08.580]  We're not back in al-Qaeda. This is over. The military is on the edge of mutiny.
[03:10:08.580 --> 03:10:13.580]  The vast majority of military and Poles are against it. All the military I talked to
[03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:17.580]  knows that they were watching live feeds or talked to friends that saw live feeds
[03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:22.580]  from the predators of the six and a half hour gun battle as they were ordered to stand down.
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:26.580]  NATO all saw it. Everybody knows it was a hit. So here's my question.
[03:10:26.580 --> 03:10:29.580]  Did they pull off security and just let them kill them?
[03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:35.580]  Or did they order the Benghazi security, the al-Qaeda forces, to go kill them to get rid of the witnesses?
[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:39.580]  Did they let them die for a cover-up? Or were they involved in it?
[03:10:39.580 --> 03:10:45.580]  Or did your NATO source say anything? And is my information correct that this has
[03:10:45.580 --> 03:10:52.580]  the New World Order in deep trouble? Because so much of the military now understands how expendable they are.
[03:10:52.580 --> 03:10:58.580]  My opinion, they came out here and they tried to turn that into political.
[03:10:58.580 --> 03:11:03.580]  It was a very serious situation that was rapidly developing over there.
[03:11:03.580 --> 03:11:10.580]  The State Department and other agencies refused or did not, I'm not going to say refused,
[03:11:10.580 --> 03:11:16.580]  they did not get back to them in time because they were concerned of how that was going to look politically.
[03:11:16.580 --> 03:11:23.580]  It would be a political bombshell if it was revealed that U.S. weapons at that point in time
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:29.580]  were being given to factions in the Middle East through Turkey, Jordan.
[03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:36.580]  It would also expose methods and procedures. It would also expose our CIA safehouses that were operating in Jordan
[03:11:36.580 --> 03:11:41.580]  and other places, Pakistan and Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
[03:11:41.580 --> 03:11:46.580]  It would expose those operations that were involved.
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:53.580]  It would expose our politicians on both sides of the aisle that was involved in a corporate gain, in my personal opinion.
[03:11:53.580 --> 03:11:55.580]  So that had to be blocked.
[03:11:55.580 --> 03:12:00.580]  We had a military situation that had a military intelligence from that region over there
[03:12:00.580 --> 03:12:02.580]  and it was about to explode.
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:08.580]  I think it was turned over into a political or possible reelection campaign
[03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:11.580]  or whatever the hell was going on at that period in time.
[03:12:11.580 --> 03:12:17.580]  The point is, those people got sold out from the sun, got killed
[03:12:17.580 --> 03:12:22.580]  because of political tampering with a very volatile situation in the Middle East
[03:12:22.580 --> 03:12:27.580]  that was about to explode and it did explode and it has exploded.
[03:12:27.580 --> 03:12:31.580]  So now, yeah, you're right, I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble.
[03:12:31.580 --> 03:12:33.580]  There's a lot of guys out there.
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:38.580]  But maybe by me coming forward, you're going to get more confirmation from other people
[03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:42.580]  that actually were the boots on the ground that was over there at that time
[03:12:42.580 --> 03:12:46.580]  carrying out those covert missions and they know exactly what happened
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:52.580]  and the pilots that threw the guns and ammunition from our US bases through those areas
[03:12:52.580 --> 03:12:57.580]  hopefully they will come out and get off their butt and come out here and take a risk with me.
[03:12:57.580 --> 03:13:02.580]  So basically, Todd, you're tired of watching all these people cowardly sit on the sidelines
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:04.580]  and let this type of stuff go on.
[03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:07.580]  So you're telling what you know to try to spur them to go public.
[03:13:07.580 --> 03:13:12.580]  They reported two weeks ago that a whole bunch of witnesses have had their identities changed
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:14.580]  under White House orders.
[03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:17.580]  Those people, I guarantee, are just waiting to be killed
[03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:21.580]  from what I've learned and what Jim Garrison, who I know you know, said,
[03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:23.580]  the way to stay alive is to go public.
[03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:26.580]  What would you say to witnesses of Benghazi who are out there?
[03:13:26.580 --> 03:13:30.580]  I would tell them go public or you're dead.
[03:13:30.580 --> 03:13:32.580]  Well, let me put it this way.
[03:13:32.580 --> 03:13:34.580]  I am a civilian.
[03:13:34.580 --> 03:13:36.580]  I am not a government employee.
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:40.580]  If I was a government employee by the laws that are on the book,
[03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:47.580]  it is my responsibility to come forward and tell my superior and my supervisor
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:51.580]  exactly what I've been involved in as a government employee.
[03:13:51.580 --> 03:13:55.580]  If I suspect that I'm involved in an illegal operation,
[03:13:55.580 --> 03:13:59.580]  if I suspect that I'm involved in aiding a terrorist group,
[03:13:59.580 --> 03:14:05.580]  it is my responsibility as a government employee to report that to my supervisors.
[03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:09.580]  Now, in some cases, these men have reported that to their supervisors
[03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:11.580]  and their commanding officers.
[03:14:11.580 --> 03:14:13.580]  Some of them have gotten killed,
[03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:18.580]  one in particular was Colonel James Sable of the Marine Corps Naval Air Station
[03:14:18.580 --> 03:14:20.580]  back in the 90s.
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:24.580]  He went forward on a gun-running operation down to Carl Quintero,
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:28.580]  watermelon guerrillas being trained at a secret base down in Mexico.
[03:14:28.580 --> 03:14:30.580]  He got killed for that information.
[03:14:30.580 --> 03:14:32.580]  They tried to say it was suicide.
[03:14:32.580 --> 03:14:34.580]  Okay, it was not a suicide.
[03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:36.580]  It was an outright hit.
[03:14:36.580 --> 03:14:39.580]  The people that was involved in that supposed situation,
[03:14:39.580 --> 03:14:41.580]  that was an outright hit.
[03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:46.580]  Look, the reason I'm being so adamant is I don't want one of these black ops hits
[03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:48.580]  hit me or my family.
[03:14:48.580 --> 03:14:52.580]  So I need the support because I am a supervision.
[03:14:52.580 --> 03:14:54.580]  I am not a government employee.
[03:14:54.580 --> 03:14:56.580]  I can talk.
[03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:58.580]  I don't have to worry about my pension.
[03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:00.580]  I don't have to worry about my star.
[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:04.580]  I don't have to worry about, am I going to get a new rank for playing ball
[03:15:04.580 --> 03:15:08.580]  with the politicians that are taking over the military industrial complex?
[03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:09.580]  My opinion.
[03:15:09.580 --> 03:15:11.580]  Does that explain anything, Alex?
[03:15:11.580 --> 03:15:12.580]  No, it certainly does.
[03:15:12.580 --> 03:15:16.580]  I'm just advising people that have direct knowledge who haven't already been killed.
[03:15:16.580 --> 03:15:19.580]  They're saying a bunch of Benghazi people have changed their identities
[03:15:19.580 --> 03:15:21.580]  and will never be seen again.
[03:15:21.580 --> 03:15:24.580]  They probably changed their identities like Jimmy Hoffa.
[03:15:24.580 --> 03:15:28.580]  Look, most of the people that do these extreme black ops
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:31.580]  are working under cut-out names.
[03:15:31.580 --> 03:15:34.580]  My name was Pellock. I'm not even going to go into that.
[03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:36.580]  That's not important.
[03:15:36.580 --> 03:15:41.580]  But there is a system out there that is in place that is filtering
[03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:47.580]  and stealing from the American people for profit, for gains,
[03:15:47.580 --> 03:15:51.580]  corporations, contractors, people that get out of the military
[03:15:51.580 --> 03:15:55.580]  and go to work for a contractor and go security, go over, get involved,
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:15:59.580]  follow the money, find out where these guys are going for it.
[03:15:59.580 --> 03:16:03.580]  Go into gutter, go into Jordan, go into Turkey, go into Pakistan.
[03:16:03.580 --> 03:16:05.580]  Get these safe houses.
[03:16:05.580 --> 03:16:07.580]  Bring this stuff forward.
[03:16:07.580 --> 03:16:09.580]  And advise the American people.
[03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:12.580]  Mainstream media will not touch this kind of information.
[03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:16.580]  Number one, it's their responsibility to bury it.
[03:16:16.580 --> 03:16:19.580]  Now, I'm pulpy. I'm pulpy.
[03:16:19.580 --> 03:16:23.580]  If some of my crews that I'm familiar with will come forward and say,
[03:16:23.580 --> 03:16:25.580]  well, this is what I did.
[03:16:25.580 --> 03:16:29.580]  But if they do, they will lose their pension and they will have
[03:16:29.580 --> 03:16:33.580]  their internal revenue on their ass before sundown.
[03:16:33.580 --> 03:16:38.580]  Alex, if I can jump in here and try to put all this together.
[03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:42.580]  This, everything we're talking about, it ties right into everything
[03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:45.580]  that you talk about constantly on Info Wars,
[03:16:45.580 --> 03:16:50.580]  which is the dark center of the New World Order, if you will,
[03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:55.580]  okay, or what Bill Moyers calls the shadow government.
[03:16:55.580 --> 03:16:57.580]  And at the very center, it's the money.
[03:16:57.580 --> 03:16:59.580]  It's all about the money and who handles the money?
[03:16:59.580 --> 03:17:04.580]  The international banks, the big guys, okay?
[03:17:04.580 --> 03:17:09.580]  Citibank, JP Morgan, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:17:09.580 --> 03:17:10.580]  All right.
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:14.580]  And then, so these are the, this is the money that is greasing
[03:17:14.580 --> 03:17:19.580]  the shadow government, which is actually running the United States,
[03:17:19.580 --> 03:17:22.580]  not our elected officials, not the Constitution.
[03:17:22.580 --> 03:17:26.580]  And this is why it's so important for this information to get out
[03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:30.580]  to everyone so they can start dealing from a position of reality
[03:17:30.580 --> 03:17:35.580]  instead of operating with rose-colored glasses and la-la lamps.
[03:17:35.580 --> 03:17:38.580]  And Jim, and Jim, it's getting more reckless
[03:17:38.580 --> 03:17:40.580]  and they're using the al-Qaeda threat to take our liberties.
[03:17:40.580 --> 03:17:43.580]  These corporations and groups are out of control
[03:17:43.580 --> 03:17:46.580]  to the point of the British won't even launch this attack on Syria,
[03:17:46.580 --> 03:17:49.580]  knowing it's going to start World War III.
[03:17:49.580 --> 03:17:53.580]  These people are out of control and I salute you and Tosh Plumlee.
[03:17:53.580 --> 03:17:55.580]  One minute, final comment from you, Jim.
[03:17:55.580 --> 03:17:58.580]  One minute, final comment from Plumlee.
[03:17:58.580 --> 03:18:00.580]  Well, mine's real simple.
[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:03.580]  People have got to wake up, start listening to alternative media,
[03:18:03.580 --> 03:18:06.580]  educating themselves so we can turn this country around
[03:18:06.580 --> 03:18:09.580]  and go back to the principles of freedom and liberty
[03:18:09.580 --> 03:18:11.580]  that it was founded upon.
[03:18:11.580 --> 03:18:14.580]  JimMars.com is the website.
[03:18:14.580 --> 03:18:17.580]  Okay, Tosh, final comments.
[03:18:17.580 --> 03:18:21.580]  My final comment is the reason I'm doing this is I want my country back.
[03:18:21.580 --> 03:18:24.580]  I'm a patriot. I'm an American citizen
[03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:26.580]  and I have fought hard all of my life.
[03:18:26.580 --> 03:18:30.580]  I'm 76 years old and it's time to put this shit to bed.
[03:18:30.580 --> 03:18:32.580]  Amen, brother.
[03:18:32.580 --> 03:18:37.580]  Yes, it is time to put this globalist garbage to bed.
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:39.580]  It is time to turn things around.
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:41.580]  Things are getting so crazy
[03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:44.580]  and the criminals are so out of control.
[03:18:44.580 --> 03:18:46.580]  We're actually the criminal's best friend
[03:18:46.580 --> 03:18:48.580]  because they're going to end up destroying themselves
[03:18:48.580 --> 03:18:50.580]  and everybody with them if they don't stop.
[03:18:50.580 --> 03:18:54.580]  These people don't know when to quit.
[03:18:54.580 --> 03:18:57.580]  Well, that's my opinion and back to Mrs. Smith.
[03:18:57.580 --> 03:19:03.580]  I hope that this broadcast will get some people in D.C. off their butt
[03:19:03.580 --> 03:19:05.580]  and communicate with that woman
[03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:08.580]  and let her know what happened to her son.
[03:19:08.580 --> 03:19:11.580]  I think every mother needs to know
[03:19:11.580 --> 03:19:14.580]  when their son is lost in battle for the sake of this country
[03:19:14.580 --> 03:19:16.580]  and the patriotism of this country,
[03:19:16.580 --> 03:19:18.580]  they need to know what happened.
[03:19:18.580 --> 03:19:20.580]  I agree with you, Tosh. God bless you.
[03:19:20.580 --> 03:19:21.580]  We'll talk to you again soon
[03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:23.580]  and hopefully get you back up in the next week or so.
[03:19:23.580 --> 03:19:26.580]  You too, Jim. Thank you, gentlemen.
[03:19:26.580 --> 03:19:28.580]  Well, folks, what we know from this
[03:19:28.580 --> 03:19:32.580]  is that Tosh Plumlee is someone who's testified repeatedly
[03:19:32.580 --> 03:19:34.580]  and been proven accurate before Congress.
[03:19:34.580 --> 03:19:36.580]  He's saying he has a high-level NATO source
[03:19:36.580 --> 03:19:39.580]  that said that the State Department was transferring weapons
[03:19:39.580 --> 03:19:42.580]  directly to the Al Qaeda forces, Syrian rebels,
[03:19:42.580 --> 03:19:45.580]  and that they basically took out the ambassador and others
[03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:47.580]  because they were complaining.
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:49.580]  And that's what I have from other sources as well.
[03:19:49.580 --> 03:19:52.580]  But this is from somebody who talked to the NATO person
[03:19:52.580 --> 03:19:54.580]  who witnessed it and knew about it.
[03:19:54.580 --> 03:19:57.580]  This is big. This is big. This is dangerous.
[03:19:57.580 --> 03:19:59.580]  We're going to get articles out on infowords.com
[03:19:59.580 --> 03:20:07.580]  the next four or five hours on this.
