[00:00.000 --> 00:09.300]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.300 --> 00:10.300]  We're live.
[00:10.300 --> 00:11.300]  You want answers?
[00:11.300 --> 00:12.300]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.300 --> 00:20.620]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now stand by from Austin, Texas, Alex
[00:20.620 --> 00:21.620]  Jones.
[00:21.620 --> 00:26.540]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, the side of South by Southwest Media,
[00:26.540 --> 00:33.140]  feeding frenzy, we come to you from the infowars.com news studios.
[00:33.140 --> 00:38.180]  We have a very important broadcast lined up today, a lot of really over-the-top information
[00:38.180 --> 00:43.060]  up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:43.060 --> 00:51.380]  New York Times reports US giving Al Qaeda money, millions of dollars and weapons to fight.
[00:51.380 --> 00:54.580]  That's a big deal because that's mainstream media admitting something we've known for
[00:54.580 --> 00:56.420]  a long time.
[00:56.420 --> 01:00.900]  New bill would prohibit ATF ban on popular ammunition.
[01:00.900 --> 01:05.300]  We also have two forced inoculation bills failing in two different states.
[01:05.300 --> 01:07.460]  Very exciting positive news.
[01:07.460 --> 01:13.860]  I was driving home early yesterday at about 4.30 and saw the new Black Panther Party marching.
[01:13.860 --> 01:18.220]  I knew we had reporters in the area, and so I sent them over there and they got some shocking
[01:18.220 --> 01:19.220]  footage.
[01:19.220 --> 01:24.140]  We're going to play coming up where they were saying, bang, bang, 20 more cops dead.
[01:24.140 --> 01:26.300]  Very shocking rhetoric.
[01:26.300 --> 01:27.300]  That's all coming up.
[01:27.300 --> 01:36.780]  But first, this report on the Rothschilds from John Bowne.
[01:36.780 --> 01:40.740]  Just an hour north of San Francisco in an hour and a half east of the dark energy of
[01:40.740 --> 01:45.820]  the Bohemian Grove lies the peaceful vineyard-laden hamlet of Napa Valley.
[01:45.820 --> 01:50.660]  The perfect place to build a satanic Illuminati temple, right?
[01:50.660 --> 01:56.820]  In 1966, Charlotton Anton Leves founded the Church of Satan in San Francisco.
[01:56.820 --> 02:01.340]  His underground book, The Satanic Bible, attracted a new wave of satanic celebrities
[02:01.340 --> 02:05.540]  like Jane Mansfield, Sammy Davis Jr., and Liberace.
[02:05.540 --> 02:10.380]  It also caught the eye of satanic introverts Baron and Baroness Philip de Rothschild.
[02:10.380 --> 02:14.260]  Fritz Springmeyer's groundbreaking work, The Bloodlines of the Illuminati, goes into
[02:14.260 --> 02:17.340]  detail regarding the history of the Opus 1 winery.
[02:17.340 --> 02:21.780]  The Rothschilds are one of the most prominent of the top 13 Illuminati families.
[02:21.780 --> 02:25.940]  The Illuminati are building their temples secretly throughout the United States.
[02:25.940 --> 02:30.580]  Baron Rothschild, one of the greatest wine producers in history, and a closet satanist,
[02:30.580 --> 02:36.260]  began the construction of a pyramid in Napa Valley, which his daughter, Philippine, completed
[02:36.260 --> 02:37.460]  after he died.
[02:37.460 --> 02:42.860]  Springmeyer continues, the name of the building is Opus 1, which means the first work.
[02:42.860 --> 02:49.220]  The project began as a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and Baron Rothschild in 1979.
[02:49.220 --> 02:53.540]  Strangely, the Napa Valley Register, which reports on all building activity, remained
[02:53.540 --> 02:56.540]  extremely quiet about what was being built.
[02:56.540 --> 03:00.460]  From the air, the construction forms a masonic square and compass.
[03:00.460 --> 03:04.820]  According to one of the contractors who participated in building the pyramid, the project cost
[03:04.820 --> 03:06.140]  $35 million.
[03:06.140 --> 03:09.260]  Its cover or front for the temple is that it is a winery.
[03:09.260 --> 03:13.540]  The wineries in California, when they open traditionally and normally, are open to the
[03:13.540 --> 03:14.620]  public.
[03:14.620 --> 03:18.140]  The opening ceremonies of Opus 1 were shrouded in secrecy.
[03:18.140 --> 03:22.140]  The opening announcement was low key and only select people and select international media
[03:22.140 --> 03:23.840]  types were invited.
[03:23.840 --> 03:28.380]  This opening is extremely unusual for a winery in the Napa Valley area.
[03:28.380 --> 03:33.340]  Private guided tours are very hard to obtain, in contrast to the other wineries in Napa
[03:33.340 --> 03:34.340]  Valley.
[03:34.340 --> 03:37.940]  The capstone of the pyramid has a rotunda where skylight penetrates and where viewers
[03:37.940 --> 03:40.260]  can get a look of the entire Napa Valley.
[03:40.260 --> 03:44.900]  Orchids, which are used by the mothers of darkness, are grown all over the area.
[03:44.900 --> 03:49.220]  The pyramid was built with limestone from Texas, perhaps to accentuate the occultic
[03:49.220 --> 03:52.100]  significance of the limestone pyramids of Giza.
[03:52.100 --> 03:56.840]  Originally, Opus 1 was scheduled to open around the summer solstice, but the date was
[03:56.840 --> 04:02.580]  shifted to Wednesday, October 30th, 1991, which is the day before Halloween.
[04:02.580 --> 04:07.700]  Since the opening day, the Rothschilds have had events scheduled around satanic high days.
[04:07.700 --> 04:11.900]  Ceremonial drinking cups with rams and chairs which had the carvings on the front of arms
[04:11.900 --> 04:16.180]  and legs of fully formed demons were found in one of the rooms, with many closed doors
[04:16.180 --> 04:18.380]  leading to very private areas.
[04:18.380 --> 04:23.620]  Philippine de Rothschild died in Paris at the age of 80 on August 23rd, 2014.
[04:23.620 --> 04:28.860]  Ironically, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Napa Valley the very next day.
[04:28.860 --> 04:33.660]  It was the largest earthquake on record in that area in 25 years.
[04:33.660 --> 04:40.740]  Full report up on infowars.com and there's a lot of other satanic activities that have
[04:40.740 --> 04:44.500]  been proven with the Rothschilds, not just the claims of Fritz Springmeier that were
[04:44.500 --> 04:45.820]  reviewed there.
[04:45.820 --> 04:46.820]  Those are his claims.
[04:46.820 --> 04:51.540]  I believe there's a lot of truth to them when you add the other facilities that have
[04:51.540 --> 04:54.380]  been found in London and outside of Paris.
[04:54.380 --> 04:55.380]  We'll be back.
[04:55.380 --> 04:59.020]  Stay with us.

[05:28.980 --> 05:32.620]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:32.620 --> 05:36.980]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:36.980 --> 05:38.980]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:38.980 --> 05:44.580]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[05:44.580 --> 05:46.620]  priced and fully legal.
[05:46.620 --> 05:47.700]  But for how long?
[05:47.700 --> 05:54.700]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:54.700 --> 05:57.300]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[05:57.300 --> 05:59.340]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[05:59.340 --> 06:00.340]  Good, brother.
[06:00.340 --> 06:03.740]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct.
[06:03.740 --> 06:07.900]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[06:07.900 --> 06:08.900]  Well, thank you, brother.
[06:08.900 --> 06:11.700]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the
[06:11.700 --> 06:13.260]  highest quality.
[06:13.260 --> 06:19.060]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[06:19.060 --> 06:21.060]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[06:21.060 --> 06:25.780]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[06:25.780 --> 06:30.740]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[06:30.740 --> 06:36.420]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[06:36.420 --> 06:41.460]  or maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just
[06:41.460 --> 06:45.420]  cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[06:45.420 --> 06:49.820]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I
[06:49.820 --> 06:50.820]  love it.
[06:50.820 --> 06:55.740]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[06:55.740 --> 06:56.740]  from InfoWarsLife.
[07:55.740 --> 08:20.380]  8-8-2-5-3-30-1-39.
[08:20.380 --> 08:25.380]  We have more thermal nuclear saber rattling today coming out of Russia.
[08:25.380 --> 08:31.740]  As NATO troops and armor build up for intensified fighting directly with Russian Spitznets
[08:31.740 --> 08:32.740]  in Eastern Ukraine.
[08:32.740 --> 08:37.260]  I just can't believe I just said that on air.
[08:37.260 --> 08:40.860]  It's so dangerous, it's so epic, it's so insane.
[08:40.860 --> 08:48.260]  We have got a lot of positive Second Amendment news, a lot of positive news on health freedom.
[08:48.260 --> 08:54.380]  Yesterday at South by Southwest, I happened to see what I guess is the new Black Panther
[08:54.380 --> 09:00.220]  Party marching down South Congress from the Capitol, and unlike an open carry march that's
[09:00.220 --> 09:07.740]  pro-Second Amendment that's meant to forward proper safety-based, constitutional-based
[09:07.740 --> 09:13.860]  open carry to promote the Second Amendment and the fact that non-criminals with guns
[09:13.860 --> 09:23.420]  lowers crime rates, I saw the new Black Panther Party carrying the guns on their chest, waving
[09:23.420 --> 09:29.980]  them around in a very provocative way that I believe violates state law.
[09:29.980 --> 09:36.900]  I was going to a meeting, so I knew we had reporters already downtown, and so I was able
[09:36.900 --> 09:42.900]  to get Josh Owens and others over there to basically interview the new Black Panther
[09:42.900 --> 09:47.540]  folks and some of the other organizations that were with them.
[09:47.540 --> 09:53.140]  As far as I'm concerned, this is basically the mirror image of the Ku Klux Klan ignorant
[09:53.140 --> 10:00.340]  stupid, racist, mindless, but on the Black side, and very stupid, very hate-filled.
[10:00.340 --> 10:06.100]  They were chanting, and there's some cuss words in this, the full videos up on infowars.com
[10:06.100 --> 10:10.580]  and prisonplanet.com, I'm not going to air the whole eight-minute video here, as you
[10:10.580 --> 10:16.500]  can see it, basically unedited, you know, large sections of what was being said with
[10:16.500 --> 10:23.940]  the chance of bang, bang, oink, oink, you know, 20 more cops, and we're done clearly
[10:23.940 --> 10:30.460]  saying kill police officers, and we've seen two shots and killed in New York.
[10:30.460 --> 10:35.340]  We've seen two shots just a few days ago, obviously, in Missouri, and we've seen a lot
[10:35.340 --> 10:40.180]  of police getting shot at, and there are a lot of bad cops out there, and there's a
[10:40.180 --> 10:46.540]  lot of globalization, federalization, to turn the police into a very dangerous conglomerate,
[10:46.540 --> 10:52.700]  an oppressive situation like we see in North Korea or Mexico, and shooting and killing
[10:52.700 --> 10:56.700]  random police will help that degeneration accelerate.
[10:56.700 --> 11:00.340]  That's why you've got people trying to stir things up and escalate things like George
[11:00.340 --> 11:06.940]  Soros spending 33 plus million dollars to stir up the little white agitator college
[11:06.940 --> 11:12.820]  students, the little political scientist, to go in and get these anti-police chance
[11:12.820 --> 11:18.580]  going and to say things like, deck the halls with dead cops, follow-la-la-la-la-la, shoot
[11:18.580 --> 11:24.580]  them, shoot them, we've played those videos, again, I'm not a cop worshiper, I've criticized
[11:24.580 --> 11:28.740]  the police turning into a totalitarian force, but it's a good thing I'm not a cop, because
[11:28.740 --> 11:33.620]  if somebody was saying deck the halls with dead cops in front of me, even if I wasn't
[11:33.620 --> 11:37.540]  a cop and I was there and Joe Biggs and Jakari were there, I'd slap them upside the head.
[11:37.540 --> 11:42.140]  Somebody was walking around the parking lot here saying, deck the halls with dead info
[11:42.140 --> 11:50.420]  warriors, I'd take that as a threat, and that is a threat, and it's a serious escalation,
[11:50.420 --> 11:54.460]  and I've been predicting for years you're going to see a civil war start in this country
[11:54.460 --> 11:58.660]  that if a civil war starts, that the establishment wants, it'll start with cop killings all over
[11:58.660 --> 12:03.380]  the nation, and they will just like they fund al-Qaeda and other groups and then flip it
[12:03.380 --> 12:08.380]  on the Tea Party and gun owners and libertarians, it's the same thing, they get a movement of
[12:08.380 --> 12:11.860]  killing cops, like that's the new protest, you go out and you kill a cop in their squad
[12:11.860 --> 12:15.900]  car, or you kill a cop directing traffic, it's real manly, it's what a revolutionary
[12:15.900 --> 12:23.540]  does, no it's not, they brand the revolution like that to discredit a peaceful revolution
[12:23.540 --> 12:27.580]  of ideas, or even if we have to have a violent revolution to defend ourselves, they want
[12:27.580 --> 12:35.900]  to brand it as illegitimate, so that's why it's being done, period, and again, I wasn't
[12:35.900 --> 12:39.740]  afraid because I've gone down to La Raza and Black Panther events and Klan events and
[12:39.740 --> 12:44.740]  protested them many times and almost gotten in fights and been arrested by the police,
[12:44.740 --> 12:49.780]  I just at this point in my life, I'm a general in the fight, I didn't pull over and do it
[12:49.780 --> 12:54.180]  so we should commend our reporters for going down there and being around these folks because
[12:54.180 --> 12:58.820]  people waving guns around and talking about shooting people, I mean my instinct is to
[12:58.820 --> 13:02.980]  punch them in the face and that would have not been good obviously, so I just did not
[13:02.980 --> 13:08.460]  put myself in that situation, I think the Austin Police Department was very restrained
[13:08.460 --> 13:13.420]  because they marched down Congress, down 6th Street, all over the place chanting, basically
[13:13.420 --> 13:20.140]  shoot the police and it's illegal folks, it's disturbing the peace, it is reckless endangerment,
[13:20.140 --> 13:26.020]  it is a clear provocation towards riot and violence, it is not the First Amendment, it
[13:26.020 --> 13:30.620]  is not the Second Amendment and it was on the news of course, being used to demonize
[13:30.620 --> 13:37.420]  open carry, when we went and had the open carry at the Alamo, nobody got arrested and
[13:37.420 --> 13:42.060]  we had our guns strapped on our backs pointed down at the ground to de-escalate things,
[13:42.060 --> 13:46.300]  but they said it was illegal, but the state law said it wasn't, the city law was a fraud,
[13:46.300 --> 13:51.980]  so 1500 of us, black, white, Hispanic, old, young marched down there and took back our
[13:51.980 --> 13:55.940]  Second Amendment with the land commissioner and that's how you do it when you've got a
[13:55.940 --> 14:00.340]  law that's unconstitutional, we have the moral high ground, we weren't spitting at the police,
[14:00.340 --> 14:04.580]  we weren't saying we're going to kill the police, when the police chief acted arrogant,
[14:04.580 --> 14:10.180]  we told him he was arrogant and told him that he was acting shameful saying he didn't support
[14:10.180 --> 14:16.420]  the Second Amendment, but that's where it ended, because we are the good guys, we have
[14:16.420 --> 14:22.340]  the moral high ground and it's that simple.
[14:22.340 --> 14:27.220]  So let's go ahead and play that clip, then Anthony Gucciardi got pushed out and under
[14:27.220 --> 14:31.380]  law assaulted, it wasn't totally assaulted, but that's what they would call it, shoved
[14:31.380 --> 14:36.140]  out, he was already leaving and McDonald's were shoving him out of the free McDonald's,
[14:36.140 --> 14:42.580]  GMO, so-called food, tent and then eight police showed up to that and didn't put their hands
[14:42.580 --> 14:50.380]  on Gucciardi or on our camera people, like the McDonald's security guards were.
[14:50.380 --> 14:54.340]  And that's, it was the private rented property of McDonald's, that's far of them to throw
[14:54.340 --> 14:58.980]  us off, it's not fine to touch us and the police didn't do that, it was the security
[14:58.980 --> 15:03.780]  guards and of course it turned out off air, some of the police were listeners obviously,
[15:03.780 --> 15:07.940]  but McDonald's was there trying to basically get our people arrested claiming that we'd
[15:07.940 --> 15:13.220]  done something wrong, Anthony Gucciardi is going to be in studio with us in about twenty
[15:13.220 --> 15:21.380]  minutes with Donald McRonald and if you go to Twitter at Real Alex Jones you can see
[15:21.380 --> 15:25.460]  Joe Biggs, he was out there last night, he's going to be back there in about an hour and
[15:25.460 --> 15:29.660]  a half, we're going to tell you the location on the Google map for everybody who is in
[15:29.660 --> 15:35.820]  Austin listening to us on 90.1 of their stations, so you can get down there in not a flash mob
[15:35.820 --> 15:42.340]  but a flash demonstration against GMO, against plasticizers and their McNuggets, McDonald's
[15:42.340 --> 15:46.980]  is the big kahuna and if we can force them to change what they're starting to do and
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.700]  if we can force them to admit what they've done is wrong, we could really break the back
[15:50.700 --> 15:57.140]  of Frankenfoods which is one of the globalist main tools, so Joe Biggs fighting on the front
[15:57.140 --> 16:02.660]  lines for food, safety and freedom, we'll be joining us and then he's going to go down
[16:02.660 --> 16:08.020]  with our camera crew at 12.30 so high noon, thirty minutes past noon, you're plenty of
[16:08.020 --> 16:12.100]  time to go down there, there's some actually healthy food trucks downtown, get yourself
[16:12.100 --> 16:16.500]  some food and then get over there but we'll pull up the exact address of the McDonald's
[16:16.500 --> 16:21.580]  facility so you can go there and then I suggest you go on with your iPhone, they can't stop
[16:21.580 --> 16:25.500]  everybody from going in and going up and asking questions about what's in the McNuggets, what's
[16:25.500 --> 16:30.860]  going on, this is very exciting, it's open to the public, they advertise it as a commons,
[16:30.860 --> 16:35.260]  they say you can come in and then they give you free quote food, kind of like a crack
[16:35.260 --> 16:39.460]  dealer, you know, gives ten year olds free crack or free heroin to get them on it and
[16:39.460 --> 16:45.740]  they're going around giving free coffee out and free burgers out of these dispensers on
[16:45.740 --> 16:50.900]  interns backs, I mean this is really sick what's going on but still there's not many
[16:50.900 --> 16:56.940]  people there getting the free McDonald's crap and I'm sorry folks McDonald's makes me physically
[16:56.940 --> 17:02.340]  ill when I eat it and if Bill Gates is involved it is just some of the worst so-called garbage
[17:02.340 --> 17:09.020]  so-called food out there so that's coming up as well but before we get into all of that
[17:09.020 --> 17:16.300]  other news we're going to play this clip, you know this is a short clip because of some
[17:16.300 --> 17:22.040]  of the profanity of the Black Panthers call for killing a police bearing shot by Southwest
[17:22.040 --> 17:29.700]  armed march and I know the law folks I'm a journalist I've dealt with it to go around
[17:29.700 --> 17:35.340]  and talk about we need to see 20 more cops dead oink oink you know bang bang oink oink
[17:35.340 --> 17:41.660]  20 more and we're done it is it's just it's not the first amendment and notice media
[17:41.660 --> 17:45.460]  matters everybody run by the White House always claiming I'm wanting violence or I'm calling
[17:45.460 --> 17:49.060]  for violence or I want police to be killed they've been saying that for like six seven
[17:49.060 --> 17:55.380]  years because they know I'm doing the opposite they know I'm on to Soros and the plan so
[17:55.380 --> 17:58.900]  when there are a bunch of cops getting shot down the road unfortunately they're going
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.820]  to blame the liberty movement they're going to blame talk radio and it's a very dangerous
[18:02.820 --> 18:07.540]  trend we're trying to stop it and trying to stop a civil war in this country we need black
[18:07.540 --> 18:11.820]  and white and everybody to come together in liberty we need to be able to be legitimate
[18:11.820 --> 18:16.540]  I mean I've got video on info wars dot com of a cop it's very angry as a man calls him
[18:16.540 --> 18:21.340]  out for parking in a handicapped spot in Boston and the cops says do you know who I am and
[18:21.340 --> 18:25.660]  gets in his face I mean yeah if you're not an emergency you're just picking up hamburgers
[18:25.660 --> 18:31.300]  don't park in the handicapped spot we need to police the police and they need to police
[18:31.300 --> 18:37.180]  themselves because that's part of this this this this this giant Psyop is the police are
[18:37.180 --> 18:42.300]  under so much pressure they then defend each other no matter the cops are doing bad things
[18:42.300 --> 18:46.220]  then that allows corruption to grow and then the whole thing is discredited and now the
[18:46.220 --> 18:52.780]  globalist can come in and fully take over let's go ahead and go to this clip of the
[18:52.780 --> 18:56.380]  new black panther not the original black panther party that did a lot of good the new black
[18:56.380 --> 19:24.380]  panther party there's a globalist funded here this
[19:24.380 --> 19:52.460]  you can admire people that have the courage to do this but they're so ignorant misguided
[19:52.460 --> 19:59.820]  it's just pathetic and it's very very very very sad we'll be right back it's no secret

[35:42.300 --> 35:47.020]  were taking on all of them just yesterday the washington post had to admit that congress is set
[35:47.020 --> 35:52.380]  to try to pass laws to not let you know what's in a vaccine and get rid of the inserts or drug inserts
[35:52.380 --> 35:57.580]  so they won't tell you that you know uh viagra might give you a heart attack or they won't tell you
[35:57.580 --> 36:03.980]  that um things like m mr shots might give you diabetes or narcolepsy or epilepsy or death

[37:18.140 --> 37:23.020]  audience of one here uh for at least a few minutes it'll become distracting for me so i like my
[37:23.020 --> 37:28.860]  solitude here down the bat cave uh but it literally in the bat cave but this is very exciting to be
[37:28.860 --> 37:34.220]  on the offense and we're teaching folks how to hijack media we've already had four national news
[37:34.220 --> 37:39.900]  stories just since last friday out of south by southwest all of them hijacking the enemy
[37:40.700 --> 37:44.860]  that's what this is all about we just exposed the new black panther party calling to shoot police
[37:44.860 --> 37:49.340]  we just exposed the people demonstrating against ai takeover society national news
[37:49.340 --> 37:54.620]  we've got so much this this mcdonald's story is going viral and this is how the new independent
[37:54.620 --> 37:59.580]  media this is what muck rakers a hundred years ago did you know the guys with the fedoras i mean
[37:59.580 --> 38:05.020]  this this is what the the straw hat fedora reporters did you'd have ten local newspapers
[38:05.020 --> 38:09.180]  or five local newspapers in a smaller town battling to really get it right and it was
[38:09.180 --> 38:13.340]  interesting and it was informative and corruption was scared so the big banking committees of the
[38:13.340 --> 38:17.980]  fellow reserve bought up the media and that's been declassified as well and the new yardee uh
[38:17.980 --> 38:20.860]  tell us what's coming up today my friend i think i know you've got another story you're working on
[38:20.860 --> 38:24.540]  but hope you go down and join begs for part of this and shoot your own angle uh tell us about
[38:24.540 --> 38:28.860]  what happened yesterday and how exciting this revolution is we know we know mcdonald's is losing
[38:28.860 --> 38:33.020]  money month after month they've underperformed the market for so long for four years in february
[38:33.020 --> 38:37.980]  they lost a colossal amount of money they're in bed with monsanto the number one manufacturer of
[38:37.980 --> 38:43.500]  gmo seats monsanto is also losing money both of these companies are struggling just like coca
[38:43.500 --> 38:48.140]  cola we have a story about that today too these companies are admittedly going out the south
[38:48.140 --> 38:52.460]  by southwest to get a younger hip crowd they're trying to rebrand them they know these are trending
[38:52.460 --> 38:56.700]  narcissists that are totally statement this is their target mark exactly and this is their
[38:56.700 --> 39:00.780]  last ditch effort and we went in there we want to save right whales that don't know and swim
[39:00.780 --> 39:04.460]  right to the boats in your harpoon no exactly i mean these people have no idea we interviewed
[39:04.460 --> 39:07.820]  these people when we went to mcdonald's but here's the here's the weird thing we didn't expect to get
[39:07.820 --> 39:12.540]  thrown out we actually did not expect you were very polite for the security guard to assault me
[39:12.540 --> 39:16.700]  and push me out the door and for them to keep calling the cops over and over and over demanding
[39:16.700 --> 39:21.100]  that they remove me from the public sidewalk and arrest me i didn't expect that so we went in let's
[39:21.100 --> 39:26.300]  be clear they kept first they tell the cops who get them off the gang plane the cops go oh please
[39:26.300 --> 39:29.260]  go over here and then they go no we're not getting them off the sidewalk well the cops admitted you
[39:29.260 --> 39:32.860]  should be able to go in there this is crazy yeah they're on tape saying that and then we have it
[39:32.860 --> 39:36.700]  on tape saying you can film we want to go in and that's because they get there they're saying open
[39:36.700 --> 39:41.340]  to media they want citizens to shoot their own media once you open the door and say give us your
[39:41.340 --> 39:47.260]  social media come in here and film yeah it's a media orgy and we've also got the gmo companies
[39:47.260 --> 39:51.580]  blocking the consumer association it was set to speak at Whole Foods and we want to go in and say
[39:51.580 --> 39:55.180]  hey why do you still have garbage in your food sure they're getting rid of antibiotics and some
[39:55.180 --> 39:59.180]  of their chicken over the next few years they're pretending they're natural they have high fructose
[39:59.180 --> 40:03.340]  corn syrup which contains mercury they did just announced Washington post they did just announce
[40:03.340 --> 40:07.260]  they're going to get rid of the growth hormone in the mill yeah that's exactly right because
[40:07.260 --> 40:11.100]  their new angle in five years they're going to have organic stuff there too their new angles
[40:11.100 --> 40:15.820]  quote unquote being natural just like yahoo is now launching health lines they're doing all of this
[40:15.820 --> 40:19.660]  to be relevant they know that they can't beat us so they're going to try to take the movement over
[40:19.660 --> 40:23.820]  with with with clumps actually and we need to highlight but we all saw John Carpenter's remake
[40:23.820 --> 40:28.300]  of the thing we know that that's not really the crew chief it's been taken over yeah exactly
[40:28.300 --> 40:32.140]  mcdonald's is going to try and possess this movement that we're speaker don't get in the
[40:32.140 --> 40:35.660]  dark with mcdonald's they are in fact doing that and we want to go in and talk about the
[40:35.660 --> 40:39.580]  ingredients and as soon as i said what are in the mcnuggets that i'm about to buy they all
[40:39.580 --> 40:45.500]  looked so freaked out like no one had ever asked before i've got one that can see exactly and then
[40:45.500 --> 40:49.500]  and then this little security this huge like fat security guard guy but he's real short came over
[40:49.500 --> 40:53.740]  and just started grabbing me like hugging me and pushing me well technically that's a salt because
[40:53.740 --> 40:57.980]  you you hadn't resisted you were going you kept saying stop it and i'm watching the tape it looks
[40:57.980 --> 41:01.420]  like he was squeezing your arm oh yeah he was squeezing my arm grabbed me really hard and pushing
[41:01.420 --> 41:04.780]  me trying to lift me up and kind of throw me down yeah i'm going to go talk to those guys
[41:04.780 --> 41:10.060]  today and find out why they were doing that yeah now let's tell us who you are sir well i'm
[41:10.060 --> 41:15.740]  donald mcronald i'm uh ronald mcdonald's more ethical brother you know i don't like gmo's and
[41:15.740 --> 41:21.900]  i'm anti mcdonald's so my whole point is i want to go out and expose all the the bad things that
[41:21.900 --> 41:26.620]  are in the food people shouldn't be eating this i talked to people last night a mother knew that
[41:26.620 --> 41:30.540]  there was so a silicone breast implant fillers and the chicken nuggets and yes she said she
[41:30.540 --> 41:34.540]  still was going to give it to her kids they've got to do something what's wrong with a silicon
[41:34.540 --> 41:41.260]  additive i mean i guess that means i'm a racist i just don't get it if i'm against clowns i kind
[41:41.260 --> 41:44.540]  of don't like you i mean does that even though you're a good guy does that mean i'm racist
[41:45.340 --> 41:49.580]  foundophobia well i'm not really a clown this is what happened to an a mcdonald's food for 40 years
[41:49.580 --> 41:54.300]  straight oh they brought you up like that yeah i transform this way it's all the gmo's this is
[41:54.300 --> 42:00.220]  a makeup i wake up this way every day wow yeah it's horrible well tell me about what happened
[42:00.220 --> 42:05.900]  last night well last night i was it was shocking i was kind of a big star everyone was really happy
[42:05.900 --> 42:12.940]  to see ronald mcdonald but they had very very rude things to say about the mcdonald's food
[42:12.940 --> 42:17.500]  they didn't like it most people that's hate speech yeah it was racist too i told people
[42:17.500 --> 42:22.620]  if you don't like gmo's you're racist i guess there's a lot of race how'd it go with the police
[42:23.580 --> 42:27.820]  most of them liked us but there was one guy who was really rude he told me to go
[42:27.820 --> 42:32.380]  do something to myself when i brought up whether or not he liked gmo's and i thought that was really
[42:32.380 --> 42:36.140]  rude i think we were looking at the footage we may even have the tape of this it's possible
[42:36.140 --> 42:42.620]  pop tells donald mcdonald to f off yeah but i got to get a nice little golf cart ride through
[42:42.620 --> 42:48.220]  south by southwest and spread all this who gave you that ride some nice gentleman who was driving
[42:48.220 --> 42:53.100]  around said he'd pick us up and i use my bullhorn to talk to people and tell him about the flower
[42:53.100 --> 42:57.660]  beet bleaching agents in the that's using yoga mats that's found in their food yeah tell me what's in
[42:57.660 --> 43:02.700]  there well there's flower bleaching agents that's uh it's outlawed in other countries and you can
[43:02.700 --> 43:08.540]  be fine 450 thousand dollars if you use that but for some reason america allows it to be put in their
[43:08.540 --> 43:14.060]  food and then for some reason mcdonald's in america uses 19 ingredients to make french fries
[43:14.620 --> 43:21.100]  hello french fries a potato what do i need 19 ingredients for so there's that there's the
[43:21.100 --> 43:26.220]  chemicals the propylene glycol a silicone breast and plant fillers i mean why do we need this and
[43:26.220 --> 43:29.340]  i'm what's wrong with propylene glycol you give that to your cat or dog they get real happy
[43:29.340 --> 43:38.620]  the laxative chemical is also electronic cigarette filler yummy but i mean it didn't also involve
[43:38.620 --> 43:43.260]  an antifreeze well what's wrong with that everybody knows that's nutritious yeah it's good for your
[43:43.260 --> 43:47.100]  actually folks that's a joke if your new listener it'll kill you a bit in large amounts go ahead i'm
[43:47.100 --> 43:52.620]  sorry yeah so we want to go out there today and ask the people that my twin brother works for the
[43:52.620 --> 43:58.300]  evil ronald mcdonald why they're doing this why are they putting all this what is it like at family
[43:58.300 --> 44:02.620]  reunions or i mean do you see your brother or you know he talks to me they don't like me because i
[44:02.620 --> 44:09.260]  like to eat fruit and natural beef and drink organic milk and try to be healthy so they don't
[44:09.260 --> 44:16.060]  like me they all just sit around the smoke cigarettes and drink like gmo beer and eat uh mcdonald's
[44:16.060 --> 44:21.900]  food all day it's horrible do you think the security guard was eating mcdonald's and
[44:21.900 --> 44:25.980]  oh i know well there was one guy he ran up to me he was really big and i know he ate a lot of our
[44:25.980 --> 44:29.180]  food well you know i actually asked an employee one of the girls that worked i didn't know she
[44:29.180 --> 44:32.220]  worked there she had a big mac because i was trying to get a big mac all i wanted some were
[44:32.220 --> 44:35.820]  some mcnuggets i kept saying this is a good guy please just let me get my mcnuggets please
[44:35.820 --> 44:40.140]  and he said no get out of here you know he actually the words were out get get out get
[44:40.140 --> 44:46.300]  so they can't even talk now i'll get i'll get asked quantities why does mcdonald's even need
[44:46.300 --> 44:51.980]  security they're obviously hiding something well i just can't believe they had eight cops there
[44:51.980 --> 44:54.940]  and the employee girl that worked there though i asked her if she eats mcdonald's at the time
[44:54.940 --> 44:59.420]  she's like no i said well why don't you eat it every day and she goes well you know and that's
[44:59.420 --> 45:05.500]  when the manager slash pr woman came over and started escorting her away don't talk to him don't
[45:05.500 --> 45:10.060]  talk to him and we were like well you know why can't she talk to us what's wrong why doesn't
[45:10.060 --> 45:13.580]  she eat mcdonald's every day and everyone we asked even even though they were eating it
[45:13.580 --> 45:16.940]  we said why don't you eat mcdonald's all the time like because it's killing me one guy goes
[45:16.940 --> 45:22.140]  i'm sheep old yeah he goes because they thought they were getting a free deal yep just like why
[45:22.140 --> 45:25.740]  why did you use the crack well the man gave it to me free yeah well why do you give it to your
[45:25.740 --> 45:31.420]  kids because they get a free toy at the end that's how they get them every time happy it's just like
[45:31.420 --> 45:36.780]  they used to give toys away with cigarettes and stuff too i'm not loving it you're not loving
[45:36.780 --> 45:40.620]  but now they covered up for 50 years they were adding deadly sometimes 300 plus chemicals of
[45:40.620 --> 45:44.780]  cigarettes to make it even more addicted and kill you and now that's all come out i wonder what's
[45:44.780 --> 45:49.500]  going to happen to the new order promoting you know mcdonald's gives money to gun control
[45:49.500 --> 45:53.420]  open borders the whole globalist agenda that's another reason we're going after these corporations
[45:53.420 --> 45:56.460]  is they're going after our freedoms and they need to know that when they watch this later
[45:56.460 --> 46:00.220]  or listening to it now we're doing this because we're tired of being screwed over by you
[46:00.220 --> 46:04.860]  you did the whole country goes bankrupt because we're so sick and then you socialize things
[46:05.580 --> 46:09.820]  or set up death panels and then set up secret death list for the veterans so they don't get
[46:09.820 --> 46:16.140]  treatment in health care we're sick of your agenda we know who you are go back to hades from when you
[46:16.140 --> 46:23.260]  came you need to perform an exorcism that's that we need tomorrow form an exorcism on mcdonald's
[46:23.260 --> 46:30.860]  and i'm not even kidding donald mcdonald yeah donald mcdonald let's uh anthony what do you
[46:30.860 --> 46:36.460]  think of donald mcdonald i think donald mcdonald is a good testament to uh as well as what was
[46:36.460 --> 46:40.700]  outside mcdonald's they had these weird creatures with like three eyes and six arms and things so
[46:40.700 --> 46:45.020]  they're teaching you that's normal well it was like it was almost like uh you know as mutations
[46:45.020 --> 46:49.420]  increase they'll say don't be mean to the mutants they won't ask why is everyone becoming a mutant
[46:49.420 --> 46:55.420]  like that's always fine to cure not why is breast cancer three thousand percent up why is this read
[46:55.420 --> 46:59.180]  this is a mutate well literally when they feed gmo's of third generation of guinea pigs they have
[46:59.180 --> 47:03.260]  like three four eyeballs legs out of their heads testicles coming out of their mouths i'm not joking
[47:03.260 --> 47:07.580]  hair on their tongues oh their butts on their heads i mean in fact we're gonna show some photos of
[47:07.580 --> 47:11.020]  this i'm not joking so actually we're not joking i guess they're getting the kids ready but this
[47:11.020 --> 47:15.500]  will be normal and then again just like all the estrogen mimicers making men feminine and then
[47:15.500 --> 47:21.900]  they have chemical reactions this is the mainstream news if you say hey men this is making you a woman
[47:22.700 --> 47:27.260]  there's some people that are artificially gay now it's oh you're a homophobe it's kind of like
[47:27.260 --> 47:32.620]  in the uh omega man at the end uh when he tries charlton hasson tries to give him the cure and
[47:32.620 --> 47:37.500]  they go dude we don't want it killing they don't want to know so well the new thing is no if you
[47:37.500 --> 47:40.780]  actually have a literal disease you shouldn't even try to fight it you should just accept it
[47:40.780 --> 47:44.380]  and let it take over your body it's normal now so as you said that's an angle they're teaching
[47:44.380 --> 47:47.980]  the kids how to be mutants well it's almost reminds me of two three thousand years ago when
[47:47.980 --> 47:51.740]  there'd be you know a fork in the road there's a sign that says like some symbol to some type of
[47:51.740 --> 47:56.460]  like you know there's an angry beast this way or home this way it's almost like warning go in here
[47:56.460 --> 48:01.500]  and you'll look like this it was these huge fat weird blob creatures with like x's over their
[48:01.500 --> 48:04.540]  eyes there's people that eat that or like that so it's like they should feel good
[48:06.380 --> 48:11.580]  teenage mutant ninja nuggets teenage mutant ninja nuggets mutant turtles
[48:11.580 --> 48:18.140]  mutant children a half shell mutant power and don't forget behind you you'll see the uh ronald
[48:18.140 --> 48:22.860]  mcdonald's selfie machine that was one of my favorite things you there was a a selfie machine
[48:22.860 --> 48:28.300]  where you could uh go up next to ronald mcdonald and go out to twitter and everything how big of
[48:28.300 --> 48:33.340]  a mcdonald's fan you are and people were doing it like grown men like in in business suits were
[48:33.340 --> 48:37.180]  going up to the ronald mcdonald's selfie machine and just taking selfies with it
[48:37.180 --> 48:42.380]  but you you wonder who actually goes here a lot of people do ronald's a seller a lot of people
[48:42.380 --> 48:47.180]  actually look at this guy this is security guy that uh decided i wasn't allowed to uh

[56:29.740 --> 56:34.620]  protest banned on sidewalk against mcdonald selective enforcement civil rights violation
[56:34.620 --> 56:39.100]  we'll just call the cops over and over again but it'll be very very but they can't stop the general

[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:21.180]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.700]  he's one of the top comedians in the country david cross and put out a film
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:34.140]  we're not even going to plug here uh where the movie ends with someone that i've brainwashed over
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.260]  the radio saying he hates black people and hates jews and they learned it from alex jones alex
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.660]  jones he repeats it cross told joe biggs who's talked to him whenever we get him on the show
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:49.260]  joe hit him on twitter and then talked to him uh that i'm getting torn up by my fans and maybe i
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.740]  don't know who alex jones is and i may have to basically apologize and we have the text back and
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:59.340]  forth that's good we're not going to spend a bunch of time in the next hour with joe's rowing on
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.740]  montell williams even though she knew montell williams she was part of a reality tv show with him
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.620]  but uh she's got some stuff she wants to dish on montell williams at the end of the day you know
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.340]  who really cares about montell williams well the issue is it shows you what type of folks these
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:18.700]  people are he came out and said that i want to blow stuff up that i'm a drug addict and that i'm
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:24.140]  basically a terrorist and then i'm as bad as isis because we were exposing
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:33.340]  mainstream news articles we were uh joe biggs was again um where it was in the
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:39.820]  indianapolis star that they were making fun of trips killing themselves 22 a day i mean we're
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:44.860]  not trying to be the good guys here but we are i mean it's not hard to be a good guy you should be
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.020]  against trips commit suicide or secret death list for the troops why would you attack me for that
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:56.300]  i mean people are sick look at the fruit loop alice jones look at the cokehead look at the
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:01.260]  terrorist look at the con man how you know how dare anybody retweet this and it wasn't even us
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.940]  tweeting our own articles most people tweet their own stuff we do that too but we tweet everybody's
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:15.340]  stuff you know that's interesting we're just trying to get the word out here
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.980]  and that's all we're talking about with joe that's just one of the little issues but it shows that
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.620]  we're under attack and i guarantee you this is being funded this is being supported this is an
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:31.660]  agenda just like i said george soros four months ago was behind the fergus and stuff and trayvon
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.060]  martin and it later came out i didn't just say that because it was in my gut i said hey what's on
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.020]  that sign it says the group and i went and looked at the group and it was soros funded in in fergus
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.700]  and then i looked at one in new york another front group and i went and looked soros funded
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.380]  and then of course it came out in the washington times that he gave 33 mil i mean look i know
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.980]  what i'm talking about you do this 23 years you you you would do i eat drink and sleep this stuff
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.460]  i was on the phone at 6 30 this morning to england with paul watson working on articles with him
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:07.020]  i was on the phone at 7 a.m with buckley hamlin working i mean i'm not bragging it's just that
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:14.700]  you wild horses couldn't drag me away i mean i eat drink and sleep fighting these people
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.500]  and i'm not going away and i'm not shutting up and i'm not backing down and liberty is infectious
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:26.220]  i'm here as a detonator not to detonate a violent revolution not the start one but to stop one
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:31.500]  with a renaissance of ideas and that's why they try to block us with our ideas at any big media
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:41.820]  event rnc dnc shot by southwest comic con that's why in media period democratic or republican it's
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:50.300]  so controlled at the top they bully and threaten anyone that comes on this show big conservative
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:55.740]  icons come on they get calls and say you better watch it not come on that show liberals come on
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.020]  the show they get calls you better not come on that show former spies come on the broadcast
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:10.380]  they get home visits by the cia and mi6 we've gotten similar visits and those visits were
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:15.740]  in confidence so i'll leave it at that the the israeli visit was not and i kind of got in the
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.820]  guy's face i agreed for him to come here and then i went to dinner with him and stuff and they just
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:24.540]  said well we wanted to talk to you and see where you really stood and i said you know where i stand
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:31.020]  is for moral rules that i want to be treated by you reap what you sow karma whatever you want to
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:35.820]  call it it's like tona montana says i got two things in this world my word and my wavos and i

[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.140]  to them and when i got to do something to somebody i don't enjoy it and i don't look at people off of
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.980]  what group or religion they are i look at them off of what they stand for and what they've done their
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:57.340]  life their fruits as christ said and it's martin luther king echo it's that simple that's who i am

[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:44.620]  the fixes in here uh the what's happened with gulf war vets the death list where they have them on
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:49.420]  these do not treat lists that joys exposed years ago before we even knew the name of the program
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.900]  and people couldn't believe it so we'll discuss all that the russia situation the state of the

[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.860]  up on screen the power hour dot com excellent website and a treasure trove information on every
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:11.740]  subject uh you can imagine so captain joys rally joins us first off i've been praying for you know
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:17.900]  the audience has uh how are you feeling overall uh in your battle here well thank you alex i'm
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.340]  feeling awesome i really am at one point i was actually in a wheelchair and now i can actually
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.860]  get around without even a cane at times so thank god it has been yeah and it's been a wonderful
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.580]  experience you know i kind of have told people that i'm the canary in the coal mine given the
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:39.180]  fact that i went traditional natural medicine on everything at first and then had to back down
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:45.580]  come back and retract that and say nope if i had to do over again i would do it differently and
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:50.860]  i'm going to disclose that you know eventually on the program and tell people what i would have done
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.460]  or should have done in my estimation but i'm not there yet to either have a cure or a demise out
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:01.740]  of this thing so i'm just kind of taking it one day at a time now but i do warn everybody and i
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:05.580]  do want to tell this to everybody who's listening to me on the power hour if you've quit listening
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:11.740]  to me in or just listening to alex and you have not heard me say this let me tell you that it's
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:18.060]  important to know where you are with your cancer that means do the proper diagnostics don't just
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:24.460]  jump into eating a handful of walnuts a day and a package of grapes and you know whatever else you
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:28.940]  read about that's not the answer you've got to know where you are and you've got to get some
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:33.980]  good experience knowledge from those that are mds and i'm working with an md now who is in the
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:39.900]  natural medicine arena so and don't don't write to me please and say what do i do i have cancer
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.540]  please don't do that because i don't know the answer to that yet i'm trying to find my own way
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:50.060]  and thank goodness for the people at the power mall and katharine my producer and and synthia
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:55.980]  and noelle and josh and all the people that have been keeping me afloat they've been making me look
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.860]  a lot better than i probably have been in the past but i feel great right now sitting here i would
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:08.060]  not know that i had cancer if i did not get up and walk around i would not do it so let me let me
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:12.620]  just say to people know where you are get good information and don't believe somebody just
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:16.380]  because they're on the internet sure let me throw this out there that's what i've always said and
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.300]  i'm not let people on my show that claim that they have a you know mineral or vitamin supplement
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:25.580]  that will cure cancer from the deep research i've done across the years on the medical doctors
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:31.500]  researchers nutritionist you name it try to eat healthy try to get the trace minerals try to stop
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.940]  the toxins that are in the food and water from building up so you don't get cancer you do the
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:43.980]  vitamins the nutrients the minerals the sunlight the exercise the oxygenation to be healthy and to
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.940]  get your telomeres more healthy so that you they don't start mutating and you get cancer but once
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:55.020]  you get cancer yes there are alternative treatments that that that in some cases help in germany and
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.900]  mexico but they're not cure-alls they're not a hundred percent and yeah i know a lot of people
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:04.700]  that have done the chemo and done the radiation and have then lived 20 30 40 more years but i
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:09.100]  know folks that have gone on chemo and died in a week you know i've had a dog that had cancer and
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:14.460]  was doing great did one chemo treatment couldn't breathe you know the dog died so it's one poison
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.420]  to kill the fast growing cells it's fighting fire with fire it's a very complex issue but i totally
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:26.060]  agree with you nothing is a panacea not any of the so-called miracle stuff that's out there
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:33.820]  not you know any of the fix all cure all silver bullet stuff nothing is a complete silver bullet
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:39.820]  uh and you know we're designed to also at one point fail we're designed to move on for the next
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:45.820]  group but we're artificially uh you know infant mortality is up cancer rates are up yeah they
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:51.100]  can keep you alive with the cancer longer now but why is the cancer up we know it's the chemtrails
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:58.300]  the gmo the fluoride i mean this is a fact joys vaccines vaccines vaccines please understand
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:03.260]  i think my cancer came from the military i did eat well i was doing the right things and then
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.140]  don't just try to have a good diet do have a good diet because you want to know if you get cancer
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:13.500]  that you did everything you could to keep from getting it and i think the vaccines play a huge
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:20.060]  part but be that as it may i want everybody to do the best they can to take care of themselves but
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:25.180]  just do it don't just have excuses as to why i have to stop at mcdonald's every once in a while
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:30.700]  or why i have to eat fast food once a day no just stop it because it's not good
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.860]  and it's going to create problems later but you know alex i want to address one thing before we
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:39.260]  move into anything here today and that is you know i don't want people saying oh gee joys has
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:45.340]  got cancer now so she's budding up to alex or oh gee alex knows joys has cancer so he's budding up
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:51.980]  to her i want people to understand that the reason that i'm on here especially today is because of
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:57.580]  the truth now you and i have disagreed on a lot of things in the past and we probably still do if
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.780]  we were to have a discussion about it but there are things that have to be dealt with in the light
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:08.060]  of what is accurate and true and i hear so many things about you and so many statements that i
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:13.980]  just want to say ladies and gentlemen i've known alex since 96 when i was first on his show down
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:21.420]  in texas and if there were all these things going on that alex is then i would probably be the first
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:27.340]  one to tell you because i don't like anybody that's a phony or anybody that's doing what they
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:33.340]  say they're not doing i want to know the truth and i know even to ted anderson's consternation
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.780]  there have been times when i've disagreed with you on the program you used to call me a uh a snake
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:44.700]  oil salesman at one time and referred to me like that and now you understand that the ways of god's
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.660]  medicine versus man's medicine are true and thank goodness you've come around and seen that also
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:55.500]  but i don't think i ever i mean i think what happens is listeners try to get people in fighting
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:02.940]  and they misrepresent who said what i never engage in that i'm never involved in any of it i'm i'm
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:07.100]  well known for that and so choice i think some of that might be the projections of other people
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.980]  i've i think one time i think you had one product with one guy that i didn't like
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:16.940]  and i told people that privately but that's a non-issue and like 14 years ago or something
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.620]  okay i absolutely believe in essential oils and all of because i felt the difference and you're
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.220]  right back when i was criticizing you for stuff i was pulling in not eating big max but pulling in
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:34.300]  and eating double meat cheeseburgers and got as fat as a pig so you know back when i was 25 years old
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.060]  i might have shot my mouth off but i don't even want to get into that today because our listeners
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.700]  tune in all over the country and they are they're they're concerned about russia threatening nuclear
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.900]  war they're concerned about the new black panther party saying shoot police but i i i think you've
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:53.660]  done just incredibly good work with the gulf war vets association and have really changed the world
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:18:00.620]  and had incredible tenacity and and and obviously you know the fact that you you could die it makes
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:05.820]  me think about how valuable you are to humanity and so that is part of the reason that spurred me
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:10.780]  because i'm so busy focused on what i'm doing to get another talk show host on the broadcast but
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.820]  shifting gears out of that we're going to skip this break because we have more time with joys
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.060]  so i've been cutting her off what do you think the biggest stories are right now front and center
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:24.540]  joys okay but just let me say that the reason i said all that is because people change and because
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:28.140]  people learn and that's what we're all about that's what you're all about and i'm all about
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.020]  is we learn and when we learn we change our positions exactly hands are whatever so that's
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:37.340]  that's the good thing and that's what i wanted to bring up let me first start talking about
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:47.020]  the attorney for the young man who is allegedly standing trial now as zharniev in zhokar zharniev
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.100]  yeah he said he was not guilty but then his lawyer says he says he's guilty boy the lawyers like that
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:57.500]  who needs prosecutors okay exactly but how many of us would want an attorney which is why i don't
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:04.220]  think that is really a zhokar in their in trial is because he was i'm innocent i'm innocent i'm
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:09.180]  innocent and she comes before them and says well we know that he's guilty we just don't
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.220]  know if he should be put to death or not and that was literally what his attorney judy kark said
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:21.260]  now here's the part that most people don't know judy kark who is a no-name attorney i mean a no-name
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:31.180]  attorney represented ted gazinski gazinski the unabomber unbelievable she also represented the
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:39.340]  alanta olympic bomber erik rudolf she also represented jared lofner in the gabby giffords
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:46.540]  trial um she or in the gabby gifford situation she also represented buford furrow from the
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:52.060]  arian nations uh he was an arian nations member at the los angeles jewish community center said
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:58.700]  he was bipolar got him off the death penalty and then in 2002 are you ready for this she represented
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:06.060]  zacharias missouri now most of these guys are in the federal adx supermax prison but can you believe
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:13.900]  that she was chosen to represent all these guys and in every case here each one of them got off
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:19.740]  the death penalty charge that were convicted for life and nobody can see any of these people
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:26.620]  they are all not allowed visitors so what tells something tells me she has been picked for this
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.100]  position you're probably going to see her on the supreme court before long but think about that
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:35.820]  she was picked by all those people a no-name attorney that you can hardly choice you are so
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:39.500]  on target and i should have been covering this more because i've been following and i've mentioned
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.700]  it and i'd forgotten that she was gazinski's lawyer for those that don't know the la times
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:52.860]  reported when it was declassified in 1998 that ted gazinski the unabomber was actually a long time
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:58.460]  10-year project member not just first he was experimented on the 60s then he was a member
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:05.100]  of mk ultra that's the cia mind control program has been partially declassified and his entire
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:11.580]  trial and everything was a uh staged event who knows what really happened he may be a cut out
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:18.620]  and it's the same thing now they killed the other brother lied about what he'd done then they tried
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.260]  to kill this brother in the boat so they could then claim he did it now they claim he wrote a confession
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:28.940]  inside the boat uh and now he comes out and says innocent innocent innocent he disappears uh you
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:33.740]  know he's probably sleeping with the fishes because they can't have that staged event we know it was
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:40.380]  staged they cannot have that staged event come out we know the elders aren't a brother was his
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:45.500]  cover was blown two years before the bombing by russian intelligence it was in the foreign news
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:49.420]  they said who's this guy under a fake name you have a fake passport to that you've got coming
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:55.980]  into russia and coming into other uh uh chetny in areas a meeting with al qaeda he's your guy
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:02.540]  id me so why is it that in the news that the older brother was under a cia traveling scholarship
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:08.220]  out of georgetown university joys right exactly so when we began to look at these things for
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:13.020]  what they are we realized something else is afloat so let's look at what happened in uh ferguson
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.820]  here one of the concerns that i have with ferguson is that on a local tv show and it may have been
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:23.020]  covered nationally you all here in missouri we should add that yeah i'm two hours away from ferguson
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:28.540]  uh the the uh agitators alleged agitators that are supposed to be the people that are the
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:34.380]  activists and they're trying to make them look bad um they were quoted as saying this is all
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:39.260]  smoke and mirrors this is all smoke and mirrors and i have and i have seen that on tape and at
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:46.620]  another time when um the the two police officers were allegedly hit by a guy allegedly in a car on
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:54.140]  the street shooting at another guy um it was said i heard one of the um people in the audience say
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:01.260]  don't put out a helmet with some look alike or some blood on it and make a and make everybody
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:08.620]  think we did it so the question is who really did that i don't know i don't know but this guy
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:17.820]  durst is getting more attention for a 30 year old murder on tv now than uh it then ferguson is getting
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:27.100]  because it's coming to a head that this has been created the the stops the uh shop owners that told
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:35.580]  me or told uh the the television news and i did uh uh copy this we called six times to get the police
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:42.540]  to come and never did they come we told them six times they were they were uh breaking into our
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:48.620]  places they were stealing our our goods out of our stores and they never came now you cannot tell
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:54.540]  me that was not set up by design so to me this is a civil war they're wanting to create this is an
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:24:00.780]  event they're wanting to expand upon in fact i was told and i don't know this to be true but i was
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:05.660]  told it by someone who said that one of the police officers said they were so disappointed
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:12.860]  that this thing quieted down after the uh police after the uh what was the police captain
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:18.060]  resigned from his position so i don't know but i do know there's more to all of these stories and
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:23.740]  that's why your listeners and my listeners are it's so important that if they're in the local area
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:28.940]  keep looking keep talking keep seeing what's going on here well sure joys i've tried to study it from
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:33.180]  every angle we've had a reporter's there for weeks during it and best i can tell there's some bad
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:40.300]  police behavior going on but the local police are just being manipulated the justice department is
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:46.140]  in there funding the radicals to try to get things to be violent they want a bigger blow-up as a
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:53.980]  political uh diversion and george soros has been involved basically financing it well and i think
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:59.420]  that's probably very true and i think this whole thing has been a creative event they're nurturing
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.860]  it right now i don't know what the next shoe is going to be that falls but uh there's still the
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.780]  jury's still out on who did the shooting and were these guys really shot were there two people that
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:15.180]  were shot i don't know they haven't released their names no pictures you would have thought they would
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:21.420]  have shown a a stretcher being taken into an ambulance but that didn't happen uh the drama
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.980]  they love the drama but it just seems like something's not right here so that i wanted to
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.980]  bring up the other thing i want to bring up regarding the gulf war illness and the gulf war
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:36.940]  is that this situation is only going to be worse now than it has been in the past we thought it
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:43.660]  was bad in 1991 when i served i did not deploy to the middle east i only served as a flight nurse
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:51.580]  um on the uh stateside and and uh other countries but not um in iraq um is that
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:58.060]  they are now pre medicating these military people prior to deployment and i think everybody
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:03.660]  needs to understand that between 30 and 50 of these troops are now being deployed with medications
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:10.380]  of ssri drugs they say that it is to make them calm since when do you want to make them calm to
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:16.540]  go into a war you don't you want them to be more quote unquote vigilant you want them to be more
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:22.300]  proactive you want them to be more aggressive which is what is happening and the very fact that the
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:30.700]  va now as i understand is the biggest consumer of drugs of ssri drugs in this country that should
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:37.020]  tell you something get ready for more problems and it's going to be made to look like see all these
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:42.140]  people are so erratic military people cannot be trusted well joys let me raise this point to you
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:51.660]  and i totally agree joe biggs was in uh an army combat group that saw major action because it
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:57.260]  they had media embedded rolling stone and esquire did stories just about his unit that he was a
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:05.260]  staff sergeant in that just saw weekly battles uh in um you know the first uh well some of the major
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:11.100]  combat in uh iraq and then afghanistan and joe said by the time they got to afghanistan
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:19.260]  they would have truckloads of of painkillers and ssri's and they would say we don't want to take
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.740]  this and they'd say you're under a lot of stress the army doctors order it take it and then they
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.820]  would order joe to order his men to take it and then they would get addicted he's off of it all
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.260]  now since he got back but he had to go through hell to get off of it he's talked about it on air
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.100]  and then he talked about sometimes they'd have russians and i looked it up and there were stories
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:41.020]  about russians doing supply russians would land with the opium pills basically uh and supply them
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:45.980]  they were taking so many and so they're trying to drug up the military to get them into the system
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:51.420]  for when they come out so absolutely joe we know this is going on it's not just speed pills they're
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:57.900]  giving the pilots why would you want to give army soldiers basically any psychotropic or any opiate
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:05.420]  drugs they wanted exactly because and they're doing it now in bags full of these drugs oh they
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:11.500]  should be given each person big bags of it yeah and so and i have seen these bags i have had people
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.900]  call me to their house and say look at the drugs that i'm on and i couldn't believe what they were on
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:23.260]  nor what they had um uh that they had been provided in the mail i actually talked to one who had been
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.020]  given morphine shots to take himself in the mail i mean this is just this defies all regulations
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:35.420]  on these classes well they say that the troops are the number one enemy and so they're trying to
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:40.860]  spike the already used weapon system and then basically get them into the system because once
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:45.660]  they're drugged up wave your rights turning your guns will keep giving you the drugs and get them
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.220]  out of you know use more drones less soldiers i mean why do you think they're cutting down and
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:54.460]  cutting back on all these soldiers all the time they don't want soldiers soldiers can respond
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:00.940]  soldiers can uh complain soldiers can say no i won't do that but drones don't the end of humanity
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:07.340]  the end of men in the military the end of women it's this is the takeover this is the thx 1138
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:13.260]  program joys absolutely it's transformation of the military all you have to do is go online and
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.060]  look at transformation of the military every about every 10 years and then every five years
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:23.900]  there was a new transformation program and that's where they're they're making and manipulating
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:28.620]  our veterans now and they're going to be uh horrific problems in the future i'm afraid

[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:07.580]  the rabbit hole joist what really runs the world well i you know at this point i need to talk about
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.380]  montel williams because that's oh yeah we said we talk about that coming on for and i i don't have
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:16.380]  much time left but we can hold you a little bit in the next hour i mean if you can do it i'm
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:22.300]  go ahead okay i i just want to make sure we cover let's do it let's do montel williams and then this
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.740]  because he attacked me recently and that's the reason and let's talk about it and i'm responding
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:32.700]  because what i think he said was totally wrong what montel said and i want people to know
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:36.620]  how i got involved with this you said earlier i was a good friend of montel williams i'm not a good
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:41.660]  friend i was just involved with him at one point you got to know him well reality show yeah i got
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:48.380]  to know him on a reality show here's the story i was a person that was contacted to be on a reality
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:55.500]  show in 2004 by showtime um i didn't know anything about the show but it was called american candidate
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:43:00.940]  and it was supposed to be about 10 people who wanted to change the world who didn't like the way
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:05.820]  our government was running and wanted to change the world in our government in our country so i
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:13.180]  did respond to it 27 pages of information you had to respond and when i was chosen out of they said
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:20.140]  20 000 applicants i was absolutely astounded that they wanted me on there i never did know why it
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:25.740]  didn't make any difference but they said it was because of my gulf war veteran involvement and
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:32.060]  because of my issues in health like i would take the the issue of vaccines so that is why i was
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:36.700]  on the program or chosen to be on the program everybody had sort of their shtick if you will
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:41.260]  if you look up america american candidate and wiki you'll see the 10 people that were on there one
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:49.020]  was you know pita one was um uh gay for gay rights and on and on and on they had their issue that
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:54.300]  they wanted to promote so mine was veterans issues and i thought because montel had been in the
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:59.980]  military and you can look at him on wiki and find out his experience but he did go to an academy and
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:06.860]  he was a i believe a captain when he departed from the military i was a captain in the air force he
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:13.340]  was in the navy and he did very well in the military he has very good record in the military
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:23.260]  but i wanted to expose through montel williams or this national tv show what was really taking
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:27.740]  place with the veterans because at the time in 2004 you weren't hearing much about this
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.380]  uh you were hearing what we could get out on genesis and that was about it and on coast to
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.620]  coast uh we were getting some of it out george norie was one of the only people that let you
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.020]  on he did a great job reaching tens of millions and of course art bell before that yeah and choc
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:47.100]  harder and there were a few that were really good but it came down to the point though that um
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:51.900]  that the mainstream medicine was not talking mainstream media was not talking about it even
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:55.580]  though they knew about it so i thought well here's the perfect place and they said you will have the
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:01.740]  chance that you can talk about this all you want so we're introduced to montel he was the head of
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:07.100]  the quote unquote program he was the master of ceremonies whatever you want to call it he was
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:14.300]  the circus leader well yeah it was kind of like on um on survival where you're booted off the island
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:19.340]  only on this case you were booted off the ballot and every week you would have to do something
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:25.820]  new and different to be in the program um to stay on a week longer and and uh attract the attention
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:32.060]  of the people so i was booted off i will tell you after the fifth week now cherif richard mac
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:35.980]  happened to be on the show too we did not know each other was going to be on there
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.300]  and cherif richard mac was booted off after the fourth week so they got the weirdos the people
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:44.140]  that were talking about constitution and stuff like that out of there let me guess the guy guy
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:49.580]  i won i don't remember no he didn't but the guy who looked just like george bush and talked just
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:57.020]  like george bush won is what happened so anyway um so i thought oh this is my chance so i brought
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:02.060]  with me volumes of documents like i always carry around whenever i go around to do a talk or a
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:09.180]  speech i carry my evidence with me i brought biological uh all the information the biological
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:13.340]  weapons that were sold to a rat just prior to the gulf war i brought biological chemical
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:19.260]  information we sold to them i brought everything with me vaccine information everything in these
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:25.980]  documents so that i could sit down with montel and say montel you have ms montel let's look at
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:31.900]  how many people come out of the military with ms and the fact that now the military has so many
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:39.100]  people getting ms from the vaccines i believe that they're now making it a 100 compensation
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.940]  for the military at least they did that time back in joys this is incredibly important can
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:47.580]  you stay with us 15 minutes the next hour to be able to finish all this sure all right good
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:52.460]  because i our reporters are being accosted by the police and given a ticket selectively enforced
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.460]  when you can use a bullhorn downtown we're going to spend a few minutes cutting to them
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:02.540]  live video skype as this happens so it's on record let's go to our mcdonald's uh coverage
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:07.500]  demonstration uh with the police i guess trying to frustrate the first amendment let's go ahead
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:11.340]  and go to that right now and we're gonna have folks now drive around and honk in front of it
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:17.660]  there if we can i guess the streets are blocked let's go to that feed guys here it is all right
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:24.060]  here is joe begs and the police are there looking like they're very sorry but it's like last year
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:27.900]  they wouldn't let us hand out magazines until i said go ahead and arrest me under orders of south
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:33.100]  by southwest on the street corner then the police back down but they're selectively enforcing the
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.180]  bullhorn ordinance because i've done it all over joe did it last night the police know they can't
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:41.660]  uphold that in the middle of that blaring and other people have bullhorns the petty cabs have them
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:47.500]  this is selective enforcement right now um they're hassling him about the decibel level and they
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.980]  don't even know what the decibel level is that even have a meter right next to us that's blowing
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:58.460]  us out of the water well what happened if you've gone into the place yet we get a good shout out
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:03.420]  these cops these are the cops here all right hey do have you i know but don't get caught up all
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:10.460]  day just talking to them all right listen you need to get back just try to go into the mcdonald's
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:15.020]  facility because mcdonald's knows that they send the cops and you'll just argue with them all day
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:19.740]  get the ticket i'll pay it or whatever we'll sue them over it i don't want to we'll sue to overturn
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:24.700]  it just just the main thing we need to do is are there people showing up at the mcdonald's facility
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:29.980]  to go in on their own or they just shut it down we'll talk to do during the break and get more
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:34.700]  and Edward Joyce leaves we'll continue to monitor the live feed Joyce uh very interesting that that's
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:40.140]  going on is they did you see Joyce where they're trying to now not have the inserts say what vaccines
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:45.020]  and drugs can do to you and it looks like congress may actually pass a law to now hide what's in the
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:52.140]  drugs and in the vaccines Joyce that was in the washington post yesterday is that not unprecedented
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:59.020]  Joyce looks like we've lost Joyce we're gonna try to get her reconnected and come back to her in
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:05.180]  just a moment here i'm here okay good what do you make of uh the move to block people and then we'll
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.300]  go back into the gulf war stuff and montel williams after the break but but so it's somewhat congruent
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:14.940]  for what i was just talking about did you see the article yesterday where they're trying to pass a law
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:20.060]  where you won't know what's in a vaccine or the side effects or or the drugs drug companies want that
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:26.780]  i know can you believe in this country we would be doing that and and exonerating any
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:31.660]  pharmaceutical company for any and everything they do there is no way you can sue a pharmaceutical
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:37.340]  company now incredible joys continue as we go to break about the montel williams situation
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:44.700]  okay so i approached montel and tell him montel the vaccines are a major issue i am vaccine injured
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:49.580]  from the gulf war he didn't want to talk about it he didn't want to even hear about it and i said if
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.780]  you want to do something you can really do something now by talking to the veterans bringing this issue
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:50:00.220]  out on a look on a national level like i cannot do and addressing it i have got all the evidence
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:05.180]  you need here to know that the veterans are suffering from a vaccines biological and chemicals
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:12.140]  the u.s government sold to iraq and he would not address anything that had anything to do
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:18.620]  with the government with the military and so i had i had the stack of documents there in front of
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:25.020]  him and i said look this is a life or death issue and you have a chance to do something about this
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:31.420]  now what the what can we do here how can we he didn't want to hear it he did not want to hear it
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:39.820]  so if it has to do anything with the government or the military he won't say anything now of course
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:45.340]  he's been jumping all over the va and been supposedly the veterans advocate for that which i think

[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:27.340]  williams it's not about this quasi has been guy it's about behind the curtain of how these people
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.580]  really operate so you're on this reality tv show with him for a while you got to know him pretty
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:37.500]  good please continue well i just uh got to know him whenever he was there and i do want to say
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.220]  one thing i've seen on your uh post some of them people saying that he is gay he is not gay because
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:47.100]  he had a girl in every port so there was it was well known that he was not gay so i just wanted to
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:53.660]  say that um in some of whose post our post i think yeah on one of the stories somebody was making a
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:57.340]  comment about you mean the commenters not us yeah i don't hear what a sexuality is i don't
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.820]  want to do with it yeah right right but i just wanted to say no he had a girl in every port so
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:07.900]  that was not the issue anyway um but the whole idea was if he was really for the veterans and
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.740]  really wanted to know like i told him i said look i'm vaccine injured i was a flight nurse in the
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.140]  air force now there was no other person in those 10 people in american candidate that
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:20.700]  had been in the military so you would think he might have listened to me i was a captain he was a
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:29.180]  captain um we were um both injured uh somehow from the military or at least i thought we might
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:33.820]  have been injured as a result of uh the vaccines but he didn't want to hear about it he did not
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:39.340]  want to hear that the government could do anything bad but if you look back now and alex would you
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:46.860]  were to look at what he might have done from 2004 until nine or until now if he had really looked
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:52.700]  at the issues of these veterans he might have been able to do a tremendous amount of work
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:58.780]  a tremendous amount of good saving lives saving those homicidal suicidal situations from even
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:04.220]  occurring if he had made a stand and he had a chance to do it and he had a chance to look at
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:09.980]  the evidence but he would not do it so i am saying to him if you want to debate me on this if you
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:14.620]  want to come on the power hour if you want to challenge me on what happened between you and me
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.980]  there at american candidate i will be glad to because i've still got the the stack of documents
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:26.060]  that i brought to show you that i wanted you to know well he's got to feel stupid joys because
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:30.540]  it's already you know you were one of the first to do this but years later it came out in life
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:36.140]  magazine you name it uh that the mutations in the babies were four or five times higher 15 times
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:41.980]  16 times higher in fallujah in the next war uh that the troops were hit with a cocktail of bad
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:49.820]  vaccines uh and then of course different chemicals and uh the du and all the rest of it so i mean
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:57.180]  you've been totally validated and so has dr. duck rocky and so many others yes but yes but
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.660]  the va's position still is that if you come in complaining of something oh i know yeah the go
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:07.100]  for illness you're crazy you're just crazy you have a mental problem it's still that way oh do
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:10.860]  you think four rides bad for you have a mental problem when harvard and the london guardian and
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:17.900]  the british government say it'll hurt you really bad they want you to believe the proper agenda

[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:51.660]  is just a full takeover to make us obsessed with fighting with each other and freaking out like
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:57.500]  mental patients while the mega banks rob the country joys i want to finish up in this segment
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:02.460]  on the whole montel williams vets thing and i want to get your take on russia in the next segment
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:09.100]  but putting bookends on this you know it's not just him it's all these other mainstream media people
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:14.380]  but the mainstream media is dying don't they understand that their establishment lapdog
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:21.260]  behavior is the reason people are deserting them and the new media is rising i don't know if they
[02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:27.900]  understand that or not but i know they know that their goal and their job is to tear down people
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:34.140]  like you and me i mean these are like assignments with them uh a guy named fomento uh mike fomento
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:38.780]  had the assignment to tear me down and he would come on the air and do radio shows and say
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:44.380]  comments like oh her bra straps must just be too tight i mean those were the kinds of comments
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:52.620]  that he would make based on the fact that uh it was his job to tear me down in any way shape or
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:57.260]  form they put out information that i'd never been in the military wasn't a nurse you know the kinds
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:01.660]  of things that are ridiculous to do that anybody's going to see through if they check it out but if
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:06.860]  they don't check it out then they're going to go away with the idea that oh gee she wasn't a nurse
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:12.860]  she's just a phony but yet everything nearly everything that i have said has turned out to
[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:18.700]  be accurate absolutely almost everything i mean without a doubt the information that i put out
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:24.540]  in 96 is accurate today so it doesn't make any difference i mean i i don't let those people
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:28.220]  bother me but because they do it all the time and they will attack us and they will try to make
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:34.060]  us look bad but when they came to the things that they said about you i thought no i cannot
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:39.340]  let this stand that is wrong i mean i may disagree with you on some things but there are some things
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:44.780]  that we have to come together on and we have to support each other for and that is that you're
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:50.140]  not the things that he says you are not creating the events that they say you're creating and in
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:56.220]  fact it is other people that are at fault for not taking action and coming to the aid of the
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:02.620]  american people on these things such as the veterans or such as whatever happens on a second
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:08.140]  amendment they're not coming to the aid of us and therefore when people like you and me do and
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:15.020]  everybody else on genesis then we're the bad guys we are quote unquote with you know air quotes
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:20.780]  bad guys so i mean i don't have anything to lose now and i would say to montel williams everything
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:26.540]  i'm saying i would say to his face right now how dare you how dare you go after somebody like alex
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:31.980]  who is telling the truth about depleted uranium and about the veterans issues when you wouldn't
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:38.940]  even stand up and you wouldn't do it yourself and now you want to find some other crazy issues
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:46.140]  that you're attacking him for i mean i do have to credit um i think jacari jackson did a great job
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:51.660]  and doing a piece for you i really liked looking at that one and and uh if they don't want to deal
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:58.540]  with the real issues then it's going to become very apparent that attacking alex or me is just
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:04.540]  something that they are paid to do they i've got to be paid to do because he has more things to do
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:09.260]  with his time than attack you and me you know he was with payday loans you know the money
[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:14.620]  what was it money mutual payday loans i would have never been involved with anything like that
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:20.460]  because there's nothing seedier than payday loans and all that stuff i mean who's out there doing it
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:26.220]  it's the veterans it's the poor vets who can't get their um their their disability compensation
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:32.380]  for nine to nine months to two years after leaving the military that's right they can't
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:36.940]  they can't and they're going there and i would not be a part of that all right let's talk about
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:40.700]  geopolitics and what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole joce i asked that question earlier we got into
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:46.700]  montel the russian situation geopolitics and where you think it all ends and where humanity's going

[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:43.820]  finally here in the minutes we have left with you what is your take on russia saying we were
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:48.780]  repairing tactical nuclear weapons in ukraine what is your take on isis the middle east the whole
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:54.620]  world financial collapse i mean those big issues where do you think the world's going joce riley
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:59.820]  well i think it's going uh to a financial collapse without a doubt and i think there's
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:05.820]  there that most of the people that we trust in the uh financial industry agree with that
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:10.780]  there's something really wrong even fox businesses now starting to talk about uh is it going to go
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:17.420]  down now are we going to lose this you know 2008 what happened and uh 1927 they're starting to kind
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:22.140]  of look at the other side and i think that's without a doubt what is going to happen now isis we know
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.100]  that's a created uh group of people it doesn't look like a war whenever they show it on cnn it
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:33.260]  looks like a phony cartoon war that's taking place uh the united states we know is supporting and
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:39.580]  aiding and abetting isis and making them what they are so all of this stuff is a theater for the
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:45.420]  mind all of this stuff is drama all of this is wag the dog scenario it's being created for the
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:51.100]  consumption of the people so the more we talk about it and the more we express what we see
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:55.500]  is happening the more power we're going to have let me talk in terms of what i think the answer
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:59.820]  is right now because i only think there's one answer and i that we have and if you have a
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:05.260]  better answer please tell me alex because i want to know uh in the time that i might have left in
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:11.740]  my world or your world or anybody else's what can we actually do and i really believe that the work
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:16.940]  that the csp away has done the constitutional sheriff's group has done has been more effective
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:21.820]  than anything else in garnering a number of sheriffs who have all come together under the
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:29.020]  direction of of uh sheriff richard mac and have made a huge difference one sheriff at a time right
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:34.540]  now that might sound like oh that's going to take too long well talking to every person in
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:38.380]  this country and getting them to understand the truth is going to take a long time that's what's
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:43.660]  going to take a long time let's get the sheriffs on board and i want to say to everybody out there
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:49.020]  if you have a better answer alex included tell me what it is otherwise i am financially supporting
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:56.300]  the csp away and check out the website at cspoa.org because look at this alex we've got the best
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:00.460]  sheriff we could possibly have he looks good smells good walks good talks good this guy is
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:07.180]  the real deal he's never disappointed us he and sam bushman that he works with have been phenomenal
[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:12.300]  in what they have done they are out there educating one sheriff at a time and supporting these sheriffs
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:17.020]  when they get in trouble with the federal government and backing them and they're finding out it's
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:23.580]  the real deal and it's counties and it's and it states real real people realizing their power
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:28.060]  the people not being enemies of their elected sheriffs getting good people elected and standing
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:33.260]  against this globalist takeover it is so exciting and of course we've sold his book and had him on
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:38.380]  many times promote that and i think you're right local government getting involved
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:43.180]  shaying no to the globalist that is the answer but also getting our hearts right with god
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:50.860]  well yeah and i and he definitely talks in terms of that but we but i think that literally in the
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:56.380]  person of sheriff mac not to put it into any one person but that organization where they are above
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:13:00.780]  reproach they have another sheriff working another law enforcement person working with him who is
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:06.700]  i just dearly love and they are really the real deal okay we've got the hard part he's put together
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:12.220]  that organization csp away he goes around the country talking about it supporting these sheriffs
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:17.900]  bringing them into the fold now they need money to do this and to me this is the best organization
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:22.620]  to support that i know of in this country at all right now absolutely look at other sheriffs
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:27.420]  that are speaking up like the sheriff in milwaukee for the second amendment and things that's the
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:34.860]  power of having good elected uh peace officers and as that becomes popular and in fashion and
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:41.100]  sexy again we can then influence the culture that right now the adl and southern primary law center
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:46.700]  have been running the nastiest meanest anti-american groups brainwashing and giving law enforcement
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:53.580]  awards i mean give me a break that's basically george soros folks uh they want to play us off
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:58.460]  against each other uh well joce riley thank you so much for coming on with us look forward to having
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:03.500]  you on against sooner i'm glad you're feeling better and we really appreciate you let me just
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:08.860]  add one thing with sheriff clark that's on tv right now he's a csp away member that just shows
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:13.820]  you it works so supports you i thank you so much alex i appreciate the time you bet absolutely
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:18.700]  thank you joice yeah there you go absolutely sheriff clark up there in milwaukee taking action
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:25.180]  that is so exciting and she's right it's it's reaching out to people in government corporations
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:31.980]  you name it and saying hey do you want to be good and not have gmo in your beer or in your butter
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:37.740]  and they go you know what you're right we'll do that you've spoken we'll do it the butter might go
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:44.780]  up a cent in price or hey you don't want me to trample your rights and you're worried about where
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:50.460]  the country is going you know what support me and i can do that there's a thousand different
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:55.180]  examples of this where we're really taking action and these constitutional law enforcement
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:15:01.260]  organizations are excellent sheriff max excellent we should get him back on soon but also voting with
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:07.740]  our dollars not eating gmo not supporting the vaccine makers exposing them will break their backs
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:13.820]  and that's what we're doing right now and getting constitutional is to elected the state government
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:18.540]  so that we can shoot down these unconstitutional laws i don't like chris christy
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:23.580]  and i don't like some of these other big republican neo contest but i liked him a lot more when he
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.100]  came out and said yeah you shouldn't have taken a vaccine notice ran paul got criticized for just
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:31.740]  saying hey some of these are dangerous you need to really read the inserts oh you'd have thought he
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:37.260]  murdered somebody when he just said you might want to read the inserts you might want to look at
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:43.100]  what's in him you might want to look at the side effects and they said he's anti science he said no
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:48.380]  i understand you can get inoculated and and and not get disease but he said sometimes you know has
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:55.980]  worse side effects than the cure well it's worse than that so for being moderately reality based
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:16:01.420]  ran paul got attacked because the globalists are in a bad position their their positions are
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:06.940]  undefendable that's why they say don't like fluoride you're to cook we're like here's 25 harvard
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:11.660]  studies here's the bbc here's a pierce waters i mean it's actually in the news
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:19.580]  where it eight-fold bone cancer increase in men uh three-fold increase in women uh
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:23.340]  degeneration of the liver degeneration of the pancreas degeneration of the kidneys
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:29.580]  lower in iqs uh destroying the thyroid i mean i just keep hammering fluoride because
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:35.420]  it's the elephant in the room where it's admitted it's not even the good calcium fluoride that you
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:40.860]  need a little bit of you need that or you die it's hydrofluorosilic acid we call it fluoride
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:47.900]  it is souped up amped up chemical type of fluoride that is deadly you one drop of it
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:53.340]  gets on the concrete at the water center it eats through like you know the the blood from the alien
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:17:03.980]  in aliens it's so deadly and speak of the devil we sell things that we have researched and we
[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:10.140]  believe in that are something you really need it's a win win win i would not morally sell something
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:14.460]  that you hear me my voice endorse they'll hear stuff on radio stations or the network that i might
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:19.020]  endorse or might not i just can't vouch for it all that you hear me endorse something i've researched
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:26.540]  that i put my name on it i believe in it and i go for the best quality i can get period that's my
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:31.580]  commitment to you when i started researching i had about four or five years ago i started taking
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:37.980]  the crappy type i did feel better i talked to group and he said listen i've been developing
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:43.340]  deep earth sources of this right now we've got the cleanest seaweed based in a palm oil
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:49.180]  that's organic but we're going to be developing if you want to be involved in it he had to jump
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.620]  through all these dea hoops and stuff to get pure 9999 i mean it you speak about eating through
[02:17:54.620 --> 02:18:00.620]  the floor it's another halogen it's a blue gas purple gas our stuff on paper turns purple blue
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:08.060]  electric blue the fakes not fake it's just bound uh so-called iodine turns red our nason iodine x2
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:15.420]  is red in the bottle blue on paper and it is from the pure deep earth crystals nobody else that we
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:20.700]  know of has this we've had major competitors try to stop us from doing this we ended up finding a
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.100]  better source it's it's it's incredible the lord works i made a wrong turn yesterday ended up seeing
[02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:29.420]  the black new black panther party rally it's now a national story i was kind of mad making the wrong
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:33.740]  turn to traffic and oh then i caught that never know how the lord works from mysterious ways but
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:39.420]  the point is we have just amazing and and what it's done for me going in and grabbing the bad
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:44.460]  halogens pulling them out my energy everything has just been amazing now it varies person to person
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:49.340]  consult your physician first you may detox after a few weeks when you're on it it's the real deal
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:55.820]  and it's not a silver bullet but it's the closest thing to it just like our colloidal silver isn't
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:19:01.180]  a silver bullet but it's called silver bullet it's simply very low price super high quality 30
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:04.940]  parts per million made by the biggest lab in the united states that makes some of the biggest brands
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:09.500]  out there and ours is just $10 less on average than what the leading competitor sells the exact same
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:15.580]  bottle for i'll just tell you right now so we sell the main brand that whole food sells for less
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:21.980]  so depending on sometimes $15 less sometimes $5 less you'll vary the prices on two ounce bottle

[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:17.100]  for handing out magazines on city streets and the zoning department said so so we said go ahead
[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:21.260]  and do it we're going to sue you and because the law didn't say that and now the police are back
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:25.420]  saying that south by people have ordered them to do that. Anthony's there talking to the police

[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:35.420]  on the sidewalk in america pure bull everybody needs to go down there now i'm going to organize a
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:51.740]  big demonstration okay and then if you do it again then it obviously goes further than that
[02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:55.340]  but right now i'm not even giving you any i'm just asking you politely now we all of us can
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:59.500]  get along out here you can do what you need to do but we're those south by officials asking you to
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:05.980]  arrest us no no we don't have any interest in arresting anybody okay this we appreciate you
[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:09.980]  guys working with us we just heard from a few people that were listening to the interaction
[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:14.860]  that those south by individuals were asking you to arrest us everybody's just trying to get along
[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:21.660]  okay but they absolutely were they were trying to say that we were trespassing and that we should
[02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:25.740]  be arrested immediately but as long as you don't create any violations a lot which would be going
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:30.540]  inside there after after being warned or blocking the interchange or using the board you could say
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:33.740]  whatever you want to say if y'all want to stand there and talk to people all day please do okay
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:39.100]  we're not we're not gonna everybody else is a lot of mohawk last year they said we could be on the
[02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:46.380]  sidewalk so now they backed off i'm gonna let y'all fight the battle that you choose to fight okay
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:52.300]  but please be respectful everybody and do what we need to do okay well alex uh just let you know
[02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:57.660]  we can't see your audio for whatever reason but at the moment what just happened is there was some
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:03.420]  girls these trendy girls over there they were calling a bunch of people and telling the cops
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:06.940]  that you need to arrest these people immediately we're with south by but this is according to what
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:10.780]  i heard from five people that came up and told me including this individual here let's talk to him
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:14.620]  but they said to arrest them immediately so we do have info warriors down there go ahead
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.540]  i'm trying to get the audience breaking up i hope you can hear me you were saying those south
[02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:25.180]  by officials were saying to arrest us correct well i overheard them talking about trespassing
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:29.740]  possibly trespassing and that's all that's all it was here just funny because we're sitting here on
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:35.900]  a public sidewalk yeah it's really it's really travesty that they were actually trying to stop
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:41.420]  them to use amplification which is this fundamental constitutional right so absolutely and then
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:46.780]  and they were all sitting over there huddled around that jeep thing and basically calling over
[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:49.660]  and over and over again and everyone kept saying well you're gonna get arrested you better leave
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:58.300]  now well we need to get those info warriors uh anthony and i think i see your girlfriend over
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:04.780]  there anthony we should send her in with a camera a small iphone just to ask a question oh who is this

[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:52.860]  did try to enter the event but now what they're doing is they're ultra screening it because they
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:58.540]  think everyone is with us because they actually are with us they actually are on our side and
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:02.940]  there were numerous people with their phones and their cameras some of the zombies coming out and
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:08.940]  asking them what they ate in fact i paid someone 20 to get me a big mac but they would not let them
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:14.220]  in even though they had to pass and all i want is a big mac and of course it was open to the public

[02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:29.260]  you know i have rethought my view on beards
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:36.700]  and i'm gonna talk about that after our guest leave us and i'm not being sarcastic remind me
[02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:41.900]  i'm not against beards my dad's had a beard a lot of my life my uncle almost always has a beard
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:47.660]  at least a mustache it's a very male thing to do it's natural it's normal it's that every
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:53.740]  trendy has them now basically everyone has them and it's weird to have anti-gun people with beards
[02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:58.940]  so i guess liberals have been so emasculated and they drink so many estrogens and look so
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:03.420]  much like a woman they've had their country taken their freedom taken their wave those taken so they
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:09.100]  grow a beard to feel like they're a man at least that's in the right direction i don't have a beer
[02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:15.020]  because it's scratchy and i don't like it uh but uh when i make a joke about beards or something
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:20.460]  it's not insulting 80 percent of men that have beards nowadays it's just it's fads themselves but
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:24.940]  maybe that's a good fad because i was thinking this morning i always try to wear green on st
[02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:30.700]  patty's day because i guess i'm i've got some irish on my dad's side of the family most people in
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:39.260]  texas are part irish and uh i like irish culture and that's an old fad that came out of culture of
[02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:43.100]  people that were seen as second-class citizens saying hey i'm gonna wear green on this day
[02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:49.820]  i'm proud to be irish so i'm all for fads if they come from the people in the grass roots
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:56.620]  the fad is the second amendment is getting very popular it's not going away i don't like globalist
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:02.700]  fake culture and south by southwest it's all about manufacturing that i'm not just picking on
[02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:07.900]  mcdonald's here folks i'm not against the chicken fried steak or big cheeseburger if it's healthy
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:13.660]  bread and healthy beef and cheese it's the gmo we're not the bloomberg crowd that wants to
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:19.260]  tax salt they ignore all the gmo and then go out for something you know unreasonable just like
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:22.300]  there's real environmental problems when they go out for carbon dioxide that plants need
[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:27.820]  so this is how the globalist control things mcdonald's gives money you can look it up to
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:34.460]  open borders anti-gine globalism fake feminist garbage they are horrible and their food is
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:42.460]  amongst some of the worst and so that's and bill gates is involved and so that's why we're hammering
[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:48.220]  this globalist organization pepsi you know uses fetal tissue for their flavor enhancers
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:53.740]  i mean i have to stand up against that if you got stuck in pepsi sorry

[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:21.740]  joe bigs is talking to children and others warning about gmo's he's uh has the alter ego now uh of
[02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:27.740]  donald mcronald the brother uh and of course both of them are the sons of john wane gacy
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:32.540]  both ronald mcdonald who follows after his father and donald mcronald who's fighting john wane
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:37.500]  gacy and i mean that is satire mcdonald's you know that who knows uh let's just put john wane gacy
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:41.500]  on screen though to remember that well there is a likeness to ronald mcdonald he probably is his
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:46.460]  father maybe maybe obama's father's really john wane gacy uh the famous serial killer with all
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:50.620]  the dead kids in his basement no i'm being sarcastic but obama does a lot of dead kids under his belt
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:57.500]  funding isis in the al-qaeda incarnation we're going to talk to joe biggs as uh donald mcronald uh out
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:01.100]  there and then we're going to talk to uh anthony gucciardi jacari can't talk to us he's on camera
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:05.340]  doing a great job i know that's exhausting and then we're going to talk to rex jones my son
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:11.340]  so let's go to joe biggs excuse me donald mcronald donald mcronald what are you doing donald give us
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:15.900]  your take on what's going on here well so far the cops have come out here in record number
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:21.020]  and they're trying to tell me that i can't be out here using the bullhorn telling people about gmo's
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:26.620]  it's pretty crazy all we're doing is educating the popular uh the population out here about the bad
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:31.100]  additives and fillers that are in mcdonald's food and they come out here and harass us and they said
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:36.620]  if we step foot on mcdonald's property again i'm gonna go to jail you wouldn't do very well in jail
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:41.740]  would you no they wouldn't like me in there because i'll be spreading truth and knowledge
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:48.220]  all right here we go rex rex is it rex wants to give his take as well i'm donald
[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:54.300]  ronald why are you protesting against mcdonald's landfill well because they have silicone breast
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:58.220]  and plant fillers inside the chicken nuggets they've got silly potty you've heard of that right
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:04.300]  what's that what do you know about it i like to play with my food but when you get older you
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:08.140]  shouldn't be playing with stuff anymore you should be eating good and healthy food i don't want i don't
[02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:13.500]  want to be a mutant like those people on the wall over there is that what happened to you ronald
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:18.140]  well yeah i'm a bit of a mutant you don't want to keep evolving into a a mutated form like three
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:25.740]  eyes and like extra arms i mean like how how did you eat that food like rex you were saying earlier
[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:29.420]  he was standing over there and he was saying hey look even i know i don't want to eat this garbage
[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:36.140]  talk to us about that well obviously it belongs in a trash can because any ice cream or burger
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:42.460]  with three eyes and a mouth is not natural no it's pretty simple we give these people these uh
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:47.580]  these informational pamphlets here which actually just say everything that's in the food in a very
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:52.460]  limited amount which is admitted on mcdonalds.com that they do use in fact the yoga mat chemicals
[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:57.180]  they do use high fructose corn syrup which contains mercury they do use you know msg derivatives
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.020]  and aspartame derivatives we'll be giving that to everyone and mostly they've just been like yes
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:04.860]  that's we actually know about this we shouldn't eat this wow we're we're pretty terrible people
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:10.380]  i mean it's like really disgusting i just just have one more thing to say i'm not loving it at all
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:21.100]  i'm hating it i'm not loving it folks person donald mcdonald i'm the ethical twin brother hey
[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:25.660]  don't eat mcdonalds it's got poison inside you know some guy also came up earlier in fact i think
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:31.020]  he's over there right now and he was saying it was actually i hope we could use it in the video he
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:36.300]  was saying well you know i know mcdonalds is bad but when i see kobe kobe brian make a dunk shot
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:40.460]  and then eat a burger it makes me think it's acceptable and it's cool he literally said that
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:46.300]  that person's on milk more on of the undermine control yes exactly but the sad thing is he
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:49.420]  represents a lot of people did you hear when when we were talking about that rex earlier
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:54.620]  anthony anthony hold on to every dr rex i want to get you guys to give us a tour on the outside of
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:59.020]  house like a concentration camp with bar bar and and and then these blob creatures under the new
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:04.300]  mascots that you can look like them or at least your liver can if you eat enough gmo or enough
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:10.060]  silly putty additive here we go so so they're basically telling you that space aliens eat this
[02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:15.660]  go ahead this is the left of the entrance that truck right there is where the food is lovingly
[02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:21.820]  made as in microwaved there is barbed wire all around the compound till the very end there is a
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:25.580]  truck right there with all of the food that they'll ever need for the next six years because of the
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:32.140]  preservatives and here is the fence and behind here you can see where they lovingly create this
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:37.820]  food where they are loving it uh some individuals smoking cigarettes over here inside is the
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:43.980]  unattainable compound of the mcnugget factory but i wanted to show you the entrance as well
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:49.900]  where we tried to enter and we were able to enter yesterday we're thrown out those creatures on the
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:53.900]  side of the wall look like feluja babies and i'm not being mean when i say that they actually look
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:42:00.140]  like du babies they are fukushima children but these are not the worst i want to show you the true
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:05.100]  art before you walk in here's the entrance here we're getting to and i'll try to dictate it verbally
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:09.180]  as well we're walking into the entrance surrounded by barbed wire where they will not let you in but
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:15.900]  then there are these these creatures representative of mcdonald's there is a skull at the bottom as
[02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:21.340]  well as some weird ronald mcdonald stepchild or something that looks diseased and riddled with
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:28.780]  acne on its forehead and has a well it's skulls it's skulls there's actually skulls at the bottom
[02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:34.300]  yes in front of the mcdonald's keep it on that because we're going to google du babies iraq and
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:38.940]  show folks how this is in our face because if you look at the blimped out babies it's hellish
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:43.660]  and i almost cry when i see it that is actually what it does in fact that could be a mcdonald's
[02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:49.660]  mind oh my god look at that poor baby right there the one looks like a a sleet stack i mean praise
[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:53.340]  god that we're getting worried on this but pray for these poor little babies in fact get it off
[02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:58.300]  screen i can't even look at it my god go up because it looks like du babies i'm not kidding the one on
[02:42:58.300 --> 02:43:02.380]  the side right there looks like a du baby i don't mean to be gross folks that's what's going on here
[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:07.420]  the other side's a du baby you should go around i mean you understand the conspiracy folks they
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:12.140]  psychically have a rule this is not the average mcdonald's employees with the higher ups they must
[02:43:12.140 --> 02:43:19.100]  tell you what they're going to do to you beforehand look that one has an ipad john that one has scars
[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:23.820]  is like frankenstein and notice how it's almost subliminal it's not real obvious it's all hidden
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:29.020]  in plain view i can't enter or they'll kill me but there is one with the ipad up there as well
[02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:37.020]  god help us this is all around the building i mean let's be clear this is all around the bar
[02:43:37.020 --> 02:43:41.820]  wire building here all of these there's like hundreds of and notice this is like the mass
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:46.540]  hallucination of the globalist where everyone's getting ugly and fat and getting cancer and zits
[02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:52.700]  all over us and just disease and just there and then it's just like they're just showing you what
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:57.420]  they're doing to you going it's ugly it's sexy hurt yourself because they know subconsciously
[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:02.860]  you know the truth by the way i've had dinner i've had dinner with top pr psychologists and
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:07.820]  psychiatrists that work for major one of them work for one of the biggest cereal companies i was up
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:12.700]  in minnesota once which had anderson and we had dinner with a radio station owner who worked for
[02:44:12.700 --> 02:44:17.980]  these people and when they called him in and told him what they wanted him to do you know it was
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:22.220]  in confidence i shouldn't even go for this far because it'll that was like 12 years ago he may
[02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:27.820]  not be alive now he was really old but i looked it up he was talking about smurf cereal and then
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:32.620]  the smurf show that and he wanted what they were trying to do to the kids with it and i'm not allowed
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:40.620]  to say because it was in confidence i'm just the weapons they use i mean this is a quiet zone i'm
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:46.380]  living in man they got skulls and mutated babies all around the mcdonalds and it's officially their
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:53.340]  stuff i mean anthony can we handle this because i ain't loving it no i mean you think about the
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:57.100]  reality these people are shoving themselves full of the food chemical sure but then look there's
[02:44:57.100 --> 02:45:03.740]  skulls all around next to these deformed babies i mean it's just such a warped sense of existence
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:08.140]  and look at all these people inside the line they said is 30 minutes to an hour long sometimes
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:13.900]  all to get their big macs and they're sitting in there it's like super hot out here in human
[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:18.540]  disgusting and kind of raining they're just sitting in line waiting to get their big macs and there's
[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:22.940]  just skulls i want to go talk to these young women here do they think mcdonalds is trendy
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:26.940]  or do they understand how serious this is let's go talk to them and then maybe somebody could
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:30.700]  take it over camera for jacarys we can talk to him later i want to talk more to rex i'm also
[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:34.300]  running this camera as well okay but let's tell you yeah let's go talk to those young ladies that
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:38.700]  i just saw on camera or is that another shot they didn't want to get on camera hey what do you
[02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:44.060]  guys think of mcdonalds mcdonalds is good i like their french fries i don't like their hamburgers
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:49.420]  though well do you know what's in the food you're eating uh no and i kind of don't want to know
[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:53.100]  well what if i told you there was chemicals that could actually cause birth defects make
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:57.580]  you sick give you cancer then i wouldn't eat it anymore really you wouldn't eat anymore
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:46:00.860]  no here can you come over here we have a pamphlet showing what's in the actual food
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:06.700]  yes sure let's see here come on over here let's see if this young woman is actually phased by
[02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:11.660]  what's in this i know uh donald is over here being a serious celebrity but we need some
[02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:16.620]  pamphlets for this young lady there's a pamphlet donald this young lady does not believe that
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:21.180]  there is uh stuff in the food and she would love she would love to know because she says
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:26.780]  she will not eat it if she realizes there are carcinogenic camp here we go here we go let's
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:34.700]  check let's go to the list again this is all from mcdonalds.com uh it's a chemical compound
[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:37.900]  found in yoga mats and why do we keep saying yoga mats over and over again it's not just for
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:44.220]  shock value this is actually a plastic based chemical that is of course used in their bread
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:49.820]  and then also the gmo's you know what gmo's are um okay if you don't genetically modified
[02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:54.620]  yeah there we go and it's not just something that selective breeding as they would like you
[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:59.100]  to believe they use a massive multi-billion-dollar machine to splice genes and admit they have no
[02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:02.940]  idea what it's doing over the next 10 to 100 years we'll actually know if we're going to be
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:07.100]  completely sterile and ruin our lives we know that it kills kidney cells and liver cells and
[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:12.540]  damages your gut floor and destroys your intestines and this is what mcdonalds is selling you and then
[02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:16.380]  the chicken magnuggets contain an anti-foaming agent used in silly putty and then don't forget
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:20.380]  propylene glycol which isn't even on here because they don't admit that on their site that we found
[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:25.180]  but it is an anti-freeze based chemical that's in electronic cigarettes and is closely related to
[02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:30.620]  butane that's great does that appetize you no not at all does that make you feel a little bit
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:34.700]  different about going in there and getting that big mac uh yeah but i'm not going to get a big
[02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:39.180]  mac i just want fries do they have nasty stuff in fries they have nasty stuff and everything
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:43.820]  all right thank you you got it and we're just talking to people because isn't it interesting
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.060]  though that ask her who else gives you free stuff and give her the answer drug dealers
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:54.700]  yeah who else gives you free things to get you hooked and addicted um i mean a lot of drug
[02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:59.660]  dealers and you know why they do that why your lifetime client because sugar on average by the
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:04.540]  way is more addictive than cocaine pull those studies up too it is more addictive than cocaine
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:08.540]  they load everything with sugar but then there's msg which is basically an excitotoxin which makes
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:13.820]  your brain essentially think that it's having anthony ask ask ask cupcake she looks like a
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:21.180]  a sweet nice person keep going ask her where she's from where are you from i'm from california

[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:37.820]  mcdonald over there you mean ronald mcdonald nope this is donald mcdonald's uh his more
[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:42.380]  conscious brother he's not a fan but they're both sons of ted bunny okay i mean he's related
[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:46.540]  said bunny and john wangasey oh yeah it's john wangasey sorry he's the clown yeah put him on

[02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:57.820]  wangasey uh donald mcdonald's father on screen please oh there's silicone breast implant fillers
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:04.460]  and the chicken nuggets so you're eating a boo job yay it is actually true silicon silicon's
[02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:11.740]  good here not here okay that's bad not to mention that uh mcdonald's could actually
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:16.300]  say it's vegan basically because it contains zero real meat hey that's not real beef they actually
[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:22.220]  own a company called 100 beef so they can actually put in whatever they want it's very true all
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:27.180]  admitted on mcdonald's dot com the best source for debunking why mcdonald's is supposed to be
[02:49:27.180 --> 02:49:32.940]  healthy company they own and with that company they can put fillers in it and fillers are all
[02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:39.820]  kinds of evil bad things like gmo's and silicone breast implant fillers and and silly potting and
[02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:44.780]  yoga mat but it's good for you donald i know i'm i'm pretty doesn't matter it tastes good that's
[02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:51.020]  what matters race it's because i don't like gmo's well it's just like if you were to be on heroin
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:55.660]  mcdonald sucks and you told someone how those girls are bummed out because they don't want
[02:49:55.660 --> 02:50:00.620]  now those girls are bummed out because they wanted a free lunch hey go talk to that go talk to that
[02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:04.220]  lady go back to the other camera shot she looks like she wants to talk there's a blonde right there
[02:50:04.220 --> 02:50:10.060]  looking at you where does it go back she turned around she was laughing and pointing at you there
[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:15.660]  she is right there go talk to her with the past she was she thanks yeah pretty enthused her over
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:22.780]  here um it's just interesting because i never eat mcdonald's at all i did a couple of hours ago
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:27.340]  after an event last night it's up by southwest and then did you regret that i regret it so i'm
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:33.180]  looking at him going uh regret eating it but it tasted so good and once a year is not bad so you
[02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:38.380]  admit it's like basically a drug what tasted good the mcdonald she said it's absolutely terrible
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:44.700]  we're live by the way dead possums taste good it's not a drug you don't think so i don't think so
[02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:51.100]  but you admit it's kind of addicting um where are you from by the way i'm from south africa but i
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:55.660]  live in calgary ask her about all the weird skull babies over there yeah come over here for a second
[02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:58.860]  i want to show you something but i talked to someone from south africa come over here we're
[02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:02.860]  gonna look at these weird skulls surrounding this area of the barbed wire compound i talked to someone
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:07.580]  from south africa yesterday he said everyone there pretty much knows that mcdonald's is garbage
[02:51:07.580 --> 02:51:14.060]  and that they will not eat it do you find that to be true um i really don't know he said basically
[02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:18.220]  everyone knows is giving cancer come over here look look at these skulls these weird deformed
[02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:21.900]  babies with one eye and these skulls on the ground what do you think about that does that
[02:51:21.900 --> 02:51:26.220]  appetize you no it's kind of weird i'm just trying to make sense of it all why do you think they're
[02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:32.700]  there i really don't know is what do you think they all have um vision issues they all patches
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:36.220]  on their eyes and they all have huge bellies and guts and mouths pouring out of their stomach
[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:43.820]  what do you think that's about um they're like revolting against doesn't it kind of look like
[02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:48.700]  a nuclear accident these deformed babies and the vampires have to tell you this way hades it's
[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:53.980]  a spiritual law folks we're dealing with satanist go ahead it's it's like a no trespassing sign
[02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:59.500]  it's it's basically saying look this is a skull at the bottom of a restaurant it's like a skull
[02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:04.060]  on a bottle of poison a rat poison they're telling you yeah it's like the x is on alcohol
[02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:10.140]  mcdonald's put skulls on entrance i mean you know they're letting you know i mean could it be anymore
[02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:14.620]  i mean she's laughing about it she's saying absolutely right could it be any more obvious
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:20.540]  there is skulls on the entrance of this building which is also and it rings it it rings it the

[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:05.180]  want to talk about we can say goodbye thank you for looking at dead children with me on mcdonald's
[02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:09.660]  doesn't that make you feel good about eating it i really appreciate that you know what i think i
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:13.740]  actually want to thank mcdonald's for letting me know what happens well they have to god doesn't
[02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:17.740]  let them to do otherwise they have to follow the rules they get they get big time problems
[02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:22.140]  see we figured out the whole enemy code folks
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:29.740]  we got the enemy code folks i mean the people gonna listen to us we've got the enemy code
[02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:34.700]  all week i've been talking about and last week about the enemy code everywhere
[02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:39.820]  let's see what rex thinks about all this or anybody else that wants to talk to us
[02:53:39.820 --> 02:53:43.740]  let's talk to jacari he's right near me is that all right let's do that jacari
[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:48.300]  you tell him to eat a mcdonald's about the skulls on the front obviously you don't
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:53.100]  know it was really weird when i first came up here because of all the things that you would
[02:53:53.100 --> 02:53:58.220]  think to see at a mcdonald's restaurant you see all the childish looking skulls the things with
[02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:03.340]  eye patches scars on their faces and also i think you took a look anthony over this way
[02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:07.820]  when you saw the mcdonald's truck you guys can see it right there on my shop and that's where
[02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:13.900]  they're cooking all the food everybody seems they at least hear us out you know use cooking um
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:18.700]  almost sardonically of course yeah yeah of course they do and the people we've met out here they're
[02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:22.540]  at least receptive to hear what we have to say a lot of them say yeah i know i don't care which is
[02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:26.780]  kind of interesting to me and that so many people would know and still choose to eat it regularly
[02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:31.820]  you know you always have your people who do it for indulgence purposes but you know this is a
[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:37.100]  good crowd a good receptive crowd uh we had a incident a little bit earlier when an officer
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:44.700]  tried to uh well actually didn't try he gave bigs a ticket or should i say uh donald whatever
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:48.540]  whatever his name is the donald mcdonald got a ticket for bullhorning out here
[02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:52.940]  but the cops were overall cool they they were pretty annoyed the south by wet south by officials
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:57.580]  kept coming by and trying to get us all arrested for trespassing when we're on a public sidewalk
[02:54:57.580 --> 02:55:04.060]  that's exactly right and skulls yeah and that's what's going on out here a very uh a very odd
[02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:12.940]  scene indeed let's find looking at what rex i think he was so intrigued that he may
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:18.300]  along with a few others tried to enter and may have been successful so he's been sitting
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:26.380]  in the bowels the literal bowels of the skull pit and yes he's on a a key mission to retrieve a big
[02:55:26.380 --> 02:55:33.260]  mac because we are absolutely destined to get one and absolutely not eat it on camera well when
[02:55:33.260 --> 02:55:38.140]  you got the denver dead baby mural that made so much interest they painted over it uh we need to
[02:55:38.140 --> 02:55:43.980]  you know to take some hd photos of this to a whole story about the cryptic skulls on the mcdonald's
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:47.740]  cryptic skulls and to form babies advertise mcdonald's goodies
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:53.340]  there's a warning sign for what you're about to experience
[02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:59.820]  well i'm telling you folks when you eat fast food like i did some back in college and stuff
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:04.620]  you you're hungry an hour later you feel weird it's like a drug these additives have psychoactive
[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:09.260]  effects excitotoxins it's in the medical literature but they're called additives so they get away with
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:13.420]  it just like cigarettes have additives to make it more addictive that's what's going on with this
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:19.020]  that's the big conspiracy that's why we obsess they try to change this just fat and sugars the problem
[02:56:19.020 --> 02:56:26.140]  no the problem is additives and franken food and things that aren't natural you need fat it makes
[02:56:26.140 --> 02:56:30.220]  your brain operate better you get Alzheimer's if you don't get it enough so many old people get
[02:56:30.220 --> 02:56:33.900]  Alzheimer's because they don't eat enough good cholesterol anthony you're an expert on this
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:37.900]  you're going to read many medical doctors on the fact uh heading up natural society story
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:42.940]  leak dot com and working with info wars dot com speak to that briefly i think about russell
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:48.060]  blalock md who talks about excitotoxins and msg derivatives and aspartame derivatives and basically
[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.740]  the chinese food syndrome as they called it which was basically just anecdotal evidence because
[02:56:51.740 --> 02:56:56.300]  chinese food did it and had msg and mcdonald's has very similar things that are actually worse
[02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:59.740]  and it's a compendium effect because of all the other additives that are in their food so what
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:05.500]  happens is as we see by this skull here when you eat the mcdonald's food you get a sensation rush in
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:09.420]  your brain that releases dopamine type compounds and you feel really really really good like you
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:14.540]  just did something ultimately over time though like a drug as you said you'll basically dismiss
[02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:18.540]  any negative things that someone says so if i say there's crap you know you're eating garbage
[02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:23.580]  you'll say well yeah i know but they secretly need it to justify their dopamine addictions
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:27.420]  and that is why they make so much money and then you end up looking like this skull here
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:31.180]  and all the mds that i've talked to you that i know personally and spoken to
[02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:35.340]  an interview and everything like that they all agree this is way beyond just ha ha
[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:41.100]  fats and macros and sugars and oh it's so funny this is a weaponized effect by mark
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:45.820]  well look at that arm that arm has like smallpox so they're getting ready that it's cool to have
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:54.700]  red puss balls all over you children eat it eat it but these people sit around in marketing rooms
[02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:59.820]  for like 16 hours a day and obsess on it and do drugs to keep them awake and think about how to
[02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:04.700]  psychologically target literal babies well what they do is they say these are unhappy yuppies with
[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:08.780]  college degrees that can't get a job and these are failures i mean i've been around these people
[02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:11.580]  in some of these marketing meetings where i've been involved in other stuff and i i'm literally
[02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:15.580]  disengaged they go we're going to use a subliminal of death and dead babies because people know
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:19.340]  they're trash and they want to see it when they feel like crap going in there to get this so it's
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:23.900]  just and it's trendy to be to fail and just be a total slacker and the next level of slacker is
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:28.780]  that puss balls all over you dead babies yeah like those du dead babies let's see what they look like
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:34.220]  there make it look like that put it in their face now let's go take some drugs ha ha yeah
[02:58:34.220 --> 02:58:38.220]  hail satan ah overdrive coming up that's what they're really saying in the corporate war

[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:24.300]  those animations looked like the skulls the rotten kids the mutated people he said it's
[03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:29.020]  exactly what you just said it is it's the world after a nuclear war with mutants everywhere
[03:00:29.020 --> 03:00:34.620]  and i guess that's part of mcdonald's promotion so see i wasn't just making up my first approximation
[03:00:34.620 --> 03:00:41.500]  analysis it is du babies it's incredible i didn't know that and now we're looking it up it appears
[03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:47.580]  that there's in some promotion with mcdonald's oh my god see i'm right again i can't believe it uh
[03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:53.180]  cj uh tell us about the loving show uh it's called adventure time it's pretty common on
[03:00:53.180 --> 03:01:00.780]  cartoon network all the preteens and tweens watch it and it's based on a world after a nuclear
[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:09.340]  apocalypse so those those are du babies oh my god yeah yeah the only people alive are a couple
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:18.780]  humans and a whole bunch of mutated creatures and mcdonald's is promoting du babies
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:25.100]  i knew i said i've seen that before because we were we were out there often over like an hour
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:29.020]  during the breaks i kept watching this video where have i seen that where like the bloated
[03:01:29.020 --> 03:01:32.940]  lips and the one eye that's what the du babies have i don't want to put them back on screen
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:41.420]  i mean i knew it so i said it to du baby i knew my gut was right but i can't believe it's really
[03:01:41.420 --> 03:01:47.820]  true what's going to happen here cj this is getting crazy if the new transhumanism isn't robots
[03:01:48.380 --> 03:01:53.980]  it's uh extra arms well they got to make us so ugly first in our minds they got to destroy us
[03:01:53.980 --> 03:01:58.860]  first before we must fall the machines because we believe we're made the image of god and beautiful
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:02:04.300]  and sentient and and if we exalt you know Beethoven and and and and you know firefighters
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:10.220]  saving kids and humans going into space then we won't be ready to fall and roll over and die cj
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:16.220]  you're not ready to die alex no i'm not ready to turn the world over a bunch of psychopathic
[03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:22.540]  haters no give up eat more gmo yep well those trendies have definitely given up we talked to
[03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:26.140]  google people that were down there last year they're like you will submit of course you'll have a
[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:31.420]  brain chip ah they think because they merge with it they've got power they're always these weak
[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:36.620]  sickly people that believe they have power because they're under the wings of the new world order
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:41.260]  you're only under the wings because it hadn't eaten your butt yet you're there in the food dish dumb
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:48.300]  dumb they'll go i know i am i mean how do you counter people that want to be slaves and want
[03:02:48.300 --> 03:02:55.180]  to take us with them exactly what you're doing here today put the news out there whether they
[03:02:55.180 --> 03:02:59.580]  want to accept or not and this is a satanic group though isn't it if you want to listen you want
[03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:04.620]  to listen you don't i guess it's your funeral you think mcdonald's likes the fact that we're
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:09.020]  exposing him because see it's not just about the poison food folks it's about devil worshipers
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:15.580]  with an evil john wane gay c clown selling you the food and what does he do once the clown gets
