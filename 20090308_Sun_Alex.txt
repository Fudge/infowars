[00:23.200 --> 00:36.800]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.160]  I are in USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan. The death toll of this morning's suicide bombing
[00:42.160 --> 00:47.600]  at Baghdad has reached 28 people. Iraqi police officials say the attack at the city's main
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.720]  police academy wounded 57 in addition to the fatalities. Here's Kim Gamble.
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.600]  In December, another suicide bomber hit recruits as they were lined up at the entrance.
[00:57.600 --> 01:03.280]  33 recruits were killed. The police academy also was targeted several other times in the past.
[01:03.280 --> 01:08.400]  And no one has claimed responsibility yet for a lethal attack on an army base in Northern Ireland.
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.400]  It killed two members of the British military and wounded another four.
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.920]  Gammon opened fire from a passing car, striking the soldiers.
[01:16.480 --> 01:18.640]  This is British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.240]  I think the whole country is shocked and outraged at the evil and cowardly attacks
[01:24.240 --> 01:29.520]  on British soldiers who were serving the country and on civilians just going about their ordinary
[01:29.520 --> 01:32.320]  duty. This is IRIN USA Radio News.
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.680]  My name is John DiMartino. I'm from Colorado and I started using Andy Willoughby 3-step plan.
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.080]  It's extremely encouraging for me and they've given me training on exactly what to say and I
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.360]  don't have to be a salesman to talk to people that are calling me. It's made me feel like,
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.680]  wow, let's do business. I can only conceive of growing and growing and growing now.
[01:57.680 --> 02:05.200]  I'm 56 years old and I feel young. I feel renewed. I'm happy. I'm excited about my financial future
[02:05.200 --> 02:11.600]  in a short amount of time. Less than an hour a day if someone wanted to. They could have a system.
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.880]  This is a stress-relieving business. Hi, how in the world are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby.
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.240]  After five years, the 3-step plan is a proven success story. If you're tired of worrying
[02:22.240 --> 02:31.760]  about money all the time, go to 3stepplan.com or call 800-480-2102. 800-480-2102.
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.320]  Pakistani authorities have released 12 Taliban militants who have been in Pakistani custody
[02:38.320 --> 02:44.080]  to keep up their end of a bargain negotiated with Taliban leaders. The deal was struck with Islamists
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.640]  in the troubled southwestern Swat Valley. U.S. officials are uneasy about the deal,
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.600]  fearful of the possibility of another safe haven for al-Qaeda on Pakistani soil.
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.480]  The president of Afghanistan has welcomed President Obama's willingness to working
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.920]  with moderate Islamic factions in the Middle East. President Har Makarsai's pro-Western
[03:03.920 --> 03:09.360]  administration has come under attack by a reinsurgent Taliban. Garsai said the effort to
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.880]  begin peace talks with moderate Taliban members, along with last month's approval to send 17,000
[03:14.880 --> 03:20.880]  additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, is a step in the right direction. And a pilotless U.S. drone
[03:20.880 --> 03:34.720]  aircraft is missing after entering Pakistan yesterday. It's believed the drone crashed.
[03:50.880 --> 04:08.240]  The U.S. economy is evident, Stephen, in the annual Iteride dog sled race,
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.520]  which began with a traditional ceremonial 11-mile run through Anchorage Saturday.
[04:13.520 --> 04:20.080]  The field of competitions is smaller, 67 mushers compared to a record 96 entries in last year's
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.760]  race. Because of heavy snow, the race is expected to take more than the normal nine days on the
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.840]  trail. Lance Mackie, the two-time defending champion, says the snow conditions could be better,
[04:31.840 --> 04:49.200]  but that's okay. Victims of disgrace financed by Nard made off will get a chance to address
[04:49.200 --> 04:54.480]  the court when he enters a plea on Thursday. It's not clear how many victims will speak,
[04:54.480 --> 04:58.640]  but the hearing is expected to be emotional. Here's Adam Goldman.
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.400]  Even though we're not talking about violent crimes, we are talking about many people losing
[05:02.400 --> 05:07.120]  everything they had. I'm sure their reactions to actually seeing made off in court will be visceral.
[05:07.120 --> 05:12.800]  And an election is underway in North Korea. The outcome is pretty much determined ahead of time.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.400]  Here's Gene Lee.
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.040]  If they approve of the candidate, they cast their ballot. If they don't approve of the candidate,
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.360]  they have to go to a separate ballot booth and cross the candidate's name out before putting
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.920]  it into a special ballot box. And defectors tell us that this is something that no North Korean
[05:27.920 --> 05:32.000]  would dare to do. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.400]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy
[05:38.400 --> 05:43.760]  and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of nine
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.760]  or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[05:49.760 --> 05:55.760]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of
[05:55.760 --> 06:00.800]  the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your
[06:00.800 --> 06:06.400]  health and energy. With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to
[06:06.400 --> 06:12.800]  the pH of 10. Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen
[06:12.800 --> 06:18.560]  content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline
[06:18.560 --> 06:24.960]  environment. Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alcovision.com.

[07:03.920 --> 07:08.880]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:08.880 --> 07:20.240]  All right, here's what's going on on this eighth day of March 2009. We'll be live over the next
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.520]  two hours. We have Lindsay Williams joining us for the last hour and 15 minutes of this Sunday
[07:25.520 --> 07:30.400]  abbreviated transmission. I do every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time for folks in the
[07:30.400 --> 07:37.440]  Eastern area. Of course, that is 5 to 7 p.m. and out on the Pacific. That is 2 to 4. Thank you again
[07:37.440 --> 07:44.000]  for joining us today. Let me break down the four stacks of important news I have here,
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.640]  and I'm really just going to news blitz and go through news for the next 45 minutes until
[07:48.640 --> 07:53.920]  Mr. Williams joined us. I'll have open phones for the balance of the transmission dealing with
[07:53.920 --> 08:00.320]  what's happening with the contrived global collapse that we have been detailing for many years before
[08:00.320 --> 08:08.560]  it began. Exactly how it would begin and how it would unfold. Vaccines were contaminated with
[08:08.560 --> 08:19.280]  avian flu virus. That is the headline, and that headline is out of the Toronto Sun. Here is another
[08:19.280 --> 08:25.840]  headline. This is out of the Canadian press. Baxter product contained live bird flu virus,
[08:25.840 --> 08:32.080]  another headline out of the Times of India. Virus mixed up by lab could have resulted in pandemic.
[08:34.160 --> 08:40.800]  Another headline of vaccines is biological weapons. Live avian flu virus placed in Baxter
[08:40.800 --> 08:46.400]  vaccine materials sent to 18 countries. That's out of natural news and Mike Adams, the health
[08:46.400 --> 08:51.520]  ranger. And then that dovetails with the New York Times article dealing with Baxter pharmaceutical
[08:51.520 --> 09:00.080]  virus, tied into Bayer. They're part of the IG Farben Combine during World War II. Bayer is,
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.720]  with the Nazis, blood money and AIDS is the headline. And it talks about how Bayer and other
[09:06.720 --> 09:12.480]  companies knowingly shipped out factor eight blood product filled with HIV and hepatitis.
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.720]  And over a million dosages of that were sent out and everyone that took it contracted HIV and AIDS
[09:18.720 --> 09:25.600]  eventually. And of course, hepatitis, all three A, B and C in there for you. And of course,
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.680]  France arrested the directors of Bayer in France, but that was it. Nobody else got any trouble and
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.040]  it did come out. This was from June 11, 1996, by the way, the New York Times. I just thought I'd
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.880]  pull that up for you. But it came out in 2000 in court hearings that they premeditatedly did it.
[09:43.520 --> 09:46.800]  That's the important thing for those of you out there that still think vaccines are good for
[09:46.800 --> 09:53.440]  you. Sure, roll up your sleeves. Meanwhile, we have national television and Dr. Dina Dell and others
[09:53.440 --> 09:59.600]  calling us conspiracy theorists when we just read out of the Associated Press in the New York Times.
[09:59.600 --> 10:08.000]  But this latest one was bird flu. It kills over 60% of those that ingest it. But it's not very
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.160]  airborne. It only lives a few seconds in the air. So they were splicing it with a bunch of other
[10:12.160 --> 10:19.840]  varieties of hardy flu that are extremely airborne and extremely contagious. And by the grace of
[10:19.840 --> 10:25.600]  God, a subcontractor tested it on ferrets and it killed all of them. Of course, normally,
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.440]  they would just test on the ferrets because the ferrets get sick. It means that the flu virus
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.520]  wasn't radiated properly in the vaccine, a routine problem. And so then they would send it back,
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.200]  would just kill them better than a hammer. So they studied what was in it. And it was
[10:37.200 --> 10:45.280]  this broke in the Czech Republic. They tested it there and in Austria. And the people at these
[10:45.280 --> 10:51.120]  18 sites are all having to go to the hospital and be tested right now. So that's the type of
[10:51.120 --> 10:54.800]  issues we have here. I could frankly spend two hours on that, but we'll spend a little bit
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.320]  more time on it later. Also, every day I see articles from even the South. You think this
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.960]  only goes on in places like Boston, Massachusetts, or in places like Connecticut,
[11:04.960 --> 11:12.160]  where people legally go to the gun shop, they buy some guns and the police pull them over and charge
[11:12.160 --> 11:17.760]  them for having an arsenal. There's no law, but they still go to prison. Now you're saying,
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.440]  how does that happen? Well, people go to prison all the time for not taking vaccines. There's no
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.560]  law. I've had listeners and it's been in the newspaper and in Lyon County, Kentucky, Kelly
[11:26.560 --> 11:34.720]  Rushing, gave state police some of my videos, the police arrested him and said it was threatening and
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.480]  said that they didn't appreciate the material in my film road to tyranny. It was also a Ron Paul
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.880]  video and I called the judge up at home and he said, yeah, you can watch the court case. I'm not
[11:42.880 --> 11:47.280]  going to comment on it. And it was in the newspaper and they took him in there and tried to put him
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.640]  in prison and the jury said not guilty. They said it was terrorism to hand out my videos. Then we
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.480]  had the state police being trained on their own video footage around the country that freedom
[11:58.480 --> 12:03.440]  is terrorism. I'm not joking when I say this. I want you to understand something, but I see these
[12:03.440 --> 12:11.040]  articles every day where troops returning home are arrested for having guns legally, where
[12:12.960 --> 12:18.240]  citizens are being harassed. And again, we're not against the police here until they stomp
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.480]  all over the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the feds are training the police. The Second Amendment
[12:22.480 --> 12:26.240]  is evil and bad. They're federalizing everything. Police chiefs nationwide are announcing going
[12:26.240 --> 12:33.520]  to take your blood at checkpoints for any reason, any misdemeanor now. They're announcing everywhere
[12:33.520 --> 12:37.520]  that even small cities are getting federal grants to put up police surveillance cameras.
[12:37.520 --> 12:42.080]  We always told you the cameras weren't for the highway folks. It was dual use. They're face scanning
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.360]  you. They're tracking you. Austin's getting it. It's just happening everywhere. But I have these
[12:47.360 --> 12:54.800]  reports here. Police, Arsenal found in Danbury team's truck and he's 18 years old. He went and legally
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.440]  bought some rifles. He was going to shoot them with his buddies in Maine ahead of a wedding
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.920]  that he was going to attend. The police pulled him over and he had four rifles and they freaked
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.320]  out and flipped out and they were all legal semi-automatic rifles and they still arrested him
[13:08.320 --> 13:15.040]  and they're charging him and there's no law, but they don't care. Now in Texas, there was no law
[13:15.040 --> 13:23.600]  that you couldn't carry a rifle or shotgun loaded in your car. Still people are in prison
[13:23.600 --> 13:26.720]  everywhere for it. You try putting one in your gun rack and robbing down the road.
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.640]  So the state of Texas had to pass a law a few sessions back stating no. They had to pass a
[13:32.640 --> 13:39.760]  law saying there is no law that you making it illegal for you to carry a gun. The only law
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.200]  they kept in there was you can't have a loaded handgun with you in the front of the car. It needs
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.280]  to be separated from the ammo in the back of the car or locked up somewhere. But still,
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.400]  I know a lot of people get pulled over. They said, you have any firearms in the car? Well,
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.480]  certainly I do, officer. Oh, I'm going to go ahead and take you into jail and the
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.800]  court system is so corrupt they will charge you with things you're not even guilty of to
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.280]  put you under the jail. So I want to get into some of that. In fact, let's just get into that
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.760]  right now and I'm going to get into all this other news here on the economy. This is out of the
[14:11.760 --> 14:18.720]  Omaha World Tribune and notice how they report this like it's normal and no big deal. A marksman
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.400]  in Iraq, no gun permit in Omaha. Now, they're honest in this article. The instant check is
[14:24.400 --> 14:30.560]  registration. It is a gun permit. It turns the right into a privilege and Clinton put hundreds
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.520]  of thousands of veterans on a list when he left office where they have no criminal convictions,
[14:35.520 --> 14:42.240]  not even misdemeanors. The federal law of the 68 gun control act says a felony and you can't own
[14:42.240 --> 14:49.520]  a gun, but they don't care. That's why Obama is now seizing all the psychological records of all
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.080]  Americans. If you were 15 years old and put on Ritalin or something, no firearms. It doesn't
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.760]  matter if you're 35 now and a bank president. It doesn't matter if you were in the military.
[14:59.760 --> 15:03.920]  Doesn't matter if you're police. They're all going to be losing and are losing their peace
[15:03.920 --> 15:12.480]  officer licenses right now. So it goes on here. It's a Sergeant Tim McKeeley trained fellow Marines
[15:12.480 --> 15:16.960]  to fire 50 caliber machine guns. He qualified as a marksman. He fought in the battle of Fallujah
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.920]  Iraq and received a combat medal with a V for Valor. Back home, he uses a rifle for target
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.160]  shooting. Yet when McKeeley shot to buy a nine millimeter Ruger pistol for protection in his
[15:28.160 --> 15:34.160]  midtown apartment, the Omaha police department rejected his application for a gun permit. You
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.000]  think in Nebraska, they have a good second amendment. They don't. I was trusted by the
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.640]  federal government or trusted by the government. How nice the people stealing all the money right
[15:42.640 --> 15:49.680]  now to carry a loaded weapon, but I'm not allowed to purchase one by my local government. McKeeley
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.240]  32 has received counseling for post traumatic stress disorder related to service in Iraq
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.680]  while completing an application for a gun permit. He responded yes to a question that
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.760]  asked whether he was being treated for a mental disorder. See, see the advertise that
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.520]  everybody's got to get a mental disorder. It's like getting a new pair of Nike tennis shoes.
[16:07.520 --> 16:10.960]  It's the latest thing. It's how you get, you know, everybody should go to counseling and well,
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.360]  so it's on your insurance. We'll give you a designation. No gun for him, but that's nothing
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.480]  compared to this article out of Connecticut. Arsenal found in Danbury team. They said, well,
[16:20.480 --> 16:25.280]  you're not allowed to have more than one gun. And so it didn't matter if he's going to the shooting
[16:25.280 --> 16:30.480]  range. We're going to charge him with felonies. And they just love it. Lick their lips as they
[16:30.480 --> 16:36.720]  destroy America. We'll be right back. Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.120]  of the economic and political problems facing the US and the world. And for the first time in
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.360]  their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.480]  in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.

[17:36.400 --> 17:41.600]  share some thoughts with you. In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking
[17:41.600 --> 17:46.880]  system on the verge of collapse, and Wall Street and continuous freefall, we both know that it's
[17:46.880 --> 17:51.200]  critical that you protect your savings and retirement programs now. Macroeconomics can
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.400]  be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets is very simple. It's purchase

[20:40.720 --> 20:50.320]  We are back live. Thank you for joining us. Throughout history, every time governments
[20:50.320 --> 20:56.480]  disarm their people, they jack the taxes up, double-triple them, and enslave the population.
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.880]  Every mafia-run city like New York, Chicago, and L.A. has massive gun control against the people
[21:02.880 --> 21:09.440]  and the highest crime rates, and now it's going nationwide. And I see these stories every day,
[21:09.440 --> 21:16.240]  and normally it's preceded by, you know, Bill was an insurance salesman living in an upscale home
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.120]  at a barbecue. He told his neighbors the economy was going to collapse. I mean, I've seen literally
[21:21.120 --> 21:27.360]  hundreds of stories just like this. You can pull them up. And Bill told his neighbors the economy
[21:27.360 --> 21:31.360]  was going to collapse, and that they need to get storable food and buy firearms, and that he had
[21:31.360 --> 21:37.120]  quite a bit of firearms. The police raided his home and confiscated 15 firearms. And they're
[21:37.120 --> 21:42.320]  investigating to see if he's a terrorist. And then I go check the state's laws. I've seen this in
[21:42.320 --> 21:49.040]  Texas, Ohio, you name it. It's not even illegal. And then we'll call the person up over and over
[21:49.040 --> 21:52.480]  again. I'll have my producers, these people, and 99% of the time they go, oh, my lawyer says,
[21:52.480 --> 21:58.080]  don't talk. My lawyer says, I got a plea to this. But wait, it's not illegal. I know, but you know,
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.560]  they're just saying that if I plead, they won't put me in prison for 20 years, and I'll just be on
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.840]  probation. And a few times they fought it and won. They've listened to me. It's gotten the
[22:07.840 --> 22:11.440]  point. I don't even call these people up anymore. But you know what? Let's do it again. This week,
[22:11.440 --> 22:18.160]  I'm going to call this gentleman up. A 18-year-old city resident is in a Massachusetts jail after
[22:18.160 --> 22:26.880]  the state police said they found an arsenal in his truck. Luke S. Huzinga was on his way to a
[22:26.880 --> 22:31.360]  wedding in Maine when a state trooper pulled him over for a minor traffic violation. It goes on.
[22:31.360 --> 22:37.920]  He had a Bushmaster. Semi-automatic. He had a shotgun. Why? He had some knives. Oh, my gosh.
[22:37.920 --> 22:42.080]  And it goes on and on. It shows the pocket knives. They're so deadly. He was going up there to shoot
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.440]  with his buddies. And it goes on to say that he just graduated as a top of his class homeschooler
[22:47.440 --> 22:54.160]  and had no criminal record, including no misdemeanors. But he was homeschooled as a sportsman
[22:54.160 --> 22:58.480]  and gun enthusiast who's familiar with guns, perhaps a little too much, his mother said,
[22:58.480 --> 23:02.880]  stressed that he was no criminal intent. Then they never list the crime he's committed here.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.800]  And I see this over and over again. I mean, listen, folks, try in Austin, Texas, driving
[23:08.800 --> 23:14.800]  with your pickup truck with a rifle. The police will pull you over in 10 seconds. Now in rural areas,
[23:16.240 --> 23:21.840]  I have talked to family that live in East Texas where we've been since 1829. And the police will
[23:21.840 --> 23:26.000]  pull over, you know, if you're walking across the street to your own land to go dove hunting. And
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.920]  they'll, let me see, let me see a bird hunting license. Let me, let me call the game warden
[23:29.920 --> 23:35.280]  over here. Let me, let me, you know, what are you doing with that shotgun? It's the Soviet Union.
[23:36.080 --> 23:39.920]  Okay. And I've had enough of it. See, first we can't have our rifles in our cars.
[23:40.640 --> 23:44.640]  Folks, when I was in high school, drove a red pickup truck. I had a, you know,
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.760]  rifle rack in my car and I'd throw my 243 in there and jet down to the ranch to do some hunting.
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.280]  And I remember being pulled over and they'd say, you know what,
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.720]  we pulled you over that rifle. What are you doing with that? Well, I'm going deer hunting,
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.280]  buddy. What do you think I'm doing? I need you to get out of the car. I'm going to have to search
[24:03.280 --> 24:09.760]  it. And one time, uh, myself and, uh, who was it, Roger Raceler, later a UT football player
[24:09.760 --> 24:15.360]  was a few years younger than me and his brother, Alex Raceler, uh, were, uh, driving. And by the
[24:15.360 --> 24:20.800]  way, he was valovictorian of his class. Now I was like a top doctor, but the point is no criminal
[24:20.800 --> 24:27.040]  record. Guys I lifted weights with and we're driving to go to the shooting range and there's,
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.120]  and we've got four rifles in the back and some handguns and, uh,
[24:33.280 --> 24:37.920]  state police pull us over, go through the guns. That's why we've got them. They get on the radio.
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.680]  The cop wants to do something to us and the superior's telling him, don't, I mean, that's,
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.160]  this country is down the toilet. It is down the toilet.
[24:46.160 --> 24:52.320]  We have turned into a secret police degenerate nation.
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.800]  You know, I've told the story one time and I lived in an apartment, walked out when I was in
[24:58.800 --> 25:03.120]  college, popped the back of my Mustang hatchback through the deer rifle in there,
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.480]  drove, uh, went hunting, came back a few days later. My neighbor said, yeah, the police were here
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.240]  and they went to your door and everything else. Cause you know, old lady next door saw
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.760]  you putting a rifle in there. Oh my goodness, not in America because these people, all they do
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.200]  is watch television and all these cop shows are based in New York and Chicago and Boston.
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.680]  You know, these fake shows, but then the real cop shows too, where you're not allowed to carry
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.680]  a handgun, a rifle in your car, even if you're going to the shooting range. It's up to their
[25:33.680 --> 25:38.080]  discretion. Texas was like that for a while, but so many lawsuits later they had to back off of that.
[25:39.280 --> 25:43.920]  So that's the moral of the story. You can fight this and you see these TV shows every
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.720]  episode. Oh, you know, he's got it. He's got a gun. You got a permit for this? Very few
[25:48.720 --> 25:52.320]  places you've got to have a permit, but they say you got a permit for this and people watch that
[25:52.320 --> 25:58.400]  in Alabama and Texas and Northern California and Nevada and Arizona and Wyoming and everywhere else,
[25:58.400 --> 26:05.840]  Oklahoma. They watch these shows. And so then when they're in your house, I had a carpet cleaner one
[26:05.840 --> 26:10.320]  time, try to call the police on me for a shotgun on the wall. Back before I had children in my
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.720]  broadcast studio out of my house, had a shotgun right up on the wall, had a gun safe right next
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.080]  to it. You bet. Got a shotgun and that guy started freaking out about it. I'm not going to clean this
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.880]  room. That gun's illegal because it was black and I guess scary. And I was just like, what are you
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.800]  talking about, pal? There had to be a newspaper article with me leading a gun rally on the cover
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.280]  of the Metro and state. And I held up the newspaper. I said, see me on the newspaper
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.720]  at a second amendment rally. It's not illegal for me to have that gun. Then I had a bad feeling
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.000]  and I called the carpet cleaning place, one of the bigger ones here in town. They drive yellow
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.440]  trucks. I'll just leave it at that. And the manager said, yes, Mr. Jones, he did want to call the
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.440]  police. We explained to him it's not illegal. You understand the country we live in. The government
[26:51.440 --> 26:54.400]  knows the criminals that run the government. They're stealing all the money out of the banks
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.480]  right now. They know what they're doing. They put up billboards for the last 15 years,
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.760]  constantly in every state of the union with an image of a revolver and it says report illegal
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.200]  guns. These weak minded cowards out there that make up most of the American people see that and
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.760]  think that revolvers are illegal. It is creating the perception with these numbskulls, just like
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.160]  they've created the color of law perception that you've got to take all the vaccines the government
[27:20.160 --> 27:29.440]  says you have to take. But it's just incredible to see this type of thing happening. And you know,
[27:29.440 --> 27:35.680]  police say they're pro second amendment, then act like it. Then act like it. Defend it because it
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.840]  isn't going to be there long. You know, something they've reintroduced the assault weapons ban,
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.640]  but this time they want to physically ban all semi-automatics. All semi-autos will be banned.
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.600]  Semi-automatic rifles, handguns, 22s, most of the firearms out there, you're going to have to hand
[27:49.600 --> 27:55.520]  them in. Federal psychological testing for everyone. Not that you've already on some list
[27:55.520 --> 27:58.400]  because, you know, you got depressed when you were 20 or something, when your daddy died of
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.800]  cancer. Not because you weren't a car wreck and they give everybody a psychological designation,
[28:02.800 --> 28:08.480]  not because you collapsed once on 120 degree weather in Iraq or something and they give you
[28:08.480 --> 28:12.720]  that designation. They hand them out like hotcakes. They give more than half the troops that leave
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.200]  the military now a psychological designation. That's so they can disarm you. They don't want
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.560]  people who know how to use weapons and defend this country to have them. But see, they've gotten
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.960]  smart. They don't brag about their legislation anymore. They just introduce it quietly. Just
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.880]  like they've been saying for months, they don't want to return to the fairness doctrine to restrict
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.880]  free speech. But this time they say on the internet, now they've introduced a bill to do just that.
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.400]  Nancy Pelosi, Wall Street Journal reported Friday that will restrict free speech on the internet
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.920]  and talk radio. The bill was introduced by the Speaker of the House. Meanwhile, Obama is out
[28:47.920 --> 28:53.680]  lying in public saying, oh, we're not reintroducing that. They do that to destroy resistance. Just
[28:53.680 --> 28:57.840]  like they've introduced all these federal bills for carbon taxes on every facet of your cars,
[28:57.840 --> 29:03.280]  your home, businesses, jobs, hundreds of taxes. And then Obama comes out and says,
[29:03.280 --> 29:08.400]  you're not going to do it, to destroy people saying no. Meanwhile, they've introduced the bills.
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.400]  You understand how they operate? You understand what they're doing?
[29:14.160 --> 29:17.440]  All right, we get back. I'm going to tell you about the deadly vaccines, the latest.
[29:17.440 --> 29:23.280]  Hey, how about some bird flu in your vaccine? How's that sound? How about make it go airborne?
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.160]  How about Kello Bunkchub is deader than a hammer? How about some AIDS in your vaccine?
[29:28.160 --> 29:48.160]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.

[33:57.760 --> 34:13.760]  So what's really happening is they're demonizing the Second Amendment and effectively banning
[34:13.760 --> 34:19.520]  the Second Amendment right now. Without even having new federal laws, they're saying millions of
[34:19.520 --> 34:25.280]  former members of the military veterans cannot own firearms now by the government giving them
[34:25.280 --> 34:30.080]  psychological designations for absolutely no reasons and also the general public. They want
[34:30.080 --> 34:36.240]  you institutionalized. They want you on welfare or they want you deep in debt or they want you in
[34:36.240 --> 34:41.360]  the psychiatric system. And that's what national service is about, is forcing the rest of us to
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.160]  be in the government system. And the bills are introduced where you, even if you were never
[34:46.160 --> 34:52.800]  given a psychological designation, you will go before federal psychiatrist every two years to
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.400]  be able to have a permit to own firearms period retroactively. That is introduced right now.
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.560]  They are coming for the Second Amendment. Make no mistake. Okay, let me get into this news story.
[35:06.560 --> 35:21.840]  Baxter product contained live bird flu virus. That is out of the Toronto Sun.
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.760]  Here is another one out of the Times of India. Virus mixed up by lab could have resulted in
[35:27.760 --> 35:34.000]  pandemic. And I have other mainstream news articles along these lines at infowars.com
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.880]  and prisonplanet.com. What happened is Baxter Pharmaceuticals based in the U.S. mailed to
[35:40.880 --> 35:52.000]  18 of its subsidiary factories in Europe with the orders to mix HN H5N1 avian flu virus,
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.600]  the deadly type that kills more than 60% of the people that come in contact with it.
[35:56.480 --> 35:59.840]  A horrible gruesome death. Your lungs fill up with water. You die.
[35:59.840 --> 36:08.160]  It has a higher kill rate with young children. So they ship this out, has nothing to do with
[36:08.160 --> 36:14.240]  the regular flu vaccine, but it's mixed at 18 different locations in the big test batches.
[36:16.320 --> 36:21.040]  And the scientists that are reporting on this in the Canadian, French, German, Czech news,
[36:21.040 --> 36:25.680]  we have quotes in stories we've written up on infowars.com that link to all this,
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.000]  that are kind of boil downs of all this news. But this is so important. I recommend you read
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.520]  all the articles on it fully grasp it. This is the perfect way to mutate the bird flu,
[36:35.520 --> 36:44.880]  the deadly bird flu, into a super airborne flu because it is not possible. It is likely
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.480]  that it would then mutate into a airborne type by merging with the other flu screens.
[36:50.480 --> 36:55.360]  But as if that isn't bad enough,
[36:59.840 --> 37:05.280]  it will also kill you if you are injected with this or give you a good chance of being killed
[37:05.280 --> 37:13.600]  with it without it even mutating because the H5N1 is very fatal. It just doesn't live long in the
[37:13.600 --> 37:18.880]  air. So it needs to get through your skin into your bloodstream to be effective. And that's
[37:18.880 --> 37:25.840]  exactly what being injected with this will do. So I thought I would go back and thank God this
[37:25.840 --> 37:32.560]  got caught and stopped, but not by Baxter. I thought I would go back. You can just Google
[37:32.560 --> 37:39.360]  HIV hepatitis in factor eight into Google and you'll get hundreds of news articles, MSNBC
[37:39.360 --> 37:47.200]  pieces where they admit that Bayer, the big parent company of a bunch of these conglomerates,
[37:47.200 --> 37:56.320]  knowingly for years, and this was ongoing until 2000, all over the world shipped out HIV-filled
[37:56.320 --> 38:04.160]  factor eight blood clotting agent that's injected. The media always calls it a vaccine. It really
[38:04.160 --> 38:11.520]  isn't. And it's also filled with hepatitis. And it turned out they knowingly did this. And
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.200]  who was involved in that as well? Baxter Pharmaceutical, the same ones. Now what's interesting
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.240]  here is the mainstream European press, big newspapers, and the Czech Republic and others
[38:22.240 --> 38:28.720]  are saying was this done on purpose to cause a pandemic because Baxter separately is trying
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.560]  to get approval for a bird flu vaccine. So that's not Alex Jones saying that. That's
[38:34.560 --> 38:39.840]  mainstream news in Europe. But look at this article from 96. You can pull up hundreds of these.
[38:39.840 --> 38:47.760]  Blood, money, and AIDS. Last December, Corey Dublin, a hemophiliac infected with the virus
[38:47.760 --> 38:54.080]  that causes AIDS, met for lunch at Carol's Restaurant in Camarillo, California with John
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.720]  Bocci, the president of Baxter International Inc. unit that makes blood clotting products.
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.520]  Mr. Dublin, like an estimated 6,000, 10,000 hemophiliacs nationwide. It's a lot more than
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.320]  that now. It's millions worldwide. Became infected with HIV after receiving a tainted
[39:08.320 --> 39:14.800]  clotting substance by Baxter and three other companies in the 70s and 80s. No, this went on
[39:14.800 --> 39:20.800]  longer than that. This is from 96. Hundreds of victims have sued, but statutes and limitations
[39:20.800 --> 39:25.440]  prevented thousands more from bringing claims. Really, there's no statute on fraud. There's no
[39:25.440 --> 39:31.200]  statute on murder. That's not true. Mr. Dublin, however, had not come to lunch to pick a fight
[39:31.200 --> 39:34.720]  rather to satisfy it with the way the key plaintiffs' lawyers were handling litigation.
[39:34.720 --> 39:39.040]  He was on a stealth mission to negotiate for all those infected a settlement with a four
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.360]  companies without the knowledge of key plaintiff's lawyers. There's just an example of that.
[39:44.080 --> 39:50.000]  Go to YouTube and Google Bayer AIDS, and you can watch the news clips about it,
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.720]  where they knowingly, knowingly, especially Bayer Pharmaceutical did this.
[39:56.240 --> 40:01.760]  Now, we told you two years ago that in the trials of the HPV, the human papillomavirus vaccine,
[40:01.760 --> 40:08.240]  that it was killing scores of people that took it and thousands of others were having
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.000]  autoimmune responses and seizures and bloody sores popping up all over their body with
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.160]  this live cancer virus injection that they admit doesn't even guarantee that it will stop from
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.720]  getting cervical cancer that only kills about 4,000 people a year. They're saying every girl
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.320]  needs it and every boy needs it. Perry claims it's the law to take it. Go look, there is no law.
[40:30.320 --> 40:34.800]  He just made it a recommended shot to the state health departments as a recommended to go to
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.720]  school. They don't tell you there's waivers, but why are there waivers? There's not even a law to
[40:38.720 --> 40:46.800]  need a waiver. And now CBS News, CNN, all of them are having a report. All these deaths confirmed
[40:46.800 --> 40:56.320]  by the HPV, human papillomavirus inoculations. So do this at your own risk, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.080]  If you go back about 15 years ago, there were only five vaccines they tried to push
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.040]  and they claim were mandatory. Now it's over 60 shots they're trying to make people take.
[41:05.760 --> 41:11.200]  The big pharma comes out with new vaccines. They go lobby, pay off politicians and politicians
[41:11.200 --> 41:14.560]  then claim it's the law you've got to take them, but there's not even a law you've got to take them.
[41:14.560 --> 41:22.880]  Just fraud and lies and corruption on every single front. Now, this is confirmed there's HIV
[41:22.880 --> 41:29.440]  in these products. It's confirmed bird flu. It's confirmed the swine flu that was caused by vaccines
[41:29.440 --> 41:35.360]  is admitted. Killed tens of thousands in the U.S. alone. Remember that in the 70s? Folks,
[41:35.360 --> 41:40.720]  you better find out about all this. You better learn what's going on with all of this. You better
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.280]  learn about the connection between vaccines and cancer, not just the DNA and the vaccines triggering
[41:45.280 --> 41:59.440]  cancer, but the fact that HV 40 SV 40 and scores of other viruses can't most cancer is viral. Most
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.280]  cancer is viral. That's the big dirty secret. But now that that's out, Oh, they have vaccines
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.840]  against viral cancer, which then kill you in many cases or main you.
[42:09.840 --> 42:20.320]  But look into the fact of SV 40. Just Google SV 40 cancer and you will be on the Centers for
[42:20.320 --> 42:25.440]  Disease Control admitting more than 200 million Americans were injected with it and that it causes
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.040]  scores of different types of fast acting cancers that were unknown
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.520]  until the fifties with the polio vaccine. And guess what? That's still in most major
[42:37.520 --> 42:46.480]  vaccine stocks, not just. Let me explain that again. Not just polio.
[42:48.560 --> 42:53.120]  Now, if you see my film in game blueprint for global enslavement, we show all the documents,
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.040]  all the government documents, State Department, CIA, congressional testimony that the eugenics
[42:59.040 --> 43:03.520]  families like the Rockefellers who publicly are in the encyclopedia funding the Kaiser
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.680]  Wilhelm Eugenics Society that Hitler learned everything he got from that they knowingly
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.800]  discovered that most cancer is viral and that it is implanted in your vaccines.
[43:16.640 --> 43:18.560]  I mean, I just read to you where it's HIV and
[43:19.920 --> 43:22.240]  bird flu. I mean, what else do you need out there?
[43:24.080 --> 43:28.640]  We'll be right back with Lindsey Williams, a bunch of economic news. Stay with us.

[47:44.080 --> 47:48.160]  We are back live. I know we've had loaded phones since the start of the show. I know your calls
[47:48.160 --> 47:57.280]  will be all over the map but Lindsay Williams can comment on those. Later at the very end of the
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.720]  show, I'm going to play a clip of a senator that actually asked some hard questions of the
[48:00.720 --> 48:06.800]  private Federal Reserve head, Bernanke. They won't say where the $9.7 trillion now they've stolen
[48:06.800 --> 48:12.480]  went and there's a Bloomberg headline from Friday. Fed refuses to release bank data insist on secrecy.
[48:13.360 --> 48:17.760]  That's what this police state's all about. So the offshore banks that control Washington can
[48:17.760 --> 48:24.160]  carry out their heist. Also, the media is saying that Obama is basically making his
[48:24.160 --> 48:32.000]  entire policy system be built around attacking Rush Limbaugh. They have to do that because
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.240]  the Republicans and Democrats all vote to expand government, attack our liberties and freedoms.
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.960]  So they have to act like there's a difference between the two parties and that will energize
[48:42.960 --> 48:48.240]  the liberal base that will energize the main line conservative base. This is a basic form of manipulation.
[48:48.240 --> 48:55.600]  We'll go over it. I also have some other important news. You know, there's that Bob Dylan song,
[48:55.600 --> 49:02.640]  Sundown on the Union and he says in there, you know, someday even growing your own home garden
[49:02.640 --> 49:07.200]  will be against the law. And I've seen articles around Europe and the United States where they're
[49:07.200 --> 49:11.120]  restricting people even having gardens in their backyards saying, you might grow marijuana.
[49:11.120 --> 49:15.920]  See, no citizen can even be trusted not just to have a gun. You can't be trusted to grow tomatoes.
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.240]  And if you go back to slaves in Europe under feudalism, they couldn't grow their own food.
[49:20.240 --> 49:27.200]  It's a system of control. And I saw that out of the Tulsa world. Tulsa City Councilor questions
[49:27.200 --> 49:30.800]  community gardens saying allowing citizens to grow gardens in their backyards. Yeah,
[49:30.800 --> 49:35.680]  we're so controlled can't have a garden. He says because they might grow marijuana. So we have
[49:35.680 --> 49:42.320]  to have police inspections of your garden. See all guilty until proven innocent. Oh my gosh,
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.480]  you got a tomato plant. And here in Austin, everybody I talked to think it's read by the
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.200]  police. It's for having blood weed in their backyard that grows everywhere. Oh, that blood
[49:51.200 --> 49:53.840]  weed looks a little bit like it. We don't have a warrant, but we're coming in your house.
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.280]  It's such a sick joke. They use the phony drug war to get involved in our lives and the bigger
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.440]  the drug war gets the more drugs on our streets, more liberties and freedoms we lose. Look at Mexico
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.640]  collapsing because of their phony drug war. You end the drug war, the crime gangs, the syndicates,
[50:08.640 --> 50:15.680]  the banks laundering the money will rise up like a cold sword. It'll all become very, very clear,
[50:15.680 --> 50:20.400]  but they won't do that because it's their plan to bring down this nation. It's the globalist.
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.400]  They want to conquer us. It's what they do. And until we wake up to that, it's over.
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.440]  Now I want to introduce Lindsay Williams. Lindsay hadn't been on the Sunday syndicated show.
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.120]  I know a lot of our listeners tune into both the weekday shows and the Sunday show, but
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.160]  Lindsay and the time we've got, I would just ask you to basically recap who you are,
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.160]  the story you've told, the information that's come out. What you wrote about 25 years ago
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.560]  came out to be true and declassified documents that there's more oil in one area of Alaska
[50:50.560 --> 50:55.040]  than all of Saudi Arabia and they won't let us have it because they want to be able to manipulate
[50:55.040 --> 51:04.080]  the prices. We also know that, well, you said seven months ago on this show and others that
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.880]  the oil price is going to drop from $147 a barrel to below 50. Everybody laughed at you,
[51:08.880 --> 51:12.960]  but you have these former executive contacts when you worked with the board of Atlantic
[51:12.960 --> 51:18.160]  Richfield and others as their chaplain and you've since talked to this individual again.
[51:18.720 --> 51:22.960]  And you went on my show and made those predictions because it was directly from the globalist,
[51:22.960 --> 51:27.200]  just like we infiltrated Bilderberg in 2006 and said they're going to run the stock market up
[51:27.200 --> 51:32.960]  to $14,000 again and then drop it in 2008. But not because we're geniuses, we cover what the
[51:32.960 --> 51:37.360]  leader actually doing and we talked about how they would claim it was the subprime mortgages that
[51:37.360 --> 51:41.280]  caused it when it wasn't and then that they would steal basically all the money because we had
[51:41.280 --> 51:45.440]  sources inside Bilderberg and that's covered by the way, my new film, the Obama deception that
[51:45.440 --> 51:51.600]  comes out March 15th. So just basically recap and then everything we've covered in the last three
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.720]  or four interviews we've done, condense it down what's happening in the world. Lindsey Williams,
[51:56.720 --> 52:01.200]  good to have you back with us. Thank you, Alex, for allowing me to be this weekend
[52:01.200 --> 52:07.520]  with you on your weekend show for the first time. I feel honored and yes, let's go back a ways.
[52:08.400 --> 52:15.360]  And well, first of all, let me say that back on July the 28th, you were bold enough to allow me
[52:15.360 --> 52:20.800]  to present something that possibly no way in this world it could happen. But I guess as a result of
[52:20.800 --> 52:25.360]  you knowing that for the past 35 years, the elite have told me things. You allowed me on your show
[52:25.360 --> 52:32.960]  to tell you because I had a contact from them eight months ago and was told everything that the elite
[52:32.960 --> 52:37.840]  planned to do in the world for the next year to a year and a half. And it has happened exactly like
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.960]  they said it. But let me go back so that folks will understand why I can say the things that I'm
[52:42.960 --> 52:48.320]  going to say today because today I'm going to tell you how things have already taken place
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.720]  and everything that will happen for the next year. It began for me 35 years ago. I was asked to be
[52:54.720 --> 53:03.840]  the chaplain on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the elite. Folks, let me say as emphatically as
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.320]  I can that positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[53:08.960 --> 53:13.840]  And since I was chaplain on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, they invited me to sit in on their
[53:13.840 --> 53:19.840]  board meetings in an advisory capacity in order to help the relationship between management and
[53:19.840 --> 53:25.440]  labor as they were building that the biggest pipe ever constructed on the face of the earth for the
[53:25.440 --> 53:31.360]  carrying of crude oil from the crude oil bay, huge new American oil field on the Arctic Ocean.
[53:31.360 --> 53:37.760]  Well, I had the experience of my lifetime. Now, by the providence of God, it had to have happened
[53:37.760 --> 53:42.960]  because how would a little unknown insignificant missionary flying airplanes out in the bush of
[53:42.960 --> 53:48.400]  Alaska all of a sudden be allowed to sit with the people you hear about in the World Bank, the IMF,
[53:49.200 --> 53:53.840]  top oil company officials of the world. It could have only happened by the providence of God.
[53:53.840 --> 54:00.080]  Very few people on the face of this earth have ever lived with the elite for three years time.
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.960]  I did, sat across the dinner table from them, stayed in the same dorms with them at crude oil
[54:04.960 --> 54:10.880]  bay on the oil field. These were not men coming to my church. I was on their oil field. They greeted
[54:10.880 --> 54:16.560]  me kind of like a mascot. Told me everything that I asked never was held anything from me.
[54:16.560 --> 54:26.080]  And I had an opportunity to literally observe the elite of the world first hand as probably nobody
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.320]  else ever has that would be allowed to ever tell the story. And I'm quite sure they didn't think
[54:30.320 --> 54:36.160]  that I would. Well, over the past 35 years, everything that I've ever been told by them,
[54:36.160 --> 54:40.240]  I have told it to the world. And a few times I've been contacted and they've said,
[54:40.240 --> 54:43.680]  Chaplin, you're saying too much and you're going to have to back off. If you don't,
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.320]  we're going to have to take action. Well, that's exactly what happened back eight months ago.
[54:48.320 --> 54:52.640]  One of them called me. This is the second time this has happened in 35 years.
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.640]  This gentleman I had not seen for about 25 years. I know who he is. He's 82 years of age now,
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.400]  but once you become a part of them, you never get away from it. And he said,
[55:02.400 --> 55:06.400]  Chaplin, you've got to quit saying certain things. You're talking too much and you're
[55:06.400 --> 55:10.640]  getting us in trouble. And if you don't quit, we're going to have to take action. And by the
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.240]  way, for those that don't know, your video went as viral as loose change, the most downloaded
[55:16.240 --> 55:21.520]  film in internet history. It was number one on Google video for six, seven months with millions
[55:21.520 --> 55:28.480]  of views a day. So that's why they called you. It was international sensation. The info you've
[55:28.480 --> 55:34.160]  been telling us for myself 13 years finally got a lot of attention. So they call you up,
[55:34.160 --> 55:41.280]  they threaten you continue. Yes. And what you said was not too pleasant. And I remember very well
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.760]  that John F. Kennedy, the president of the United States of America, decided one day he'd buck the
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.960]  elite change over the currency and do away with the federal reserve. Well, it didn't take long
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.560]  for him to get shot. So there was no sense in the world in me arguing with them. I talked with
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.920]  the gentleman a few minutes, agreed to pull my video, redo it, agreed to shut down my website,
[56:01.920 --> 56:07.040]  which you won't find it there any longer. But that's not the important thing. The important part
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.960]  is what I can do in helping you who are listening to this program today, know everything that the
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.080]  elite told me for the next year and a year and a half that they plan to do. Because after this
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.400]  gentleman, I came to agreement, he said, now, Chaplin, if you'll do these simple things, he said,
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.680]  we'll let you alone, let you go ahead and talk like you want to. Well, at that point, I asked him,
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.640]  I decided I'd be friendly. I said, how's your family, your wife, where have you been living
[56:32.640 --> 56:38.480]  since I saw you 25 years ago? He became quite polite. And at that point, I began asking him
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.640]  questions. And for 45 minutes time, he talked with me on the phone. Now, if you can imagine,
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.000]  Alex, I don't, again, I must say, I put on my britches just like you do every morning.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.680]  This is a former CEO of one of the big five old companies, but go ahead.
[56:53.680 --> 56:59.120]  Yeah. And he was talking with me on the phone. And he said, this is what we're going to do.
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.960]  Now, that was when crude oil was $147 a barrel. It actually had 150 to be technical, but go ahead.
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.760]  Yeah. There's no way in this world that it was going to come down to $50 a barrel. But he said,
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.880]  to me, it's coming down to $50 a barrel. He said the price of gasoline at the gas pump is going
[57:14.880 --> 57:21.040]  to $1.50 to $2 a gallon. He said, we, I said, why are you going to do this? He said, we're going
[57:21.040 --> 57:27.680]  to do it for the purpose of bankrupting OPEC oil producing countries of the world. This was
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.640]  unthinkable. The richest people on the face of the earth to be bankrupted. I said, what's this
[57:32.640 --> 57:38.560]  going to do to that city over there called Dubai five star, never anything been built like it before.
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.280]  He said it's going to become a ghost town. He went right down the line with everything that
[57:43.280 --> 57:49.360]  was going to happen, including what was going to take place for the next 12 months to a year and
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.640]  a half in the United States of America. Now, Alex, I would like to do something very unusual on
[57:54.640 --> 58:00.560]  your program as it goes along today. I have never done this in the 35 years that I have had the
[58:00.560 --> 58:06.800]  privilege of doing radio talk shows all across America. I have never done what I'd like to do
[58:06.800 --> 58:12.320]  on your show today. You see, knowing the elite personally sitting across the dinner table from
[58:12.320 --> 58:18.640]  them, living in the dorms with them, talking with them on their level. I was able to analyze their
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.240]  minds. I understand. Stay there. You got to know them and how they work. Stay with us. We'll be
[58:22.240 --> 58:27.040]  right back. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Did you miss your favorite shows on GCN today? Thanks to the

[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:46.800]  Responsibility yet for a lethal attack on an army base in Northern Ireland that killed two members
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:52.480]  of the British military and wounded four others. Eyewitnesses said gunman opened fire from a passing
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:58.160]  car striking the soldiers. This is British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Our first priority has
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:02.800]  always been the security of people in Northern Ireland and we'll do everything in our power to
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:08.400]  make sure that Northern Ireland is safe and secure and I assure you that we will bring these murderers
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:13.280]  to justice. When the death toll from this morning suicide bombing and Baghdad has reached 28,
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:19.280]  Iraqi police officials say the attack at the city's main police academy wounded 57 in addition
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:25.200]  to the fatalities. The bomber was reportedly wearing an explosive vest when he drove a motorcycle
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:32.080]  also packed with explosives into the back entrance of the academy building. This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:39.600]  Hi this is Bob and Bill. We're here to talk about your boss. The stick it to him guy. That's not
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:43.920]  nice. There's nothing I love more than to be told women where I can and cannot go by someone who
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:47.440]  thinks they're smarter than me and wants me to know it. I'm sensing a little bit of pinned up
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.520]  aggression there Bill. I lost my happy place for a minute there. And all there is an alternative
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:55.600]  to the old J.O.B. Yeah it's called unemployment. I'm talking about starting your own business.
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:00.480]  I'm losing my happy place again. What if I could show you a proven system that really does work?
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.480]  What's that? Andy Willoughby's three step plan. How in the world are you anyway Andy Willoughby?
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:08.080]  Now the nice thing about the three step plan is you don't have to go looking for customers. The
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.640]  customers call you and you don't have to sell anything. The system does all the work. You just
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.200]  provide the information. Now I can do that. That's why I'm telling you about it Bill. Even you could
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:20.960]  be your own boss. Can I tell myself when to go home? Oh of course. Can I tell myself to take a
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:24.960]  vacation? Why don't you just tell yourself to take a hike? And I don't take me out of my happy place.
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:32.960]  How in the world are you anyway? I'm Andy Willoughby. Go to threestepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:39.520]  Pakistani authorities have released 12 Taliban militants who'd been in Pakistani custody to
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:45.040]  keep up their end of a bargain negotiated with Taliban leaders. The deal was struck with Islamists
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:50.640]  and the troubled Northwestern Swat Valley. On February 24th, Taliban militants announced a
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:57.360]  ceasefire in Pakistani forces and turned halted operations in Swat. U.S. officials are uneasy
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:03.120]  about the deal, fearful of the possibility of another safe haven for al-Qaeda on Pakistani soil.
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.600]  A pilotless U.S. drone aircraft is missing after entering Pakistan yesterday. It's believed to
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:15.760]  have crashed. The unmanned aerial vehicles routinely fly over northwest Pakistan regions
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:21.600]  along the border with Afghanistan, seeking out Islamist militants. And an executive order that
[1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:26.480]  would lift the eight-year limits on stem cell research is set to be signed by President Obama
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:35.600]  tomorrow. For the latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com. With a word about Israel,
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:41.920]  here's bestselling author and Bible teacher Kay Arthur. If you could only visit one country,
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:50.240]  one nation on the face of this earth, it should be Israel, because then you'll never be the same.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:57.840]  To start planning your trip to Israel today, call 1-888-777-ISRAIL or visit www.goisrael.com.
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:09.120]  The weak U.S. economy is evidenced even in the annual Iterod Dogs Lead Race,
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:14.400]  which began with the traditional ceremonial 11-mile run through Anchorage Saturday.
[1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:20.880]  The field of competitors is smaller, 67-mushers compared to a record 96 entries in last year's
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:26.400]  race. Because of heavy snow, the race is expected to take more than the normal nine days on the
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:33.440]  trail. The winner receives a new truck and a cash award of $69,000. This is Governor Sarah Palin.
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:41.200]  This is what puts Alaska on the map. This uniquely Alaskan event. We're just so proud to get to
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:47.040]  Alaska first, get to host such an event. It's world class. It's so unique and we're just so proud
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:52.400]  of this race every year. North Koreans go to the polls today, and this is the first election
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:57.680]  since Kim Jong-il reportedly suffered a stroke last August. Here's Gene Lee.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:03.680]  There are hints that Gene Jong-il may be grooming one of his sons to succeed him.
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:08.640]  In summer, jobs are not just for young people anymore, especially in this pink slip-heavy
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:13.920]  economy. Dan McBride is the director at the Ride Playland Amusement Park. He says high
[1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:19.280]  unemployment in the nation in the midst of a recession is tipping the age scale of his summer
[1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:24.640]  applicant pool. This year, our applicant pool is older and more mature without any question.
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:32.880]  The unemployment situation is the nation's worst in 25 years. I'm Jonny Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:39.040]  Our tax season is upon us, and a lot of you are concerned because tax-related fraud is up 600%.

[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:21.920]  I know we've been loaded with phone lines. This is the radio show. But again, we're going to get to you.
[1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:25.360]  It won't matter if it's all over the map. Lindsey Williams can comment on it all.
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:30.960]  But Pastor, recap what you've said in your past interviews. Explain what he told you
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:35.280]  that we're going to do eight months ago, that you go on the air six and a half, seven months ago.
[1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.720]  You break it down when oil prices were only rising.
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:50.880]  And believe me, you had to have been bold to have allowed that because crude oil prices
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:58.240]  at that time, $147 of arrow. And this gentleman told me they were going to $50 of arrow. I knew
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:02.720]  there was no way in this world that this could happen, except that the elite would do it. Now,
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:10.240]  folks, let me pause here long enough to say, please, please, I beg of you, believe everything you
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:17.760]  hear Alex Jones say on his show. I know from firsthand experience that the elite of this world
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:23.760]  do exist. There is a handful of people who control our government, control our president,
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:29.040]  control the currencies, control OPEC and the oil production of the world, and the price they get
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:36.400]  to a barrel of oil. And this man said to me, it is going to $50 of arrow. It's going to $1.50 to
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:41.200]  $2 a gallon for gas pump. Now, here I'm going to make a prediction. Don't be concerned about
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.320]  gasoline prices going up to gas pump. They aren't. I was told by this man that they would stay this
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:53.440]  way until they had completely bankrupted OPEC, the oil producing countries of the world. That
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:58.560]  means a year to a year and a half, you are going to see gasoline price prices stay right where
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:04.000]  they are today and not go up. Walk my words. I was told it by one of those who knows everything
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.960]  that goes on behind. And by the way, since then, several mainstream publications like Bloomberg
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.800]  and AP and George Soros at the Davos World Economic Forum where the elite spews their
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:21.200]  propaganda admitted that they've artificially lowered oil prices to bankrupt Russia, Venezuela,
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:27.280]  the Arabs and ensure a worldwide depression. So the big central banks flush with all the bailout
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:33.120]  money can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar with an artificially engineered fire sale.
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:38.800]  Now, within months of you saying this on air, it began to drop from $150 a barrel down to $100,
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:44.880]  down to $75, down to $60, down to as low as $33 a barrel. It's at $40 something right now.
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:49.840]  It bounces around down there at the bottom. Again, he told you they were doing this.
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:53.920]  Now, break down why they wanted to destroy the world economy.
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.520]  They're doing this intentionally. All this was planned much and much in advance. This did not
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:04.560]  happen by chance. What's happening in the finances of America right now, likewise,
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:10.640]  are not happening by chance. All of this is for the purpose of bringing about everything that you're
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:16.240]  seeing take place right now in banking. He told me he said, America, we'll see. Now, folks, please
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:22.800]  notice this. I'm quoting this man Burb Atom word for word. It almost is if he had just walked out
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  of the boardroom of the elite and was quoting it to me on the telephone before we had this financial
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:34.480]  crisis, before Obama was elected, before we had any money given by the Treasury of the United
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.520]  States of America to the banks of America, before the real estate crisis took place.
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:44.640]  This man told me, and Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of being on your show.
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:47.120]  Well, you bet, Lindsay. You bet. Let's get into it. So, so...
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:52.880]  America will see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take years to come out of
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:59.440]  it. Now, this means he was forecasting exactly what's taking place in the financial world right now,
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:04.480]  the real estate crisis, the banking crisis, and folks, you haven't seen anything yet. You just
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:09.840]  wait until they finish up what they wanted because he said to me, he said, this is being done for the
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:15.440]  purpose of bankrupting the OPEC oil producing countries of the world. That means that they
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:20.320]  no longer have the money to buy our T-bills. Folks, you don't realize just how drastic this is.
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:24.400]  The T-bills pay the interest on the national debt of the United States of America,
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:29.120]  and when they don't buy our Treasury bills at the auctions of the Treasury,
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:34.960]  it could bring about a collapse of the dollar. Mark my words, you are going to see six months,
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:40.560]  nine months, maximum one year from now, a total complete collapse of the United States dollar,
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:47.120]  and the economic system in this country. Prepare yourself for it. I was told by one of the insiders
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:52.880]  themselves that it's going to happen, and you can depend on the fact. Now, Alex, when can I come
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:57.920]  down to the mindset of these people so I can help folks understand why they have all this to do?
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:02.480]  Let's do that in a moment. I first want to flesh out the fact that you said on this show almost
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.920]  seven months ago that it would first start bankrupting things like Dubai, which was supposedly the
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:12.640]  best place to invest in the world. Now the New York Times admits it's imploding. They're stopping
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:18.080]  building. They're going into full bore depression. People are going to the airport and just leaving
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:23.600]  their cars and flying out of the country, the foreign workers. I mean, it's happening here.
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:28.720]  This is a war against everybody. I've had some good old boys email me and go good. Let's bankrupt
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.120]  Venezuela and Russia and the Arabs. No, no, no. This is the banks and the oil companies,
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:36.960]  the same people that own them, bankrupting the world to bring in a world government,
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:42.080]  a world carbon tax total control. And they've now announced it. They've announced Gordon Brown was
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:48.160]  here this week announcing a new world government. I mean, I was listening to Fox radio and on XM
[1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:52.640]  and they were going, I guess people like Alex Jones are right. Imagine I turned on XM last
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:56.720]  night and there's some talk shows going, I guess Alex Jones is right. They're saying it's a world
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:02.240]  government and they're taking over. We were only going off their documents, but please continue.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.720]  Yes, go ahead and get into their mindset. Alex, you're telling everything that these people plan
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:11.760]  to do. You've told it in advance. You've been right on the money every time. People should
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:18.400]  believe every word you're saying. OPEC financial oil ministry met just a few days ago. And after
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:24.160]  that meeting, they made this statement. They said in four months, OPEC, that's the oil producing
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:29.680]  countries of the world, have lost two and one half trillion. You've heard me correct.
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:34.880]  They were heavily leveraged in derivatives as well over extended. Again, bankrupt the middle
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:38.720]  class in Western Europe, the U.S., bankrupt the middle class in Japan, bankrupt the middle
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:44.240]  class in Australia, bankrupt the middle class in Latin America, bankrupt corporations, and then
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:50.160]  government working for the bankers come in then and consolidate everything. Go ahead.
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.160]  They have everything to gain by this. The average person says, oh my goodness,
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.880]  as one person said to me the other day, don't some of these elite live in the United States of
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:03.520]  America? Do they want to destroy their own country? I said, wait a minute, you don't understand their
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.960]  mindset. So this past week, after you've given me the invitation. Yeah, these are conquerors.
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:13.600]  Explain their mindset. Break down their, their conquerors. This is, this is global
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:19.760]  domination that we're using economics as a weapon. Yes. Now, folks, understand, I lived with them
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:26.240]  for three years. I had an active unit to analyze them on their own ground. The name of the game
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.920]  is control. If you remember anything in this program today, please remember that expression.
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:38.720]  The power is greater. The power of these people is greater than the average person can even
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.520]  comprehend. They control presidents, they control the government, they control nations,
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:50.000]  they control currencies, they control the masses. They have the leverage and the power to be able
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:56.160]  to do this. They create a problem and then they create a solution to solve the problem. Now,
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:02.320]  let me begin. 15 years ago, two institutions that were created, remember back on this,
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.800]  two institutions were created to make money available for the real estate loans, Fannie
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:13.600]  and Freddie. 40% of all loans were made by them, guaranteed by the government. They were ordered,
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:20.080]  Fannie and Freddie were, to make loans to anybody. These are loans, interest loans, no interest loans,
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:24.240]  option are more. And the real estate workers were publicly told to falsify the reports and
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.560]  they wouldn't get in trouble. And that's why none of them are because they were told to do it.
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:34.560]  They created the bubble. They knew exactly what they were doing and they also knew exactly when
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:39.200]  they were going to pull the news and that the bubble would burst and the real estate crisis
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:44.720]  would take place. And it all began 15 years ago when they began to create it. Secondly,
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:53.920]  15 years ago, they planned the price of crude oil to go from $30 a barrel to $137 a barrel.
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:16:00.160]  Then they planned it and told me about it, eight months in advance, that it would go from $137
[1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:09.600]  a barrel to $50 a barrel, that gasoline would go from $5, $4 to $5 a gallon to $1.50 to $2 a
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:16.480]  gallon. OPEC oil producing countries had, during the time it was $137 a barrel and stayed there
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:22.960]  for quite a period of time, around 125 to 140. And the OPEC oil producing countries obligated
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:27.920]  themselves for defense contracts. Oh my goodness. They fought on them like you wouldn't believe.
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:32.080]  Energy infrastructure. Stay there. We got a break. We'll come right back, Lindsay, get
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:37.920]  over their mindset. Good day. Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, March 6, 2009. Goal open this

[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:58.240]  has been spending money faster than tax collections. Now the government has published the document that
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.560]  sounds the alarm. That's right, the United States government accountability office, the GAO has
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:07.200]  published the long term fiscal outlook document. Clearly stating that the federal debt burden is
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:12.320]  spiraling out of control. This will directly affect programs like social security to FDIC's
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:17.280]  ability to ensure bank deposits. Taxation and inflationary printing of the US dollar are
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:24.000]  inevitable pressures facing the economy. Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.

[1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:59.600]  You know, someday having your home garden may be against the law.
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:06.000]  And I got articles all over the country. Police want home gardens to be illegal.
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:10.880]  You can't trust prisoners. You think a prisoner's allowed to have a garden?
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:17.760]  But they're doing it because they want to help you.
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:24.640]  Sun down on the union. Sun down on the union.
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.520]  Tulsa City Council questions people being allowed to have their own gardens.
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:37.760]  He says they may grow weed. You're all prisoners until you say, no, I'm not a prisoner. We need
[1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:41.760]  a jailbreak here. Defeat the New World Order. Lindsey, I want to go to calls in the last 30
[1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:45.200]  minutes of the show. So we're going to come back and also tell folks about some of the
[1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:50.240]  documentaries you've done. But right now, yeah, it blits through. You were getting how they set
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.480]  the world up in this big Ponzi scheme to blow it out and then bring world government out of it.
[1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:59.760]  And then the mindset of these people. Go ahead. What we're talking about is not a conspiracy.
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:04.880]  This is an agenda. They had it planned in advance. They knew everything they were going to do.
[1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:10.960]  I heard them talking about a 30-year plan 35 years ago when I lived with the elite on the
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:16.160]  trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Today, I am seeing them fulfill everything they have told me over
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:21.520]  these past 35 years they were going to do. They planned the real estate crisis. They planned
[1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:27.120]  the price of gasoline to go to a dollar and fifty to two dollars a gallon for gas pump.
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:32.560]  They had the states, the United States government and the states of America to obligate themselves
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:37.920]  for every kind of project imaginable and put in every kind of agency imaginable based on the
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:42.880]  taxes that they were going to receive as a result of the booming economy that had been
[1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:46.640]  artificially created. And even though it's imploding, they just keep expanding government
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:51.280]  everywhere. Yes, and they've done all of this intentionally. Okay, 15 years ago,
[1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:56.320]  they planned the price of crude oil to go to $137 a barrel. They did it gradually.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:00.240]  Then they let all the OPEC, that's the oil producing nations of the world,
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:05.200]  to believe that it was going to stay there so they obligated themselves for defense.
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:10.960]  Every kind of infrastructure project imaginable, every kind of debt and obligation, long term
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:17.600]  that you could imagine, they got them in that debt intentionally in order to be able to bankrupt
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:22.640]  them. The only way you can get a person bankrupted is to put them in debt. They took the price there
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:27.520]  so that they could bring it to $50 a barrel. They told me eight months in advance that they
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:33.360]  were going to do it. Dubai started to build that beautiful five-star city. Venezuela got into every
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:39.360]  kind of trouble imaginable. And now Mr. Chavez is just about to be ousted because his people think
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:45.360]  he was the one did it. He was not the one that did it. The elitist did it to him. Nigeria is in
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:51.760]  trouble. The Arabs are in trouble. China, oh my goodness. Russia. You say, wait a minute,
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:57.120]  the elite don't control China? Yes, they do, folks. Please believe me. The Rockefellers
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.560]  sent George Herbert Walker Bush there in 75 to start the one child policy in a State Department
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:08.240]  treaty for money. They control the world. They control China. They control Russia. They control
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:12.480]  the Arab world. They control the United States of America. They dictate to Congress what bills to
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:20.080]  pass. They put in, oh my goodness, okay, China. They let China believe that the economy of America
[1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:24.560]  was going to continue the way it was going in the rest of the world. Now, today, they have almost
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:30.640]  bankrupted them. China has 70,000 Chinese factories that have closed in the past five months. 28 to
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:35.840]  30 million Chinese are out of work. They came from the farms into the city, and you're going to see
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:40.640]  riots in China like you've never heard off Russia. And then the IMF documents state that once the
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:45.760]  riot starts, that lets the establishment bring in martial law, and then the people are actually
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:53.360]  asking for it. Yes. And so in Russia, they've devalued the ruble eight times. Why? Because the
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:59.600]  elite of the world took crude oil to the price they did, then crashed it to the price they've
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  never thought they'd take it down to $33 a barrel, Alex. But they have. He told me $50 a barrel.
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:11.120]  I was amazed when they took it to $33. They really want to get on with this project. And so Russia
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.720]  is in trouble. 15 years ago, they created derivatives. Oh, folks, if you've never heard about derivatives,
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:21.520]  please, I beg of you, you've got to know what a derivative is. It's not the subprime mortgages.
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:25.920]  That's the cover. That's why they didn't spend the bailout money on that. It's these made-up
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.960]  instruments that they raided as pure gold cash. They use it to buy up the world. Then they pop
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.920]  the Ponzi scheme. They have all the real assets and buy up the planet. And every bit of this was
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:40.160]  created in advance. They created the real estate problem. They created the fuel problem. Well,
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:45.040]  it's Obama's, I mean, Bush was involved, and Clinton was involved, but it's Obama's entire team.
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.920]  Ruben and Summers and the rest of them are the very people that made the changes and got rid
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:56.320]  of the Glass-Steagall Act and others. And every bit of this, folks, it is not happening by chance.
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:02.160]  Oh, I plead with you to believe everything you're hearing Alex Jones say. The elite of the world
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:07.440]  created the real estate crisis. The elite of the world created the banking crisis. The elite of
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:13.120]  the world created the small business crisis. And you haven't seen anything yet. Unemployment,
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:19.200]  didn't just happen not on your life. Every bit of this is, and you are going to see,
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.600]  I'm going to read it to you one more time. This individual who knows everything that goes on
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:29.280]  behind closed doors told me eight months ago, and I broke it on Alex Jones' show on July the 28th
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:34.640]  before it ever happened. He said, America, we'll see a financial collapse that will be so great
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:41.040]  that it will take years, not months, as Obama says, years to come out of it. They are creating a
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:46.800]  depression. I was told it eight months in advance and had the privilege of saying it on this show,
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:52.800]  oil to $50 a barrel, bankrupt OPEC. Now finish up with their mindset, though.
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:00.400]  Finish up with their mindset. Their mindset is control. Control. That it's not necessarily money.
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:04.960]  Some people think, oh, these people. If you've got the control, then I mean, you print the money,
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:11.280]  but go ahead. Yeah, look, Mussolini, Stalin, it's the identical same mindset that they had
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:18.400]  is the mindset. They'll be elite. The elite have made you to believe that the United States
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:25.600]  Treasury must bail out the banks. They had to do this. It was all a part of you paying for the
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:31.120]  elite playing on the house to put it. No, no, no. I mean, they admit they're setting up a new bank
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.160]  of the world, called a new world order that you will pay carbon taxes to hundreds of new taxes,
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:41.840]  everything you do organized and run by them, or they won't turn the economy back on when they're
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:45.840]  the very people that engineered the implosion. I mean, even the Financial Times of London admits
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:49.360]  this. When we come back, I'm going to play a quick clip of George Soros admitting they're using oil
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.400]  as a weapon, but please continue. Yeah, they made you believe that the Bank of America had to be
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:28:01.280]  bailed out. In order to do it, they created the real estate crisis. Then with all of these derivatives
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:06.160]  that were out there, the banks of America were in trouble. They told you as a taxpayer, oh, you've
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:11.120]  got to bail them out. If you don't, we're going to have another depression. Well, you're going to
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:16.640]  have another depression anyway, whether to bail them out or not. Did you realize that you, the
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:22.240]  American taxpayer, had paid the bills for the elite by bailing out the banks of the United
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:27.920]  States of America and GM and Chrysler? Well, it was a setup. I mean, they mean to bankrupt GM
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:32.480]  and Chrysler and move them to Brazil in places with the bailout money. But I mean, the banks
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:35.840]  are bragging that they're keeping the money to buy up other banks and insurance companies. It's
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:41.040]  a total scam. Now, folks, you've got to believe this because I told it on Alex Jones' show on
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:47.360]  July the 28th, not because Lindsey Williams had the knowledge of this. Lindsey, Lindsey, I had you
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:53.440]  on because I got the exact same info two years before that at Bilderberg. That's why I knew,
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:56.960]  plus you've been accurate in the past. I mean, we're going off with the globalists saying,
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:00.320]  dude, I mean, I got arrested going up there trying to cover it. You know, we go through
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:06.160]  hell in high water to bring people this information. Let me give you an example that maybe would come
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:10.160]  down to home because I know some of you sitting out there right now still mind boggle to say,
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:14.400]  can this guy possibly know what he's talking about? Okay, let's take a simple thing like your
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:19.920]  house mortgage. All right, you buy a house, you take it on a 30-year mortgage, you go down and
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:24.960]  get a loan, and that loan is guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. All of a sudden, you paid on the
[1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:30.000]  house for 15 years, and the financial crash comes like we're having. Stay there. Let's cover it,
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.960]  when we get back. Stay there. George Soros, straight ahead with Lindsey.

[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:48.320]  more. We are the GCN Radio Network. You know it's so frustrating reading U.N. documents,
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:55.840]  rank corporation documents, Pentagon documents, linking to them on infowars.com. State Department
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:58.800]  of Environment 200 where they say they want to get rid of the majority of the people on the planet
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:03.840]  and to know it's real, to know it's happening and just keep warning people and warning folks.
[1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:08.400]  And yeah, tens of millions worldwide listen, but it isn't enough. And more people are listening
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.720]  every day and finding out we're telling the truth. But it's scary to admit the truth. All I can
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.200]  tell you listeners is we're in a lot of trouble. But what the leader doing is so over the top,
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:21.520]  so criminal, that if we just speak up and stand up and say no, we can beat him. We're going to go
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:25.040]  to your phone calls here in a few minutes. I went to Lindsay to finish up with a story he was
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:31.760]  telling about your house mortgage as a parable or an example. But first I wanted to play this
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:37.760]  brief clip of George Soros. It's up on YouTube. It's from the Davos Globalist Switzerland meeting
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.560]  Economic Forum a few weeks ago where he's being interviewed on international television. He admits
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:46.160]  that oil is being used as a weapon and that it's destroying all these different economies.
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.920]  Now the clip's long. We're just playing a clip of it. You can just Google George Soros admits
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:58.000]  oil as a weapon and watch the whole clip. But here it is. Bursting. However, it's not all bad news
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:04.080]  because the major oil producing countries have been the enemies of the prevailing world order.
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:15.200]  Venezuela, Iran, Russia. And it's not so easy to finance a Bolivarian revolution with $40 oil.
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:23.520]  So I think Venezuela is Chavez. Probably his days are numbered. And in Iran, I think that
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:30.240]  he's not going to last a year. Maybe wrong. But I mean, he's under considerable duress
[1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:38.880]  and his influence is going to decline. In Iran, Ahmadinejad is up for elections in 1909.
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:49.360]  And unless he can provoke some incident, I think that he's liable to also be defeated and you may
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:36:04.320]  have a more reasonable regime. Now, Russia is more troubling because Putin has been using oil
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:09.040]  for a number of reasons. All right, let's stop right there. You can go watch the whole clip if
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:14.480]  you want. But you know, oh, these countries are going against the new world order. And so they've
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:19.520]  got to be dealt with. But remember, it's going to kill you as well, because these countries can't buy
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:24.880]  our T bills. They can't prop up the debt anymore. This is the bankers going out and badmouthing the
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:30.400]  world economy, saying we're in a depression to artificially implode it so they can consolidate.
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:35.840]  That's the banker game. It's now in congressional testimony that the banks engineered the 1929
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.880]  crash. Lindsey Williams, please continue. The person told me back eight months ago,
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:44.640]  and you remember me saying this on your show, Alex, he just brought, was brought to my mind
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:50.960]  about what George Soros just said. Iran, he said to me right at the time that everybody was predicting,
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:56.160]  even I was saying, we don't have a war with Iran. America, Israel, somebody's going to invade them.
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.760]  No. This individual said to me, we do not want to go to war with Iran. I said, what's going on?
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:05.360]  No, you said that on air almost seven months ago. You were right. You said, no, they're going to
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:10.720]  bankrupt them with oil. Go ahead. Yeah, he said, oil, we're going to bankrupt them. That's exactly
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:15.440]  what George Soros just said eight months later. And I was told it by one of the people who knows
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:19.520]  everything that goes on behind closed. Okay, go back to your house. There's so much to say,
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:23.520]  Alec, I'm having to talk as fast as I can. I know we're running out. Okay, your house,
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:28.160]  30-year mortgage, you pay on it for 15 years. All of a sudden you have a financial crash like
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:32.240]  we're having right now. You haven't seen anything yet. You think this is bad. You wait till six
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:37.280]  to nine months from now, folks. And it's not going to stop until we arrest the bankers. It's not
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:42.400]  going to stop until we take our country back. You're exactly right. And it's going to be programs
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:48.240]  like yours that see it bought back because the only thing that these people fear is the masses
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:52.400]  waking up and that's what you're doing for them. Alec, okay, 30-year mortgage, you pay on it for
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:57.120]  15 years. What did that banker give you when you bought that house? They gave you a piece of paper.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:01.840]  They did not give you gold or silver. They gave you no tangible objects whatsoever. They paid no
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:07.200]  collateral, but you did and you gave them that house as collateral. Okay, you pay on it 15 years,
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.320]  you have a crash, lose your job. All of a sudden you can't pay on your house. After three months of
[1:38:12.320 --> 1:38:16.000]  you being behind on your mortgage, they're coming and repossess. What do they give you back to that
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.960]  house? Nothing. Positively, nothing. But you've paid them for 15 years for that house. You have
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:28.160]  paid the elite through the banks and now owned by them because the Treasury has bailed them out
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:32.800]  and totally controls them. And they have everything to gain by getting that house back
[1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:37.360]  because they pay you nothing for it when they take it back. Did the baby boomers think the elite
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:41.680]  were really going to let them have all this money they put into 401k? Obama's getting rid of all
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:48.880]  these 401k rules, mortgage, tax deduction rules. They want you bankrupted. They're cold-blooded.
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:55.440]  They financed Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. Finish up, Lindsey. The elite will own. Please, folks,
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:00.560]  listen to me. The elite will own the banks of America when all this is over. They will own
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:05.520]  the majority of the real estate of the United States of America because when you can't make your
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:08.960]  house payment, they come and get it back. And they're going to use high taxes to drive everybody
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:13.120]  else out of their houses. They don't want to help the economy. They want to wreck it.
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:19.200]  Well, sure, it's their advantage to do that. We have all their banking association documents.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:24.160]  It's incredible. They're criminals. In fact, stop there. And then I want to plug your DVD for folks
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:29.200]  and go to calls because this is too important. The banks of America get that real estate back.
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:33.360]  And who is it that owns the banks of America now because the Treasury bailed them out?
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:40.480]  Your great-great-grandchildren paid for the elite to get your house after you paid for it for 15
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:46.320]  years and put you out on the street. And now that bank has them, the nations of the world.
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:50.560]  Stop right there. Stop right there. But to buy up real assets, they cut off liquidity of the
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:56.320]  real economy worldwide, crash the world to destroy the economy. And then 9.7 trillion later,
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:00.880]  the banker bailout was really a banker takeover, Congress says, where's the money?
[1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:03.520]  And they're told, we're not going to tell you. And then the head of the private
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:08.400]  Federal Reserve lies and says it's on our website. Senator Sanders says, no, it's not.
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:11.840]  And then the head of the Fed admits, we're not going to tell you where the money is.
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:18.160]  Bloomberg headline, Fed refuses to release bank data insist on secrecy. Here is that clip.
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:24.720]  That's absolutely extraordinary that I wrote you a letter and I said, hey,
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:33.120]  who'd you lend the money to? What were the terms of those loans? How can my constituents in Vermont
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.600]  get some of that money? Who makes the decisions? Do you guys sit around in a room? Do you make it?
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:44.320]  Are there conflicts of interest? So my question to you is, will you tell the American people
[1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:51.440]  to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars? Will you tell us who got that money and what
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:56.720]  the terms are of those agreements? We explain each of our programs. In terms of the terms,
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.400]  we explain the terms exactly. We explain what the collateral requirements are. We explain what
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.560]  the funds are. To whom did you explain that? It's on our website. Yeah, okay. So all that
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:09.280]  information is available in our commercial paper. And who got the money? Hundreds and hundreds of
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:14.960]  banks. Any bank that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve's discounts. You tell us who they are?
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:21.360]  No, because the reason that is counterproductive and will destroy the value of the program is that
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:26.080]  banks will not come to this. Isn't that too bad? Sorry. In other words, isn't that too bad? They
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:29.760]  took the money, but they don't want to be public about the fact that they received it. We heard
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:33.200]  a whole lot about AIG. They're on the front page. These are very... Now, I got banks and I have
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:37.200]  businesses in the state of Vermont who are in a lot of trouble. Not banks. Our banks, by the way,
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.600]  doing pretty well. Now, how do these guys who are honest business people get it? Do you have to be
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:47.760]  a large, greedy, reckless financial institution to apply for these monies? There is no subsidy.
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:52.800]  There is no capital involved. There is no gift involved. It is a collateralized short-term liquid
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:58.080]  loan that is both over-collateralized and is recourse to the company itself. We have never
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:06.800]  lost a penny doing it. And how can other institutions get those loans as well? That's
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:11.920]  enough. According to all lies, you're paying for it all with interest. The private bank's loan back
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:17.200]  in the $787 million stimulus package, really the federalization package of the states,
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:22.480]  they loaned it back at interest to the American people. It's all secret. And you heard Bernanke
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.200]  there to U.S. senators saying, you don't get to know and the Federal Reserve is private.
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:32.000]  It's only going to get worse until you recognize who the criminals are. And the private banks
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.520]  admit they have Northcom and the military standing by, threatening Congress with martial law
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.280]  if they don't follow orders and that the president is a dictator. Lindsey Williams.
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:47.120]  Well, Alex, this is the mindset of the elite. You have done a masterful job of presenting it to
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:51.760]  the folks out in your listening audience today. And folks that listen, hey, here's the latest.
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.080]  And this is final. I'm going to stop with this and then go on to whatever Alex wants to do
[1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:01.120]  in the rest of the program. We've got so much more to give, but the Treasury of the United
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:06.400]  States must sell. Now, this is as far as Friday. This week, the Treasury of the United States
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:16.320]  must sell $450 billion of T-bills a month to fund the new debt this year through September the 30th.
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:22.320]  While the bankers are bankrupting other nations, so they can't buy it. Iceland, Latvia, Eastern
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:26.400]  Europe, all of them are about to go on to Iceland. Latvia is already going on. When Eastern Europe
[1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:29.600]  goes on, it's going to bring a total collapse of the American dollar. Stay there, Lindsey.
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:33.360]  Got a break. Got a break. Come back. Final calls with Lindsey Williams. Stay with us.
[1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:38.640]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:44.400]  may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.520]  drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:54.640]  something is wrong. Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:44:00.720]  people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:37.680]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people. Unemployment is the highest it's been
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:43.840]  in over 30 years. Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up. Everyone needs
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:49.600]  something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.

[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:48.080]  Look, I know I usually take more calls on the Sunday show. We haven't done that. They'll be all over
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:51.600]  the map. We're going to go to them here in just a few minutes. And I want to thank
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:57.360]  Valencia Williams for joining us. I do want to put out a program note here. My film,
[1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:01.440]  The Obama Deception, showing what the bankers are really doing, how they're engineering this,
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:04.880]  how he's their puppet just like Bush was. But to betray the people, how they're
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:11.360]  bringing in the gun control, the FEMA camps, it's going to be out now in just about seven days.
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:17.920]  You can pre-order the DVD right now at infowars.com. It'll also be up in high quality next Sunday
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:21.520]  night at the end of the show. It will be the premiere. 6 p.m. central. It will go live at
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:27.200]  prismplanet.tv for prismplanet.tv members. There's going to be a DivEx copy up there in high quality
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:33.840]  to download and burn the DVD for activism. So the obamadeception.net or infowars.com,
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:36.800]  get involved in the fight today. We got to expose this puppet for what he is.
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:42.560]  Lindsay, speaking of films, every week now you do a DVD update, breaking down what's happening.
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:46.240]  You go into a lot more detail than you've been able to here on air with me button in and add and
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:55.200]  stuff. Give folks that toll-free number who want to call and get that. Toll-free number 800-321-2900.
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:01.040]  Would you like to know everything that the elite told me that's planned for you for the next one
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:08.960]  year? It's two DVDs. That's correct. You watch them on your television. Two CDs, over five hours of
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:17.520]  viewing and listening either in your automobile or at home on your TV. 800-321-2900. You've
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:22.160]  got to know about the Baltic Cry Index. I plead with you. Let me tell you what Vita Lock told me
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:26.640]  in southeast Colorado last weekend. Folks, you don't have to... The farmers are going to be like us.
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:34.240]  800-321-2900. Now, now I operators have been busy all week long. They were so tired they almost
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:39.920]  collapsed on Friday. I persuaded two of them to be on the lines this afternoon. That's right. Right
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.960]  now, you can call this number. I begged them to be on on Sunday afternoon. Give them the number.
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:52.960]  Give them the number. We're going to get a call. 800-321-2900. Two DVDs, two CDs. Get them. I beg
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:57.840]  of you. And white people up. These are key tools. Thank you, Lindsay. Let's go. By the way, they're
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:01.760]  not copyrighted. You can copy these and give them. Everybody want to give them to. Just get the message
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:06.720]  out. All right. Let's jam in as many calls as we can. Nathan and St. Louis. God bless you,
[1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:11.520]  Alex and Lindsay, from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1 St. Louis. Sir,
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:16.720]  your phone's really bad. Go ahead and make your point. Sorry. Okay, Alex. What is your opinion
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:21.600]  on the rumor that Hillary Clinton signed an agreement with China that granted eminent domain
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:26.960]  as collateral for U.S. debt? And Lindsay, how does that go against or play into Big Oil's
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:32.240]  New World Order agenda? Okay. It's not a rumor. Under the IMF and World Bank plan,
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.960]  big companies that have bought T-bills, our infrastructure is pledged. The particular
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:41.600]  website that put it out that there was a specific deal with China, that guy's disinfo,
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:46.560]  and it's meant to discredit the serious story. Lindsay? We had to do something in order to get
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:51.120]  China to buy our T-bills. Anything. Because the Federal Reserve two weeks ago said,
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:54.400]  we're going to start buying American T-bills. I've never done it in the history of the United
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:59.440]  States of America because they knew that the dollar was about to collapse. You're right,
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:04.720]  Alex. It has to be. All right. And again, I'm going to people quick. Thank you for the call,
[1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:08.800]  sir. We appreciate you as well. Mark in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Mark, welcome.
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:13.280]  Hey, Alex and Lindsay. Thanks both you guys for everything you're doing. I'll try to make this
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:18.640]  quick. I was thinking about the whole vaccination scandal that's going on recently.
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:26.000]  And I remembered how sometimes in Hollywood and such, they'll years ahead of time to
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:32.800]  subconsciously acclimate the people to a certain scenario. They'll put things out ahead of time
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:37.040]  and then years later, you'll look back and go, oh, that was a plot of a movie or whatever.
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:44.160]  Mission Impossible 2 was actually the basic idea of what was going on here this last week
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:50.080]  with the vaccine situation. It was viruses combined into a super virus that makes it more
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:58.080]  easily transferable among humans in creating a pandemic. And then a pharmaceutical company can
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:05.280]  therefore cash in on the mass needs for the end. And one of the issues I've got going on is I think
[1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:09.920]  the phone problem is on our end. So who's I'm going to have you take these calls from in there
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:15.200]  for some reason problem with the phone box in here. You want to comment on stage terror,
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:20.640]  stage biological weapons releases by the elite? I beg of you, my eight DVD set,
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:25.280]  which I didn't talk about a moment ago, one of them is entitled vaccinations and deals with
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:34.080]  the problem this gentleman just called in about again. I beg of you, 800-321-2900 and one of the
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:39.520]  DVDs on my big eight pack concerns that Alex. Well, I mean, it came out that they were trying
[1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:44.480]  to mix bird flu and with vaccines this week. I mean, it's just you can't make this stuff up.
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:48.320]  It's just too insane. Let's go to JD and Hollywood. JD, you're on the air.
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:56.800]  I'm calling you from the brainwash capital, but I'm a Canadian. It's nice out today. I can't see
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:05.040]  any chemtrails. So I guess even on the seventh day, the soft killers need to rest. I like your story
[1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:11.520]  about the carpet cleaner. If I were you, I would have told them that he missed the spot underneath
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:23.120]  the gun rack. Anyway, I have a question for you about this article in Reuters was the headline is
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:30.160]  Obama to sign stem cells order on Monday. That's right. That was in my style. It can be used for
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:35.840]  good, you know, but you know that's not their intention. Yeah, let me comment on that. Let me
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:39.680]  comment on that briefly and I appreciate your call. We got to move quicker. Callers, I apologize for
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:44.640]  that. That's in my stack. I never got to it, but I will now since you brought it up. There's no
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:50.800]  debate. They can use skin sales. They can use your own cells just as good. It's a cover story.
[1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:55.200]  And if you read the fine print, it's there. It isn't about stem cells. It's about being able to
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:54:00.800]  use fetuses and embryos in genetic experiments. That's what is being legalized. Pastor Williams.
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:05.520]  Yes, that's exactly right. And it is immoral to the core and unbiblical.
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:09.440]  All right, let's talk to Josh in North Carolina. Josh, you're on the air.
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:17.280]  Welcome, Josh. You guys doing good. Hey guys, how are you all doing? Fine. So I have something of
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:25.760]  dire importance here. While the story on avian flu broke, it was brought to the attention of many
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  of the readers, the prison planet forum, that we have also uncovered several of the moderators,
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:36.480]  anti-illuminati and saints specifically have come up with a lot of the evidence to back this up,
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:45.200]  that there is a plan in place to stage a false flag terror event to bring in internet too.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:51.200]  Yes, they're going to attack the internet. The Pentagon is to shut it down and force us to
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:55.840]  internet too, where the New York Times admits we will have no freedom and infowars.com and other
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:03.520]  sites will be gone. Exactly. And the scale of this attack is far beyond anything else.
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:08.720]  But we found some of the documents that talk about discussing this.
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:13.120]  Yeah, the elite have to false flag their own internet because we're killing the mainstream
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:17.760]  media. And in fact, the great writers on the side, I've seen the material they put together on the
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:22.960]  prison planet forum, they should write articles and then submit them to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:30.000]  for posting on the main site. Okay. Just to bring up a very dire point that's brought up here,
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:38.240]  this recent false flag about Marine One is completely utterly bold. Yeah, they're claiming
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:42.240]  somebody got into the Pentagon online and got the specs from Marine One, so they've got to ban
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.720]  the internet because somebody got the specs from Marine One when the government's own computers
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:53.680]  are on separate nets that aren't even on the web. Exactly. Having worked in big IT as well as
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:58.480]  done some government projects myself, I can wholeheartedly vouch that it is impossible for that
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:05.920]  to occur unless they let it occur intentionally. But to sum up basically something that is very
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:11.600]  important here, by their own documents, they were saying that the type of attack that they are
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:17.040]  staging is so widespread that it could not only affect computers, but almost any device
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:23.520]  plugged to the power grids and conceivably try they can deliver viruses over power cords
[1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:28.960]  because they have systems where they can deliver internet commands and things over the internet
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:34.240]  itself data transmission. Look, precisely, I have an uncle in law who actually worked at one of the
[1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:39.840]  university universities here in North Carolina who helped pioneer that technology back in the
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:44.240]  sixties and seventies. We're out of time. I'm sorry to Mercedes, Chris, Chris and many others
[1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:47.760]  that are holding. In closing, Lindsay Williams, they're openly announcing they're going to shut
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.400]  down the old web, force us on to a new web. They've got to do it because we're exposing
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:57.440]  their criminal activities. Comments on that? You're exactly right, Alex. And folks, I plead with
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:02.480]  you, set your spiritual house in order. You don't have any time left to play around with what you
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:07.440]  do with Jesus Christ in the Bible. Listen to everything Alex Jones says every day and don't
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:12.400]  you miss a single one of his programs because 24 hours could make the difference in you knowing
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:16.320]  whether it's going to be your dinner table with food on it or not. Lindsay, Lindsay, since you
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:21.600]  brought that up, it's come out in the news that 26,000 preachers, 50,000 executives are on secret
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:26.400]  FEMA payroll. We got the secret documents years ago. Now it's mainstream news. They announced
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:30.480]  it like it's no big deal. The preachers, most of them are paid off to tell their flocks to go to
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:35.440]  FEMA camps, turn in their guns, take force inoculations. Is that biblical or is that of the
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:40.560]  New World Order? That's of the New World Order. Don't you dare let them get hold of any information
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:44.640]  about you. I was in a church the other day and I wanted to walk out. They wanted every
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:48.720]  information imaginable and they said they wanted it for their files. I know exactly what they're
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:54.720]  doing with it. Turn it into FEMA. Folks, be careful of your local church. I'm a preacher of 50 years.
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:58:00.480]  Believe me, you must set your spiritual house in order according to the scriptures, not according
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.120]  to your local pastor. That's right. The New World Order is making its move. They've got their
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:11.760]  secret police in place everywhere, but the sleeping giant is awakened. It is rising. We will defeat
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.480]  the New World Order with God's help. Lindsay Williams, Godspeed, thank you so much for joining us on
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:22.080]  this important transmission. We're out of time. Retransmission starts now at infowars.com.
