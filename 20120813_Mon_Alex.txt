[01:18.400 --> 01:22.440]  people are the enemy because foreign bankers have hijacked the country and
[01:22.440 --> 01:26.520]  they're trying to turn the military and police into globalist collaborators
[01:26.520 --> 01:34.240]  similar to the Vichy French and tyranny is the norm worldwide it's happening now
[01:34.240 --> 01:42.440]  in fact coming up Asia times Al Qaeda flags fly over rebel held Syria boom

[03:57.720 --> 04:02.280]  DHS won't explain its purchase of 450 million rounds of 40 cal that's their
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.320]  standard sidearm they're arming every agency you can imagine so let's be clear
[04:07.320 --> 04:13.640]  250 million rounds last year 450 million they bought a few months ago and now
[04:13.640 --> 04:28.720]  750 million how many is that that's 1,400 million so that's what is that 1.4
[04:28.720 --> 04:38.160]  billion 1.4 billion rounds of ammo for the American people I mean these are

[08:24.760 --> 08:29.240]  color creed religion worldwide thank you so much for joining us on this Monday
[08:29.240 --> 08:38.440]  edition the 13th day of August 2012 we are about to launch into the incredible
[08:38.440 --> 08:44.560]  news and believe me there is a lot of it the federal government and the
[08:44.560 --> 08:49.600]  governments of Europe are openly under the control of a banking mafia cartel
[08:49.600 --> 08:55.120]  that brags in hundreds of publications per month and on television that they
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.440]  have conquered us they have now entered into an acclimation phase of
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.320]  flaunting it as criminals like to do in everyone's face so they've now gone to
[09:05.320 --> 09:09.960]  the criminal flaunting stage which criminals always do they always tell
[09:09.960 --> 09:16.200]  on themselves they always bragging nauseam it is part of the screwed up
[09:16.200 --> 09:20.040]  mindset of these people throughout history humans only live on average about
[09:20.040 --> 09:25.000]  75 years we never seem to learn from the past we go through these cycles over
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.400]  and over again but here is the news last year 250 million rounds of hollow point
[09:31.400 --> 09:36.160]  40 that's been the main sidearm for more than a decade of all the federal
[09:36.160 --> 09:39.480]  forces that means globalist collaborators not saying everybody in the
[09:39.480 --> 09:42.720]  federal government's evil but you are run by foreign banks now so you are
[09:42.720 --> 09:46.400]  collaborators sure there were Vici French that worked with Hitler who didn't
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.880]  like him did it out of cowardice did it out of careerism it doesn't matter you
[09:49.880 --> 09:54.360]  are helping occupiers of this country who are very nasty we are occupied
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.640]  you are collaborators let's just get that straight you do work for criminals
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.240]  mentally ill criminals they look at fast and furious look at the head of
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.520]  Homeland Security in New York about Janet Napolitano and her her gal pals
[10:08.520 --> 10:14.280]  ruling everyone and doing psychopathic stuff I can't even mention on air just
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.080]  absolutely mentally ill well of course they're mentally ill that's what that's
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.960]  what these type of terrorists are like and if we won't call them what they are
[10:21.960 --> 10:29.760]  it's over tyranny in history is around 99 plus percent of the time there have
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.320]  been less than ten times in world history most historians agree about seven or
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.200]  eight you can debate it where you've had a free society to some extent out of
[10:38.200 --> 10:44.040]  thousands of different civilizations that have come and gone say thousands
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.600]  yeah there's probably been 25 different permutations the last 3,000 years and
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.680]  what is Rome and Italy today there have been hundreds of permutations in what
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.720]  are the Greek Islands there have been hundreds of permutations in what is
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.400]  Central Asia and Iran hundreds of different permutations in Mesoamerica
[11:02.400 --> 11:10.400]  and the norm is vicious aggressive ruling classes that are like cancer
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.080]  they're programmed to take it all they're programmed to take over the body
[11:15.080 --> 11:21.000]  politic and they're programmed to exercise power to the point of the
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.520]  reason when Cortez showed up in less than 200 men on horseback the reason they
[11:25.520 --> 11:33.520]  could fight tens of thousands of the Mesoamericans and Montezuma was because
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.440]  disease wiped a lot of them out but but more importantly they had already in
[11:38.440 --> 11:44.200]  some cases on special holidays demanded that in some cases 10% of the
[11:44.200 --> 11:47.760]  population be killed and that they would kill tens of thousands a day
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.200]  sometimes and so they just and they would kill the strongest on those
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.120]  holidays they would kill the winners of the different sporting events they have
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.320]  their own Olympics and you would fight to be able to be killed people were so
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.120]  brainwashed they wanted to be killed that's mind control just with culture
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.000]  and it's the same thing I've studied history let me tell you something the
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  people we've got running things are the most crazy wicked twisted devils I've
[12:17.000 --> 12:26.000]  ever seen the globalist plan that's public by the way is so horrific that
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.080]  one cannot even be told about it one has to research it and read their own
[12:29.080 --> 12:37.280]  writings it is so vicious now that said here's the deal and everybody police
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.200]  military all of you the general public radio talk show hosts people that write
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.960]  in the news all of you have to decide what side you're on no one is covering
[12:47.960 --> 12:52.440]  this but a few newspapers alternative media the government documents are all
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.120]  public the drudge report info wars dot com prison planet dot com dot report
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.560]  dot com things like that the mainline talk show hosts are not covering it even
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.600]  though it's all public army documents that they admit are theirs for re-
[13:07.600 --> 13:13.480]  education camps for collapse of society for total gun confiscation for taking
[13:13.480 --> 13:18.160]  open over local police departments and they're going operational is the issue
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.280]  massive funding massive buildup people say oh well they had this on the books
[13:22.280 --> 13:26.640]  in the 1980s with Rex 84 well yeah they had an Eisenhower's time and that's why
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.720]  he wanted the military industrial complex and killed the program early in
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.840]  1961 right before he left office so so this has been a long-term plan and in
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.080]  every case in history from Rome to Nigeria or Mexico today you worry about
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.000]  the military taking over that is criminal interest using the military to
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.280]  take over that's always the big threat to a sovereign or free society that's why
[13:50.280 --> 13:54.920]  again in ancient Rome you couldn't bring the military into Italy was really a
[13:54.920 --> 14:00.840]  province of the Roman city-state wasn't even a country you couldn't bring them
[14:00.840 --> 14:07.400]  out of Austria or out of areas north of there with Switzerland today you
[14:07.400 --> 14:11.440]  couldn't bring the military in why because the because the top general with
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.000]  the military would just take over they'd seen that in every other country that
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.160]  they dealt with so this is what we're dealing with now foreign banks have
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.760]  gotten all the major regulatory positions most the people in Congress or
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.720]  their agents they've gotten federal and globalized training of the police and
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.440]  military and they are the number one US military action in the world and gear
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.480]  up dwarfing pretty much all the other operations combined is a giant sustained
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.320]  covert buildup for absolute war with the American people that the system plans
[14:45.320 --> 14:50.000]  to start and no matter what it takes you turn your guns in they'll start grabbing
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.880]  your kids that it is meant to elicit a response the entire homeland security
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.280]  system was set up in the beginning to be for the American people and to dissolve
[15:02.280 --> 15:11.280]  the Republic homeland security is homeland insecurity it's the Department of
[15:11.280 --> 15:26.240]  Homeland destruction it is the Department of Homeland takeover and this is
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.520]  what we're dealing with now now so let me just cover some of the news here that's
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.120]  that's got me having to catch my breath the so-called federal government
[15:34.120 --> 15:41.280]  openly run by foreign banks got 250 million rounds of hollow point 40 caliber
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.000]  general issue ammo just an off-the-chart giant order then a few months ago they
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.240]  ordered 450 million rounds we have United Press International Associated Press
[15:50.240 --> 15:54.120]  on this Paul Watson's got a big article breaking the whole thing down today
[15:54.120 --> 16:05.520]  they've announced the order for 750 million more rounds of ammo that is 1.4
[16:05.520 --> 16:15.320]  billion 1.4 billion what is that there's there's 312 million people in the US so
[16:15.320 --> 16:19.800]  what is that four bullets for each person more than four bullets for every man
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.000]  woman and child in this country I looked at past orders the feds would order
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.240]  a half million rounds of ammo at a time for DHS I mean I mean how many of them
[16:29.240 --> 16:33.600]  are really shooting their guns or even practicing this is a this is a seismic
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.240]  digging in build-up level this is what you order if you plan to make things go
[16:38.240 --> 16:44.720]  road warrior and fully collapse into armored government fortress mode all the
[16:44.720 --> 16:47.560]  rest of us run around out here and things collapse and I'm telling you that's
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.560]  one of the main plans they've got is just turn things off Paul Joseph Watson
[16:51.560 --> 16:55.680]  this article should be red-linked but it's a four-story down on info wars.com
[16:55.680 --> 17:02.840]  DHS to purchase another 750 million rounds of ammo second massive ammunition
[17:02.840 --> 17:07.120]  by this year fuels fears of civil unrest gee you think when they're buying
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.480]  hundreds of armored mobile pill boxes for the highways trade armored build
[17:11.480 --> 17:17.920]  armored checkpoint facilities giant black armored vehicles being delivered to
[17:17.920 --> 17:21.200]  police departments with homeland security on the side with gun turrets on the
[17:21.200 --> 17:27.280]  top gun boats for the lakes and rivers with big twin machine gun mounts on the
[17:27.280 --> 17:33.720]  top your money 30,000 drones arming police drones federal training military
[17:33.720 --> 17:38.120]  doing checkpoints everywhere Marines doing DWI checkpoints in the middle of
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.760]  you know major cities all of this to acclimate you training the entire
[17:43.760 --> 17:48.560]  military for riot control Reuters reporting big banks have been told to
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.640]  prepare for collapsed you know during a federal collapse for them to not collapse
[17:52.640 --> 17:56.520]  exclusive US banks told to make plans for preventing collapse it wasn't
[17:56.520 --> 18:00.280]  exclusive that came out two years ago but the point is that's getting ready for
[18:00.280 --> 18:04.880]  collapse and I've got big stacks of news on that front and Ron Paul has warned of
[18:04.880 --> 18:08.600]  during this engineered collapse the fact that they're gonna try to bring in
[18:08.600 --> 18:13.680]  pure fascism they've got a hundred million people totally on welfare they
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.840]  don't know how to tie their shoelaces who will do whatever they're told and if
[18:17.840 --> 18:22.520]  the welfare checks don't ever arrive major cities will go up in flame and
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.040]  looting it will start they're laying off in many police departments more than
[18:26.040 --> 18:30.440]  60% of police keeping a small portion just to write tickets and raise revenue
[18:30.440 --> 18:35.680]  no amount of money will fix this we've been signed on to 1.5 quadrillion in
[18:35.680 --> 18:41.280]  derivatives this has all been engineered this is I told you this 14 years ago
[18:41.280 --> 18:46.200]  it's happening now I don't know if the collapse is going to be in late October
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.240]  early November like the police and military being told but they are being
[18:49.240 --> 18:53.600]  told get ready for the big event then that may not happen they do this a lot
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.680]  to get everybody in gear and to follow orders but the point is every economist
[18:58.680 --> 19:03.040]  I talked to says there's no way out of this but writing off the derivatives and
[19:03.040 --> 19:06.680]  that's not happening because that's how the bankers hold us hostage it's not our
[19:06.680 --> 19:13.680]  debt 1.5 quadrillion our debt is 15 point what one trillion that's what we've
[19:13.680 --> 19:18.800]  been suckered into 15 trillion eight 1.5 quadrillion 644 trill they says our
[19:18.800 --> 19:27.920]  debt JP Morgan Chase is $92 trillion in derivatives is not my problem so I want
[19:27.920 --> 19:32.600]  to tell the police something here they want to get rid of you just like the
[19:32.600 --> 19:35.960]  global estate terror attacks to get Sunnis and Shiites killing each other in
[19:35.960 --> 19:41.520]  Iraq that's how they've got us divided up we're really all Americans and I know
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.120]  it's macho and it's kind of sexy to have a war the American people and arrest
[19:45.120 --> 19:49.280]  people some of the cops have been hired that are thugs like the idea most of you
[19:49.280 --> 19:54.120]  are not evil and you understand that you are going to be wiped out if this
[19:54.120 --> 20:01.320]  happens and so will a lot of patriots it's gonna be bad the worst drought in
[20:01.320 --> 20:05.240]  50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[20:05.240 --> 20:10.040]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[20:10.040 --> 20:14.760]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices
[20:14.760 --> 20:18.360]  the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business
[20:18.360 --> 20:22.400]  blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze
[20:22.400 --> 20:26.280]  your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for

[24:09.000 --> 24:14.200]  here live I have been to the urban warfare drills I have shot video of it I
[24:14.200 --> 24:18.000]  have shown you real military checkpoints on highways from Alabama to
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.880]  Tennessee to California to Texas the Secretary of the Army is announcing
[24:22.880 --> 24:27.320]  they want to put a brigade in every major city and smaller detachments in
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.920]  small towns by any other name is still the same thing this is a martial law
[24:32.920 --> 24:38.160]  takeover of America not to respond to a hurricane or something like that which
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.960]  they take your guns in illegally but just to make sure that this criminal
[24:43.960 --> 24:51.080]  takeover can be completed because if they don't they are going to be able to
[24:51.080 --> 24:58.320]  basically shut down our shut down the people they just turned on a giant
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.160]  weed whacker right outside my window the studio this is a soundproof studio
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.840]  except for right there at that one window and it just distracted me I'm
[25:06.840 --> 25:10.440]  normally pretty hard to distract me but it just turned on right there in my
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.040]  ear at that point just go ask the guy to go to it later tell him we don't need a
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.240]  cut all right don't be mean to him anyway I mean he's been going for like 20
[25:18.240 --> 25:20.920]  minutes he just turned it back on it really distracted me we just need to
[25:20.920 --> 25:24.480]  soundproof that and shut that completely down that one little window all right
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.680]  that's enough side issue the import of what we're covering here cannot be
[25:29.680 --> 25:35.520]  underestimated the globalists are going to end up going to prison if they do
[25:35.520 --> 25:44.960]  not basically totally take over society that's what's happening here and they
[25:44.960 --> 25:49.480]  are at the point of return they are committed and those of you that serve
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.520]  the evil are not going to advance yourselves in the mid and long term in
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.560]  the short term you may advance yourselves but this is all coming to an end
[25:58.560 --> 26:04.440]  the globalist plan has scientifically packaged collapse as a policy of
[26:04.440 --> 26:08.920]  government and statecraft where they collapse society into warfare and
[26:08.920 --> 26:16.360]  sectarian violence and poverty as a mode of control now we have a special guest
[26:16.360 --> 26:19.800]  coming up a whistleblower later in the broadcast I have a lot of other news I
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.280]  want to get to but I want to open the phones up for current active duty
[26:24.280 --> 26:27.760]  military that are in urban warfare drills against the American people and
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.920]  police because the admissions of urban warfare expanding the admissions of
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.280]  troops deploying all over the country the admissions of reeducation camps the
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.840]  admissions of gun confiscation training by the US military for the United
[26:42.840 --> 26:46.880]  States all these manuals are now public on army websites they're not even
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.520]  hiding it meaning they're getting ready to go operational the massive buildup of
[26:51.520 --> 27:00.320]  1.4 billion rounds 1.4 1 billion 400 billion rounds of ammo 750 mil just
[27:00.320 --> 27:07.640]  ordered checkpoints all over the place television all the big movies
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.800]  acclimating you for martial law this is for the economic collapse and I and I
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.560]  see comments on our YouTube channel I see comments out there saying Alex yeah
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.440]  things are collapsing we've got to do this it was collapsed by design I said
[27:21.440 --> 27:26.440]  this 14 years ago been on air 17 we saw this coming a long time ago they've done
[27:26.440 --> 27:30.120]  this in third-world countries over and over again they'll take the wealthiest
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.360]  country in Latin America that was as wealthy as the US per capita and
[27:33.360 --> 27:38.840]  destroy it in a matter of months like Argentina in 2000 folks you better look
[27:38.840 --> 27:45.120]  this up look what they've done to Europe and they keep posing as the saviors
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.160]  but they say they're going to use global crises to bring in a one-world
[27:48.160 --> 27:56.280]  government we are in so much trouble I am begging you to speak out because if
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.360]  we don't speak out if other talk show hosts who know this stuff is true but
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.320]  decide to kind of play along with the system out of fear and and writers and
[28:06.320 --> 28:09.960]  and people working for the big networks and all of you I've talked a lot of you
[28:09.960 --> 28:13.680]  privately and you know this is real but you're scared if you don't start
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.760]  speaking out and saying no now if we don't really get a viral transmission of
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.760]  this information a buzz going against what's happening the globalists are
[28:23.760 --> 28:27.240]  going to go ahead and pull the trigger on this they want to start a civil war
[28:27.240 --> 28:31.400]  I'm asking the police out there you they've got you all hyped up and ready
[28:31.400 --> 28:36.760]  for war the armored vehicles the drones the body armor you know the founding
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.040]  fathers are bad gun owners and veterans are bad these are the bad guys these are
[28:42.040 --> 28:45.800]  the people that ship guns to Mexico maybe they'll ship some of the 1.4
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.240]  million rounds of ammo down there to the drug gangs these are weirdos that run
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.440]  bizarre lesbian cults over homeland security I mean these are very very
[28:55.440 --> 29:00.480]  strange people these globalists I mean they just want power they want to screw
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.280]  stuff up they they like burning cities and black uniforms and helicopters and
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.440]  explosions and all of this okay I've studied the psychology of these people
[29:09.440 --> 29:14.520]  throughout history I'm just singling out the lesbians out there I'm saying this

[33:42.360 --> 33:47.760]  is in an arrested development area and we've been trained to worship government

[34:05.880 --> 34:10.680]  homeland security saying white males are the terrorist and are going to attack
[34:10.680 --> 34:15.040]  and it's because they're going to basically order the military and police
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.920]  to start a civil war in this country and you are designed to be absolutely
[34:20.920 --> 34:25.560]  decimated by this it's all a big laboratory they've learned how to do it
[34:25.560 --> 34:29.560]  all over the Middle East all over Central Asia and the globalists admit
[34:29.560 --> 34:32.800]  this the last few months all these army manuals that the armies put out
[34:32.800 --> 34:37.000]  themselves on reeducation camps mass-arrest gun confiscation those
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.240]  aren't just words I'm saying just type in army manual covers gun
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.520]  confiscation inside us and it says inside the u.s. they're training the
[34:46.520 --> 34:53.720]  cordon cities and take our guns just like Katrina the government has been
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.520]  hijacked when a plane gets hijacked a lot of times the hijacker will even put
[34:58.520 --> 35:01.600]  on the captain's uniform are you supposed to then do whatever they say
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.000]  because we've all got collective Stockholm syndrome and we're just gonna
[35:05.000 --> 35:13.560]  watch the captain the globalists have taken this country over and this is an
[35:13.560 --> 35:17.600]  illegitimate government and if you think Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are going to
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.760]  save you I got news for you it looks like the system's getting ready to put
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.480]  them in so that all the police state gains Obama has gotten everybody will
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.680]  forget about it and suddenly support it if it's good old Mitt Romney and Paul
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.440]  Ryan who both supported the banker bailout are in there and again this is
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.000]  way bigger than Obama this is a takedown this is global government being
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.480]  announced I mean look at the other news here Darrell is that a Sue Eric Holder

[39:37.480 --> 39:44.560]  middle of the street okay it's a pervert command base and Senator John DeKamp
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.840]  said it on my show more than 10 years ago and I shut him down because I've
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.760]  never heard of that and never been in the news it was original info because he
[39:53.760 --> 39:56.760]  dug into it at the Republican National Committee he was hired as a
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.800]  Republican he didn't believe it to go out and disprove it and found it was true
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.920]  and the police officer who was retired police officer a detective his plane
[40:05.920 --> 40:12.000]  was blown up to shut it down okay that's who runs things look at Janet
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.080]  Napolitano and what the head of New York Homeland Security says he's got a
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.080]  bunch of witnesses they do I can't even say it on air it's basically stuff along
[40:19.080 --> 40:23.400]  these lines they're perverts folks these are crazy people you imagine these

[40:44.320 --> 40:48.320]  done talking about it let's just go to your phone calls we got bad people in
[40:48.320 --> 40:53.040]  charge they work for foreign banks they've been hiring all these defraught
[40:53.040 --> 41:01.440]  priests and people to run TSA in Philadelphia the head TSA minion on

[41:11.920 --> 41:18.680]  hands on you they're breaking us and they hate the military and police and
[41:18.680 --> 41:22.920]  they're gonna march you against the American people and they're gonna stage
[41:22.920 --> 41:26.320]  massacres and things like that to make us look bad it's gonna be bad this is the
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.320]  takeover this is how American I'm gonna go to police officers Mark in

[41:52.160 --> 42:00.720]  original red dawn and it was gonna come out like a year and a half ago but it
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.120]  said the Chinese invaded the US through Latin America which is a lot more
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.920]  plausible than North Korea they can't even tie their shoelaces because they're
[42:06.920 --> 42:10.040]  actually a communist state it's not leaching off a free state like the
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.920]  United States like China is because they got hard-working folks in China they
[42:13.920 --> 42:17.480]  made them go in and reshoot a bunch of it and digitally change it or in North
[42:17.480 --> 42:23.720]  Korea invades with Latin America and in it the kids fight back against it folks
[42:23.720 --> 42:27.720]  that's not how this is going to work the takeover happened through banking and
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.000]  through regulatory agencies and they set up a national security system and a
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.840]  continuity government system to replace the legitimate government then they
[42:35.840 --> 42:39.880]  blackmailed the vestigial Congress that's where we've gotten in the chair is
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.960]  against the wall John does have a long mustache and if you're out there on or
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.760]  behind enemy lines now this one's for you America we are occupied they're
[42:48.760 --> 42:51.680]  getting ready to shut things down they just gave us notice they're gonna shut
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.800]  down our YouTube channel today because you they now say my voice is copyrighted
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.560]  and they're and they're preparing to move to ban my voice on YouTube I'm not

[43:27.960 --> 43:33.120]  public this is all public now but they count on you being ignorant they just
[43:33.120 --> 43:37.920]  said oh I heard a rumor no it's not a rumor and again you have to stop the
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.600]  takeover they're engineering it it's not oh we gotta have troops on the streets
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.080]  because the collapse the collapse is designed only exposing this can back
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.680]  them off but right now they're going forward with it right now all the signs
[43:50.680 --> 43:56.200]  are green lights we can back them off together also suggest you pray and get
[43:56.200 --> 44:00.600]  out of your 501c3 Romans 13 churches that say worshipping tyranny is what the
[44:00.600 --> 44:03.800]  Bible says and the whole Bible is against that let's go ahead and play this
[44:03.800 --> 44:08.120]  red dawn clip and straight to your calls you're in the Air Force right Marines

[44:23.440 --> 44:28.280]  the blackout may run along the entire northwest corridor that's exactly how
[44:28.280 --> 44:34.040]  they'll do it the globalist will do that and poses the saviors what's going on
[44:34.040 --> 44:37.840]  it won't roll in as a foreign military
[44:41.360 --> 44:45.760]  destroy our military by having an engagement
[44:45.760 --> 44:48.800]  by the way the military will be completely destroyed
[44:48.800 --> 44:55.720]  you take care of your brother you hear me go now if you're seeing this broadcast
[44:55.720 --> 44:59.440]  you are in a part of the country no longer controlled by the government of
[44:59.440 --> 45:08.280]  the United States boys I love you both but I want you do what I would do kill
[45:08.280 --> 45:18.800]  this piece they messed with the wrong family how did this happen there's a
[45:18.800 --> 45:23.040]  new class of weapon everything went offline never came back they wipe us out
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.520]  including you a central command
[45:26.520 --> 45:30.960]  I'm supposed to do I'm gonna fight anybody who wants to join is welcome to
[45:30.960 --> 45:37.680]  it we'll hit them on our terms or the Wolverines we create chaos we need to
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.840]  steal that weapon it'd be the foothold we need and take our own that's enough now
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.720]  the globalists are the ones shipping guns all over the US not just Mexico to
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.360]  create chaos they're the rebels the rebels the globalist they're there the
[45:51.360 --> 45:54.000]  revolutionaries we're the counter revolutionaries that's what they call
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.200]  us that's why the whole architecture is against the American people we're all
[45:58.200 --> 46:03.120]  that's left folks worldwide we've been used to set up the world government now
[46:03.120 --> 46:07.560]  we're to be totally enslaved and so they've all got all the Marines are
[46:07.560 --> 46:12.800]  gonna lead you oh yes they are the Pentagon is run by the bankers and they
[46:12.800 --> 46:18.480]  brag about it the military treated like absolute trash all right who's up first
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.240]  here is it Fernando is it Mark Dan Scott Jim who's up first here let's go to the
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.520]  police mark in Washington let's move quickly thank you for calling in Mark
[46:27.520 --> 46:33.280]  so 1.4 billion rounds of 40 Cal for the American people what's that sound like to
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.240]  you well they're not they're getting ready for something definitely I don't
[46:38.240 --> 46:44.200]  know if it's too much ammunition for training that's for sure yeah I mean it's
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.560]  enough to put four bullets in every American I mean it's a giant buildup
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.840]  for a sustained war and that's that's that's what they admit they're doing yeah
[46:53.840 --> 46:59.520]  I'm concerned outside I like working one of the wealthiest counties in eastern
[46:59.520 --> 47:03.480]  Washington and I will tell you this though that I've been in law enforcement
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.160]  for 15 years and and I've called before we don't do a lot of training with the
[47:08.160 --> 47:13.640]  federal government so if they're planning on something in our area we
[47:13.640 --> 47:16.840]  don't know about it I will tell you this though I have seen a lot of military
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.640]  equipment running west towards Seattle in the last month seen a lot of trucks
[47:21.640 --> 47:29.520]  on flatbed trucks a lot of Humvees last month I saw nine strikers heading west
[47:29.520 --> 47:34.880]  bound from from Oregon to Seattle area yeah they're cashing them in all the
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.960]  that's been confirmed they're cashing them in every US city yeah I I would just
[47:40.960 --> 47:48.000]  tell the American people is that police officers that have got you know at least
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.120]  15 years or more on like myself we are not going against American people I've
[47:53.120 --> 47:56.840]  already made the decision if we're asked to take guns I will be on the other
[47:56.840 --> 48:01.680]  side the only the concern I have is the young military personnel and also the
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.360]  young police officers that are coming out of the academies now they're more
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.480]  apt to take orders that are they're not awful legal but I mean these are orders
[48:11.480 --> 48:17.000]  coming from admitted criminals I mean the entire at the top of the Justice
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.920]  Department it's a bunch of gangsters it's just it's just really sick to watch a
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.280]  bunch of New York and Chicago gangsters take our country over like this yeah
[48:26.280 --> 48:30.000]  it's frustrating I will tell you this though you know you've got men and
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.720]  women that we got families to feed and and a lot of them be honest with you or
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.240]  asleep I mean what they'll do what they're told there's there's only a
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.000]  small percentage of us I believe at least in my area because I talked to a lot
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.120]  law enforcement officers I really know what's going on and I want to thank you
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.880]  personally you woke me up two years ago and I'm even to the point now where I'm
[48:49.880 --> 48:53.720]  putting your stickers everywhere and I'm getting tired of people my area keep
[48:53.720 --> 48:57.200]  taking them down but I'm gonna keep putting them up well God bless you for
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.520]  providing leadership in your area look I appreciate your call if we don't get
[49:01.520 --> 49:05.560]  aggressive with this information they're gonna pull the trigger they got a gun to
[49:05.560 --> 49:09.920]  our head they're attacking us we're doing everything we can to stop this
[49:09.920 --> 49:15.880]  civil war believe me I don't want this and once they pull the trigger it's gonna
[49:15.880 --> 49:21.800]  be bad folks I mean these crooks are full of arrogance and bravada let's go
[49:21.800 --> 49:25.280]  to another call Dan and PA them I'll hold him over and then Scott and others
[49:25.280 --> 49:31.600]  Dan and PA you're on the air police officer go ahead hey you are awesome I
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.000]  love your show and love all your documentaries man you're the best so
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.640]  thank you but yeah a couple comments the first thing is I think the one thing
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.120]  the globalists aren't counting on is human ingenuity the fact that we can
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.720]  adapt and survive and the fact that there are so much more of us out there
[49:50.720 --> 49:55.080]  and time and time again you know humans adapt and we survive and I don't think
[49:55.080 --> 49:58.560]  that they're not giving us enough credit that we're gonna survive I agree with
[49:58.560 --> 50:01.640]  you but let me ask you this my police and military sources a lot of them
[50:01.640 --> 50:05.240]  senior are saying something big late October early November that's what this
[50:05.240 --> 50:10.320]  gear up is for well I mean what what do you get 1.4 billion rounds of ammo again
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.840]  I mean what is that for well what they've done is because the standard round for
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.400]  the government was always the 115 grain 9 millimeters so what they've done is
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.040]  they've now standardized and up their caliber because they all bought up to
[50:25.040 --> 50:29.720]  9 millimeters and they're now going to the 40 so they are clearly preparing for
[50:29.720 --> 50:34.200]  something and a lot of us in some of these departments we were not able to
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.000]  get a hold of ammo because everything was on back order because they were buying
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.640]  it all up no I absolutely stay there I'm gonna come back to you and then we're
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.400]  gonna go to the sheriff Scott in Pennsylvania we're gonna go to Fernando
[50:47.400 --> 50:52.560]  we're gonna go to Jim and others straight ahead but I mean the federal

[54:14.040 --> 54:19.200]  one-world government where would we get that Herman von Roompie the head of the
[54:19.200 --> 54:24.360]  EU and countless mainstream news articles saying how great it is go read our
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.200]  article bankers say they've conquered the US and Europe and you'll see the
[54:29.200 --> 54:33.440]  video clips the links and then police out there should go read the Southern
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.400]  Poverty Law Center and ADL reports they're forced to sit through the videos
[54:37.400 --> 54:41.120]  and things and go wait well they're saying this doesn't exist but then the
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.600]  media saying it does that's how dumb they think you are is they tell you that
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.560]  now the veterans and gun owners and libertarians and conservatives are the
[54:50.560 --> 54:57.000]  new al-Qaeda and a new army plan they're preparing for a tea party insurrection
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.080]  where we work with al-Qaeda but meanwhile the Pentagon is running al-Qaeda in
[55:02.080 --> 55:08.200]  Libya and Syria editorial the war of 2016 Washington Times linked up at the
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.880]  drudge report all weekend with our article US Army tactical manual
[55:12.880 --> 55:16.440]  describes how to control domestic insurrection gun confiscation you name
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.360]  it going back to the police officer who's holding Dan in Pennsylvania I mean
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.960]  are people starting to wake up in your department is the public or is the
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.440]  armored pill boxes that the secretary of the army saying they want to put troops
[55:30.440 --> 55:33.440]  on the streets I mean is anybody discussing this or are you the only
[55:33.440 --> 55:37.520]  person you know that's awake no actually it's it's a lot more than I think
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.280]  people realize and because of the sensitivity of this people aren't
[55:42.280 --> 55:47.560]  communicating it openly we're doing it very quietly with one another my town
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.040]  that I work in there's a lot of don't try on these flags floating around there's
[55:51.040 --> 55:56.320]  a lot of military veterans a lot of police officers and you know you can't
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.320]  be afraid to talk to each other and I think people were very afraid to
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.240]  approach me and when I would talk to them after a couple minutes of speaking
[56:05.240 --> 56:08.280]  with people they realize kind of you're on the same page well I mean listen Dan
[56:08.280 --> 56:12.360]  think about where we're at we're actually sitting here talking about a red
[56:12.360 --> 56:16.440]  dawn internal takeover I mean we're actually to the point now I mean this
[56:16.440 --> 56:19.760]  is so horrible and I know why people don't want to believe it because it's
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.000]  so crazy but history is crazy sorry go ahead yeah and it's exactly like Thomas
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.720]  Jefferson said you know every generation needs to you know have a
[56:27.720 --> 56:31.840]  revolution you know and I think kind of what you're talking about it is it's not
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.640]  only economically and and physically it's also spiritually we have just lost
[56:35.640 --> 56:41.000]  our way as a country and as a people and people are slowly kind of waking up to
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.160]  it but you know what people need to do is they got a lobby Congress and things
[56:46.160 --> 56:50.760]  like that and get an Oklahoma law passed and the law in Virginia and when you
[56:50.760 --> 56:53.960]  guys reported in New Hampshire about the jury notification law you know that's
[56:53.960 --> 56:57.000]  what they need to do I think you just said it and I want to give people some
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.560]  positive news they've always had the incremental takeover they're putting
[57:00.560 --> 57:04.920]  hammer down worldwide a presence he even says this in his new book because they
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.960]  know humanity's waking up this this accelerated takeover is the fact that
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.640]  they're desperate to get us under their control because they know we're waking
[57:13.640 --> 57:18.200]  up yeah and you know people need to start saying no and people by nature
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.240]  are really non-confrontational and they needed to start saying no you know and
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.480]  just nip it in the butt and just stop it in its tracks because exactly what you
[57:27.480 --> 57:30.960]  say you give them an inch and they take a foot so thank you so much for
[57:30.960 --> 57:34.920]  everything that you do man don't thank me brother god bless you I just I just
[57:34.920 --> 57:41.280]  have studied history so much and this is so real this is so real these
[57:41.280 --> 57:45.240]  globalists could do anything I mean I've got a stack of mainstream news today
[57:45.240 --> 57:51.600]  where they admit Al Qaeda is funded by NATO and Hillary Clinton shipping them
[57:51.600 --> 57:56.760]  into Syria to kill the Christians and Jews I mean it's I can't even believe

[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.680]  army buys for you know a giant war I mean it I mean it's an arms build up
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.080]  against the American people by the crooked banksters that have taken over
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.680]  and who've got all these freaks working for them at the Department of Justice
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.360]  who are so freaky I can't even I mean it's just they're they're nuts they're
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.760]  loons let's go to a gym in Indiana who's on duty so what's your take about the
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.920]  open announcements of reeducation camps gun confiscation drills by the army all
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.560]  the documents it's even in mainstream news the army preparing for war with the
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.880]  tea party saying they believe the tea party's gonna link up with al-qaeda what's
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.120]  your take on that well it's an absolute outrage I agree with everything you say
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.400]  about it well I mean it's Alice in Wonderland too do any police you know
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.440]  are they buying this are they concerned well you know it's like the guy in
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.400]  Washington said you know most of the younger guys aren't getting it and
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.920]  they're probably gonna go along with this nonsense the guys that have been
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.120]  around for a while are starting to figure it out but for the most part of
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.440]  you you talk to people and they think you're nuts you know when you bring up
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.160]  stuff like this but more and more guys are waking up especially the older guys well
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.520]  I mean what are hundreds of mobile checkpoint pillboxes for what are 1.4
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.000]  billion rounds of 40 cal for well here's a question for you why did my department
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.920]  issue me a federal ID card there you go hard it says on the back of it's got a
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.840]  RFID chip with my picture on the front of it and on the back of it's got the
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:31.720]  USC code warning that if we tamper or were liable for federal criminal
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.880]  penalties it's nonsense I won't even carry it well that's because I mean you
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.320]  know it's the threat fusion centers there listen they're spraying for West
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.040]  Nile virus because there's been two cases in Dallas it means nothing it's like
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.960]  the flu they're spraying the city with it and I'm watching the news and I see
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.040]  them turn around and they say homeland security I mean they're over everything
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.560]  I had a call last week about I looked it up homeland security is involved in CPS
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:06.800]  cases and cases of swap meets shelling copyright violating t-shirts I mean
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.720]  home I mean the they've got TSA sir all over the country now just showing up
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.880]  running checkpoints that are illegal for you to run and you're a sworn bonded
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.280]  peace officer and they're just goons have any part of it did you are you
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.720]  familiar with Moscata tuck Herbert training center in southern Indiana yes
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.080]  the last three weeks they've been running drills and then they talk about
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.280]  natural disasters this that and the other but their biggest drill last week
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.520]  was an atomic explosion in the United States yeah well I look into these guys
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.160]  mines because I've followed them so long and it's really uncanny because I can I
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.080]  know it's in their cars I don't know what they're gonna play next but they
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.800]  really hyped the new can you imagine the power grab they're gonna have if they
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.720]  set off the nuke and claim the tea party did it no but down there at this
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.720]  place they the federal government's put in millions and millions and millions of
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.360]  dollars and I know somebody that was down there last week that was in EMS and
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.800]  she was telling me about the yeah the atomic explosion she said you can believe
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.020]  it they had cars up in trees and all kinds of nonsense I mean it was the
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.640]  emphasis supposedly for natural disasters and whatnot training but that's

[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.960]  being issued because we just heard an active on-duty police officer talk
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.960]  about but it's in the news these federal ID cards and if you haven't gotten them
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:29.040]  you will soon they've got CIA involved locally illegally they are putting
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.240]  regular army and Marines all over the streets the Secretary of the Army is
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.960]  calling for it and the Chicago Tribune and others are reporting that the five
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:42.480]  US megabanks of course then this is 6 the European consortium have been ordered
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.280]  to prepare to prevent collapse but really it's prepared for collapse when
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:52.280]  you actually read what's going on there again army training manuals saying
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.440]  reeducation camps war with the Tea Party they're projecting civil unrest led by
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:05.000]  the Tea Party linking up with Al Qaeda out of Mexico that's like saying Jesus
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.200]  Christ knelt to the devil out in the desert and accepted the I mean it's
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.280]  it's the opposite I mean who believes that the Tea Party is gonna work with
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.200]  Al Qaeda how long did I tell you that would be what they'd say I know these
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:27.040]  people okay I mean it's not hard to look at big sis to know what she's like and
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.440]  then it all comes out which I mean these are crazy people and they want to
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.800]  start a civil war I mean they're nuts Obama's top economic advisor was John
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:42.160]  Corzine the former governor of New Jersey and he made 40 to 1 bets with
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.560]  other people's bank accounts that his company controlled on the stock market I
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:55.680]  mean these criminals go do crazy stuff is and I've studied history and now it's
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:00.840]  not even studying history I'm going to your calls they admit that they're
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.160]  gearing up for war with us and training and it's in the movies it's
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.120]  everywhere where the gun owning conservative libertarian Christian is
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.960]  the enemy they've got an ABC News show coming out called Founding Fathers were
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:16.080]  Texas gun owners a criminal scum who abused their children it's always the
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.320]  same MO and people sit there watching this believing that if you're a Christian
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.640]  gun owner you're planning to nerve gas New York I mean it's in all these shows
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.160]  it's all and then people sit there and watch this the most the lowest crime
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.800]  rate out there is white women then Asian women then white males but they say on
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.480]  the news the white males the most dangerous because they're just gonna
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.600]  flip it from Al Qaeda that they get all the white males to get behind giving up
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.840]  their liberties to fight when Al Qaeda is run by the globalist this was always
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:52.400]  the plan and now it's public okay who's up next here we've got Sheriff Scott
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.840]  and Fernando then Jim and then Steve in Montana we're gonna go to all of you but
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.840]  if you just joined us 1.4 billion rounds of ammo all Watson's article deals with
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.000]  450 million rounds of 40 cal and 750 million rounds that's not all of it
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.280]  we've got links to the PDF of the purchase order it's a million of this a
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.720]  million of that I mean it is just and some say they're doing this to buy up
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.800]  the ammo because you can't get most these animals they listen now it basically
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.160]  any price so they are going maybe that's how they're keeping us from getting
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:28.800]  bullets because we're buying 234 million guns a month and don't forget the I
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.480]  mean I look I'm not for violence but it is a counterbalance that's why we have
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.000]  the second amendment is if the government did get taken over as it has
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.760]  now they try to carry out these type of crimes you got to defend yourself let's
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.800]  go to Scott is a sheriff listening in Pennsylvania Scott what is your take on
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.200]  the armored pill boxes the checkpoints the regular army on the streets the
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.120]  talk of everything collapsing why during a collapse would you need 1.4
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.600]  billion rounds of ammo I mean that's enough to kill everybody four times
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:12.320]  Alex can you hear me yes sir yeah your phone's breaking up bad no I'm not
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.520]  saying everything's going to collapse in October our police and military sources
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.320]  and everything we see the globalists create jump points where they're looking
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.200]  at something in a frame they may unlock the trigger and go with it or they may
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.720]  lock it back up but late October early November is when a lot of our sources
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.440]  are being told get ready for something incredible but the globalists were
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.360]  saying it was something big would happen after the Olympics I said that
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.760]  doesn't mean it's going to happen but was later confirmed that the security
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.680]  firm was saying get ready for something big but they do that to get everybody to
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.960]  line up and do what they're told
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:52.200]  okay yeah you know you fear longer the whole Olympics or deal and you know
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.440]  nothing happened and now you it seems like you're tearing up the whole October
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.040]  ordeal and trying to jump over what you said in you know the past week about the
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.560]  Olympics yeah no what what you're doing what you're doing is engaging in a
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:13.160]  straw man situation but go ahead and say whatever you want about me and then I'm
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:21.520]  going to respond I mean okay put him on hold for me because his phones bad and
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.360]  I'll go back to him in a second because I wanted to be able to respond I was
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.960]  saying go ahead sir I hope to heaven I've been fair mongering and this doesn't
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:35.120]  happen okay I am absolutely blown away by what you just said and I'm and I'm
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.760]  tired of this meme you have this this this talking point I had a guest on who's
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.840]  a TV producer he later released his name who had already been in local TV and
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:53.480]  newspapers who did go get a job with the big security firm and who said that
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.480]  there's no real security and they're telling them there will be an attack I
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.720]  got him on and I said just because they're telling you that doesn't mean
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.640]  this is the case a few weeks after we broke all this we didn't really break it
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.280]  we had him on but broken internationally and already been in the news there they
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.200]  came out and they said yeah it's true horrible security shambles people can
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.840]  bring anything through so that's what happened there you know I told you in
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:25.360]  2007 that because I had former top CIA analyst Ray McGovern on that they were
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.720]  planning to stage a gulf of Tonkin with ships attacking our own ships it came
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.520]  out in New Yorker magazine two-time Pulitzer Prize winners Cy Hirsch
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.440]  confirmed Cheney at that time wanted Navy SEALs to attack our own ships they
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:43.920]  said no Admiral Fox Fallon basically had to resign because he refused the orders
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.320]  we've had several heads of SETCOM several chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.120]  Staff come out and behind the scenes stopped the Iran war 888 we almost had
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.920]  nuclear war with the Russians that whole Georgia thing sir I told you years
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.960]  ago they would put TSA on the streets I saw him say on C-span I said that I broke
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.520]  all this down I said that of course the leadership of Penn State was involved in
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:20.640]  a pedophile ring it's now in the Daily Mail and other newspapers okay I have
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.600]  had the police officers on and others who were there and saw the feds bomb
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:30.520]  Oklahoma City so I understand it's scary for you to hear this type of info 1.4
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.880]  billion rounds of 40 Cal have been purchased in the last year that dwarfs
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.920]  anything ever imagined I can read to you the news articles where regular
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.240]  Marines are running checkpoints from Tennessee to California I've had the
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.840]  state reps on and read the governor statement where the military tells them
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.120]  we're gonna do what we want and then I mean no one can deny I told people 15
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.160]  years ago the NSA's got hubs at all the telecommunications facilities listening
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.640]  to everything you're doing illegally that's now admitted now
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.760]  you know I met with a fella from a telecommunications company an engineer
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.600]  15 years ago is how I knew about that he said I can't tell you what's classified
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.720]  but I'm in order to do this here's what's open source look at the Telecommunications
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:21.160]  Act I told you they'd be breaking in over cell phones with government alerts
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:29.360]  it's all coming true I wish it wasn't okay if I do anything and I apologize for
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:37.280]  this I subconsciously hold back how bad this is
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.720]  I mean I told you the globalist run al-Qaeda and I have a stack of news here
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:52.560]  Asia times al-Qaeda flags fly over rebel held Syria that's today more visible
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:17:01.280]  US role expected in Syria in coming weeks CNS news you know US gets ready for
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.640]  Israeli news quotes US sources close to president saying he will join an Israeli
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:15.240]  attack Israel test SMS missile alerts Iran chatter grows Syria video shows

[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.040]  people are like oh Alex don't fear monger about war and all this did he hang
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:32.680]  up why do you do that I mean it's funny he brought up the Olympics what am I
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.880]  supposed to do when we have whistleblowers saying this is what they're
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.760]  being told I mean are you gonna call in if we don't have something in October
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:49.600]  November happen and say oh Alex you made this up nothing happened I mean what
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.920]  am I supposed to do I've had countless police at others where they're having
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:00.440]  urban warfare drills in places like St. Louis where they got tanks rolling
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.800]  around say yeah we were told you know martial law in late October early
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.280]  November that's what I'm seeing all over I'm not saying that's gonna happen but
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.320]  there's all these mainstream news articles in Army manuals saying
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.080]  reeducation camps for us and the government's arm into the teeth against
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.600]  us and if we don't take this as a threat they're gonna get away with it don't
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.520]  you get that God you make me angry excuse me I just Fernando whose army
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.840]  Fernando what's your take on all this Frank's for holding yeah there's a good
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:37.200]  article in veterans today by Gordon Duff have you had him on the show I think
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.200]  years ago I don't think so it goes into it was over the weekend the
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:52.320]  Israelization of the United States police force and what's the breakdown slowly
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.960]  every police department in the United States at the behest of Department of
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:03.240]  Homeland Security is being trained by Israeli groups as part of this training
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.080]  there is an increased move to use military uniforms armored vehicles heavy

[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.200]  with me but when I covered the Olympics a few times and in sources saying that
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.360]  they were being told there'd be this big attack sometime after it I said I
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.480]  thought that was to acclimate people you know to a police state and that I
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.880]  didn't think there'd probably be an attack but then that guy calls it and
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.720]  says you said this is gonna happen it didn't happen look at what's happening
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.160]  overall look at the loss of liberty look at what's happening the economy look
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.840]  at what the bureaucracies are doing we're becoming an unfree country the world
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:51.880]  is losing freedom and world government is being announced and censorship is
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:58.360]  increasing let's go back to the phone calls here let's go to Jim with info
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.400]  from active duty Marines go ahead Jim tell us so what's going on we'll go to
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.720]  Mark Steve and others hey Alex but first of all I wanted to say the previous
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:14.000]  caller he up don't let that discourage you no it doesn't I just don't get these
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.120]  weak minds that I mean you clear that there's public Army manuals admitting
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:25.560]  reeducation camps for us you know I see it you know I have a friend that's a
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.440]  current military police and he he's pretty much in the dark about all this
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.680]  I've turned him on to your program on on on your website I've shared my you know
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:41.200]  logging information so go check it out and he basically he's in shock I mean
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.880]  he doesn't he doesn't see what's going on I mean nobody's telling him so
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.120]  apparently this is very compartmentalized you know he's only about an
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:55.120]  E2 or E3 I think so I you know I think I think if this is going on it's going on
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.600]  at the higher levels definitely you know well yeah just like fast and furious but
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.320]  I mean we've got the articles with links a lot of this is on the Army's own
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.160]  website this is the reeducation camps that the gun confiscation the teaching
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.800]  the army that the enemy is the Tea Party and they're gonna have to take over the
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.840]  states I mean that's all there it's just I guess the average people don't go
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:22.520]  read you know the overalls or structure they just take orders I mean that's how
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.280]  the globalists get away with all this yeah that's exactly right I think I
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.760]  think for the most part most of you guys are young you know they're they're
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.280]  out there they it's it's it's you know what I wore a Marine Corps uniform it
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.640]  you know it was a source of pride and you know you follow orders I mean that's
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.320]  that's what you're taught you know there's a lot of us of us waking up I
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.680]  mean you know realizing that there's something wrong there's something that's
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.800]  just not right about our country anymore and you know he's definitely waking up
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.480]  he's waking people up you know I asked him questions you know do you see any
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.120]  this going on he like I said he himself he doesn't see any of this I mean
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:06.160]  they're telling me he's in a ship to Afghanistan and well sure they're all
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.840]  coming I mean I mean but the they're training regular army and Marines for
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.080]  riot control and stuff that's not hidden the Secretary of the Army again a month
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.960]  and a half ago in the CFR said they want to put troops in every major city so
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.840]  this is all really public that's what's so weird for somebody like my shelf that
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.240]  sits there and studies it it's all pretty much in the open God bless you
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.480]  appreciate the calm that the that that caller before last gets to me because the
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.120]  guy sound like a nice person and I guess he just wasn't sophisticated enough to
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.600]  understand that I'm I didn't say the Olympics we're gonna get blown up like I
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:48.120]  said I thought it was hype but we looked at it unbelievable let's go to Steve in
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:53.240]  Montana go ahead Steve you're on the air what's your info
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:00.160]  we're pulling over here on the side of the road I got a friend of mine Bob here
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.280]  with me too that got the information first and I'll let him tell you what it
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:12.880]  was yeah general Valley general Paul Valley used to be on the Fox News he's
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:19.840]  telling no friends and relatives to stock up on the beans in the bush up here in
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:28.240]  Cal spell Montana show again sure I'm here and some of your people that are
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.840]  inside the system are saying get ready absolutely but he's been saying this for
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:41.360]  about a year now Paul's been saying this and I can't give my source but anyway
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.520]  the other thing is we got our National Guard up here in Montana and Cal spell
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:54.120]  is being trained by the a cadre of of National Guardsmen out of Helen in
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:29:05.560]  Montana and riot control there I talked to two different guardsmen and the one
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.280]  guy kid was from living Montana and the other guy was from Cal spell and he said
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:18.960]  they're getting training on civil unrest you know as far as riot control yeah
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.320]  that's the game plan and we're getting closer to the control collapse where
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.720]  you'll be begging for the military on the streets but the point is the
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.280]  globalist engineered it to then take our liberties it'd be one thing if people
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:34.800]  were burning a city and you know got dealt with militarily but you could
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.560]  just let the citizens be called in by the police they could deal with it if
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.760]  you'd let the citizens just be armed the cities that'll burn will be New York and
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.520]  Chicago where they disarm the people but Obama has come out and said Chicago is
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:54.280]  the model of the country really we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.440]  criminals at the top that are trying to manipulate good people throughout the
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.880]  system to do bad that's why they tried to sell us that torture is good and
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.680]  secret arrest is good and cruise missiles are tough and armed drones are good and

[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:43.400]  owning conservatives libertarians constitutionalist it's a takeover and
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.360]  they bragged they did it it's a banking takeover now they want physically
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.040]  controlled they want a national security state over everything all over the US
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.960]  they got public school kids trained to spy on their parents that's in the news
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.800]  they're forcibly inoculating little kids all over the country without parental
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.480]  consent we're already living under incredible tyranny they're doing forced
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.800]  Gardasil shots killing people all over Mexico right now the Gardasil shots here

[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.960]  already living under crazy land they're already grabbing little kids and putting
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.320]  them on chemotherapy and killing them
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:32.280]  just two weeks ago Harvard came out with a decade-long study I said over a
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.800]  dozen it was more than 20 major in-depth studies that they collated and said yes
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:41.000]  sodium fluoride is brain damaging the public the IQ has been reduced everywhere
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:48.520]  it's used and bone cancer is up sevenfold and it's deadly poison but if I go
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:53.000]  down to the city council and I've done it the mayor will laugh and walk off when
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.080]  we bring in scientists and top doctors university heads fly them in from all
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:03.160]  over the world to present this and the mayor gets up and laughs okay and that's
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.360]  this attitude people have been so comfortable with evil for so long that
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.400]  you can't even recognize it anymore let me tell you what you will recognize
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.440]  though those of you that serve this system you're gonna recognize when you
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.280]  get that early diagnosis of cancer or your kid does or your wife or husband
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.880]  you're gonna get religion when the IRS comes it takes your house when you know
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.040]  you paid all the taxes that are unconstitutional to begin with now I
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.840]  wish you don't have to go through this pain that a lot of people that to go
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.120]  through to wake up but this thing's coming to a head I want to take a few
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.320]  calls we're gonna have Sherry pill Jackson for the balance of the
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.320]  transmission today we've got Joe Bannister in studio former Treasury
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.600]  agent who found out the IRS collects money for the private Federal Reserve as
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.360]  Ronald Reagan's own Commission showed they arrested him twice and tried to put
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.880]  him in prison for it but juries found him not guilty that did not happen with
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:02.280]  Sherry P. L. Jackson has got a new book coming out dealing with all of this she
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:05.640]  was an IRS agent we're gonna be breaking down all this fraud with their order to
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.480]  give out fake ID numbers tax IDs which then can be tied to social security
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:13.400]  numbers of real citizens and then the citizens don't get their refund checks
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.040]  the citizens get their bank accounts grabbed and the IRS goes ahead with it
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.200]  I've got the whistleblowers you've seen the national news I told you about it
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.440]  before it broke I'm just so overworked I couldn't collate it all together and
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.760]  couldn't get them in here been talking to one of them three years there's a
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:30.520]  total collapse at the main IRS center nationwide here in Austin because
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.560]  because they now know they work for a private Federal Reserve they now know
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.040]  the money doesn't go to run the country they now know the 70 plus percent of the
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:44.760]  new money they're getting is from retirees where they've changed the rules
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.960]  and are taking their money we're gonna get to her in a moment and we're gonna
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.560]  talk about all the fraud and context of this not just her case but it was a
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.040]  former fraud investigator what she saw because the same thing she went through
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.400]  is now happening but they can't jail all of them but let me tell you when these
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:04.040]  whistleblowers try to expose what's happening they put them in prison they
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:11.680]  put them in prison my dad in the 80s lived in middle-class area had the two
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.480]  nice cars the IRS came and said we've retroactively changed the rules we want
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.840]  all this money penalties and he said but I've got all my receipts I paid the
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.800]  taxes they said mr. Jones were criminals pay us we're gonna put you in
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:29.160]  prison well if you're not a criminal they put you in prison we're gonna be
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.240]  talking to her in a moment but I'm also gonna hit some other news here but let's
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.200]  real quick take two calls mark in Texas former police officer current
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:44.160]  correctional officer what's your intel on 1.4 million excuse me 1.4 billion
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.720]  rounds of 40 cowl now purchased in the last year 750 mil ordered last week by
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.880]  DHS top story at info wars.com what's your take on this massive military
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:00.120]  buildup against the American people well Alex you're a national treasure by the
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.960]  way my intake I is one big year enough okay these shootings that are happening
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.140]  the other day like the so-called Batman shooting and the shooting at the
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.920]  sick temple just goes to show you that they're setting they're setting things
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.760]  up and by the way I've connected the dots I called a few weeks earlier after
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.960]  the I think was last week actually about the six shootings and I said that I
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:31.120]  know about the right wing websites I go to both extreme right and extreme
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:37.640]  left-wing websites I know my history the six and not considered first of all
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.040]  these a neo-nazi would know that the six are not Muslims and they also
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.160]  identify with the Indian Indian Indian people as a whole because Himmler used
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:57.640]  to carry a copy to buy a bagada with him during the NIT days so I mean this is
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.520]  obvious that this was just a government setup they figured people are stupid
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.120]  enough or ignorant enough not to understand this and both of these guys
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:12.080]  have really have actually military mind control connections and as far as the
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.480]  ammunition goes today it's my opinion that they're gearing up they're also
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.360]  trying to take a lot of this ammunition off the market so we can't get it
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.320]  because they know they can't really come down in the Second Amendment so they're
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.560]  trying to drive the ammunition pool you're right but they could do anything
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.360]  they could they could release a bio weapon you name it everything is gearing
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.680]  up towards a design collapse so we're so diverted by the collapse they don't go
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.680]  to jail for fast and furious and the rest of it good to hear from you real fast
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:51.600]  Jay in Indiana you're on the air you've got info on ammo deliveries go ahead go

[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.360]  expert fraud investigator what's happening a cherry peel Jackson good to
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:56.160]  have you with us thank you Alex for having me on your show I really
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.240]  appreciate you for everything that you've done I actually did not learn
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.520]  about the fraud until after I left I left the IRS in 95 because as a Christian
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.000]  mother I felt like I was putting too much time into what was going on outside
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.640]  of the household so I came home to be Jim Cleaver and at that point I guess
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:19.200]  people felt freer to ask me questions and the year 1999 and 2000 people were
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.080]  asking a lot of questions about you know is this income tax real and it got to the
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.200]  point where pastors were asking me so I started trying to do research found out
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:32.080]  about the USA today the first ad that we the people put out and within that ad
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.120]  was a challenge of $50,000 challenge for anybody to prove that Americans people
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.880]  that work and live within the 50 states liable for the income tax so you know
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:47.760]  $50,000 to me pretty good amount of money and started doing research a couple
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.240]  of weeks later I was stuck I still had my codes and regulations and all these
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.560]  things in front of me but I wasn't finding what I needed to win that
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:01.720]  $50,000 and the thing that really woke me up and snapped the light on was
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.600]  actually the Federal Reserve being not federal and then collecting $40 million
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.400]  an hour in interest from the American people and I thought about wait a minute
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.320]  this is slavery so I started digging more and ended up finding out about we the
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.600]  people in Joe Bannister and everything went on if everything went on from
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:24.400]  there and then they set you up in three in prison yeah well I became more than a
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.360]  low-flying that at that point especially the late great Aaron Russo's movie
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:33.480]  America freedom of fascism when that came out I guess that really set him off
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.760]  by the way that was seen by about 50 million people conservatively that was
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.520]  a big deal great I was hearing that people over in the Middle East our
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.960]  soldiers over there have been seen the movie as a matter of fact when I was in
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:50.320]  the prison I got letters from soldiers you know they blessed my heart because
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.920]  they are becoming aware of what's really happening here in our country did the
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.280]  jail guards know they had a completely innocent person in there yeah some of
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:04.880]  them actually did come up to me sometimes and pull me aside and say I
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.720]  didn't know you're a celebrity and you know at the little jailhouses that I
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.560]  was at and the prison you know at least one person every time came up to me and
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.520]  that I know who you are so it was interesting but again they're locked
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.640]  in a job they don't want to speak out because they are afraid the fear in
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:28.960]  this country is breathtaking Alex that's right and we've got to get past the
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.800]  fear if we're gonna get saved here it's the fear that lets the evil take over
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.600]  that's true that's true and I don't know people don't understand that but we've
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.520]  gotten in a comfort zone that unfortunately is taking the country down
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:44.920]  and it is going down fast wow Sherry pill Jackson and but I remember later you

[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.600]  on screen for folks sherry this is a short segment just wanted to introduce
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:36.880]  you in this hour hold another hour coming up but but briefly and we'll talk
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:41.340]  about your case when we come back what did you discover the income tax was from
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:46.160]  your own research as a former IRS fraud investigator. I discovered that it
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.440]  doesn't apply to us there's a lot of research out there I think that they
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.040]  make it difficult I think that they separate things in different books and
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:58.480]  the easiest way to deceive people is to hide things in these books these codes
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:02.160]  and regulations so when you research them the first thing that people do is
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:07.340]  they get bogged down and they give up but people like Larkin Rose and Tommy
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:10.760]  Crier and Jill Bannister and VVT and others they didn't give up and when you
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:15.920]  get down to the bottom of it it's just a gigantic monster with tentacles that is
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:22.960]  daily regularly raping us it's not something that we as people that live
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.400]  here should be paying it's for non resident aliens and foreign corporations
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:34.000]  or the privilege of working here they are the ones that should pay the taxes
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.760]  impulse excise duties and tariffs should be being to be paid by other
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:46.000]  countries yet through some special deals these other countries are not paying
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.480]  for instance from what I understand countries like China don't have to pay
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:54.000]  any excises and duties at least yeah so it's really written as a tariff but then
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.480]  it only applies on us when you're not supposed to apply tariffs to domestic
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:02.760]  grips and it's just like the illegal aliens are above the law right right so
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:07.480]  the whole thing is it's just a big fraud and people are being we were being
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:12.120]  demoralized we have God given right and our rights to live and be able to
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:17.920]  support ourselves and our families have been run over because if you can tax a
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.400]  man 1% you can tax them a hundred percent and he's asleep the power to tax is
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:28.040]  the power to destroy and our tax policies are set by offshore banks that now
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.600]  brag they've captured the country we're always remember that they now brag

[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:54.200]  then ended up getting thrown in prison sherry start getting into well well
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.880]  first let's get into your research when we come back from break this is a short
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.600]  segment long segment coming up we'll get into your imprisonment and take some
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:06.640]  phone calls but I mean what was it like for you when you started investigating
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:09.800]  it and finding out that the conspiracy theorists were actually the people that
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.400]  were telling the truth you know I didn't look at people as conspiracy theorists
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  in the first place my father always taught me to be very very open so when
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.600]  I started hearing and I just kind of filed it in the back of my head it's
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.240]  something and I should research you know at some point but when so many people
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:28.040]  started asking me questions about it and I started seeing information and yes I
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.880]  did one of the women at my church gave me one of Erwin's books and I started
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:39.600]  reading it and I was making sense and as I got into it I saw you know with the
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:45.120]  the rabbit hole just started to go deeper and deeper and I felt like the rug
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.200]  had been taken from under me just pulled from under me because we've been
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:52.280]  living a lie all that time I was at the IRS thinking oh you know I'm doing this
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.960]  for the country and these bad people aren't paying their taxes and when I
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.440]  before I quit I started seeing you know that the damage that the income tax was
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:04.040]  doing you know breaking up families and closing down businesses for people who
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:08.400]  were just trying to make it and just didn't have the extra resources so when
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:12.600]  I saw the research and found out that this was something that was not applicable
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:16.400]  to us I started thinking about my own family you know my children they want a
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.920]  nice life and the Federal Reserve isn't federal and it's owned by the wealthy
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.960]  banking family so their children's children's children never have to work
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:29.840]  a day in their life but you know my family's slaving away just to make ends meet
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:33.280]  and to get my children a college education and that's wrong and it didn't
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.600]  matter what color people were it didn't matter what your religion is it's just
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.720]  this broad goes way up they don't care who we are they don't care what color we
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.000]  are they just want to keep us down and that's when I started speaking I don't
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.800]  want to be kept down this is something that does not it's not for anybody but
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.600]  especially for somebody that has worked hard and always been an
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.000]  upstanding person well you just hit the nail on the head to interrupt that's it
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.080]  I instinctively get upset by people wanting me to not do good I mean I mean
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.840]  these are bad people that admit they want to make us all poor so they can
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:13.000]  control us these are bad people right and the control is not for them over us
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.360]  we're supposed to be in control of ourselves we've got it ahead so I had a
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.720]  meeting I had to make a decision whether I was going to be an informed slave or
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.840]  get off the plantation and I decided that I was gonna get off the plantation I
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.720]  knew that it could come to them going after me but it was more important for
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.880]  me to sleep at night and it was more important for me to stop the rate
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.360]  because I didn't try to stop the rate 15 years from now they were gonna be
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:41.960]  ranked in my daughter and I didn't want that exactly the evil grows and it
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.800]  doesn't feed people that live in fear never get it they're so afraid once you
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.800]  stop being afraid and just say I'm trusting in God I'm doing the right
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.760]  thing I'm standing up doesn't mean I'm perfect God help me I'm weak but just
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.080]  that's that's when your life becomes empowered even if you get persecuted and
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:02.000]  I think you imply in your writings of that that being persecuted to make you
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.200]  even stronger hasn't it yeah it really has you know that when the when we get
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:10.680]  somebody said we're like teabags we really find out who we are when we get
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:13.840]  put in the hot water and I've been in the hot water but one of the things that
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.240]  resonated in my mind as I was reading back when I was studying it was the
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:22.040]  founding father I read something by Thomas Payne he said is there be trouble
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:27.160]  let it be in my day that my child may have peace that's the way these founding
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:30.320]  fathers thought and a lot of people say oh you shouldn't be doing this and I
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.480]  said what if the founding father didn't do what they did and you still be a
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.960]  King George and I stay there stay there come back and repeat that and expand on
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:43.360]  that that's right and this is something that I have to go to sleep at night and
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:46.720]  I couldn't go to sleep knowing what I know and knowing that I was leaving my
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:52.360]  children this this of rolling snowballs down the hill I had to do something stay
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.080]  there I'm gonna come back get into what you were just saying and then go to phone
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:59.640]  calls and everything we'll we'll be back

[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:35.760]  they said hadn't paid their college loans of course statutorily it's not
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.720]  illegal and they didn't statutorily have the power to have a SWAT team but who
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.280]  cares I just do what you want and we have 1.4 billion rounds 250 million last
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.920]  year 450 million this year and other 750 million rounds this just came out of
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:55.640]  this weekend purchased by the Department of Homeland Security of 40 caliber and
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.880]  other calibers the story up an info wars dot com and I saw a report a while back
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.400]  where the IRS expanded its special response team with 1.2 billion dollars
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:10.960]  of weapons and training so they can have more of them raiding us and attacking us
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:18.000]  and going after us IRS forms SWAT team for tax dodger crackdown and again now
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.880]  you get a 4 a.m. raid because the collection agency for the private
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:26.440]  fellow reserve says so it's all about fear we're not just going to take the

[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:02.560]  ago now seven or eight years ago time flies and sort of speaking out against
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:08.320]  this they came in locked her up and tell us how they set you up put you in
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.680]  jail because they tried that with Joe Bannister twice was an armed Treasury
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:14.920]  agent back when they used the Treasury Department didn't have their own giant SWAT
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.520]  teams and armored vehicles and think about it now they just send the SWAT
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  team to your house I mean it's just wow these are criminals so hardcore but
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.680]  Sherry Peele Jackson joins us she's got a new book coming out you can find out
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.720]  more at Sherry Peele Jackson dot org so you wake up you you see the National

[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:42.440]  Federal Reserve you know citizens are exempt it's all a fraud that you the
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:46.400]  ultra-rich all know this they wrote the law with loopholes it doesn't run the
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.880]  country you find this out you start speaking out what happened to you
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.520]  originally nothing so I started talking about it in 2000 2001 that's when we did
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:04.480]  the ads in the USA Today with We The People but in 2004 it's seven o'clock in
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.560]  the morning somebody was knocking wildly at the door and when I went to the door
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:13.960]  I had that little red laser on my head and there were I have a little window on
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:19.040]  each side of my door and there was a gun pointing at me through this window and I
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.080]  had been downstairs in my office so all I had on was a p-shirt and I'm standing
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.960]  there thinking okay these people are screaming screaming at me to open this
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:32.520]  door either I ignore them and they shoot me and my children run downstairs and see
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:37.240]  me laying in a pool of blood or I open the door at that point my husband came
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:40.280]  down the stairs because he was upstairs and I opened the door and they just
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.880]  rushed in there were 15 to 20 of them they were even in the backyard with metal
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:50.120]  detectors to see if I had some kind of a something buried in the backyard they
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:56.480]  went all through the house and they stayed from 7 to 445 or so and took 32
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.400]  boxes and went away at that point a couple of attorneys told me that you
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.960]  know they've taken this information and they're bound to indict you it didn't
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:12.920]  happen until 2007 and they didn't indict me they never did feel unfeel the order
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.080]  because the attorneys tried to get the information they wouldn't unfeel it so
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:20.080]  finally the little sheet came out saying that oh we're going to go into her
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:22.800]  house and we're going to find all these felonies I think there were four or five
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.200]  felonies that they said to the judge that they were going to find so the judge
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.640]  gave a permission to raise us and they didn't find any felonies because the
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.880]  only thing I was doing is telling people what I learned I didn't tell people
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:40.000]  what to do I didn't tell people to pay a tax or not to pay a tax or file a tax
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.080]  return or not let's be specific they tried to they tried to arrest a bunch of
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.120]  people and they I've seen them do these SWAT team raids when somebody films the
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.560]  police in Illinois and they do the raid to show the jury like look they're bad
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:58.560]  we SWAT team them so here they are with the lasers these are childlike people
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:04.600]  that like to intimidate folks trying to terrorize you now do they have local
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.440]  SWAT team you or was it a Department of Treasury or IRS SWAT team to you know to
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:14.360]  there to punish you to try to scare you or hopefully make you run so they could
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.400]  shoot you in the back that may be but your savvy listeners are going to pick up
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.500]  on what I'm going to say first I live in DeKalb County Georgia the first two
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:29.720]  people in the door opening up my door were two DeKalb County police officers
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:33.960]  can you say jurisdiction anyway they open the door and then the other ones
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:39.880]  would be I think they had IRS on it that came in and they just started running
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.180]  all over the house I don't know what they had been told they came in like I
[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:47.560]  was some kind of a terrorist with thousands of guns we don't even have a
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:52.560]  gun and you know no no it's part of the theater because they're so bad they have
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:56.440]  to hyperventilate and run around like you're bad I mean it's all part of the
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:02.040]  bizarreness of this but please continue I honestly think and when I looked into
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:06.840]  the eyes of some of those agents that they were very surprised whatever they
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:09.920]  were told was very different from what they found they found that just a
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.560]  Christian family in a house and they didn't find anything else and they went
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:19.480]  away so in 2007 I was never indicted because I was not brought up on any
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:25.800]  felony because no I mean it was purely intimidation right yeah right they
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:31.040]  brought an information force as opposed to an indictment and information is what
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:35.160]  they bring forth when someone is being charged with a misdemeanor so I was
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:41.320]  charged with misdemeanor willful failure to file tax return however in order for
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:50.200]  that to be the case I would have known that I was liable for the income tax so
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:56.880]  since I knew that I wasn't liable then I was never guilty however we have
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.760]  Americans that have been dumbed down to the point where either they have no
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:08.760]  clue about what's going on they don't care or they're in fear I asked to ask
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:12.600]  the question I was not or my attorney was not able to ask this question but the
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:19.720]  question that I wanted to pose to the jury was would you acquit Ms. Jackson would
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:26.360]  you found her not guilty how many of you I take that back how many of you are too
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:32.000]  afraid to acquit her for fear that you'll be next I know in my heart that
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.360]  everybody in that room would have raised their hand and so the person that has to
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:40.120]  go to court basically is lost when they first get in the door and all because of
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.640]  fear this is an empire of fear where foreign banks run us through a
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.360]  communist manifesto that says in it a graduated income tax it's in the
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.880]  communist manifesto that's in the planks in fact I forget which blanket is guys
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:56.160]  we pull up the 10 planks and I can read it to people and it just all operates out
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:00.080]  of fear I can't tell you how many people the military police you name and I
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.080]  talked to they go oh we know what you're saying is right but they'll come get us
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:09.760]  if we do anything look I'm an example of being bold and and God protecting me
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.960]  but I've had some bad things happen but you know every time I go through the
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.640]  fear you know God God brings me the next level but even if I was killed
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.840]  tomorrow I wouldn't be mad at God because I understand it's all part of the
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.720]  larger plan but I just don't get how we became a land of the coward home of the
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.840]  slaves I just comfortable hmm we got very comfortable we started watching that
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:34.160]  thing that I call the electronic income reducer what you might call the
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:38.760]  television yes and for our children the electronic intellect reducer we started
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:42.520]  paying attention to everything that this thing said in the media and we started
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:47.160]  losing our grip on reality we started being group thinkers as opposed to
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:50.560]  individual thinkers and those of us that think individually are the ones that
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:55.320]  are being persecuted and prosecuted when I was there's a saying I don't know who
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:58.240]  said it so I'm not plagiarizing when the government fears the people there's
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:01.600]  liberty but when the people fear the government government there's fear and
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:05.040]  that's where we are that's what I feel that's what I feel like we're there the
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:10.480]  people fear the government and now government you notice yearly gets more
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.040]  crazy than the year before let's put it up on screen it's the second plank of the
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:22.560]  communist manifesto and it says a heavy progressive or graduated income tax
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:29.680]  that's the 16th amendment 1913 Social Security Act joint house resolution so
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:36.320]  there you go and that's how they do it go ahead cherry the point behind it is
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:42.280]  we we the solution is we have got to get the people to understand that whatever
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:46.200]  life they're living and whatever they're trying to protect is not worth what's
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:49.480]  gonna happen if they don't step out and at least start paying attention to what's
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:55.040]  going on because you know they a lot of people think that oh well I haven't done
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:59.000]  anything I could never be put in prison what nothing could be further so the
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.920]  people whatever they are fearful of it it doesn't matter because they're not
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:05.760]  protecting themselves they don't understand it whatever they're doing is
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:09.920]  not protecting them it's making them more that's right people think cowering
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:14.200]  helps them and when a nation start a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:20.240]  right where we're going and that's where we're going and one of the things I
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.120]  wanted to make sure that I didn't forget to say about guns I know you were
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.560]  talking about guns and ammunition prior to me coming on but from what I
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:35.240]  understand the felon can't have a gun and this is becoming prisonation so we
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:43.040]  have over a million people that have a felony so for every home that has a
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:46.680]  felon there's not supposed to be a gun there oh there's a lot more than a
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:52.360]  million felons okay so that's a way of hearing down the second amendment by
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:55.000]  coming in the back door
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.240]  well no that's right you're absolutely right on that front don't even see that
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.560]  hey we it was all these people millions of homes don't have guns or not
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.720]  supposed to because these people have felons well if you just don't have your
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.520]  protection it's gonna be easy for anybody to come and roll over you all right
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:17.200]  sherry peel jack so we're gonna go to break and come back and talk to Andy and
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.240]  Richard and a whole bunch others that want to talk to you and then Joe
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:24.280]  Bannister is gonna pop in a little bit with you but before you leave I want to
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:31.200]  spend some time on just the fact that the IRS now gives people tax ID numbers
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:34.240]  they know we're being attached to other social security numbers they're being
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  blocked from going after the illegal aliens and criminal grips but using it
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:44.400]  the person whose credit is clouded to grab their bank account and actually
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.760]  punish the citizen who's been set up for what the illegal did I mean so now the
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:54.000]  IRS is setting people up and it's actually freaking out the workers most
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.520]  of which are a bunch of well-meaning socialists that really think the IRS
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:03.440]  money goes to run the country the worst drought in 50 years continues and the
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:07.800]  first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the

[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:16.920]  were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns I kept thinking what if my family
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.440]  had been home the police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:25.960]  through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders the officer told

[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:26.760]  know they do this so much they plan on wearing a shout I need to tweak this
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.200]  out to everybody Paul Watson did a story on it YouTube threatens to terminate
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:36.720]  account over criticism of copyright policy it's worse than that I'm gonna
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:40.840]  explain it briefly at the start of the next segment it's my voice and a pattern
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.520]  has emerged now where they're flagging videos on my channel and others saying
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:50.280]  my voice me talking is copyright and I I did a video about it and they they
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:54.080]  banned that video and did a community strike and are trying to shut a channel
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:59.360]  with 230 million views and down I mean it's just incredible and again they
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:05.320]  advertise as a commons it's false advertising so I don't know what to do
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:08.440]  because they can shut us down here they'll shut us down everywhere so I'm
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:12.160]  gonna have to fight this that's all I can say I know they're a big monolith I
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:17.240]  mean it's pure NSA let's talk to Andy in Hawaii you're on the air with Sherry
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:24.640]  Peel Jackson sent to prison for telling people the IRS was a fraud and we'll
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:28.800]  get her take on Erwin Schiff Peter Schiff's father wrote his book and a
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.880]  judge said don't publish that book and then he kept selling it and they put him
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:36.760]  in jail he's still in there in fact briefly we'll go to Andy here in a
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:39.400]  minute continue with calls Joe's only popping in for about five minutes but
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:43.000]  briefly Sherry what's your take on Erwin Schiff how long is he gonna be in
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.920]  prison unfortunately he may be in there for the rest of his life Erwin Schiff has
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:51.960]  put together some great information and his information is found and he
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:58.440]  definitely researched it Erwin's very outspoken and he upset judges and
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:02.440]  other people so they want to make an example of him as they make made an
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.760]  example of me and some others and Erwin's a good guy and I just you know my
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:10.600]  heart goes out for him and the others that have been put in there for a long
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:16.160]  period of time and we're gonna talk to a man coming up who they arrested twice
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:21.160]  and try to put in jail former Treasury agent for speaking out I mean man I mean
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:24.480]  they do not want this information getting covered do they Sherry no they
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:28.680]  don't and the more they try to suppress it the more it gets out especially with
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:34.560]  Aaron Russo's movie and Joe Bannister a great book that he put out his trial was
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:38.720]  a little different and his trial was one of the first of us an agent and what
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:44.040]  happened was they let the jury see his video but by the time they got to me
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.240]  they'd learn from their mistakes so a lot of the a lot of my evidence was
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:52.200]  suppressed yeah there's such a cult they were showing videos of people talking
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:56.640]  and exposing it and they thought well that's reasonable right we talked to
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.720]  jurors after Joe I actually flew out to Joe Joe and our very good friends I flew
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:04.200]  out to his trial and I was out in California for two weeks and after the
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:08.080]  trial was over we talked to the jury and they would say you know he what he
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:14.720]  saying is is reasonable and he he's a sound person even one of his co-workers
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:20.680]  was able to testify on his behalf concerning his character well now
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:25.800]  they're expanding a 1.2 billion dollar snatch and grab squad at the IRS this
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:30.240]  is really creepy folks let's go get Andy sorry in Hawaii go ahead and make your
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:35.800]  point thanks for holding hi Alex long-time listener present planet TV
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:39.960]  subscriber first-time caller so a big aloha from Hawaii to both of my true
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.320]  American heroes you and Sherry well brother we're not heroes we're just
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.280]  trying to survive but thank you thank you okay hello Sherry first of all I
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:53.920]  want to let you know you changed my life after seeing freedom to fascism that
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.560]  movie and your testimony in there led me into my research to you know after years
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:04.160]  of you know doing my research I came to find the same thing that you found that
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:09.640]  there is no law and your video your parts of freedom to fascism did change my
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:15.400]  life second I want to tell you my story briefly after I did some research like
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:19.280]  you did you know I started signing up for the tax honesty movement things like
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.120]  that so just all the callers up there this is so real that you got to be
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.520]  careful they they came at me with the you know the club and pretty much
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:33.200]  claimed that I know I had owed them $40,000 when in fact I didn't so short
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.800]  story after about $10,000 in attorney fees they said oh sorry and you only
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:43.480]  owe us $3,900 so this is a typical stuff that I've learned from the IRS listen
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:47.680]  listen they knowingly give illegals under orders tax IDs and then they let
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:51.920]  them use them in citizens names and then they come that's the rest of the story
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:57.160]  and take the citizens bank account and refunds I mean there it's not enough now
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:01.560]  they're now using illegals to set up citizens that this is a criminal
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:06.960]  organization that is now kicking all the useful idiots out and converting to
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:10.960]  pure mafia criminality because before they operated in ignorance oh we got to
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:14.760]  keep these tax cheaters in line oh we'll break a few eggs oh it'll keep the
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.000]  now they know it all goes off to our banks so all the old guards being thrown
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.320]  out just like TSA they're bringing in actual criminals like a lot of the big
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:28.200]  head TSA people is turning on our pedophiles and they hired the head of
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:32.160]  Penn State who helped cover up to now be in a special homeland security position
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:40.600]  so secret they won't say my word is it's over TSA rollout in all places the
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:45.080]  streets of America but that's in the Washington Post so I mean that's who
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:48.760]  they are brigades of pedophiles all right we'll be right back stay with us

[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:47.440]  control down to the local level does that make me crazy well possibly we're
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.360]  gonna talk about some censorship issues here for a moment but let me engage in a
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:55.720]  crash commercial for people watching at prisonplanet.tv and people watching on
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:59.280]  the radio as well because I was back there getting one of these as I usually
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:03.000]  do it about 130 central instead of having a bunch of coffee I have a
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.720]  polymers and I have the new polymers plus that I like so much I'm on the

[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.080]  base form of caffeine but if I drink a bunch of coffee I end up getting headaches
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.000]  to stay energized in the nightly news the rest of us and those work 18 hours a
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.640]  day not with polymers plus this is less caffeine than a regular cup of coffee
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:35.360]  but I usually have to take like one a day maybe if I'm working till midnight or
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:38.960]  doing coast to coast AM overnight I'll take two you know one at 130 and then

[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.280]  bad coffee is great it's just this stuff has all these vitamins and minerals in
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:40.040]  it and it's just supercharged so info wars team.com okay let me shift gears
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:43.680]  before you go to Joe Bannister and the rest of your calls and political
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.320]  prisoner Sherry Peele Jackson they learned from Joe Bannister's trial and
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.960]  when when the jury said not guilty for the First Amendment and so they were
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:57.240]  able to get her and others thanks to brainwashing and fear of the public
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:02.720]  there's an article up at info wars.com and prisonpunna.com with video YouTube
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.720]  threatens to terminate account over criticism of copyright and this new
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.360]  thing is happening in the last six months or so where I have guests on and
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:18.640]  the videos get banned or restricted or have copyright claims put on them and
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:22.200]  ads placed over them and all sorts of stuff when I have a guest on air like
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:27.880]  Joe Rogan and then Joe never said do that it's happened with my voice now and I
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:31.560]  know it's not even the companies that are doing this people sample my voice for
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.200]  record companies and then computers hear my voice and say everything that my
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.840]  voice is on is owned by the record company so I'm not even blaming the
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:44.000]  record company or the artist or whatever it's it's that they register to have
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.760]  their song protected in a system and then my voice is in the song so the
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.520]  original video my voice is in endgame is restricted now I did a video it was
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:00.360]  very polite but I said I've warned the people that are doing this claims two
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.920]  other times on air I said take the claim off of endgame because we see when
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:07.840]  they put these claims on sometimes suddenly it just takes it down well
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.000]  they gave us a strike saying YouTube says I am a fraud but we can show you
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:18.920]  their notice they said for misleading fraud and basically say I do not own my
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:23.680]  voice so this is how they can censor the web and censor everything and it's a
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.720]  big deal you know most people are upset by this but we see this happen you know
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:31.040]  now on a routine basis if we ever just give into this it's over then I hear the
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.480]  comments about well you know YouTube's its own company really it's called
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:43.440]  YouTube it advertises as a comments and then you go and follow all their rules
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:47.520]  and then they keep banning the channel knocking it down out to file you have to
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.720]  follow on their site you're swearing in federal court it's filed before federal
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:55.440]  court through their systems that you know you own this you own that you didn't
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.360]  do this you know we show you a helicopter blowing up a tank that the
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.400]  military releases it's on a hundred plus channels and on the news they ban our
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:07.880]  channel they're doing everything they can to shut it down now look don't let
[02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:13.680]  that stop you become a prison planet TV member it's 595 a month six
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.920]  memberships a month for 595 because you get one it's really six that just pays
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:23.640]  for our bandwidth and all of you put it on daily motion Vmo blip TV all of them
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:27.080]  we need you to get everything from the nightly news and put it everywhere
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:31.480]  including YouTube so they shut down one of our big juggernaut channels with 230
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:37.160]  million views that's their issue I mean just the incredible research films that
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:41.920]  all the dedication all of the work we've done on every subject like Gardasil
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:47.280]  killing people all of it they want to erase it because it just keeps going
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:50.800]  more and more viral all the videos that are on there so we all see people to go
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:55.760]  copy you know the really high quality high production value stuff that's up
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:59.200]  there oh here's another one multiple people shot near Texas A&M
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:03.080]  University that's right up the street police took a man out of custody Monday
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.520]  after multiple people were shot near Texas A&M University several law
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.680]  enforcement officers were among the people shot Rhonda Seton of college
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:13.320]  station police department told CNN she didn't have information on how people
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:17.320]  were shot or their conditions so the person identified as the government was
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:22.560]  in custody huh shooting happened about a block from campus University had warned
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:25.960]  people to stay away from the intersection okay we'll keep from I'll tell you
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:29.000]  they want they got all the gun bills introduced and just magically it's all
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.200]  happening and witnesses always see other shooters and they're always in army
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:36.200]  psyops but there's nothing going on everything's fine they just ordered
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:42.480]  750 thousand 750 million more rounds it's 1.4 billion now to fight us with and
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:45.280]  this may be a lone nut but the other two cases that happened the last month
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.880]  weren't okay I'm gonna shut up now the point is if we fall if our free speech
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:58.120]  goes it all goes and sure we're on XM 166 I see Andy waiting you know to be
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:03.000]  going there sure on over 115 AM and FM stations but that hits a certain audience
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.200]  and it's big YouTube could hit anybody in the world it's not compartmentalized
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:10.480]  and we're reaching let's be conservative just from what I've counted with all
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:16.520]  our channels the other ones and seven eight nine ten million a week on YouTube
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.040]  I mean they the system does not like that I have an audience of seven to ten
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:23.800]  million people a week on there we're not gonna shoot a video on any topic and it
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:28.040]  gets on average about 300,000 views in a couple weeks and the system does not
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:34.080]  like that okay they do not like it at all I mean we destroyed the county 2012
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:39.080]  scam and even got credit for that in the news I mean we're we're dangerous to the
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:44.200]  system and again we're here because of your prayers and we're here because well
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:46.880]  let me ask you a banister that question I'm gonna go back to Sherry pill Jackson
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:50.880]  political prisoner they tried to put you in prison multiple times for your free
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.360]  speech as a former armed treasury agent who found out the IRS was a fraud the
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:58.520]  income tax was a fraud and you just started speaking out so they arrested
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:02.320]  you that was back in the late 90s and then they arrested you a few years later
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:07.840]  because you were in you know national TV ads and radio and print so they went
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:11.200]  after your speech they swat teamed her later and put her in jail why do you
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:15.200]  think I'm still on air Joe I don't mean to spring that question on you I wanted
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:19.280]  you to come on talk about Sherry but all this is coming to a head they tried to
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:23.040]  put you in prison they put her in prison they put others in prison why am I
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:29.040]  still alive why am I not in prison well exposure is a double-edged sword but I
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:36.160]  I pursued it as did Sherry and anybody that's that's doing the right thing you
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.400]  definitely want to get exposure and you've gotten it and you deserve it and
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:44.240]  you've helped other people to get exposure I I truly believe that people
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:50.000]  like you Alex have kept us at least safer than we would have been if not
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:55.400]  entirely safe so you know we all have our hats off to you for no no no no I
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:58.040]  mean I wasn't even asking I mean I know they don't want to kill me because it
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:01.880]  will underline everything I said it turned me into a martyr and I also know
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:06.280]  God's in control but I still from the death threats years ago and physically
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:11.280]  being attacked and IRS stuff now it's like dead silence and they try to censor
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:14.880]  me and stuff and White House control grip said they want me shut down but I
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:18.320]  mean I think this shows they're not in complete control as well I mean I'm
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.480]  asking why do you think I'm still around just the exposure yeah exposure I mean
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.480]  there's an Alex Jones room I can guarantee you or at least a room that
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.760]  handles the people that are you know very much in the public eye and if they
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:35.920]  could find something to trip you up and discredit you they probably would but
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:39.840]  again and the exposure you're I think you're just light years ahead of them
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.440]  you and your crew are light years ahead of them because they are still
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:49.040]  bureaucrats I heard Max Kaiser's talking on your show yesterday about how many
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:51.880]  weeks you know the Europeans take vacation so you're not going to expect
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:56.240]  any stuff to happen because they're all on the beach well you know we do have
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:43:00.160]  that to deal with with the government they do like their long vacations and
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.480]  their big fat page and that's what Steve Botanic said he said it's too much
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:09.960]  paperwork to kill you I mean for the elite but but also I guess once you work
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:13.120]  for them even if you wake up to the right thing they almost see you like as
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:16.680]  their property because I've seen when you've been a federal agent or even
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:20.520]  local police whatever you do the right thing they really are scared of that
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:23.800]  because more people might follow that example I think that's why they tried to
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:28.600]  put you in prison yeah they definitely want to set an example and and scare away
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.680]  everyone else and of course they was Sherry they did that but thankfully you
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.640]  know Sherry's too strong for them and I'm sure her Christian faith is what
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.600]  what happens makes that happen and I God bless her and I'm just so you know I
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:47.080]  hope people will get out there and help Sherry we're all out there fighting you
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:52.120]  know the tax gladiators out here but Sherry's taken the biggest hit for sure
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:57.320]  and I just hope people will go to Sherry peel Jackson org and help the lady out I
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:00.560]  mean you know she's been putting her own time and her own money in this and you
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:05.480]  know what lost earnings are over a three and four and five-year period you know
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:10.400]  she needs our help and I'm just and I'm gonna order the book myself today I've
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:14.520]  I've got the advanced copy here but I'm gonna buy the beautiful hard copy there
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:19.000]  as well in fact Sherry briefly tell people about the new book that's coming
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.080]  out and what it deals with actually there are four of them I was very busy in
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.760]  prison I made sure that I set a standard I didn't play around and play cards and
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:33.160]  watch television I wrote so sure you've got three that are Christian books but
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:36.920]  but then you've also got the IRS one right right question a question people
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.480]  asked about prison life there are a lot of people that have no clue what really
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:46.120]  goes on in prison and I was in a prison camp and I was also in an FBI federal
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:50.120]  correctional Institute where the murderers I was in both places so I asked
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:53.720]  I asked for several questions my friends and family got together they were
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:58.040]  asking me so many questions anyway and I recorded them in a book it's called
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.000]  questions people asked about prison life answers from a former political
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.520]  prisoner and my other book wrongly convicted is of mostly my story but I
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:10.920]  talk about some of the other women that were in prison and I have a couple of
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:14.880]  other books that I wrote there so all of those are coming out all at the same
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.320]  time and there's a discount for all four actually I want to go to some calls
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:22.360]  here we're getting you back home when they're officially out but maybe we can
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:28.160]  carry them at info wars.com but the point here is all of the craziness is now
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.240]  coming out the weird sexual stuff by the people at Homeland Security the fast
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:38.360]  and furious the IRS giving people fake tax IDs in order to keep doing it and
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:42.800]  then blaming it on the citizens who they attach the IDs to I mean just that
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:47.200]  just inventing evil and I'm told by my whistleblowers here in Austin where this
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:51.320]  all broke last week that that that everybody's really freaking out now
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:56.200]  realizing wow we do collect money for offshore banks it is all a fraud and so I
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:01.280]  see a crisis of conscience what do you make of all these new reports coming
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:06.400]  out new depths of evil. I think it's like a horror movie to me they're getting more
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:12.200]  bold and brazen and I don't know how the people on the inside are reacting
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:16.400]  within the IRS the people that I talked to was in the prison system their
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:21.280]  sympathy was with me but they wanted to keep their job so they kept their mouths closed
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:26.640]  and I don't know you probably know some insiders that are talking more but I
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:32.120]  don't know how some of them can sleep at night. Well they told me they're ordered
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:37.920]  now retroactively it's not even a law it's just it's rulings to take 70 plus
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.560]  percent of the money they're now being told to target is just the middle class
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:45.920]  and blue collar retirees where they've got savings and they tell them well five
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:48.680]  years ago we really changed the rules so penalties and interest we want a
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:54.120]  million dollars on $200,000 you pulled out of your 401k and then they're
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:59.120]  taking their houses. Poor people don't have any money the wealthy people have
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:03.120]  lots of loopholes and they can hire high-powered attorneys so who's left those
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:06.520]  of us that are in the middle class we are the low-hanging proof on the tree and
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:10.240]  that's what they're going for and those are the people that have the fewer
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:14.120]  resources they don't have the money to go and get an attorney like Andy. Or they're
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:18.440]  so trusting in the system they think well okay just take everything I got. Joe I
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:23.320]  mean what do you think of all this evil coming out in the open now? I think it's
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:29.080]  a direct result Alex of hard work like people like Sherry you know Sherry Jackson
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:33.720]  gets people's attention and that's why she became a target and and she's not
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:38.760]  gonna stop getting people's attention and now probably hit the stratosphere you
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.520]  know having done the sacrifices that she's done but I think what's happening is
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.520]  that reverberation it gets through there like you said you know the IRS is don't
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:50.360]  listen to him and then everyone listens they used to say the same about Erwin
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:54.880]  Schiff when he was had the show in Las Vegas. The more that they try to put a
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:00.400]  lid on it the worse it becomes so I think it's you know we're doing the right
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.000]  thing we're doing a good thing and we just may not see the results of it. Sure
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.880]  I mean take Sandusky and the fact that the whole extra one at the top of the
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:12.560]  school was involved is a bunch of pedophiles now it's coming out I mean and
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:17.240]  good people or average people can't even imagine this but the people at the top
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:21.680]  are a bunch of demons. They are and unfortunately you know the government
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:26.280]  gets way too much credit you know in the jury box and and everywhere in the
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:32.120]  voting booth and the fact is they don't deserve the kind of you know credit that
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.680]  they're being given and people need to wake up and you Alex you say this all
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:41.640]  the time they think you're so stupid okay that is so apropos to what the
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.040]  government really thinks of the American people and I mean do you want to be
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:49.000]  taken for a fool over and over again I don't and I'm hoping you won't either.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.360]  Well you they've tried to put you in prison and then they learn from your
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:57.320]  case to put Sherry in prison and so many others it's just none of us are safe
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:00.800]  when innocent men and women can be thrown behind bars folks for their free
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.760]  speech like Erwin Schiff. Peter Schiff's father wrote a book and they said quit
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:07.880]  selling it or you're going to jail and he said I'm not they said all right
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.480]  basically you rest your life in prison I mean this is that what people are doing
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.680]  so you can have info. Let's talk to Richard in Texas and then we'll go to
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:21.080]  Andy. Richard you're on the air quick question for our guest. Yes ma'am. Thanks for
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:24.440]  taking my call. Yeah I want to know how she feels about clawing back the clergy
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:30.160]  respond preachers reverence pastors and getting them to help her in her quest
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:35.200]  to educate the public about the IRS and the Federal Reserve. I've been calling
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.520]  different shows trying to get them to not let not necessarily have a contest
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:42.800]  but just calling having your audience just as international call all the
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:46.600]  preachers clergy and literally claw them back like we're trying to claw back
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:50.680]  the park money we claw back some of those preachers her job would be a lot
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:54.760]  easier Mr. Jones your job would be a lot easier and all the rest of the GCN. No
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:59.600]  you're right I mean I saw a video some guy sent me saying you know Romans 13
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.120]  do whatever government says well that's not even what the Bible says and these
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:06.360]  churches will not talk about this because most of them aren't churches
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:12.680]  they're they're 501c3 creatures of the IRS sherry. That's right Richard that's a
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.480]  good question and before my prison experience I did try to get in touch
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:22.040]  with some pastors there were very few of them that were willing to go beyond the
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:26.880]  regular information that they wanted to put out I talked to one he said I'm not
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:31.680]  gonna walk that line this information is true but again there's that 501c3 and
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.600]  the 501c3 has put the government over God so has the only incorporation and
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:42.080]  Peter Kershaw has a wonderful book out called MCs of Grip and it talks about
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:47.640]  how churches undenounced to them in the beginning have gotten incorporated
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:53.360]  gotten the 501c3 and and they're muffled. Yeah we're gonna come right back stay
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:59.080]  there sherry and and Joe for to come right back and talk to Andy, David, Barry
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:03.680]  and Richard will at least get to those calls. Attention information in this one

[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:22.680]  ride two days on and take two days off after being on one world way I wrote
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:26.480]  10 days in a row and over 100 degree heat and then I take another two
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.120]  servings of one world way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:34.320]  half I just couldn't believe these results my normal muscle tightness and
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:38.600]  soreness after working out are virtually gone don't take my word for it one
[02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:43.720]  way comes in single servings just give it a try for a health and taste sensation

[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:36.280]  too much confusion I can't get no relief there are too many people out there that
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:41.520]  think that life is but a joke let's go ahead and go back to our guests a
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:45.160]  little bit of overdrive with them so I can get to everybody here let's go to
[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:49.840]  Andy in Alabama then David Perry Corey Jim here on the air with Sherry Pill
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.000]  Jackson and Joe Bannister both have been politically persecuted for working for
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.280]  the IRS and exposing the fact that it is a fraud let's go ahead Andy listening
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.880]  on XM-166 you're on the air go ahead
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:07.920]  I'm a health care provider work for one of the nation's largest health care
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.340]  corporations and like so many other millions of Americans that work for
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:15.760]  corporations has payroll departments that automatically take taxes out of your
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:19.280]  check you know there's so many others that are aware of this and are willing
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:25.120]  to stand up but you know being subject to these corporate policies to you know
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:29.200]  follow these court regulations I mean I don't see any other way out of it yeah
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:32.960]  that's the big problem with mega corporations is they now say you have
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:36.360]  to take all these vaccines that you're fired you have to take all these drug
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:43.480]  tests it's these jobs are prisons Sherry Joe well I think Andy is actually
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:47.200]  talking about the withholding yeah you do work for a big corporation and he
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:50.480]  there's nothing you can do I have friends that also work for corporations
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.480]  and they said well right now I can't go out on my own some people actually may
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.960]  quit and if they have a skill they can start their own business and redirect
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:02.800]  their resources to sure well I knew you were talking about withholding I'm just
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:05.640]  saying in general that's the that's why they want to shut down are you guys
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:09.960]  seeing the phenomenon of shutting down all the mom-and-pops everywhere yes yes
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.200]  and that's the shame because those are the people that we need to be supporting
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:17.880]  now the corporation most of them aren't even in the country oh they're all
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:21.440]  globalist the big ones yeah thank you Andy great points Joe any comments on
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.280]  what he said just a couple things I can think of if you go to truthattack.org
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:32.000]  and the pre-induction physical Tom Crier the deceased attorney he gives people a
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.280]  good way to kind of look at their situation and whether you know they're
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:40.720]  gonna butt up against the IRS or whether they're better off just you know
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:46.120]  paying the mafia to not break their legs and then supporting info wars
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:49.680]  supporting Sherry Peele-Jackson that's what we do you've got a you know we
[02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:53.760]  should do a whole show on Mr. Crier what if you beat the IRS in court great guy
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:59.440]  now now gone on to heaven yeah so there is some things people can do they can
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:03.080]  still help those that are on the front lines we've already made our decision
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:08.120]  don't necessarily fall in the sword yourselves support the front lines with

[02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:52.440]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hi this is Alex Jones
[02:58:52.440 --> 02:58:56.320]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:59.720]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:58:59.720 --> 02:59:03.860]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[02:59:03.860 --> 02:59:07.240]  that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:10.960]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:15.360]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:20.360]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[02:59:20.360 --> 02:59:23.640]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[02:59:23.640 --> 02:59:27.600]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre
[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:32.200]  crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:42.640]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:48.040]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[02:59:48.040 --> 02:59:51.360]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:58.800]  coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:15.680]  ladies and gentlemen we have Joe Bannister former treasury agent who spoke out
[03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:20.120]  against the fact that it's all a fraud at the IRS they tried to put in prison but
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:23.880]  jury found him not guilty Sherry Pill Jackson was a former criminal
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:28.560]  investigator who spoke out and was part of films and full-page ads in US today
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:32.440]  they swat teamed her kangaroo courted her and sent her to present for three
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:35.840]  years she's got a new book coming out next month and pre-order it at her site
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:42.320]  SherryPillJackson.org these are amazing people because we stand on their
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:46.360]  shoulders just like we stand on our forebearers shoulders and and look
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:51.040]  freedom is not given it's taken it's demanded we've got to stop being such
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.280]  pushovers let's go to Jim in Minnesota you're on the air with our guests go
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:02.160]  ahead yes we are being blackmailed okay now I would like to ask the question are
[03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:07.920]  you aware that social security numbers are only to be applied for pursuant to
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:13.520]  order and notice and that when we apply for them in the absence of order and
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.840]  notice we've committed a fraud we are impersonating government officers and
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:24.200]  employees social security numbers are only mandated for US government
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:30.040]  officers and employees sure what they do is they trick you into into taking one
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:33.880]  and then contractually you go into the banking system who's holding the money
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:37.440]  in these pensions but really has already spent it but you get involved
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:41.040]  legally they don't care they're enforcing it all at the point of machine
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:48.960]  guns comments from our guest yes I have two children and when I gave birth they
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:55.800]  actually the hospital that place surveillance numbers to my house so I
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:59.680]  sent them back and and so I went to prison my children did not have place
[03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:06.000]  surveillance numbers unfortunately now when I was gone they got drivers
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:10.440]  licenses and other things and again they said underlawed the card used to say it
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:14.240]  well a few years ago it says not to be used except for the program the slave
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:18.720]  surveillance number is the is the whole control grid system I wrote them and
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:22.760]  they said well no you're right it says it's not that you'd be used for
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:26.640]  identification but now so many corporations and banks require it and we
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:29.960]  can't tell them that they can't make you give it to them to get services from
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:33.360]  them so what the Social Security Administration is saying yeah it's not
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:36.960]  supposed to be used but if someone asked you for it if you want the privilege
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:39.560]  that they're gonna give you then you have to give it and they make citizens jump
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:42.600]  through a hundred hoops the illegals are above the law Joe Bannister comments on
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:48.120]  that well it basically you know with all due respect to his comments about the
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.920]  legalities of it it's the we have to look at the realities first is it
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:57.680]  force measure I mean it's just they're just doing it yeah de facto versus
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:03.680]  desure and and basically you know the reality is try functioning without one
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:07.640]  I'm not saying to not try to do that from that angle too but again it's about
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:12.760]  educating people and and letting them understand that just because someone had
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:16.640]  went to prison I guess the entire Christian religion would have to
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:20.920]  disintegrate because Jesus went to prison St. Paul went to prison I mean
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:24.680]  pretty much all of them oh no but now they teach this doctrine of if you're a
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:28.360]  Christian and the government tells you to murder babies do it just do whatever it
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:31.960]  says Romans 13 out of context when the whole Bible is about fighting that
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:37.240]  thank you for the call Jim one last caller Cory in Texas quick question hey
