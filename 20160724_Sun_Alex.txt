[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:18.000 --> 00:34.000]  Sunday the 24th day of July 2016 I'm your host Alex Jones back in studio for the live Sunday broadcast
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours thank you again so much for joining us
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  We're going to look back on the incredible events of the RNC
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  We're going to look forward to the unbelievable events already unfolding at the DNC where we have crew on the ground
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  They'll be joining us coming up in the last 15 minutes of this hour
[00:52.000 --> 01:09.000]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and Trump confidant will be joining us coming up in the second hour to cover the waterfront
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  And obviously I have a lot of other news concerning Camp Trump
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  And even some of this stuff I was told I was like you know not from Roger Stone my other Trump source it's even closer to Trump
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  You could say you couldn't get closer to Trump than this person
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  The point is that very interesting developments is all I can tell you
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  And this source told me I could go ahead and talk about it but you know what I'm just not going to
[01:37.000 --> 01:49.000]  So there's that said I also had dinner with Nigel Farage of UKIP who by the way told me he's not resigning completely
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  He's still going to be in the EU Parliament he's resigning from the head of UKIP to try to give the political class there a chance to do the right thing
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  And not make it about his party getting ahead but actually about the establishment doing the right thing
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  And that's what I heard he was doing as a major olive branch he told me that point blank at dinner and I said is that off record and he said absolutely not
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  He said I have a bad feeling I'm going to be back very very soon
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  Very very good man very very real very very concerned about how they're attacking the UK England right now trying to keep them inside
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Spent about an hour with him
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  That was amazing we got a bunch of interviews as well that we haven't even aired yet
[02:32.000 --> 02:43.000]  What we're seeing unfold right now is so epic that it just makes my head spin
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  The good that's happening the bad that's happening as well this is going to be a very important broadcast
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  But I tell you that is a very enjoyable joke that I have a Trump insider that's not Roger Stone
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  I'm sorry it's just funny it's so ridiculous to watch the dinosaur media falling apart
[02:58.000 --> 03:06.000]  And they know they're falling apart and they had a deadness in their eyes the arrogance has left them their aura of invincibility has fallen
[03:06.000 --> 03:19.000]  And it has been the listeners of this broadcast Donald Trump Matt Drudge and others who have really helped this major breakthrough that I really don't see being reversed
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  And I'm an overconfident person but barring the global especially nuking major cities and trying to bring in a you know some type of new dark age which they might do
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  I don't see them long term winning
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  Now for those of us alive right now that doesn't really say much because it's going to get rough
[03:38.000 --> 03:47.000]  Stone wants to respond to it I was talking to CJ he's a really smart guy so what do you think of the young Turks thing if you haven't heard about it from the most viral stories out there the last few days
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  I was on media robe hundreds and hundreds of media booths everyone grabbing me wanting me to come talk to them
[03:54.000 --> 04:02.000]  But that wasn't just me they wanted to talk to it was everybody it was a free for all and culture crash one shows on I crashed another sink of the young Turks was crashing shows
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  I mean this is what was going on one of their folks like hey come over be on our show I'll be back later so then they're just up there on this little stage
[04:08.000 --> 04:18.000]  And I gay what's going on he's all nice at first but then the guy that I think that's pretty sure together divided this up with 20 minutes before he starts screaming Alex Jones Alex Jones is taking over
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  And then sink goes crazy I don't think he was in on this and just start screaming and yelling and threatening to physically attack me and some guys spit in my face
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  Well same guy that I believe it invited us up looks like the same guy but they all have that fake intellectual you know dressed to him
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  And CJ said you know this is really a diversion from the history that's happening right now
[04:37.000 --> 04:50.000]  And this you know failing sinking leftist pro-islamic lobalist group acting like I needed their show I mean it's really just a lesson and a hoax by them
[04:50.000 --> 05:08.000]  And that YouTube was pulling our videos the confrontation so people couldn't see the actual truth but later they had to reinstate them under pressure
[05:20.000 --> 05:30.000]  So this is a well-developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you know it's yourself your coworkers your family your children to the best job you can to purify your air
[05:30.000 --> 05:40.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't
[05:40.000 --> 05:50.000]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems can keep eight hundred square feet incredibly clean this is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[05:50.000 --> 06:12.000]  Replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then forward store.com
[06:12.000 --> 06:31.000]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:31.000 --> 06:44.000]  I'm going to be absolutely completely honest with all the listeners and viewers out there I have never been in a better mood I've never been happier I've never been more excited
[06:44.000 --> 06:53.000]  I don't care about knowing Hollywood people or even rock stars once you've had a chance to do it it really becomes old hat
[06:53.000 --> 07:03.000]  Some of those folks are really interesting informative passionate Liberty loving people I like them because they're patriots the people I know not because they're famous
[07:03.000 --> 07:19.000]  In fact being famous to a great extent as a gilded cage and those that have become famous and haven't lost their soul you notice we're always trying to move to the countryside somewhere to be left alone and you know changing their name and getting a facelifter in those jobs and no one recognizes them
[07:19.000 --> 07:44.000]  But I am so proud of my association with Donald Trump and my association people like Matt Drudge because they are true trailblazers their innovators that swam against the current and are trying to basically restore our republic and the true renaissance the free open society
[07:44.000 --> 08:08.000]  And I tell you to know that Donald Trump is real to know that Donald Trump is informed know that Donald Trump is aware of the world government plan and the plan to make us poor under clowered and piven and agenda 21 and to know that he really does want to restore the republic and really turn loose the engine of human innovation is so exciting
[08:08.000 --> 08:30.000]  Now there are two rules about fight club don't talk about fight club and the second rules don't talk about fight club and this is definitely the real fight club this is what fight club wishes it was okay and I'm going to just stop right there people like general Flynn and all these other patriots I mean amazing to be absolutely confirmed
[08:30.000 --> 08:46.000]  They already knew that they're dialed in they get the whole program better than I do and they are ready to fight it they think America is ready to wake up and take action against the new world order and it is just such an exciting time to be alive I'm going to stop right there
[08:46.000 --> 09:02.000]  I'm telling you we don't have an uphill battle anymore if we just realize that humanity is built to win humanity is built to innovate and rise and then for far too long we've been asleep and let these little police these little
[09:02.000 --> 09:18.000]  parents like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and others suppress us and control us because we're not arrogant we're not seeking power we're just seeking success and kinship and honor well we're not going to have all that unless we get these people out of our way and so there's not some utopia
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  we're offering on the other side but it's certainly the opposite of what we're under right now which is total parasitic despotism
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  we have a cornucopia of news to cover
[09:33.000 --> 09:45.000]  but let me just tell you all something from the highest levels in the Pentagon where there are patriots from the highest levels of the Trump campaign and from the highest levels of the resistance of this country
[09:45.000 --> 10:03.000]  this broadcast is the spirit of the resistance this broadcast is having the effect my prayers to God Almighty every day are coming true and that's what God promises us in the good book is that if we take action and do the right thing
[10:03.000 --> 10:20.000]  and continue to persevere for a long time in the end God will take us the rest of the way and that's happening right now and even if Trump has the election stolen even if the globalist set a nuke off in a major city they could do anything to bring in tyranny it's not going to work
[10:20.000 --> 10:49.000]  because by resisting we win even if Trump doesn't get across the finish line he's moved the ball to the one yard line and we got a thousand downs folks if we just take it in our hands it's amazing it's amazing amazing what's going on they want to break our will and take our hope it's not going to work
[10:49.000 --> 11:10.000]  all right let me just read to you some of the headlines I'm gonna come back and cover and then we have our crew in Philadelphia covering things they're gonna be popping in we're going to have Roger Stone joining us to cover all the new developments and so much more able to talk about
[11:10.000 --> 11:31.000]  just as a microcosm he's having a violent criminal audit all of a sudden and they're just claiming he didn't pay taxes period and is involved in total tax evasion for 2014 even though he has a copy of the check and the filing and the check and the money deposited and they say we don't care we're
[11:31.000 --> 11:46.000]  eventually coming to arrest you that's what Obama's now doing to him this just started during the RNC last week he had to run back to New York and deal with it he's not scared he loves it he understands this is the animating contest of liberty but
[11:46.000 --> 12:05.000]  Nixon had 110 names that he was looking at auditing to mess with and he got basically the beginning of impeachment had to step down over and I say yeah good that's bad so the stone who worked for him but now they just do it in mass and they go well that's okay
[12:05.000 --> 12:20.000]  and that's done to intimidate people it's an act of desperation good have a jury trial going there with his check and he paid and they just and they said they just don't care they just don't care it's all about just a bunch of arrogant people bullying around
[12:20.000 --> 12:35.000]  now get ready for this they're at the DNC they asked the baseball commission why this is going on they said no we changed the printout because they have the sections at the baseball field where they're where they're having part of the convention
[12:35.000 --> 12:57.000]  they put a big 10 up in Philadelphia it's on info wars.com we're going to write an article about tomorrow dim sensor white from red white and blue to avoid triggering those are white section as if anybody would think blue red white as if anybody so they've changed it to a cream
[12:57.000 --> 13:13.000]  cream section we're going to play part of that but the crews going to be joining us and if you want to go down that line of censorship the BBC is now announcing they want to stop using the word terrorist they don't say Islamic terror already and now they're going to censor the names in fact they've officially done it this is mainstream news
[13:13.000 --> 13:28.000]  they're not going to say Ali or Muhammad even though the latest attacker was called Ali and you'll Allah Akbar they're going to censor all Islamic names and words from the attacks and then say no ISIS connection
[13:28.000 --> 13:46.000]  they're going to say yes to the big attack kill 80 something people yesterday and then there was 80 something a couple weeks ago and hatchet attacks and nine dead and all this stuff and it's like wow you guys really are doubling down with this but dims have banned the white section at the DNC
[13:46.000 --> 14:02.000]  Munich team government has no ISIS links the police say even they've been ordered German ministers are raped and they come out and say a blonde hair German did it BBC scrubs Ali from Munich killers name on TV
[14:02.000 --> 14:17.000]  I'm sorry I mean that's next level BS I'm this is like a Monty Python is actually so entertaining it wasn't so deadly you know when your family gets killed Syrian refugee arrested after killing woman with machete writers in Germany police say
[14:17.000 --> 14:34.000]  she's always a Syrian or you know Afghan of course there's people that invaded Syria hello they always say with this guy that killed the people at the McDonald's they said he was a German course he's from Afghanistan from Iran I mean it's just German machete
[14:34.000 --> 14:48.000]  attack shocking footage of Syrian energy wants this is the way it's like every few hours now launching deadly assault in which pregnant woman is hacked to death they just calling German I'm surprised this article even actually got it right
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  German officials respond to migrant acts attack by calling for mandatory Islam classes I told you you will be indoctrinated so that you don't trigger them
[14:57.000 --> 15:10.000]  so we're gonna not have a white and red white and blue because that having white triggers you and now you're triggering the Muslims wearing a miniskirt remember the Cologne mayor the green piece you know greeny green party lady she said
[15:10.000 --> 15:24.000]  don't wear those sexy miniskirts and they're having to not have open street parties anymore and during October fest which Germans have done for a thousand years they can't do that now they have to be walled off and in buildings because it's causing a triggering
[15:24.000 --> 15:38.000]  you bring in something incompatible to wreck the liberal society having guns low taxes freedoms liberal banning the color white is the opposite it's cult level brainwashing by the way we have it there is no doubt
[15:38.000 --> 15:50.000]  we have a guy that is literally the most brainwashed zombie cult member of Hillary ever and here's what's crazy we have hundreds of these coming this is actually what most of them are like we didn't just go find a loon
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  we have videos up on info wars dot com the ultimate Hillary zombie today we interviewed in Philadelphia

[19:42.000 --> 19:53.000]  again ladies and gentlemen I could care less about being famous I could care less about being successful within the globalist system that they already control I want to create new systems
[19:53.000 --> 20:06.000]  I want to see individuals turned loose to empower themselves I want to see humanity free the feudalist model of globalism is about making you poor stupid and controllable programmable
[20:06.000 --> 20:16.000]  what america was all about even though it never even realized but a tenth of its plans was about setting up a system where the individual could be turned loose to follow their dreams
[20:16.000 --> 20:27.000]  and that's what donald trump's talking about bringing back hope that's why I get excited about it because we're changing history we're having a massive effect
[20:27.000 --> 20:43.000]  on bringing back real hope not the fake hope of baron cobalt so we've got all these articles where people named Ali are having their name censored on the news so you don't even know it was an islamist yelling Allah Akbar killing people
[20:43.000 --> 21:02.000]  father saying it wasn't Islamic attack that happened in nice even though they admit it was they said San Bernardino wasn't Fort Hood wasn't and again it just shows what these western governments are doing and now we've got to have Islamic training in schools to make us accept it so they don't kill us anymore
[21:02.000 --> 21:28.000]  meanwhile dem censor white from red white and blue avoid triggering color white change because it's racist info wars reporter joe biggs discovered that democrat media party planners excise the white from the red white and blue sex is the media party in order to not trigger anyone
[21:28.000 --> 21:41.000]  and don't worry they've excise you get the censorship now so trendy and cool they've excised the word Ali from a killer or Allah Akbar
[21:41.000 --> 22:01.000]  meanwhile I reported on this in the middle of last week when Roger L stepped down from Fox News as their CEO that it was a total made up red herring that had organized for years and ready for the election and that they were bringing it out in the election to basically allow the control in the final months
[22:01.000 --> 22:17.000]  and Fox News contributors to be so intimidated they wouldn't dare put out any information that might hurt Hillary and the last straw was when Sean Hannity about a month ago had Donald Trump on and allowed him to talk about Bill Clinton and rape settling rape cases
[22:17.000 --> 22:37.000]  and because of that that's the big term that they banned Roger stone off CNN MSNBC and Fox he's been banned for six months you want to talk about that but he was basically told so that's unfolding as well and now if you think Fox had already gotten bad and lost half its ratings in many demographics because it was becoming so globalist
[22:37.000 --> 23:01.000]  it's a bellwether of the coup that's happening and there's a breakdown here report Murdoch son horrified by potential Trump presidency forced out Roger Ailes and list a bunch of different articles from slate Fox you name it admitting that yes indeed this is being done right now this is all preplanned the lawsuit set up years ago ready to bring down Ailes right before the election
[23:01.000 --> 23:19.000]  and the next will be Matt Drudge and Alex Jones everybody else so this is how they do it and the Roger Ailes things is completely synthetic look at look at the Clinton settling rape cases covering it up all the enabling
[23:19.000 --> 23:37.000]  all the lying all of it but that's okay but for me the issue is we have Debbie washerman Schultz first thing she wouldn't be at the DNC yesterday because of the hacked emails coming up
[23:37.000 --> 23:51.000]  that they were there not the media is mainly focusing on the fact that they said let's create a narrative that he's a bumbling idiot he's a moron he doesn't know how to run things that's actually true about Bernie Sanders was the fact that I didn't have a paying job till he's 40
[23:51.000 --> 24:07.000]  but she said let's develop that but deeper in the emails has come out in a few news articles there's thousands of them deeper in the emails is that they were talking about having the super delegates just block them and announcing a narrative that didn't matter if he won they were still going to win
[24:07.000 --> 24:24.000]  remember they nakedly came out five six months ago and said it doesn't matter if he wins New Hampshire it doesn't matter all the states he wins the super delegates matter we change the rules we're the sovereigns they tried that with the Republicans
[24:24.000 --> 24:42.000]  but to their credit it failed but now they're going into this convention with the Queen Hillary's coronation crooked robbing Hillary who didn't even win California but they quote met the day before with the AP and CNN with the big donors
[24:42.000 --> 24:58.000]  and the super delegates and they decided what her numbers would be so they could then announce that the next day the voting didn't even matter and I can't believe it's not a bigger outrage by this but I'll say this Sanders talks about a lot of real problems
[24:58.000 --> 25:12.000]  deindustrialization globalization corrupt mega corporations being by the law but that's not capitalism that's globalism but it's the problems he talks about a real his solutions look at Venezuela and everywhere else they don't work
[25:12.000 --> 25:28.000]  his solutions are where globalists actually want they just want it done a little bit slower via Hillary but talking to Hillary supporters they are the most cultic dumb down mindless stupid people we've ever seen I got a hands of the Bernie Sanders people on average
[25:28.000 --> 25:47.000]  they actually make some really good points and are smart so I'll give them that but it gets crazier what else is in these emails that they organized the anti-Trump demonstrations that were so violent Chicago and other areas
[25:47.000 --> 26:02.000]  we knew that was Hillary it was it was it was Roger Stone and others that confirmed it was Hillary it wasn't people in Bernie Sanders shirts beating up Trump supporters attacking folks it was Hillary operatives that's in the emails as well
[26:02.000 --> 26:20.000]  that's mainstream news that they scapegoated the burning people so the Democrats would see that and think well beating up innocent folks we're not for that or people calling for communism we're not for that to make Hillary look less radical
[26:20.000 --> 26:35.000]  so they played Sanders just like the globalist always play socialist they played democratic socials those things they played him so hard they're playing you now unless you wake up and vote for Trump here's the bigger question though what about election fraud
[26:35.000 --> 26:48.000]  I mean you know if they'll steal the votes in at least 10 states and give it to Hillary Clinton when when Sanders in some cases with 25 points ahead 20 points ahead 14 points ahead 11 points ahead 10 points ahead
[26:48.000 --> 26:59.000]  these are real states he would he would he won by a landslide if they'll steal the nomination will they try to steal the election you bet your bottom buck buckaroo
[26:59.000 --> 27:19.000]  look at these headlines CNBC Wasserman steps down ahead of DNC convention after blowback from WikiLeaks saga pressure mounts on Wasserman resigns she did pop DNC staffer apologize for email on Sanders religion there's even anti-semitic crap in there
[27:19.000 --> 27:29.000]  leaked emails show DNC officials told their Democrats folks planned anti-Trump protest and they ran them and did them and had folks rest up at Sanders boom daily caller

[32:06.000 --> 32:14.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[32:14.000 --> 32:34.000]  the mainstream media in hundreds of publications panicked Thursday night when they heard Donald
[32:34.000 --> 32:46.000]  Trump talk about we're going to promote Americanism not globalism that will be our credo because they couldn't block it when he gave speeches saying that in other parts of the country and similar things they would just not cover it
[32:46.000 --> 33:01.000]  not Fox not CNN not anybody of course the alternative new media that in many cases is bigger than the old dinosaur media it did in fact Buckley just was vacationing with his wife in Europe
[33:01.000 --> 33:15.000]  he just sent me a photo of the New York Times I'm going to tweet out during the next break a photo he took that was the New York Times a full double page spread the t-shirts of the RNC and there's nothing inflammatory
[33:15.000 --> 33:25.000]  there's nothing political there's no Hillary for prison there's nothing and they wonder why they have to be owned by the richest man in Mexico and why they're bankrupt
[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  why they're like a baseball card for some Mexican kingpin because they're a fraud they're a birdcage liner they're a joke they're their whole mystique is gone
[33:36.000 --> 33:47.000]  when I was there they're like the New York Times wants to do a profile the New York Times wants to interview and I was just like New York Times want them to show it up she's a nice lady and everything but I was just like I don't care to talk to you just make up whatever you want to make up
[33:47.000 --> 34:02.000]  you don't want to talk to the New York Times no I don't want to go play basketball with Kim Jong-un either I mean I just blow my brains out before that I mean I just don't you get it I don't want to be in the establishment
[34:02.000 --> 34:13.000]  you've wrecked the greatest country on earth you've bankrupted us you've run us in the ground don't you understand I don't want to be in your club I want to trailblaze I want to bring back liberty
[34:13.000 --> 34:21.000]  I want to make America and the world great again and that means exposing you because once you're exposed you're gone
[34:21.000 --> 34:34.000]  it's just so pathetic they've hired all these nobodies all these these these hunchbacked intellectual midget people that just think they're God and you're not God your whole world's coming to an end
[34:34.000 --> 34:44.000]  figure that out and of course they're scapegoating washerman Schultz another bug-eyed demon like she was the one trying to steal things from Sanders
[34:44.000 --> 34:59.000]  but Hillary didn't she didn't know she's cut washerman Schultz head off politically no honor among thieves they steal it from the voter they steal it from Sanders
[34:59.000 --> 35:09.000]  they put that hyperbolic weasel you know up there on TV to resign is if everybody's gonna go to sleep now because of this
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  truly sickening and they went out I gotta tell you I don't roll my eyes a lot of what Stone says because everything he's ever told me it turns out to be true
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  is why they say he's the biggest liar ever and he's a hatchet man and he's a dirty treacherous none of it's true none of it from my experience
[35:23.000 --> 35:34.000]  it's sickeningly accurate stuff he comes up with sickeningly accurate this the connections he gets us and he was like oh they're all we're gonna we have the intel they're all Sanders people it's all fake
[35:34.000 --> 35:47.000]  they're directing it the Justice Department Obama and Hillary are directing the entire protest against Trump and we know through the Chicago PD they were ordered to stand down on and on and on and now it's in the emails boom
[35:47.000 --> 36:00.000]  he's joining us coming up about 25 minutes but let me play this short clip of Trump Thursday night and Trump a few weeks before combined with his declaration of independence against the globalist here it is
[36:00.000 --> 36:11.000]  the era of economic surrender will finally be over we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism
[36:11.000 --> 36:24.000]  there you go and then there's another clip in that intro that I'm gonna put in all our intros and I'm gonna hammer forever where Trump says we're gonna play it coming up in the next segment where he says in his speech
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  that was Thursday night
[36:29.000 --> 36:44.000]  Americanism not globalism will be our credo that is gonna be just you're gonna hear that every hour on the show for ever I am gonna hammer because it is so key now let's go ahead and go to another clip here
[36:44.000 --> 36:56.000]  let's go ahead and go to this clip now folks I people have to understand something when Mark dies who does reporting for us puts out these famous videos that drudge everybody else links to where he goes out 90% of Californians
[36:56.000 --> 37:08.000]  white black Hispanic college degrees you name it 90% 9 out of 10 every time sometimes it's 10 out of 10 but usually it's not you know sometimes it's 13 out of 14 but it's usually about 9 out of 10
[37:08.000 --> 37:18.000]  say we want to put all gun owners in slave camps and kill them or we're gonna take their guns and put them in slave camps or we want to make everybody be slaves and a globalist commune
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  and I mean you know they don't know what the fourth of July is they don't know anything they say let's make Karl Marx Hillary Clinton's VP oh yes it's great
[37:27.000 --> 37:41.000]  if you say Hillary supports making Karl Marx or VP they're the biggest fake intellectuals they don't know what planet they're on they just know they feel powerful they're with the system even as it gang raps them
[37:41.000 --> 37:59.000]  this is the first person Rob do today in Philadelphia at the DNC interview and by the way most the people this guy's about a nine or a 10 when it comes to being a zombie moron but they're all six sevens or eights
[37:59.000 --> 38:12.000]  I mean this is and so we're gonna put out videos that are just we don't usually even do this we'll just put out videos like mark dice where it's like 15 people and 12 or 13 of them can't talk okay
[38:12.000 --> 38:29.000]  remember the Obama phone lady he gave us a phone on you more I mean to the it's like the white black matter it's like Muppets and God bless them they're human beings but this is who they are this is who their operatives are and they're and he says well they stole it from
[38:29.000 --> 38:45.000]  Sanders that's fine whatever government wants to do these are soulless us then a Sanders guy comes over all you got an agenda info wars were like really let him talk and he goes okay I guess you don't yeah we know we have an agenda to show what's going on
[38:45.000 --> 39:03.000]  we wish that 10 out of 10 people were at least as smart as a Sanders supporter but they're not we're showing you what's going on I just fire and forget folks I just cover boom the facts what my historical gut is what we believe to be true doesn't mean we're perfect but let me tell you
[39:03.000 --> 39:17.000]  compared to dinosaur media we are the opposite let's go ahead and go to part of this club here this okay so I'm here with a Hillary supporter he's got a shirt says yes queen 2016 what's your name sir
[39:17.000 --> 39:35.000]  my name is Anthony the botany from havertown I'm a Democratic leader Greg Battali sent me down to volunteer with the committee of Democrats for Hillary Ron and Clinton and I support the Democrats because John F Kennedy inspired me to come a Democratic leader I trust Hillary
[39:35.000 --> 39:49.000]  for leadership dedication, honor, trust, dignity, loyal, trustworthy, Hillary's the best I know what she becomes president she'll be the best leader in the world no Hillary
[39:49.000 --> 39:59.000]  alright hey did you see the article about the WikiLeaks documents that came out and said the DNC was trying to throw it for Hillary they did not want Bernie Sanders to become the nominee for the Democratic Party
[39:59.000 --> 40:13.000]  well I believe that the Democratic Party they know what they're doing Hillary's a good leader I trust Hillary, Hillary is a good leader and I know what she becomes president of the United States she'll be an outstanding leader for our country
[40:13.000 --> 40:21.000]  I trust her for loyalty, leadership, trust, value, friendship and God and country
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  so you think it's okay that they decided to select a candidate instead of letting the people's will decide
[40:26.000 --> 40:36.000]  yes sir I agree with that the government should allow Hillary Clinton to become president of the United States
[40:36.000 --> 40:46.000]  one last question what do you think about the emails scandal when the FBI director came out and said she had at least 110 classified emails that she put out on her server
[40:46.000 --> 40:55.000]  as far as I'm concerned there she's clear Hillary Clinton is cleared for all charges she is clear 100% clear
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  what do you think of Bill Clinton
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  awesome I can't pay with Bill Clinton I got him elected I got him certified I got him elected for president of the United States
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  this guy associates his personal power with Clinton
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  we've ever had that was Obama Obama's totally awesome we're gonna miss him
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  that is cult brainwashing
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  I'm gonna miss him too
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  alright what do you think the biggest things are in this country that need to be changed
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.000]  one of the things that need to be changed basically to keep everything remained the same
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  everything has to be remained the same
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  do you think everything's good right now
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  yes sir everything is awesome outstanding
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  collapse going bankrupt economy falling apart
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  I agree with Hillary Clinton 100% pure proof
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  alright then
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  pause it right there
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  the next guy come over and accuse us of showing crazies
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  he just stole the election from Sanders that's the cult accepting
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  I mean we're just showing the facts
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  Twitter executives won't say if they believe in freedom of speech
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  after Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos who was banned for life by Twitter
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  confronted the progressive social media company executives
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  a reporter at the RNC followed the two around
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  repeatedly asked them to answer the question yes or no does the company believe in freedom of speech
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  for more than eight minutes the Twitter executives who refuse to identify themselves would not answer
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  whether they believe in that basic American principle of freedom of speech
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  Representative Darrell Issa Republican of California
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  the former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  answered the question for them
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  they totally believe in freedom of speech as long as it's their speech
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  Issa told Breitbart News
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  I'm Ashley Beckford reporting for infowars.com
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  watch the full video
[42:43.000 --> 43:08.000]  Twitter refuses to support freedomofspeech at infowars.com
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.000]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  these are all parasites
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  tell us about all the stuff I said there's so many things that are in it

[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year

[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  here's why
[45:02.000 --> 45:05.000]  my friends we already see major power grid problems
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  and it's getting worse
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  so please listen
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  and unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  and here's the best news if you want to get one this week

[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear

[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  so it's a good time to check it out
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money
[45:47.000 --> 46:14.000]  go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com
[46:14.000 --> 46:20.000]  when a country, when a nation, when a people, when a planet start accepting tyranny
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  the bottom falls out of the floor
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  the bottom was pit
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  and all that we're seeing is
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  the public start to wake up, not trust the system
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  and rediscover what made us great
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  not globalism, not collectivism
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  but I tell you, you go out and you see what the Democrats are doing
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  you see BBC and CNN
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  and others censoring the word Ali
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  with the latest Islamic killer in Germany
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  not the latest, I'm sorry, the shooting was Friday
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  yesterday was a machete killing
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  by an Afghan of a pregnant woman, I'm sorry
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  and they at least admitted he was Afghan
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  but now
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Dems censor white from red, white and blue
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  you can actually see at the sports stadium
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  where they were having this media event for the DNC in Philadelphia
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  they covered it up and changed the color
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  because you can't have a white section, a blue section and a red section
[47:14.000 --> 47:17.000]  and you think, well this is overreaching
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  this is mental illness, they don't want to trigger stuff, that's crazy
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  ban brown-hipper bags, mother and father
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  ban all these terms
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  no folks, they want to be able to just ban language whenever they want
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  they're setting the precedent for that
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  there's a full video up on infowars.com
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  actually showing the blueprint of it
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  in fact we can probably roll some of that
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  and see how big is talking
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  so TV viewers can see it
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  infowars.com
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  I'm 48 minutes into this broadcast
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  and I haven't mentioned
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  that we're going to be doing a
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  20
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  8-hour broadcast
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  it used to be 24 but now we've expanded it to 28-hour live broadcast
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  I'll be hosting for at least 10 hours
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  special guests, our crew on the ground in Philadelphia and more
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  this is going to be a special report
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  while Hillary's being coordinated Wednesday through Thursday
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  a lot of stations, a lot of affiliates
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  a lot of UHF stations, VHF, cable, TV are picking it up
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  a lot of our affiliates are
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  but here's the issue
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  I normally promote one of these
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  once a year events that we usually do
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  the middle of summer, end of summer
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  months out
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  I have been so incredibly busy
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  battling the globalist, launching new projects
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and having such amazing success
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  on every front, quite frankly
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  that
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  I've never even mentioned this now until today
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  but the video where I promote it and more is
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  at infowars.com
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  we're announcing Operation Sleeping Giant
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  infowars to launch special 24-hour broadcast
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  I started thinking no
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  because we go 24 hours from 11 a.m. to the next 11
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  always to the next four hours anyways
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  it was really a 28-hour broadcast
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  and we'll also have some of the biggest sales in our history
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  as part of a fundraiser during that
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  special auctions of infowars gear
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  and more so
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  be sure and join us and spread that link to everyone you know
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  because we're just three days out
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  or less now from that being launched
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  now joining us is Joe Biggs
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  they've been there since yesterday
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  they follow a lot of amazing reports
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Joe, when they openly admit
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  it's not even a news item
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  that oh, we're banning the color white
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  it might be offensive
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  that's discriminatory against the color white
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  but it's like, if Scientology did something like that
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  they'd call it a megacult
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  I mean this is, or if Jim Jones did it
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  you'd laugh at it
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  I mean this is the most cultic, freakazoid weirdness
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  I've ever heard
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  it's not even a big deal Joe
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  or they won't say Ali now
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  or Muhammad when the jihadists killing people
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  they say they're not Islamic
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  they yell out Akbar but they're not Muslims
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  and by the way their names, you know, Tom Jones
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  I mean, we've now reached that level
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  what do you think Joe?
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Roger that, Joe Biggs here with infowars.com
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  in downtown Philadelphia
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  where tomorrow the DNC will be kicking off
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  and last night we had this opportunity
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  to go into the DNC media party
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  that happened at the Phillies baseball stadium
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  and do Michael and Kit and I
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  actually walked up into one of the top decks
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  where it was actually breezy to cool off
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  and a guy who worked there is a union worker
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  he was a fan, ran over and started telling me about
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  hey man, he was like, due to the backlash
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  at the RNC how there was a red elevator
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  a white elevator and a blue elevator
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  the people were upset about the white elevator
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  but the DNC wanted to go ahead and squash that
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  before it was a concern
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  and it's now the red, white and blue sections
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  it is now the red, Ashburn and blue sections
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  because we don't want to offend anybody else
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  now what color is Ashburn?
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  I have no idea
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  maybe like a communist with yellow
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  like I don't know a red and yellow mixture
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  it's just there's a new level
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  they're stealing all of our basic rights
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  there's no idea of this for TV viewers
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  they're stealing all of our rights
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  and then meanwhile they're trying to
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  number one, white people aren't white
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  I mean some are but most of us look like pink geckos
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  which quite frankly I like to be more tan
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  so I guess I hate my whiteness
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  but whatever, the point is
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  I actually like tan people, I like dark people
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  I'm so racist, excuse me
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  I find it very exotic but that's because I'm a bad person
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  I mean Joe at a certain point
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  when you and I are out in the sun
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  I mean we're red
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  we're blue too
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  and I guess once we die we turn blue
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  so I guess we've got to be on the whole thing Joe
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  well I think what they're going to do
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  to go ahead and squash anyone's feelings from getting hurt
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  at the actual DNC convention
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  there's going to be a red section
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  a triglyph section where they're going to have a large picture of her
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  with blue hair
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  and complete like a meme
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  that's moving a gif of her shaking her arms
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  and then a blue section as well
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  to help make everyone a little bit more comfortable
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  let me ask you a question
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  how much interview is coming up
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  he said he found a lot of people
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  as bizarre and cult like
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  as the guy we played earlier
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  have you seen that video where he sounds like a muppet
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  and saying I'm glad we stole the election from Bernie Sanders
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  that's a good thing
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  I haven't heard it yet
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  he was telling me about it
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  I was actually in another part of the march
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  and I actually had an opportunity to speak to like one of the only
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  very few Hillary supporters
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  that are out here protesting
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  there's very few like a handful
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  of Sanders supporters marching up and down the road
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  but I encountered
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  Black Lives Matter today
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  which is in Philly
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  it looks to be about 80% white
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  and I really got into a conversation
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  and triggered this one white guy
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  to a point where he looked like Hillary Clinton's
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  seizure going
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  when I called him out on something with some facts
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  that's what's crazy is
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  we would be in Pittsburgh
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  and if they saw a Trump shirt
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  they would actually start going
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  where are these people from Joe?
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  they're mother's basements
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  most of them are still residing there
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  and they probably will retire in their mother's basements
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  with those Cheeto stained fingers
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  and look of defeat and disgust
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  what's the overall flavor though
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  how would you describe the spirit
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  of Philadelphia versus that of Pittsburgh
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  versus that
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  of Cleveland
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  well inside of the convention center areas
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  you're going to have more of the delegates
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  who've rolled over
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  and they're more pro-Hillary
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  now in the streets you're going to have
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  thousands, tens of thousands
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  of these Bernie Sanders people
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  who are hoping that Bernie will maybe
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  pull back that
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  endorsement of Hillary
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  and then hopefully step in in some way
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  and take this convention for themselves
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  because we already know due to the DNC leaks today
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  that Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  will be stepping down at the end of the
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  the convention
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  and also be speaking
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  tomorrow to a lot of the delegates
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  for about three to five minutes
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  so based on how that goes
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  I think there's going to be a lot of animosity
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I agree and that's the $64 trillion question
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  everybody's asking
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  will the Sanders people, they're like 90%
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  I mean Hillary didn't have any votes
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  he'd have 50,000, she'd have 500
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  I mean literally, she'd have 1,000, you'd have 20,000
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  it's total fraud, they admit they stole it
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  will these people like cult members
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  march into the modern political gas chambers
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  and open elections
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  murdered in front of everybody's eyes Joe
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  I know those reports are coming tonight
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  what percentage of them
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  said that they'd be going along with this
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  when you talk to them
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  Most of the people are pretty angry
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  but if you look at this press pass
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  it actually has Debbie Wasserman Schultz's name on it
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  instead of like Cleveland or how we had
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  30 badges, we only get one here
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  but it's got her name on it and as you can see
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  we're going to have to get a black magic marker
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  and take that off
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  if you can get in there now
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  we'll talk to you like 30 minutes during the Stoner Review
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  I'd love to be inside the nest
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  please continue Joe
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  Oh yeah, there's nothing going on in there right now
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  there's not going to be anything happening until tomorrow
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  there was just a couple parties last night
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  but we had an opportunity
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  to speak to a lot of the protestors
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  who were hoping that Bernie's going to break away
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  into a third party
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  and hopefully run on his own and do something like that
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  because they have enough people
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  that are Bernieites
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  and they're going to jump up and seal this election
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  from Hillary Clinton
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  inside this media center that we were at last night
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  you've got a lot of hardcore Hillary fans
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  that are in there and I was wearing a
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  pretty
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  provocative t-shirt
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  the hitlery t-shirt that we're going to be
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  getting pretty soon
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  and it was very interesting to see people look at me
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  and discuss and go why would you wear something like that
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  what has she ever done
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  and I'm like wow how long do you have
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  she's done so much
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  for her today
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  he's like all Trump does is lie
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  all he does is lie about everything
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Hillary is the only proven person
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  I'm like yes she's the only proven criminal
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  Trump is a wild card
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  we have nothing on him
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  that's why the only thing they can ever use is
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  blah blah blah blah
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  meanwhile Trump is the one who invited Caitlyn Jenner
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  and said you could pee in my bathroom
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  I don't care but for some reason he's against
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  LGTBQ whatever it is now
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  that's part of the incredible brainwashing
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  stay there back in 70 seconds

[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Joe Biggs, getting back to
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  final thoughts here my friend
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  I'm going to get you on a bunch throughout the week
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  the whole crew that's there covering things
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  how epic was cleveland though
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  I mean the airplanes in the sky and we've got airplanes there
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  saying hollory for prison
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  but cleveland was so epic
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  contrast the two places together
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  well the weather in cleveland was a lot better
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  for one this is the hottest
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  and it's like muggiest place
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  I've been to in years
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  they were bitching on fox this morning that's like hell
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  they say it's so humid and no the AC
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  had working
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  you walk one block alex and you're completely
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  drenched
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  it is miserable but it is what it is
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  we're going to be out here doing what we do
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  kicking ass like we did in cleveland
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  like you said cleveland was epic
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  we got amazing interviews
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  we got in on key
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  things we were able to talk to a lot of people
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  stop some communists we're able to
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  get in with the young turks and sit there
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  and really just kind of show how the left
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  is that they're completely out of their mind
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  a lot of times the fact that you know
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  we're more worried or they're more worried about
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  what's the bathroom to go into
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  or what color
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  to name a section of a stadium
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  meanwhile there's actual things going on
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  we have open borders we have
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  the second amendment that's on the verge of being taken away
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  if we get hillary clinton as the president
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  there's important topics we should be worried about
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  not transgendered bathrooms
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  not the color of the name of a section
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  in a sports section
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  well they got to give us little fake weird rides
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  as they take all of our basic freedoms
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  what about just the general fact
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  that they've been lobotomized I'm not being mean
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  no wonder they're always talking about how intellectual they are
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  these are really stupid people
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  I saw a girl
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  that had one of the prettiest faces I'd ever seen
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  and then when I pan down she looked like Sasquatch
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  that had the half of her body from the waist down
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  I mean it was very very scary
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  maybe maybe space aliens are real
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  these are actually hybrids I'm joking
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  but Joe other key points you want to impart
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  to the viewers from the DNC
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  well I think
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Chink should change his name
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  because I think that's a very offensive term
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  used to describe a certain type of people
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  and we should also call him
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Trigley Turk from here on out
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Trigley Turk
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  listen they're so arrogant
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  they waved us over when we walked by
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  we had other stuff to do
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  I'm walking by I could do 500 interviews if I wanted to
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  everywhere we were mobbed just cameras
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  thousands of news articles
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  hundreds a day all over national news
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  all these big interviews
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  hey how you doing
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  like freak out and spit in my face
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  and threaten to attack me and then
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  have our YouTube videos taken down
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  and then say we're liars what did you make of that
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  that was pretty shocking
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  the fact that
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  they within minutes were able to
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  via YouTube possibly
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  take our videos down
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  well they were on the YouTube page
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  they're force fed by YouTube go ahead
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  and meanwhile
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  what are they doing they're doing a quick edit
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  to cut out the spitting
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  the fat shaming part coming from the lady
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  who's known for her
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  that's right they edited it out where they call me
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  a fat bitch they also attack women
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  yes
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  it was
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  it was beautiful to see their true colors
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  come out in that moment we were able to
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  have that video we put out our
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  we need a meme of him as Trigley Turk
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Trigley Turk
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  he's not Trigley Turk he's Trigley Turk
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Trigley Turk
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  and we need to also say hey you're such a big Muslim lady
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  put the freaking burqa on your head
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  yeah exactly
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  it's not a group you develop living
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  why is this so good because
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  people are actually waking up to the problem
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  that pretty much scares me the most
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  I mean I try to make sure
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  that I don't put toxins from food
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  and water and beverages in my system but
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  right now we're dealing with
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  massive parasites which is
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  anything that's harmful to your body
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  that lives off a host mechanism
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  right now with all the refugees
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  spreading disease around
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  these are all parasites
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  tell us about all this episode there's so many things that are in it
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  you have the neem in there you have the organic
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  clove bud the organic wormwood
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  I recommend doing a parasite
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  cleanse at least twice a year
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  all right well I'm glad we've got some back in because
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  I'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday

[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  now banning the word terrorists
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  or discussing it
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  and pulling Islamic names
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  from the daily German
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  and French attacks with machetes
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  hatchets guns
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  trucks hundreds of dead
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  bombings
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  I saw some headlines
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  when in Kabul Afghanistan
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  80 something got killed
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  and they didn't say Islamic attack there
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  I was surprised they didn't say it
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  German did that
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  I mean separate
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Islam and from the debate
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  it's the control of language
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  and then the Democrats have this
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  sports stadium this baseball stadium
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  with the red white and blue
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  sections
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  and they get rid of the white
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  section and call it another color
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  because people freaked out on there being blue red
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  and white elevators in another event
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  I mean whoa
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  I'm wearing a white shirt folks
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  I'm wearing blue blazer
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  a navy blazer
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  because it looks good
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  and of a
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  seven foot tall NBA superstar
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  where as a white shirt he's not racist
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  I don't even have to defend that
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  I mean it is mental illness
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  it is mind control
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  it is culture war
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  meanwhile what we heard from Roger Stone
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  last week has now been confirmed
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  also whenever we talk to Fox News folks
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  that were all bivouacked over at the Rich Carlton
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  there
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  at the RNC
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  and I talked to several Fox News hosts
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  off record and they said oh yeah no we've been told
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  and I've been told this months ago
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  actually last year too
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  that they've all been threatened with being fired
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  in fact Sean Hannity's been told that's why I've been suddenly defending Sean Hannity
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  saying I respect him
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  he was told you let Trump talk about Hillary
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  and cover it up for Bill Clinton's rapes
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  and in settling cases you're going to be fired
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  that's why he said he may leave Fox now
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  they threatened a bunch of people
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  this lawsuit for a year sitting there
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  with a sexual harassment suit
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  with a long list of women
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  they dug up
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  going back sometimes 40 years
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  I mean they have stuff from the 70's
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  before I was born
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  that Roger Ailes grabbed a woman's butt
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  at a furniture store
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  in 1971
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  I mean
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  this is crazy
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  to bring down Fox a lot of folks go
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  you're going to get picked now they're all going to you
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  don't want to get big at the expense
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  of the fall of free press
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Fox News has attacked me
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  they've already tried to control the conservative movement
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  the point is is that
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  they get Fox, they get everybody
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  so that's also
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  in the news today
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  it's come out with other mainstream media
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  confirming what I have broken
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  down here
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  Rupert Murdoch, Slate, Fox
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  others report
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  son horrified by potential Trump presidents
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  because he wasn't attacking Trump
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  enough
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  I mean that whole thing with Megan Kelly
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  the rest of it was a stage deal
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  you know she's going to be part of the
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  suit now she says
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  six years ago, it pays her millions a year
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  she was hugging him and he squeezed her a little
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  too hard I mean I've got the point where
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  women that aren't my wife
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  or whatever or I'm married I'm
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  I'm not hugging you, are you trying to hug me? No
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  don't be alone
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  in a room with a woman either
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  is this this culture
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  is incredible
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  meanwhile Washerman Schultz has resigned because the emails come out that they stole
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  the election they had super delegates
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  that's already known
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  joining us for the balance of the hour
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  is rogerstone of stonezone.com
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  his crew designed the new shirt
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  we're selling it, we're producing it
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  I hope it's the new
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  mega shirt, we're still selling the Hillary for prison
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  shirt that has become totally viral
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  with hundreds of companies knocking it off that's fine with me
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  we want the original though it's at m4store.com
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  support the broadcast
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  the new Clinton rape shirt
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  looks like the iconic
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Obama communist posterized shirt
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  that said hope
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  said of scam or said of jihad
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  as it should have said well now it just says
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  rape with Bill Clinton smiling
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  original design from the stonezone
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  available exclusively at m4store.com
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  and we just printed up a ton of those
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  not even reviews of it because we're only selling it three days
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  but it has been printed right here in the USA
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  the 18-wheeler is coming to our studios
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  to our warehouse
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  we'll be shipping these babies out by Wednesday
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  should be the first to get the shirt
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  that triggered
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  the
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Trigley turk
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  the Trigley turd
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  and I don't want to spend much time on them
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  because we've got all this big news coming up
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  if you don't know about it I'll tell you about it later at the bottom of the hour
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  but we'll talk about media row
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  hundreds of TV and radio stations all in there
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  hey come on in here
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  I'll come back later I'll do another review
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  but later I jump on and make a big deal
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  that I took over their studio
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  total crap everybody's seeing through it
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  but the big thing
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  the reason I'm only mentioning what happened with the young turks
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  video is all on m4store.com
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  from all the other animals of what really happened
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  them attacking me, hitting me, spitting on me
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  everything
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  is that
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  their people acting like they were with us screaming and yelling
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  when it turns out it's their people working for them
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  like our chink or however he pronounces his name
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  because he doesn't seem like to be the shy
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  knife in the drawer
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  but we're going to cover that later
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  the issue was Roger Stone was the one
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  that we were going through doing interviews with
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  we could be there all day if we wanted we just done like 7, 8, 9 interviews
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  we've only done 4 or 5 more left
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  we wanted to leave we had a meeting to go to
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  it was very important I'll leave it at that
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  believe me don't be hanging out with the young turks
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  they wanted to have this big pity party
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  about how it was all about them and calling me a fat bitch
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  when they talk about
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  let's arrest people that call people fat
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  it was just all so hypocritical
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  and it all got caught on tape
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  but the biggest issue was they pulled
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  3 of our videos within 15 minutes of this happening
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  live and it was the videos of them
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  and then they put out edited versions covering up
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  what they did so the fact that they work
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  for YouTube and Google is very scary
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  and so this affects everybody
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  but let's shift yours out of that for now
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  Roger Stone I want to get into
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Wasserman Schultz stepping down
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  the WikiLeaks where Trump's going from here
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  to the epic speeches against globalism
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  I mean this is an incredible time to be alive
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  my friend
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  yes indeed this was
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  Alex the best convention I've been to
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  as you know I've been to every
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  republican national convention since 1964
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  but this is the first one
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  that wasn't run by the politicians
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  and
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  it's amazing how the talking
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  points went out to the mainstream
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  media
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  because by the time I left the arena after
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Trump's momentous speech
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  and got to my hotel
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  at least 13 reporters had told me
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  that the speech was dark
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  too dark
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  oh I watched Fox singing in all of them for an hour
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  on the elliptical this morning it was all the same
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  talking point boring a failure
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  fizzled it was everyone was bored inside
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  it was I've never felt
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  electricity like I felt in there and everyone's
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  talked about that only him or at Fox
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  admitted it was the most electricity
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  he ever felt
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  I think what they're trying to say is that
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  that the speech was not
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  more upbeat meaning
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Trump didn't say Islamic terrorism
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  is not a problem he didn't say
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  that everything at the veterans administration
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  healthcare system is wonderful
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  no we're in apocalyptic
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  times this country's up hard
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  up against it these are dark
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  times and we face stark challenges
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  and Trump laid them out so
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  he didn't say it was morning in America
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  and that's why they're criticizing it
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  meanwhile the wiki
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  leaks of the Democratic National
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Committee
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  internal memos
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  prove that the nomination was stolen for Hillary
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Wasserman Schultz
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  steps down and now goes immediately to the
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Hillary paywall this is the payoff
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  for screwing
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Bernie Sanders in the progressive movement
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  so
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  the epic cheating of the Clintons
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  continues what bothers
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  me is that the alleged
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  plagiarism
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  of Melania Trump's speech
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  received far more
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  coverage than this
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  that's all they were talking about today
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  right but it receives more coverage than this
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  startling revelation
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  that the Democratic nomination was
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  stolen for Hillary Clinton
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  the media
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  the mainstream media has no sense
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  of
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  propriety or of
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  order they don't understand
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  what's important they're so busy
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  putting out propaganda
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  that they're missing the big
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  they're mindless parrots they're bird brains that just repeat what they're told
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  I mean for me
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  I feel guilty that I don't come up with words
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  big enough to describe how crazy it is
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  they were all calmly taking
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  the proven emails and the super
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  delegates making it up that elections
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  don't count and stealing it from
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Sanders as you said it's incredible
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  she should be disqualified immediately
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  meanwhile they
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  had Tim Kaine of Virginia
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  as I predicted
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  and Kaine has a
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  you predicted that like six months ago by the way on my show
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  yes I did
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  the difference the only difference between
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Tim Kaine and say
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Ted Agnew
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  is the bribes that Agnew took were illegal under
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  Maryland law but the bribes that
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Kaine took in the form of suits
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  and tickets and other things
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  are technically not illegal under Virginia law
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  he's got enough to go problem
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  he'll fit right on to the Clinton
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  ticket because as you know
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  the Clintons would steal a hot stone
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  that's right Roger Stone stay with us

[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:02.680]  what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:08.600]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.560]  out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:18.760]  the good halogen in and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.720]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:30.520]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:36.600]  gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.320]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:47.400]  is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today

[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.200]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.000]  help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.040]  trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.160]  obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.240]  or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.240]  with a degenerative disease. If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and

[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:15.720]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:26.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.600]  Now here's a clip of Donald Trump from the convention saying Americanism, not globalism,
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:51.320]  will be our credo. That is total anti-New World Order. That is like high noon to a vampire,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.120]  and then of course the clip of him a month ago saying that the era of Americans surrender on
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.720]  trade is over. Hillary Clinton is the communist spy of China. Notice that speech was not aired
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.840]  anywhere, but they can't block him when he gives a convention speech. That's why he's up so many
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.560]  points right now, way ahead of Hillary in so many polls. My big concern is stolen election.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:17.240]  Here's their problem. Trump isn't going to roll over. Trump knows she's crooked, Hillary. He knows
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:22.360]  they just stole it from Sanders. Americans know that just happened. If they miscalculate and
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.440]  steal this from Donald J. Trump, what do we do? Stone's got a plan to counter it. We're going
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:34.680]  to talk to him in a moment about that, but first the clip. Americanism, not globalism, will be our
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:42.440]  credo. We have to no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:49.960]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over. Oh my god. Ladies and gentlemen, Trump's
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:54.280]  for real. I could just tell you 100%. So's Nigel Faraz met with him privately. I'm just going to
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.120]  stop right there. None of this was even off record, but I'm just going to leave all this stuff off
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:04.040]  record. The point is Trump is 100% for real, putting his life on the line. If you don't
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.040]  back him with the Democrat and Republican party against him and all these foreign governments
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:14.040]  and the Chinese communists and this corrupt communist pope, shame on you. I'm going to tell
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.160]  you a point blank. It's not about the money. We need money to operate, obviously, but
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.960]  to see a third of the people on the street in Cleveland wearing Hillary's prison shirts shook
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.200]  up the globalist. It was a huge story. I want to see them a few months before the election
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.080]  because we've got the factories that can do it. Everyone to be wearing Clinton rape shirts.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:37.480]  Look at the New York Times. We can put the tweet up showing dozens and dozens of t-shirts and a
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:44.680]  two page spread saying photos of t-shirts. New York Times publishes t-shirts from RNC
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:48.760]  and leaves out Hillary for prison t-shirt. And they wonder why they're dying.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.920]  They put all these milk toast things up. The New York Times is a shadow of itself.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:01.640]  It's owned by a Mexican kingpin. It's bankrupt. Only the guy made billions off Obama phones
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:07.240]  and then he shovels it back into this scam. He owns it like, you know, some head. He's got
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.040]  mounted on the wall. The New York Times. What a joke. All right. I'm all over the map here at
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.000]  Stone. I want to get into the big question. I want to do it the next segments. We have plenty
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.040]  of time. Let's get into what do we do if they still the election next segment. Right now,
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.880]  let's get back to the spin, the media, Washerman Schultz, the emails proving what you said that
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:33.480]  they ran the, what you said they ran the anti-Trump protest, blamed it on Sanders. It's all there.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.720]  They stole the election. They put the super delegates in. This is so sensational.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.640]  Yeah, it's extraordinary, Alex. I mean, I'm very, going to be very interested to see if the
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:51.960]  mainstream media, particularly some of the cable networks function as a fact checker
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:58.440]  for the Trump campaign as they functioned as a fact checker for the Clinton campaign. I mean,
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:04.280]  it was extraordinary to see at least two the networks go through Trump's speech or speeches
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.560]  by others and say, well, this isn't true. Ben Gazi. She's not responsible for Ben Gazi.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.240]  Everything's great at the Veterans Administration. Just absurdities. So it'll be very interesting
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:22.520]  to see if the mainstream media plays the same role in Philadelphia as they did in Cleveland.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:30.840]  But I think we already know the answer. The Trump pens ticket is an intrinsically stronger ticket.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:37.880]  And for those who have may have bought the Trump doesn't get it. I mean, his speech was an all
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:45.000]  out call for nationalism, for American sovereignty. But it was also unity, like, hey, we're going to
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.640]  back off churches. You have free speech. We're not going to harass the gays anymore. And it was
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.280]  all so fair. It had everybody coming together. Talk about a unifier. My God, this guy's awesome.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:03.080]  Well, actually, and it's interesting that that line where he said that he would protect the LGBTQ
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:08.680]  community, he then ad libs a line that's not in the prepared text in which he said,
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:15.880]  as a Republican, I'm very happy that that got all those applause in essence. He said, thank you.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:21.880]  He said, thank you. Yeah. So I mean, look, Trump is the more tolerant candidate. Hillary will not
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:30.440]  protect gay people, Hispanics, Asians, African Americans, all Americans from Islamic terrorism.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.880]  She doesn't even admit that it exists. You and I both know they're burning churches in Egypt.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:41.640]  They're burning Christians across the region. But, you know, we're more interested in covering
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.840]  since you raised this, I had to pinch myself. They've banned the white and the red, white and blue
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.120]  of the Democratic event in the sections because white is evil. And now all over the news, including
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:57.960]  Reuters, they will not in an AP you name it, they will not say the name Ali BBC scrubs Ali from
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.640]  unit killers name as he screamed Allah Akbar. And as ISIS takes responsibility, we've reached a new
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:09.160]  level where the BBC won't even say terrorism now. What are they? What is this stone? I mean, this is
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:14.920]  crazy. Well, censorship, you've been talking about for this time for this about this for some time.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.880]  The leftist and the establishment are hysterical about the rise of Trump. And therefore, we're
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:31.000]  now going to resort to censorship or smears. I have to mention the entire sequence of events
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.600]  with the young Turks, I mean, the young Turks, particularly this fat Turk sinkhole or whatever
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.640]  his name is, let's be very clear. We did not crash their show. I would never do that.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.800]  By the way, by the way, stay right there because I want to, I mean, I need to be able to roll the
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.600]  video of this and stuff. And I want to be able to walk through this for our listeners are like,
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.840]  what are we talking about? Why don't you set the table?
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.440]  Yeah, this is very simple. We were in the media center, you and I were doing several radio
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.200]  interviews together. We had had a great interview with Jonathan Alter, who is a former time
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:08.440]  reporter now on Sirius, who's a real establishment figure, a liberal, very good guy, smart guy,
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:14.520]  just incorrect on a lot of things. But fair, we had a spirited debate. And we had people hundreds
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:20.680]  of booths begging us, begging us to be in their deals. But nobody was spitting on anybody. Then
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.520]  we're walking down the hallway. And I hear a producer for the young Turks asked you to come
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:32.600]  on the set, show you've been a guest on a number of times, it would be good TV, you go up on the
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.680]  set. I'm kind of holding back kind of just off camera is I'm sensing maybe this is a setup.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.120]  And suddenly this fat Turk goes absolutely insane. Now he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.560]  But this was a setup. They grab your microphone, then they demand that you leave.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.760]  Yeah, they wouldn't let me listen. Well, let me have it. And I'll leave. And they start saying,
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.080]  we're going to hurt you and spitting on me. And then I went, whoa. And by then they said,
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.280]  stone, get off our stage, you're like 20 feet away going, what?
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.480]  Yeah, I wasn't on their stage. But the best part is the stage, it's a freaking hangar,
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.280]  you know, a huge building just everywhere. Stets everywhere. You're like, what?
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.560]  Yeah, the best part is, is that Saint keeps yelling, you're a liar, stone, you're a liar.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.280]  Everything you've written is a lie. Everything you say is a lie. I say, what have I lied about?
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.560]  And he says, Elliot Spitzer, does he not read the news? What part is wrong?
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.960]  Did Spitzer liked hookers or did he like to choke hookers? Only a month ago,
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.760]  the New York Post in the Daily News reported that a woman in a New York hotel called the police
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.800]  because she said Elliot Spitzer tried to choke her. By the way, he's been convicted of all this
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.800]  hooker stuff. It's in the newspaper. What you said, he says, that's why you're discredited.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:46.840]  It's like Roger Stone said that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. He's discredited.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.640]  Technically, he hasn't been convicted. That's exactly the point. He was never meant for the
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:58.600]  earlier hooker stuff. I'll say that. $19.4 trillion in debt. We have added $1.1 trillion
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:05.640]  year to the national debt under Obama. In 2006, US Senator Barack Obama boldly declared that
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:11.240]  increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. That was one of the truest
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:17.640]  things that he ever said. But now the US debt is sitting at a grand total of $19.4 trillion.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:24.200]  When he first entered the White House, our federal government was only $10.6 trillion in debt.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:31.240]  That means that we have added an average of $1.1 trillion a year to the national debt under Obama.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.360]  Obama will be the first president in all US history to not have a single year when the
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:43.160]  US economy grew by 3% or better. Unfortunately, this Ponzi scheme cannot go on forever and a day
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:29:11.160]  of reckoning is coming. I'm Ashley Beckford reporting. Read the full article at infowars.com.

[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:36.840]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us on
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:47.240]  Stations Across the Country. We were getting into what happened at the RNC. I would have
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:54.280]  the speeches I was giving, the thousands of people I would have, comedians from Adult Swim,
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.800]  charge the stage and start fights. I just bring them up. I would have, you know,
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:03.320]  Ann Coulter jumping on a show I was on. It didn't matter. But then I'm like, hey, come on the show
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:09.320]  as I'm walking down through Media Robe, a huge building next to the RNC event, just full of,
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.040]  I mean, I'm talking 300, 400 TV radio stations. More shows you could do all day. You could kill
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:18.120]  yourself in there. And I'm wandering by and some producer waves is over. I got to do some other
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.760]  interviews. So I do them. I come back by and then they're doing the show. I see they're on break.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.160]  They're not talking. I'm a media guy. I see people sitting there not talking. I go, hey,
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:32.200]  what's going on guys? Hey, and then they got kind of friendly. And as soon as they go live,
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.520]  the person I believe, they'll look the same. It's all like the trendy guys that run it.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:42.680]  Same suits, same hairstyle, everything goes Alex Jones is taking over. Alex Jones is almost
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.640]  said, I'm going to beat you up and start spitting in my face and attacking me.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.120]  And they start going, Roger Stone, you're not taking over. And Roger Stone is like 20 feet away.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:55.480]  And Roger Stone goes, what are you talking about? So again, it's not about the young turds or the
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:59.560]  young Trigley Puffs or any of this. It's about their disinformation, how they were on the Google
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:04.680]  YouTube stage that admits they work with the White House. And how as soon as our live videos went
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:10.200]  up, they took them down in real time. Since we made a big deal about it, they put them back up.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.480]  But I want to digress into, they steal the election. We've seen them steal it from Bernie
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:21.720]  Sanders. Will there be a big revolt against that? And so much more. But putting bookends on this,
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.520]  while you talk about it, we're going to roll some footage for TV viewers,
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:28.280]  WashingtonInfoWars.com, forward slash show of what actually happened, Roger Stone.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:34.600]  Yeah, look, I don't want to belabor this. But to be very clear, it's not that Elliot
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:40.200]  Spitzer was ever convicted. In fact, that's precisely the problem. He violated the Mann Act,
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.480]  taking a prostitute across eight state lines. Some liberals say, well, the Mann Act is never
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:52.760]  enforced. Actually, a New York state Supreme Court justice was convicted of two 15 years in jail
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:58.920]  for violating the Mann Act, the exact same year that Spitzer did only months before. He isn't
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.280]  convicted because he was wealthy and connected. If he were black and poor, he'd be in jail right
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:11.720]  now. As far as his both patronizing and choking hookers, one month ago, a prostitute called the
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.640]  police from a New York hotel and said that Elliot Spitzer had tried to choke her. The police showed
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:24.760]  up. He had already fled the scene of the crime. She had marks on her neck. They went looking for him.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:31.640]  Then subsequently, she fled the country that very night back to Russia. Nobody to question
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.960]  no crime. And last week was announced that Spitzer is suing her presumably to get the payoff back.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:44.680]  So I don't know what St. is talking about. This guy is a criminal. He's just not convicted,
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:50.760]  but he's violated the law of all things to yell at. He didn't tell me I was lying about LBJ,
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:55.800]  which of course I'm not, or about Donald Trump. So look, the guy doesn't know anything. I watched
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:02.600]  him on TV. He's inarticulate. It's all rote name calling. You see, this is the classic tactic of
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.720]  the left. Stone, you're a liar. You're a liar. They don't want to refute the facts because the
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.240]  liberals can't. Okay. Well, I'm just going from memory. I don't pay attention to a lot of New
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:17.400]  York politics, but listen, listen, listen, fix it because you know how this is. The, the, the,
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:24.280]  the penny wasted media matters for America. We get their panties in a twist about, you know,
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.600]  these arcane subjects. So it was sure, but I'm just going from memory, Roger. Didn't, didn't,
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.360]  didn't he, I know he wasn't convicted for this, but didn't he get in trouble for the stuff before
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.160]  he resigned as per governor over it. So he, but that's exactly the point. He should have been
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:45.320]  prosecuted, but he wasn't because he's a wire. Uh, the madams who provided hookers for him,
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:51.560]  they went to jail. So well, my big problem with him is, didn't he put a law in place
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.440]  to take the cars of Johns while he was seeing hookers every day? Exactly. So real issue.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.600]  But listen, this is all a distraction. Why did he say you were on his stage?
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:06.440]  Most of its radio stopped taking over your 20 feet away in a hallway. And then, I mean,
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.680]  I'm, I'm, there's so much bigger fish to fry, but it's just crazy. Well, the bigger news,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.280]  of course, is the self-immolation of Ted Cruz. I mean, Ted Cruz has a golden opportunity
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:24.200]  and he muffs it. 1964, Barry Goldwater was the nominee. Nelson Rockefeller took a powder,
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.160]  wouldn't endorse him. George Romney, Mitt's father takes a powder, wouldn't endorse him.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.200]  Governor Williams, here in Pennsylvania, he splits to, he won't endorse it. Richard Nixon
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.720]  sees only opportunity. He not only endorses Goldwater, he introduces him to the convention
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.280]  for his acceptance speech. And then he hits the road and campaigns for the Goldwater Miller
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:52.360]  ticket in 38 states, more than Barry himself. Four years later, when Goldwater lost, and I
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:37:00.520]  don't expect Trump to lose, but to go out the, to follow out the analogy, Nelson Rockefeller is
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:07.480]  persona non-gratis, negrada, Barry Goldwater, Bill Buckley, John Tower, Harold Curtis, the giants
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:12.840]  of the conservative movement. They're not for Ronald Reagan in 1968. They're for Richard Nixon,
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:19.320]  because he was a party loyalist in the party's greatest battle. Ted Cruz could have been a hero
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:28.840]  here. Instead, he is so self-absorbed. He is so obtuse about how he looks. He stabbed Donald
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.640]  Trump right in the back. It was one of the most duplicitous things I've ever seen in American
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:39.560]  politics. Let me be clear. The Hill reported on this. He's going to have a primary in Texas.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:46.120]  We're going to find a candidate who is a true constitutionalist and not an egomaniac globalist
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.320]  who's taking a million dollar plus illegal loans from Citibank and Goldman Sachs.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.440]  Speaking of that, I want to come back and talk about what happens if I try to steal the election
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.280]  from Trump. You have a plan to counter it. But here's one of the senior congressmen from Texas,
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:07.000]  Congressman Carter, I talked to at the airport flying out Friday. This is his views on Cruz,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.480]  not being a Texan. He should go back to Canada. Well, we were sitting here about to board our
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.840]  flight and it's Congressman Carter from the great state of Texas. Sir, you are actually a real
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:22.600]  Carter Texan, meaning you're actually from there. What is your view over all of what Ted Cruz did?
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:29.640]  Oh, well, first and foremost, he calls himself a Texan. He does keep his word. That's intolerable.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:36.040]  Texans keep their word even if they're hurt, even if it hurts them, because that's who we are.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:42.280]  It breaks my heart that he's a Texas senator and didn't keep his word. I heard it from a little bird
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.360]  that when he didn't keep his word, you had something to say. I got kind of whiplistic,
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:52.440]  but I've calmed down now. So should Ted Cruz maybe just go be a congressman in on a look?
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:58.280]  Well, he's acting more like a Canadian than a Texan. Thank you, sir. Have a good one. Do you
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:07.960]  have any comment? All right, folks. That's infowars.com on the job. infowars.com. By the way,
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:12.600]  you can read it in Politico. You can read it in the Hill. Myself and Roger Stone with a little
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.560]  Trump juice. We're coming after that fake Texan, okay? All hat, no cattle.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.320]  And it's not about a vendetta against Cruz, but he and Beck are just such slime bags. Beck now goes
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:30.760]  on ABC News, CBS News, you name it, and says vote for Hillary. I mean, how in the hell could anybody
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.520]  put up with this? Yeah, look, Glenn Beck is unfortunately irrelevant. A more important
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:42.760]  point here, Alex, is that the Republicans had a very successful convention and Trump
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:51.080]  really crystallized the stakes in this election. These reporters saying it's too dark. These are
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.520]  apocalyptic times and they call, you know, dark times all for dark rhetoric. We have dark choices,
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.960]  stark choices, I should say. So I feel very good. I think Trump will be a couple points ahead.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.760]  Let's move to the most important point here. Yes, we are going to have to be vigilant about
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:14.440]  voter fraud. I read a terrific study by Richard Charnett, who's a math, retired mathematician,
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.600]  a brilliant guy, a liberal, by the way. Stay there. Stay there. I'm gonna give you the
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.920]  form. We come back. What is the final legs of the race? What are the dirty tricks? How do we
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:28.360]  counter fraud? They've stolen it from Sanders. Will the Sanders people try to stand up for the vote
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.920]  in America? Or are we bad to even say there was ever even voting? If you ever wanted a great deal
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.480]  on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.600]  to want to miss this important message. Here's why. My friends, we already see major power grid
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:49.320]  problems, and it's getting worse. So please listen. Solar generators really do provide
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.040]  lifesaving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently,
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.160]  emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer storms,
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.040]  blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.200]  of the sheep. And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.720]  has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.920]  dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for infill wars listeners. So it's
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:24.760]  a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.600]  to generate maximum electricity with minimum money. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.

[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:38.040]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.560]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean,
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:49.240]  I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:55.320]  right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.600]  lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.320]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.600]  stuff that says there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there, you have the
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:14.680]  organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:18.120]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.680]  back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarsleif.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.120]  great for your body, period. And you can support the broadcast, infowarsleif.com. Thank you,
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.040]  Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:57.560]  Spoke on the water. Fire in the sky. Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:04.920]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Roger's got to jump on a cab and get over to a very
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:09.720]  important meeting. He's got to go in like five, six minutes. I want to give him the floor as best I
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:17.160]  can. Roger, obviously, we know that the polls show Trump's ahead. I think this is going to be a
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:22.760]  boring fest that we're going to see with Hillary. A, do you think that some of the Bernie folks will
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:26.520]  do the right thing for the voters' rights in this country? Do you think they'll be able to
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:31.000]  suppress that? Then let's shift gears into Trump winning. And what they're going to try to do to
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.480]  steal it? How do we counter that? Let's take them one by one. And one of the great disappointments
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:43.320]  here is that Bernie Sanders himself turns out to be a fraud. All this talk about progressive values
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:49.960]  and principles turns out to be nothing. He is signed on to the Wall Street candidate. If I were a
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:56.120]  Sanders supporter, I would be furious twofold. One, he got cheated out of the nomination. We now
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:02.680]  know that definitively based on these WikiLeaks documents. Yeah, that is so bombshell. But the
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:08.440]  media is to hurl up on the alleged plagiarism by Melania Trump. And then second... I got
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:12.920]  interrupted. How did you know when it first happened in Chicago, you said, unequivocally,
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.520]  these are Hillary operatives. This is White House run, not just Hillary. Now it's all come out that
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.680]  it was directed by the Democratic Party and they had people dressed up like Sanders. How did you
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.680]  know that? I have sources, Alex. Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. Just go ahead. I do want to tell you
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:38.280]  about a huge piece of news here. Malik Obama, Barack Obama's brother, has endorsed Donald Trump.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.640]  That's right. Front page of the New York Post today. Blockbuster story. Malik was in New York
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:49.720]  last week when I understand this decision was made. Pardon me, let me make sure I have the
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.600]  right cover here. And he says he absolutely loves Trump because the corruption of Hillary
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:57.880]  and Obama not delivering for folks. It's a big deal to have Mr. Obama
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:04.200]  or the brother of Obama endorsing him. And ironically, Alex, Bernie Sanders' brother,
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:09.640]  who lives in the UK, said that Bill Clinton was a rapist. Oh my goodness, that's what you're not
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:14.360]  allowed to say, even though it's entirely true. Even though you're banned on all networks because
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:19.160]  of it. Well, what's ironic here, we went through this in our interview with Jonathan Alter. For
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:24.840]  some reason, the liberal media, the mainstream media insists that because Hillary and Bill have
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:30.120]  denied his sex crimes, his assaults on multiple credible women, that means they're not true. In
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.080]  other words, Broderick, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Willie, Paula Jones, all these women,
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:41.240]  they should not be believed because she's Hillary. This is nonsense across the board, just total
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:46.200]  nonsense. But Bill Clinton's settled cases with women that claimed rape. Yes. And I believe Juanita
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:51.560]  Broderick and I can tell you this, there are going to be new women coming forward who have now
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:57.720]  surfaced, who have been emboldened by the very brave Juanita Broderick, who have read the stories
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:04.840]  about her deal detailing Bill's serial assaults on her or stalking of her. And there are new
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:12.120]  credible women who will be coming forward shortly. That's amazing. Now, obviously,
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.080]  we've talked privately, I don't know if we can talk about this, but what do we do?
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.960]  They try to steal the election. I mean, obviously, if there's a big enough landslide,
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:22.680]  they can't do it. Obviously, Trump's not going to back down. He exposed crooked Hillary earlier.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.600]  He exposed the Republicans trying to steal the nomination from him. That's why they failed.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.280]  So Trump obviously has the instincts to beat him. How do you see this playing out? Because I mean,
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:36.040]  right now, I see Trump winning. I think it's crucial that you begin to prepare the argument
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:42.920]  before the election. As I started to say, I've read this terrific study of the Wisconsin elections
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:49.240]  in primaries by Richard Charnan, who is a Democratic liberal retired mathematician, brilliant guy,
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.640]  who concludes indisputably that elections in that state have been stolen through the system.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:01.880]  We're going to see this again, these machines that have no paper trail, these computerized
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:08.680]  machines. This is truly, truly problematic. How do we counter it? I mean, I don't put the
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.760]  car before the horse, but if they steal it for Hillary, we know there's fraud. What do we do?
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:19.160]  Precisely why I have to leave this broadcast and go to a meeting. I mean, there will be a game plan.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.200]  The good news is that I think we know this is going to happen. It's not like in 1960, when,
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:30.280]  when, if you'll read my book on LBJ, the man who killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ. I have a
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:38.360]  detailed analysis of both Chicago and Texas. I go through precinct by precinct, where, for example,
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:46.360]  in one precinct, there are 385 people registered and the vote was 695 for Kennedy and 13 for Nixon.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.720]  Sure. I mean, it's all famously documented. It's all admitted. But Nixon was caught totally by
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:57.240]  surprise. He didn't see it coming. We know what they're up to. There are lawyers and computer
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:03.720]  experts beginning to develop a strategy. Donald Trump is not going to take this sitting down.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:09.160]  Absolutely. I know he's not counting his voter fraud. No, he's front and center on the radar.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:13.800]  We know that. Very exciting that Trump is conscious and so smart. So in closing here,
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.840]  I mean, we already defeated the Republican establishment trying to spin it that, oh,
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.560]  your votes don't count. We're the imperial sovereigns to quote George Will, that bloop
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.760]  in their face. Trump fought back, unlike Sanders, the popular vote counted. This is a referendum
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.880]  against tyranny in the establishment. Everybody for Sanders should vote for Trump. And it's very,
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.720]  very exciting to know that Trump's not going to put up with this. I think we're on the edge of
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:42.520]  the biggest event in American history since our founding. That's probably correct. And I also
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:48.200]  want to point out that Time Magazine has a terrific piece about the Clinton rapesher.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:56.280]  Of course, they're poo-pooing it, not realizing that they're helping InfoWars.com and the Stone
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:02.280]  Zone sell, hopefully, millions of shirts. So if you have the Hillary from prison t-shirt,
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:08.440]  you now must get the companion Bill Clinton rapesher. We're showing the Time Magazine showing
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:13.080]  you in the rapesher. Now available. That was just a demo at infowarstore.com where the folks
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:17.240]  are printing it, putting it out. And then notice the New York Times, though, did a whole spread
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:22.120]  on the t-shirts of the RNC, but didn't show any of the real shirts, my friend. I mean, this is
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:27.160]  why they're going bankrupt. They did show the shirt that has the cover of the Clinton's War on
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:32.520]  Women. So it's the first time the New York Times has acknowledged my book. Other than one article,
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:38.680]  it said Donald Trump seems to be using it as a playbook. Thank you very much. Well, obviously,
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.880]  we normally have you on once a week, but as the quickening happens, we've got to have you on more
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:48.040]  and more, Roger. Last question. What do you think your gut? Will the Bernie people, because we
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:51.800]  do was telling me he's there on the ground. He says like, there'll be 80 people for Sanders,
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:55.640]  one person for Hillary. He thinks there's going to be a rebellion or something. That's why they
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:01.880]  got rid of Schultz as a sacrificial lamb. Well, I thought about going out there. I had my Shaga
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:07.640]  Vera t-shirt, my beret, my dark glasses. I figured I would stop bathing a couple of days before the
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:14.920]  convention, so it would fit in. But I have decided not to go because the mainstream media will make
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:21.400]  something out of it. The, the, the Bernie people are angry and they should be. And I hope that
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:28.120]  their protests are, are adequate because this is fevery. This is wholesale theft of democracy.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:32.200]  Let's leave it there. All right, sir. Get to your meeting and we'll talk to you in the next
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.400]  few days, stonezone.com and fullwarstore.com for the new Clinton rape shirt. God bless you.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.560]  Thank you, Alex. Folks, they can censor us. They can try to ignore us at mainstream media,
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.560]  but when you send a video link or an article, when we get more traffic than New York Times many
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:51.240]  days, when drudge gets more traffic than New York Times, Facebook combined every day, when you go
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.080]  out a third of the people, no exaggeration on the street, we're wearing Hillary for prison shirts.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:01.880]  When that's going on, it shakes the system to its core and they can try to censor Bill Clinton's
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:06.040]  sexual abuse and all the things he did. He makes Bill Cosby look like a choir boy.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:12.280]  You know, he makes Roger Ells look like an angel. He makes, you know, Jeffrey Dahmer look
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:19.160]  like a cupcake. This is how you fight him is you personally wearing T-shirts, you personally
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.680]  setting up YouTube sites or calling his dog radio or running for officer,
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.880]  not complying with all this tyranny or all the leftist threats don't show up or will kill you.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.400]  I mean, believe me, it went on. We showed up and the left didn't even really show up because
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.400]  they're not the left. They're a bunch of criminals run by the Democratic Party that's run by Saudi
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:41.240]  Arabia in the communist Chinese. Are the Republicans perfect? Absolutely not. They're the horrible
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:47.320]  establishment that works for the Democrats. We've just run them over too. But I can tell you folks,
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:53.000]  Donald Trump is the real deal. Is he perfect? Absolutely not. Am I perfect? Are you perfect?
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.320]  No. He's a real deal. So to everybody that early on has been back in Trump, your instincts were
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:05.160]  right. Your discernment was right. There's still a lot of cult-like and evangelicals and people.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:08.920]  And I'm a Christian. I love evangelicals. I went to evangelical churches, run up as a kid,
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:15.080]  that and Baptist. But man, he's not the Messiah. I know they got you to invoke that, admit you
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.600]  followed false prophets and glim back and Ted Cruz. I mean, it's just, it's cult-like. They're
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.440]  telling you both for Hillary. It's evil. It's evil. And a so-called deal's been made if they
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:32.360]  sabotaged Trump. That these two, he could even be, the plan, as I was told, is that's going to be his
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:37.960]  vice president. Well, you'll never get that from the global issue, idiot. You've been, you've been
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:42.920]  absolutely scammed. By the way, I hear in Philadelphia, this show's being broadcast on a pirate station
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:48.680]  since Hillary tried to censor our airplanes and billboards, 92.9 and Philly. I just hope folks
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.120]  don't spread the word about that. It's only on for the duration of that. We're going to have a crew
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:57.480]  on covering it all. 28 hour broadcast kicks off this Wednesday, 11 a.m. to the next day when
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:02.920]  the show ends at 3 p.m. So 28 hours long. But I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central for the
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:09.400]  four hour broadcast infowars.com or slash show or affiliates and TV stations across the station,
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.440]  across the nation. I keep forgetting we're on TV. We're on a bunch of stations. A bunch of radio
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  stations pick up the nightly news as well. Never saw that coming. Great job with the crew. We'll be
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:22.600]  back tomorrow. Lord willing, pray for us and support us.
