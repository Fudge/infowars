[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:02.000 --> 00:08.000]  You
[00:08.000 --> 00:23.000]  You
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.720]  Infowars tomorrow's news today
[00:25.720 --> 00:36.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[00:36.880 --> 00:47.960]  a story that most outlets ignored private leaked documents from the CDC
[00:47.960 --> 00:53.800]  show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included the very
[00:53.800 --> 00:59.040]  same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database this mode of
[00:59.040 --> 01:03.360]  deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into
[01:03.360 --> 01:09.840]  specific populations such as red states analysis of the number of dying per
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.080]  100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.120]  vaccine deaths are happening in red states second smartest guy in the world
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.920]  on substack also reported on it and has recently published an update writing
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.280]  that now we have a more robust and far more damning view of this carefully
[01:31.280 --> 01:38.840]  distributed depopulation scheme back in Ohio of 2021 the expose publishes a
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.560]  report on data found in the USA's there's vaccine adverse event reporting
[01:45.560 --> 01:52.200]  system which reveals that 100% of COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been
[01:52.200 --> 01:58.400]  caused by just 5% of the batches batches that can be identified and these
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.720]  deadly batches were not distributed evenly the top eight states with the
[02:03.720 --> 02:11.000]  highest vaccination death rate Kentucky Arkansas West Virginia Montana Alaska
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.400]  North Dakota Wyoming and Tennessee are all red states 19 of the top 24 on the
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.680]  list are red states and California has been the least affected by the deadly
[02:24.680 --> 02:32.160]  lots of COVID vaccine the numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse
[02:32.160 --> 02:38.160]  vaccination death rate than California suggesting that Kentucky received 20
[02:38.160 --> 02:44.400]  times the amount of deadly batches than California did Florida number 20 on the
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.320]  list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination received three times the
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.440]  amount of deadly batches than California with its vaccination death rate at 200
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.000]  percent higher than California's the author points out that these deadly
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.760]  batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and slow kill lots as we
[03:08.760 --> 03:14.440]  are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time and the evidence shows
[03:14.440 --> 03:20.560]  that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots this would go along
[03:20.560 --> 03:26.440]  with the United Nations agenda 2030 planned which seeks to move the entire
[03:26.440 --> 03:31.960]  population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.480]  the name of climate change they have less than seven years to accomplish this
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.760]  and they are deadly serious about it the US government is in lockstep with the
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.240]  United Nations and they will resort to murder and democide to accomplish their
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.200]  goals of total control many are suggesting that this is what is happening
[03:54.200 --> 04:00.480]  in East Palestine Ohio right now the people of America are under attack by
[04:00.480 --> 04:04.480]  their own government who is never going to quit until they accomplish their
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.560]  goals or unless they are stopped reporting for Info Wars this is Greg
[04:09.560 --> 04:29.560]  Grease
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.480]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say I don't know what's
[04:34.480 --> 04:41.480]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[04:41.480 --> 04:47.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones

[06:00.880 --> 06:29.560]  Well it's already the last day of the second month of 2023 wow we're really
[06:29.560 --> 06:33.480]  racing into the future aren't we thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday
[06:33.480 --> 06:39.800]  February 28th 2023 transmission we've got masses of absolute critical news the
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.720]  good the bad the ugly to be covering with you here today and then Mike Adams is
[06:43.720 --> 06:49.560]  coming in to co-host in the second third hour with very special guests as well
[06:49.560 --> 06:54.600]  some very hard-hitting massive breaking news in the second and third hour as
[06:54.600 --> 06:59.400]  well and on into the fourth today here on the Alex Jones show thank you so much
[06:59.400 --> 07:04.600]  for joining us all right I talked a lot Sunday and Monday about the chain
[07:04.600 --> 07:08.280]  reaction of global awakening that's happening now the enemy's gonna strike
[07:08.280 --> 07:14.120]  back at that by cutting off resources and and crashing economies and we've
[07:14.120 --> 07:21.560]  seen some major developments to give us a window into how the new world order
[07:21.560 --> 07:25.680]  plans to bring down civilization using organized crime gangs that they
[07:25.680 --> 07:31.400]  basically steer protect and at the top control and of course I'm talking about
[07:31.400 --> 07:40.720]  MS-13 that is originally based out of is based out of El Salvador but that
[07:40.720 --> 07:47.520]  started in the US prison system and the US prison system and for over a hundred
[07:47.520 --> 07:52.560]  years how they've controlled the prison system is by segregating people into
[07:52.560 --> 07:57.560]  different groups and then playing those groups off against each other with a
[07:57.560 --> 08:04.640]  divide and conquer strategy so naib bukele the president of El Salvador only
[08:04.640 --> 08:10.240]  got in about a year ago crime has dropped about 97 percent violent crime
[08:10.240 --> 08:17.000]  about 99 percent since he got in because most the crime is committed by the
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.120]  hundred thousand strong or so MS-13 that are one of the most murderous vicious
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.680]  death cults in the world they do satanic rituals when they torture people to death
[08:27.680 --> 08:34.800]  you name it they literally worship Satan and they have been a scourge not just in
[08:34.800 --> 08:41.800]  the US and El Salvador but in Mexico and in Mexico the army just basically goes
[08:41.800 --> 08:45.560]  in and slaughters them all and then they'll send in their people into places
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.440]  like Cancun other areas just to randomly shoot people now that's the MS-13
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.760]  now you'll remember if you'll remember Nancy Pelosi what three four years ago
[08:55.760 --> 08:58.800]  in fact I forgot to tell the crew find that clip when Harrison Smith comes on
[08:58.800 --> 09:02.640]  30 months talk about this I'm just giving you a prelude right now where she
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.000]  says we shouldn't be mean to MS-13 we're all God's children that's because it's
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.920]  well known that MS-13 and other Latin gangs but they're the most vicious the
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.120]  wander money to the Democratic Party help run the smuggling and take a big cut
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.680]  to their lawyers and others other narcotics money for methamphetamine
[09:19.680 --> 09:24.600]  cocaine heroin fentanyl the list goes on and on so MS-13 takes young street
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.800]  children about age 10 basically trains them puts them through hell makes them
[09:29.800 --> 09:34.000]  by age 13 start committing major crimes by about 14 to 15 committing murders
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.240]  become fully made members of the gang so when you have those particular tattoos
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.160]  that is their uniform it's like a Nazi uniform it's like a communist uniform
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.320]  you don't get those unless you're in the gang and if you have those and don't
[09:48.320 --> 09:58.800]  have them the gang kills you okay so when Naib Bukele started arresting
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.000]  upwards of 40,000 of these people for being known members of a terrorist
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.160]  organization who's sworn to basically take over and murder and slaughter and do
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.120]  whatever they want arguably the worst game on the planet it's not one of the
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.960]  globals completely but it's definitely partially protected by them it's gonna
[10:16.960 --> 10:20.240]  take a military action to deal with that or you let that military group that is
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.320]  MS-13 win and that's all this is so I don't like a police state well you can
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.160]  run some of the b-roll of the videos that the president's put out of all the
[10:28.160 --> 10:31.400]  troops and formations out there and he talks about honor and will encourage or
[10:31.400 --> 10:36.080]  be playing some of those clips coming up I know that the president is a listener
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.560]  and I know he's a supporter of info wars I know he's retweeted off and on info
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.160]  wars reports and videos we did have an invite a ball scenario going on a
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.200]  brazilian interview a few years ago we just couldn't do it really wanted to go
[10:50.200 --> 10:54.480]  but we're just tied down here never got to that but looks like we're probably
[10:54.480 --> 10:58.520]  gonna go out and interview this guy and it looks like we probably will do it so
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.200]  I understand that people are concerned about this and I'm not even defending it
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.840]  but when you have cancer what are you gonna do about it and so they've
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.520]  protected these gangs here in the US the Soros DA's let them out of prison all
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.520]  across the United States when they commit seriously violent crimes they're
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.720]  working with the global of Soros Democratic Party crime acts so now the CIA
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.440]  control Washington Post New York Times are basically calling for naib who
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.800]  Kelly to be removed from office even though he was elected with about 60% of
[11:30.800 --> 11:35.160]  the vote he has the most popular polling numbers ever seen in Latin America not
[11:35.160 --> 11:42.000]  just in El Salvador he has a 95% positive rating in one year in El Salvador
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.440]  he has over a 80% approval rating in Latin America so he's above and beyond
[11:48.440 --> 11:55.000]  even the popularity of Bolsonaro and of course Bolsonaro had his hands tied
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.320]  because he didn't control the Congress he didn't control the Supreme Court that
[11:58.320 --> 12:01.440]  our Communist so as you saw they stole the election the State Department ran
[12:01.440 --> 12:08.600]  that removed him so what is who Kelly supposed to do when there were tens of
[12:08.600 --> 12:15.440]  thousands of murders a month by MS-13 shaking down kidnappings businesses
[12:15.440 --> 12:18.840]  everything under their control police officers being shot every day what are
[12:18.840 --> 12:21.960]  you supposed to do when they're wearing a military uniform that's what those
[12:21.960 --> 12:26.480]  tattoos are of how many murders they've committed what team they work with what
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.560]  they did one tattoos when they're 10 they robbed somebody you know when
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.520]  they're when they're 11 they start doing more robberies when they're 12 13 they
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.600]  start murdering people and so some of these guys have committed hundreds of
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.840]  murders apiece and those are the kingpins and those are the 90 MS-13
[12:42.840 --> 12:47.880]  leaders that the military and police bash their brains out in the prison so
[12:47.880 --> 12:50.680]  before they took them out of all the smaller prisons this one big giant when
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.080]  they built for 40,000 of them they went in and beat the leaders to death so they're
[12:55.080 --> 12:58.120]  gonna be running their prison inside there the way the US lets gang leaders
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.560]  run things they're isolated and they're not gonna be running their gangs from
[13:02.560 --> 13:09.120]  inside and they're basically in a supermax prison and so it's very very
[13:09.120 --> 13:15.120]  harsh it's very very serious and I'm not saying that I don't think you couldn't
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.400]  turn into its own tyranny once this police state deals with what they have
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.560]  but once you have lawlessness and defund the police and gangs taking over once
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.000]  the police get pushed back like you see all over the US things collapse into
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.800]  lawlessness and then the deep state can bring in its own leftist tyranny that
[13:33.800 --> 13:36.920]  controls the police that will then arrest political dissidents and go after
[13:36.920 --> 13:39.800]  conservatives like the New York Times wants people for their speech arrested
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.520]  but they want MS-13 let out of jail see how it works so the leftist like this
[13:43.520 --> 13:50.280]  model of lawlessness and collapsed to a certain extent if it brings in a Hugo
[13:50.280 --> 13:54.480]  Chavez for them or it brings in an Adolf Hitler for him Hitler used major
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.240]  street wars and crime exploding and a promise piece come to power so it's a
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.860]  double-edged sword will Bukele use this to become a dictator will he use this
[14:03.860 --> 14:08.920]  to go after his opposition that that is an MS-13 normally historically
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.400]  especially in Latin America but most places as well it ends up happening
[14:12.400 --> 14:15.760]  we're run by the security apparatus here in the United States at the top it's
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.000]  waging war against the local police by putting in their own Soros prosecutors
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.080]  people not prosecute and then attacking police when they make minor mistakes or
[14:24.080 --> 14:27.720]  even when they don't make mistakes to bully and control them and come in and
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.880]  socialize them under the new communist way and then the police will be more
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.200]  brutal than ever once the communists during control Bukele is a big Bitcoiner
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.000]  he's a big anti-New World Order he's a fan of info wars so that makes the scales
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.800]  tip towards him to understanding you want to be ruled by MS-13 or you want to
[14:45.800 --> 14:51.360]  let us take these guys out and again anybody that's a citizen under our law
[14:51.360 --> 14:55.320]  or the other laws around the world modeled after ours has due process has
[14:55.320 --> 14:59.080]  rights should be tried and other accomplices should be jailed with them
[14:59.080 --> 15:04.080]  but when you have an outside military force trained in the US MS-13 that's
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.160]  come back into El Salvador that has military markings all over them and
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.520]  that basically just like generals and admirals and colonels have fruit salad
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.120]  on them telling you their campaigns and what they did MS-13 is a military
[15:16.120 --> 15:19.960]  operation and those are all of their campaigns and what they've done so
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.600]  they're in military uniforms robbing killing stealing kidnapping creating
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.960]  horrible drugs just absolutely out of control behavior all they make all the
[15:28.960 --> 15:31.560]  other gangsters all the other gangsters all the other groups look like
[15:31.560 --> 15:36.760]  sweetie pies that maintain order compared to them and so it remains to be seen
[15:36.760 --> 15:39.840]  we're gonna look at this closely but also the biggest news first when we come
[15:39.840 --> 15:43.920]  back we'll revisit MS-13 in about 15 minutes but first the big news the
[15:43.920 --> 15:47.240]  government now admits COVID-19 was made in a lab we told you three years ago

[20:20.920 --> 20:24.760]  joining us Harrison Smith with me in the Austin Texas tuning host joining me
[20:24.760 --> 20:28.080]  coming up on this very important issue of El Salvador and the globalist response
[20:28.080 --> 20:32.400]  to it but I want to get into something very important and even bigger than
[20:32.400 --> 20:37.560]  what's happening with mf13 and the example it shows us and that's this three
[20:37.560 --> 20:45.400]  years ago plus in January late January February and March and April of 2020 I
[20:45.400 --> 20:52.080]  went to the top experts in the world on bio weapons and the history of them and
[20:52.080 --> 20:56.640]  laboratories and what's happening and I checked with what experts in the US
[20:56.640 --> 21:04.960]  Europe India Australia Russia were saying and the first was a major Indian
[21:04.960 --> 21:10.920]  University is the only Indian University that bought the CRISPR
[21:10.920 --> 21:17.040]  software and has other very high-tech computer systems that can scan viruses
[21:17.040 --> 21:21.040]  and they looked at COVID-19 and they said it's got the P shuttle gene a bunch
[21:21.040 --> 21:26.120]  other things and basically it's like in Blade Runner where he takes the scale to
[21:26.120 --> 21:31.400]  the cloning market NASA lady under electron microscope what is this a
[21:31.400 --> 21:35.640]  fish a snake what is it and who made it and she says yeah it's a snake and it
[21:35.640 --> 21:39.840]  was made by this company superior craftsmanship blah blah blah and that's
[21:39.840 --> 21:44.680]  a science fiction movie from the 80s this is real and in the movie there's a
[21:44.680 --> 21:51.040]  serial number on the cells in the real world there are injection sites where
[21:51.040 --> 21:57.160]  they smash the viruses together and you think man they've got scalpels and things
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.400]  they can put a virus together no they have these big gene guns there's
[22:01.400 --> 22:06.000]  different ways they do it they just fire millions and millions of cells of the
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.960]  types they want together and then under electron microscopes they divide out the
[22:09.960 --> 22:13.840]  viruses that are what they want then they put those into pigs or other animals
[22:13.840 --> 22:17.120]  and have them get sick then they drain the blood out of that and then put into
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.840]  other animals and other things there's a lot of different ways to do it but we
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.480]  know what Bill Gates and all these different levels for doing a chapel
[22:24.480 --> 22:27.960]  in North Carolina and the Wuhan lab and there were big scandals in 2015 that
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.280]  Obama was funding the gain of function of a SARS COVID virus and so we
[22:32.280 --> 22:37.240]  specifically exactly because of Dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the US chemical
[22:37.240 --> 22:42.080]  biological weapons laws the law the guy that was the head UN prosecutor after
[22:42.080 --> 22:49.600]  that for war crimes he came on and so this is what happened he was 100
[22:49.600 --> 22:55.040]  percent dead on should get 15 Pulitzer prices I mean it's just insane nothing
[22:55.040 --> 23:00.280]  I've never seen things so dead on he was saying in early no late January 2020 and
[23:00.280 --> 23:03.880]  then we went and looked at what the Indians said and boy they got attacked
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.480]  and the Indians said well we're having all our funding threatened so we're not
[23:08.480 --> 23:12.560]  going to say we're wrong we're gonna withdraw our paper with the electron
[23:12.560 --> 23:17.080]  microscope scans and we're gonna say we've withdrawn it under pressure then a
[23:17.080 --> 23:21.360]  bunch of other governments including in France and the discoverer of HIV he went
[23:21.360 --> 23:26.200]  public top virologist in the world and said it is five viruses it's a
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.240]  chimera and it was made a freaking lab in a trillion years a virus wouldn't
[23:31.240 --> 23:34.720]  evolve to be five different viruses from different families including an HIV
[23:34.720 --> 23:41.240]  spike protein okay that's the delivery system it's highly toxic as well so we
[23:41.240 --> 23:45.640]  knew that early on and in vaccine trials for regular vaccines for COVID it
[23:45.640 --> 23:49.240]  would people would say they were HIV positive that happened in Australia the
[23:49.240 --> 23:52.280]  US everywhere they said oh don't worry you don't really have HIV the vaccine
[23:52.280 --> 23:57.680]  just says you gives us a false positive because it sees the spike protein in the
[23:57.680 --> 24:03.000]  HIV test that's what it tests for so we knew they made this and now three years
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.160]  later three years and a month later so that's a 25 months later the Pentagon
[24:10.160 --> 24:13.360]  comes out the Justice Department comes out they say okay it was made no lab
[24:13.360 --> 24:17.800]  it's man-made well we knew it was man-made the issue is who made it and I'd
[24:17.800 --> 24:20.320]  love to blame the chai comms and they're terrible they're horrible and they're
[24:20.320 --> 24:23.200]  they're involved doing the whole police state roll out in the lockdowns and
[24:23.200 --> 24:26.800]  working with the whole chai comm element in our government but there's a rip
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.800]  between the chai comms and their buddies in the US government now so they're
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.160]  letting this come out and trying to blame the Chinese when the Chinese were
[24:33.160 --> 24:38.760]  involved but the main virus was made in 2014 you have a big scandal in 2015
[24:38.760 --> 24:43.680]  major news articles and was then shipped to China where they could illegally keep
[24:43.680 --> 24:47.520]  working on gain a function so in the last 48 hours Fauci and the rest of them
[24:47.520 --> 24:51.240]  gone from saying there was no gain a function I had the clips right here to
[24:51.240 --> 24:54.800]  Kirby at the Pentagon and others saying well we should be proud we're doing a
[24:54.800 --> 24:58.480]  function it's a good thing to keep you safe make weaponized viruses so if
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.000]  somebody else just makes this magic virus that would never have existed they
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.080]  have no idea how to make it that the US government made well we'll be able to
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.400]  counter it we'll be able to respond to it so they think you're so stupid that a
[25:10.400 --> 25:13.800]  they told you it wasn't a man made when they knew it was because they made it
[25:13.800 --> 25:16.960]  they had the receipts we have all the emails going back forth how they made it
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.320]  had the so-called vaccines ready before it even got rolled out but their whole
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.600]  plan to do this the world ID the castle society the vaccine passports everything
[25:24.600 --> 25:30.280]  and now they're saying oh no no no gain a function is good we always told you we
[25:30.280 --> 25:33.120]  were doing that and we have the clips do I even need to play the clips it's all
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.080]  over the news you want to hear Kirby do you want to you want to hear Fauci do you
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.760]  want to hear Biden do you want you want to hear this we're three years later
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.120]  they're like oh yeah and remember the cherry on top thousands of doctors and
[25:46.120 --> 25:51.840]  scientists and virologists including the discoverer of HIV got censored and banned
[25:51.840 --> 25:55.880]  off of Twitter and Facebook and places and Dr. Malone the discoverer and the
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.800]  developer of mRNA technology he got banned and showed it Dr. Michael Hedon and
[26:00.800 --> 26:04.800]  everybody else and still Dr. Yedon still banned former chief scientist at
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.200]  Pfizer who said all the same stuff two and a half years ago he was like five
[26:09.200 --> 26:16.880]  months after boil so at info wars we created the roadmap of reality total
[26:16.880 --> 26:20.840]  vindication with real hardcore research it's not about the credits about why
[26:20.840 --> 26:24.760]  the enemy hates us my info wars is critical and must stay on the air we
[26:24.760 --> 26:33.080]  were 100% on target where where it came from how they did it and then what the
[26:33.080 --> 26:38.040]  shot would do on average a Pfizer shot on average is about six seven times
[26:38.040 --> 26:40.760]  worse than catching one of the earlier variants of COVID because it gets
[26:40.760 --> 26:48.840]  lethal less bad as it mutates and that's just a guesstimation but if you look at
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.960]  the Moderna shot it's got to be like 15 20 times worse because it's for Pfizer
[26:53.960 --> 26:58.160]  shots the same thing it was developed by criminal elements run by the globalist
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.080]  the military industrial complex get the Pentagon that's all come out
[27:01.080 --> 27:05.480]  fenced through North Carolina Chapel Hill fenced into China so there be
[27:05.480 --> 27:08.960]  plausible deniability when Fauci and Bill Gates and the new world order
[27:08.960 --> 27:13.360]  released their virus to roll out the great reset the castle society and to
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.040]  take over our bodies that's what they've done and that's why exposing them
[27:17.040 --> 27:20.080]  bringing the justice isn't about vindictiveness it's not even about
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.400]  justice for the victims that's the big part of it but we've got to stop them
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.640]  from doing it again because now they're getting weaponized Marburg and weaponized
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.520]  mousepox and weaponized bird flu ready and our pre-programming the same way
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.120]  they did before COVID to launch the next phase of disease X disease Y disease Z so
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.840]  they're bringing in and with the UN and the World Treaty public being prepared
[27:41.840 --> 27:45.040]  to take over our medical systems of every major nation and to take over our
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.840]  bodies and Biden says he doesn't care if Congress doesn't ratify the UN Treaty he
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.000]  has said that they're going to follow the United Nations Treaty and who helped
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.040]  write the UN Treaty the CIA the Carnegie Endowment and Biden's new chief of
[27:58.040 --> 28:04.160]  staff that was the head of the COVID response now you get it their main
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.280]  attack is going to be using viruses very soon and if folks want to lay there and
[28:08.280 --> 28:11.120]  let them kill you or let them take over your body give you poison shots and
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.160]  main year kill you and if people want to be locked down again and if you want to
[28:14.160 --> 28:17.720]  be in a destroyed civilization then by all means folks you go ahead and you
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.840]  attack him for wars and you don't support us and I'm telling you all the
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.200]  corporate press people all the lawyers all the people that serve the system that
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.440]  think you're safe joining the new world order because you're such losers and
[28:29.440 --> 28:35.200]  such followers that you think by groveling under the dark wings of Satan
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.200]  you're going to be protected you're not you're destroying yourself fools you're
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.520]  destroying us with you we all need to go public and complete the chain reaction
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.680]  and say no more gain of function no more bio weapons and bring those that did
[28:47.680 --> 28:53.320]  this to justice before they do it again and kill all of us we'll be back
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.080]  ladies and gentlemen this book the Great Reset in the War of the World is a
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.200]  historic book that documents the globals in their own words plan for our

[32:54.640 --> 32:58.760]  signed the last books you get them right now
[32:58.760 --> 33:20.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of a new world order it's Alex Jones
[33:28.760 --> 33:53.360]  we are at the same scenes in El Salvador over the highest crime rate in
[33:53.360 --> 33:59.600]  Latin America hundreds of thousands of murders committed by MS-13 a paramilitary
[33:59.600 --> 34:03.840]  group is tattoos are their military uniform of how many murders and crimes
[34:03.840 --> 34:11.040]  and extortions and kidnappings they have committed and so they don't have the
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.200]  normal rights citizens into process when you're an outside trained in the U.S. by
[34:16.200 --> 34:21.200]  globalist crime syndicates operatives but it's a very dangerous slippery slope
[34:21.200 --> 34:24.120]  or that it could be used against the general public that's what the Patriot
[34:24.120 --> 34:27.720]  Act was they said oh this is just for radical Muslims who aren't citizens but
[34:27.720 --> 34:30.760]  it was written for citizens and out of the day we're told the main terror
[34:30.760 --> 34:35.560]  threat is the American people so we like to see crime dropping by 95% or more in
[34:35.560 --> 34:42.800]  El Salvador in one year since Naib Bukali got Bukali got elected he's big
[34:42.800 --> 34:47.120]  in Bitcoin he's an info wars listener he's a Tucker Carlson fan he tweets out
[34:47.120 --> 34:51.600]  our show he tweets out Harrison Smith and so it you know looks good and what
[34:51.600 --> 34:54.080]  are you supposed to do when MS-13 is running around killing thousands of
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.600]  people a month on average and totally lawless and as a paramilitary group well
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.680]  that's what you do is that's what the military is for when an army is attacking
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.120]  somebody but historically once the army defeats that problem they will then
[35:08.120 --> 35:13.960]  become that problem now is it a lesser two evils you know because even the new
[35:13.960 --> 35:20.200]  leader is good they the military can assassinate him a year from now five
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.240]  years from now and then they're in control and that's the problem with
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.200]  centralization even if it does good for a while it's like the ring of Mordor it
[35:30.200 --> 35:33.120]  ends up causing a big problem I want to go to Harrison Smith has been doing a
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.200]  great job covering this it's really been peeling the onion on it I want to get
[35:37.200 --> 35:43.920]  his tape his take on this but let's play a clip here from Harrison's show a few
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.200]  days ago that's gone viral that the president of El Salvador retweeted on
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.440]  his official Twitter that's clip 10 I believe here is Harrison Smith
[35:52.440 --> 36:00.040]  we have this homicide chart El Salvador homicide raid from 2010 to 2022 you see
[36:00.040 --> 36:09.480]  that the murders reached a zenith in 2015 with nearly 7,000 6,656 murders in
[36:09.480 --> 36:17.160]  a single year for a daily homicide rate of 18.2 or 103 homicides per 100,000
[36:17.160 --> 36:23.280]  inhabitants as of 2022 the total homicides have gone from nearly 7,000
[36:23.280 --> 36:30.840]  to under 600 the daily homicide rate has gone from 18.2 to 1.8 and the
[36:30.840 --> 36:36.680]  homicides per 100,000 inhabitants has gone from 103 to 10.3 literally one
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.720]  tenth of the former amount and you can see the precipitous drop beginning in
[36:41.720 --> 36:50.720]  2019 continuing through 2020 2021 and into 2022 where it has gone down to yeah
[36:50.720 --> 37:00.520]  600 total homicides or less this entire year 6,600 to under 600 all thanks to
[37:00.520 --> 37:06.040]  this guy of course what do you think the powers that be think about this guy how
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.080]  do you think this guy's portrayed in the mainstream media well all you have to do
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.720]  is search his name naib bukele and you can see and it's like even if you don't
[37:13.720 --> 37:16.640]  know anything about this guy search his name read the headlines come up to
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.720]  yourself whether he's a good guy or not because here's the headlines El Salvador's
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.000]  war on itself the siege of soya pango and we'll talk about what that is exactly
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.640]  bitfinex goes full fascist report on that Salvadorian gang crackdown details
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.280]  killings other abuses thousands of troops around city and gang crackdown state
[37:36.280 --> 37:39.760]  department Salvadorians tried to directly influence us election trolls
[37:39.760 --> 37:45.480]  propaganda and fear stoke bukele's media machine in El Salvador right they hate
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.840]  this guy they despise this guy because he's showing that there is another way
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.160]  he's showing that you can actually fix problems yeah he's going to war with the
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.280]  criminal elements in his country of course this is infuriating to the
[37:59.280 --> 38:05.280]  otherwise totally authoritarian mainstream media in this country rise of
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.520]  naib bukele El Salvador's authoritarian president from the New Yorker the
[38:09.520 --> 38:13.400]  budding strongman has ridden bitcoin sheen's and a repressive crackdown on
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.960]  gangs to become Latin America's most popular leader most popular leader in
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.480]  South America because he's cracking down the game like they're literally like how
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.880]  dare this guy a crackdown on gangs he's repressing gangs how dare he he's
[38:27.880 --> 38:34.240]  repressing the murderous cartels that have made life in El Salvador unbearable
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.760]  in the past how dare he do that so we're gonna go to a speech now that he gave to
[38:38.760 --> 38:42.160]  his troops right before they embarked on this mission
[38:42.160 --> 38:47.240]  he says for eight months we have been fighting the war against these gangs
[38:47.240 --> 38:55.320]  and thank God we're winning this is a very surprising victory that is nearly
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.960]  within our grasp let it be clear that the glory is for God and it's in God's
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.560]  glory and it is God's glory we humans are lucky
[39:05.560 --> 39:08.800]  the instruments of God
[39:08.800 --> 39:13.720]  bring peace, liberty and happiness
[39:13.720 --> 39:21.920]  Salvadorian people we are the instrument to heal this land each of you is an
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.360]  instrument of God to do this peace is not reached through agreements signed
[39:26.360 --> 39:31.920]  between corrupt sharing power amongst killers peace is built with hard work
[39:31.920 --> 39:38.600]  with sweat with effort and with the bravery that you and your brothers in
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.960]  the police have you must have something to be able to know that you are part of
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.280]  something greater than yourself and that it's worth risking your life for that
[39:47.280 --> 39:53.640]  purpose that is more important than yourself alone it's values values such
[39:53.640 --> 40:00.240]  as bravery such as courage such as strength discipline patriotism honor
[40:00.240 --> 40:07.960]  loyalty and love for your fellow man these are fundamental values for human
[40:07.960 --> 40:12.880]  society but these values are increasingly scarce in the world if you watch
[40:12.880 --> 40:17.360]  the international news you'll see how the most important values for human
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.280]  beings such as honor loyal bravery courage and love for your fellow man are
[40:22.280 --> 40:28.280]  precisely the values that we are losing with each passing day and that's why
[40:28.280 --> 40:33.680]  you can see how societies that seem to have won now are degrading as they are
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.760]  losing the values that made them great those values were probably not strong in
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.560]  this land and we're strong in other lands and that's why those lands grew and
[40:43.560 --> 40:49.720]  became great they're losing those values now and on the other hand in El Salvador
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.240]  those values are precisely that were precisely degraded in our country are
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.200]  now the most important ones just take a look at yourselves young men and women
[40:58.200 --> 41:03.440]  who embody all these values how could a nation not rise up with values such as
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.600]  these how could a nation not rise up when it puts God first and then puts in the
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.080]  hard work and effort with these kinds of values
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.520]  all right we're gonna go to Harrison really good speech we're gonna go to
[41:16.520 --> 41:22.880]  Harrison here in just a moment respond to this but I want to be clear who Kelly
[41:22.880 --> 41:26.280]  I guess got into three years ago but he didn't get control of the Congress and
[41:26.280 --> 41:30.240]  things behind him till about a year ago and in less than a year crime rates gone
[41:30.240 --> 41:35.240]  up down depending on the crime 90 to 95 percent and it's one of the safest
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.840]  countries now not just in Latin America but in this whole hemisphere and he did
[41:40.840 --> 41:43.880]  go on Tucker Carlson and say America's in the greatest country ever because of
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.960]  God and free market and hard work and good people now look at you you're being
[41:47.960 --> 41:51.120]  destroyed from within by the globalist by the new world order and you've got to
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.320]  get control you've got to stop the crime wave or you're gonna fall like Latin
[41:55.320 --> 41:58.520]  American countries that's why the globalists do this so I believe he's
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.320]  coming from a good place and now he's got a 95 percent approval rating but
[42:02.320 --> 42:05.720]  there's still some slippery slopes here and one of the globalists assassinating
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.720]  and then put in a new guy that controls this paramilitary force Harrison what's
[42:10.720 --> 42:15.880]  your take on this I definitely think that it's a possibility but you know you
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.240]  can tell from that speech that he seems to have a very good grounding and it's
[42:19.240 --> 42:24.480]  it's the values that he's promoting that you know give people the loyalty to him
[42:24.480 --> 42:28.240]  it seems like if somebody came in with a different set of values maybe they
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.000]  wouldn't have the same response from the troops that they're leading it really
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.680]  seems like the people of El Salvador are responding to this every call we've gotten
[42:35.680 --> 42:38.960]  on American Journal all of the comments I've seen on Twitter since that video's
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.920]  gotten 1.5 million views at this point they've all been totally positive so so
[42:43.920 --> 42:49.120]  far so good but I totally get your point for sure all right stay there I want to
[42:49.120 --> 42:53.200]  get into this more and why the globalists are so scared of the jelly on the
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.560]  other side info wars.com to Mars today spread the word about the live show

[47:17.120 --> 47:22.560]  Welcome back to this live Tuesday broadcast. Mike Adams out of his new amazing studios is
[47:22.560 --> 47:27.200]  gonna be hosting right outside Austin dialed into our system with several big
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.480]  guests joining him in the second third hour and again I'm getting back to
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.200]  Austin on Friday I want to thank Harrison Smith I'll ensure the rest of
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.920]  group doing a superlative job as well and all the great listeners and viewers
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.080]  that are tuned in so going back to Harrison Smith you're right I've seen
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.000]  nothing on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and in my email and on the
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.240]  street but but support for the president of El Salvador he is a listener he is an
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.000]  anti-new world order person he did an hour interview with Doug Carlson out of
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.960]  his Florida studios blew me away we're obviously wanting to get him on the show as
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.640]  soon as possible Latin America wants to be Christian they want to be free people
[48:06.640 --> 48:09.840]  think Latin America is a failure that was the IMF World Bank the last 60 years
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.120]  Latin America had two countries per capita richer than the US and now
[48:15.120 --> 48:22.640]  places were incredibly wealthy like Argentina and then of course Venezuela
[48:22.640 --> 48:29.520]  had a higher per capita income in the 50s 60s and 70s in the US we had the
[48:29.520 --> 48:35.720]  highest in the 50s and then again in the 90s but we haven't since because our
[48:35.720 --> 48:41.960]  jobs are set to China so Latin America could be a jewel and a destination and
[48:41.960 --> 48:45.000]  I'd love to have it where they're successful we're successful we live
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.680]  there they live here they can come here we can go there but we can't have them
[48:48.680 --> 48:52.240]  implode and then we bring all that here and we implode and that's the globalist
[48:52.240 --> 48:56.480]  model and when you have crime who out of control people don't go to dinner people
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.080]  don't get their hair done people don't get their car fixed shops close society's
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.560]  collapse and that's what the globalist want with viruses and crime and
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.520]  homeless people everywhere that's their plan and that's why law and order is so
[49:09.520 --> 49:14.640]  incredibly important and it's key to notice Harrison that look at the Washington
[49:14.640 --> 49:17.240]  Post articles the New York Times I know you've covered it's not watch the show
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.200]  they are literally saying we need to be arresting right-wingers and doing this
[49:21.200 --> 49:25.040]  for our thoughts we need to be censoring and arresting people I mean that's the
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.120]  next level but leaving ms-13 alone I don't know the crew was able to find
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.800]  the Nancy Pelosi clip saying that ms-13 are all God's children but it's on record
[49:33.800 --> 49:40.400]  guys did you find that I forgot to ask her in the break you did find it how
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.480]  long is the clip I want to play that
[49:43.480 --> 49:51.880]  okay the show is live added in post just for continuity once we post the band up
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.720]  video we don't have time to get to it it's on record she said it maybe do this
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.280]  maybe just just cut it down like 30 seconds I won't play too many club in
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.920]  Harrison I mean this really is the solution if it's only targeted in a
[50:04.920 --> 50:08.800]  paramilitary group that doesn't follow the law and are terrorists that's what
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.200]  you've got to do with people like this when they have tattoos of how many
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.320]  people they've killed and how proud they are that they're murderers and they're
[50:15.320 --> 50:18.760]  never going to be reformed and they're never going to stop I'm sorry this is
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.280]  war all you can do when it's an outside group destroying your country is kill
[50:22.280 --> 50:27.040]  the leadership and lock up their people till the cult is dead what is your view
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.800]  on that yeah absolutely and again we had a great caller yesterday on American
[50:31.800 --> 50:35.160]  Journal who had tons of experience he'd gone down to El Salvador talked to the
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.880]  people and I mean he was talking about just the transformation that's happened
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.880]  children running around in the street in neighborhoods where a couple years ago
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.920]  children would literally be killed for just being in the wrong neighborhood so
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.000]  it's it's a total transformation and I think it's beyond just the crime crack
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.400]  down in fact there was a guy on Twitter that was saying that he was blown away by
[50:55.400 --> 50:59.600]  El Salvador he reaches out to lots of countries and their leadership and the
[50:59.600 --> 51:03.360]  thing that he said about El Salvador was that it's all run now by family men in
[51:03.360 --> 51:08.360]  their prime age from 35 to 50 and he basically he talks about how you know
[51:08.360 --> 51:14.400]  he'd never experienced or never sensed such a caring from the from a national
[51:14.400 --> 51:17.480]  government he says I deal with people you know powerful people all the time
[51:17.480 --> 51:21.120]  none of them seem to really care these guys seem to really care and he ends by
[51:21.120 --> 51:24.800]  saying if you want to fix the world elect fathers of integrity in their prime
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.400]  age give them the latitude to make change and that's it they'll take
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.040]  responsibility for making the hard unpopular calls anybody can open the
[51:32.040 --> 51:35.240]  money printers and say comforting lies so it seems like this is a real
[51:35.240 --> 51:38.520]  transformation that's happening in El Salvador and again I've got nothing but
[51:38.520 --> 51:42.320]  positive response 1.5 million views on that video at this point it was also
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.080]  retweeted by General Flynn on his official Twitter and everybody that I've
[51:46.080 --> 51:49.320]  talked you from El Salvador's reached out just to say thank you for saying this
[51:49.320 --> 51:53.680]  because the mainstream media with Bukele has finally found an authoritarian that
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.440]  they don't like right there they're all for all the authoritarian measures in
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.000]  the Western world regardless of who they're targeting or what they're all
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  for they're all for ZZ ping they're all for the New World Order but but when
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.080]  somebody actually targets a criminal group that our criminal government's
[52:09.080 --> 52:11.960]  been working with they totally freak out you're absolutely right notice for
[52:11.960 --> 52:15.640]  targeting working-age men who are supposed to put themselves in the way
[52:15.640 --> 52:18.680]  of tyrants working-age men that are supposed to know that they're the heart
[52:18.680 --> 52:21.880]  of the country to protect the women and children that's why the globalist target
[52:21.880 --> 52:26.120]  masculinity and all the TV shows and all the movies not just here but all over
[52:26.120 --> 52:28.920]  the world that's what Hollywood does because they don't want men to know
[52:28.920 --> 52:33.760]  their mission to be hard-working guardians of the civilization and that's
[52:33.760 --> 52:37.720]  what scares them in just a few years what this guy has been able to do and
[52:37.720 --> 52:41.480]  let's not forget Max Kaiser when this guy first got elected like three years
[52:41.480 --> 52:46.280]  ago was going down there and they were setting up you know a Bitcoin energy
[52:46.280 --> 52:50.280]  thermal energy from volcanoes around Bitcoin mining he was saying you got to
[52:50.280 --> 52:54.760]  go interview this guy the future is El Salvador wait until you see what
[52:54.760 --> 52:58.640]  happens and I wasn't rolling my eyes at Kaiser but he is a trailblazer we need to
[52:58.640 --> 53:03.040]  get him back on the show but Kaiser is the guy's main financial advisor think
[53:03.040 --> 53:07.200]  how much that scares the new world order Harrison oh yeah absolutely and you know
[53:07.200 --> 53:10.920]  actually the clip that the re-retweeted out and that and that you just played
[53:10.920 --> 53:15.520]  that was from December early December of last year so you know now all this
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.520]  video of the prison is going viral and people are seeing which it is sort of
[53:19.520 --> 53:22.760]  horrifying right all of these guys with the tattoos the way they're caught I
[53:22.760 --> 53:26.760]  mean it's it's sort of stunning footage and so I wanted to go back and show that
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.000]  not only info wars is tomorrow's news today we've been covering this guy for a
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.920]  while even though a lot of people are just now finding out about him but sort
[53:32.920 --> 53:36.280]  of lay the groundwork and show that speech that shows this isn't like a
[53:36.280 --> 53:41.400]  punitive power grab it really seems to come from something positive and yeah
[53:41.400 --> 53:45.840]  it may be the the outcome of it it looks it looks crazy I mean we're seeing it on
[53:45.840 --> 53:49.960]  screen right now it's a crazy thing imagine that's only that's only two
[53:49.960 --> 53:53.120]  thousand of the 40,000 right they've arrested and remember he got in what
[53:53.120 --> 53:56.680]  three years ago and I said he really got in a year ago they saw real success
[53:56.680 --> 54:01.280]  the first two years so then the Congress finally got elected that was for him and
[54:01.280 --> 54:05.360]  now that he's actually got a unified government 95% approval rating look it
[54:05.360 --> 54:10.360]  up folks and the crime rates down over 90% the economy is coming back it's so
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.200]  good and that's scaring the New World Order folks because literally MS-13 was
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.880]  trained and created in US prisons yes it's a El Salvador gang but it was
[54:20.880 --> 54:25.320]  created and what formed in Los Angeles well 30 something years ago it's a
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.880]  fascinating history and how vicious they are and how the media covers up the
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.320]  Satanism and the human sacrifices that have a business owner in New York City
[54:35.320 --> 54:42.200]  or Los Angeles, California or San Antonio, Texas or in El Salvador doesn't pay
[54:42.200 --> 54:45.040]  them the money doesn't let them put their 14-year-old daughter into
[54:45.040 --> 54:51.200]  prostitution they come and butcher the family and sacrifice them and to Satan
[54:51.200 --> 54:59.120]  MS-13 literally is a Satanic cult think about that Harrison oh no yeah a hundred
[54:59.120 --> 55:02.960]  percent and that's the thing that you Kelly said about the video where you
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.760]  see the 2000 people you know it might seem like a lot of people in prison but
[55:06.760 --> 55:12.680]  behind every one of those is dozens you know maybe hundreds of these horrific
[55:12.680 --> 55:15.280]  crimes horrendous crimes I don't like getting into the details but you're
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.640]  exactly right I mean they use brutality as a psychological lever to get people
[55:19.640 --> 55:22.360]  to submit to them they're they're terrorists they're Satanists they're
[55:22.360 --> 55:28.920]  evil and El Salvador like the police in the US had been overrun and defeated and
[55:28.920 --> 55:34.440]  so the country had collapsed they finally had to get ramped up tough and the go
[55:34.440 --> 55:38.080]  in against them and they've beaten them decisively and quickly the people say
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.000]  well this looks dangerous well these people of many thousands they report a
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.200]  police have been killed the last three years bringing things to this point in
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.280]  military so they're in a war they're committed they're winning prosperity came
[55:49.280 --> 55:53.280]  back and as long as it doesn't get used against political opponents or other
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.880]  groups that are citizens this is the response we should be seeing to the drug
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.840]  cartels and on our border that are doing many of the same things and working
[56:01.840 --> 56:07.480]  with MS-13 it's time to start arresting them and trying them with speedy trials
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.320]  and to start hanging their asses and to start hanging the leftist that launder
[56:12.320 --> 56:16.280]  the money and help run this because that's why Nancy Pelosi is allied with
[56:16.280 --> 56:20.400]  this and and they know that if they have a criminal gang that can commit we I've
[56:20.400 --> 56:24.720]  been told this by high-level people in army special operations you name it five
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.600]  six years ago and then later it came out in the news that the globalists are
[56:28.600 --> 56:33.120]  using MS-13 to commit assassinations the MS-13 15 year old that does the
[56:33.120 --> 56:36.520]  assassination doesn't even know who gave him the order it's total plausible
[56:36.520 --> 56:40.880]  deniability just like the CIA used mafia to help kill JFK was one of the three
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.360]  teams they had there plausible in ability the old Italian mafia which is
[56:44.360 --> 56:49.360]  nothing compared to these people and so this is what they're doing so MS-13 is
[56:49.360 --> 56:55.120]  an arm of the deep state and Bukele understands that absolutely and you
[56:55.120 --> 56:58.960]  know we've heard Kamala Harris say that the the correct response to the crisis
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.920]  of the southern border is to basically send money in unlimited amounts to you
[57:03.920 --> 57:07.360]  know the country south of the border well if you want to stop the flood of
[57:07.360 --> 57:12.280]  people from the south into America maybe more Bukele's need to you know take
[57:12.280 --> 57:15.720]  the reins in in Latin America and South America and stop the violence that's
[57:15.720 --> 57:18.480]  driving people out of those countries and towards America well that's right

[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.840]  hi ladies and gentlemen final segment with the great Harris and Smith when I
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.080]  said the great Harris and Smith he's always been a smart guy worked for us
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.840]  many years as a reporter and a host but just the show gets better and better and
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.480]  the production crew and that produces a show with the guests and all the
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:33.040]  information is just over the top grade 8 a.m. central every morning info wars.com
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.000]  for its last show in Bandai video Harrison there's another wrinkle to this or
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.360]  another layer to this onion and that's Biden comes out two years ago and says
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.520]  the number one threat in America and the official terrorism plan of the
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.120]  executive branch is not the Russians not the chai comms not MS-13 not the
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.920]  Mexican mafia no it is the American people and white supremacy if you
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.640]  actually go to the real crime statistics basically doesn't even exist it's like
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.200]  super rare okay I mean maybe white supremacy like ten people here or
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.440]  something but they hyped the living hell out of it and then say anyone that is
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.560]  against lockdowns or open borders or forced injections or talks about
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.120]  election fraud is a terrorist and needs to be shut down needs to be silenced and
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.760]  then we have an article in four words calm about the whole rig trial of show
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.960]  bigs and the proud boys who when the police opened the barricades they went
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.560]  in they even try to stop some people being violent here they are in solitary
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  confinement for two plus years are now over two years and they're being well
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.160]  eroded by a corrupt you know judiciary that we know DC is famous for and so
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.280]  there's the left wanting to keep people when the left burns down buildings
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.920]  Kamala Harris bells them out of jail when the left shoots cops Kamala Harris
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.320]  bells them out of jail when she was a vice presidential candidate that's all
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.880]  sweet and wonderful hundreds of millions of dollars you know raised for the
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:55.760]  summer of rage in 2000 but oh no don't lock up an MS-13 guy that has been
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.720]  arrested more than a dozen times and spent years in prison and committed
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.960]  multiple murders he admits to and has all over his tattoos saying he did it and
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.520]  then they know them as 13 of you that that's approved by by the head guys when
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.640]  you get those tattoos that's your stripes your sergeant stripes that's
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.120]  that's a record that's your rap sheet that they tattoo on their bodies oh these
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:22.040]  portable God's children let's be nice to them but the American people oh they all
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.320]  need to be locked up for January 6 it's the biggest terror threat ever and then
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  all Trump supporters are all populous you're all terrorists too because of
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.400]  this it's so transparent Harrison yeah and not only is major media celebrating
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.040]  what's going on in this country they're demanding more of it they want more
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.720]  Trump supporters to be thrown into prison and it almost goes even beyond
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.280]  that we showed a video yesterday sort of in conjunction with talking about El
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.120]  Salvador which was a safe way in California somewhere at a grocery store
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.520]  that had you know bars on the window and you can't just check out and leave you
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.640]  have to get you know there's a gate there and you have to show your receipt for
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.440]  the gate to go up so you know essentially we're dealing with the
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.800]  situation where we can either put the criminals in prison or we're all gonna
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.240]  live in prison right either we put the bad people away and separate them from
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.040]  society or the whole society has to have bars around it and has to become a
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.160]  you just hit the key you just hit the key in a speech I forget where you can
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.560]  pull it up online a bison hour he was president in 1960 he said I can give you
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.480]  total safety but I got to lock you in a tiny you know 200 square foot cell and
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.200]  and so now the new smart cities are 200 foot coffin apartments and you've all
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.360]  got to be scanned and tracked everywhere you go but the illegal aliens aren't
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.640]  scanned the criminals aren't scanned so they use that outside threat to get us
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.160]  to then be herded into quote safety zones where the good people are in
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.880]  prisons and the globalist criminals and the low-level criminals work together to
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.520]  keep us under their control you just nailed it well and to go back to your
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.560]  point about the tattoos to expand on that a little bit because I saw I think
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.360]  it was CNN or some mainstream media you know corporation said these alleged
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.720]  gang members well in El Salvador if you have a gang tattoo and you're not in the
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.320]  gang they will kill you for that so it to have these tattoos is proof that they
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.440]  were part of the gang so they're not locking up just random people with
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.440]  tattoos they're locking up criminals they all went through a judicial process
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.240]  according and I guess and we can we can have some skepticism about that because
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.760]  we do want to be on our toes for authoritarianism but as far as I can
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.320]  tell it all seems totally legit the criminals that are in jail now deserve
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.480]  to be there for the horrific or horrific crimes that they've exactly and on the
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.040]  subject of tattoos you know all those different Aboriginal groups to tattoos
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.720]  when they do rights of passage or they get married or they kill their first
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.000]  warrior or whatever and it's the same thing nobody until the 70s had tattoos
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.240]  it wasn't in a motorcycle gang or wasn't a special military unit or hadn't done
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.560]  something special you didn't get those unless you'd been part of that and if
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.840]  you go back hundreds of years ago sailors would get a special tattoo when
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.000]  they crossed the equator for the first time or when they circumnavigated the
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.720]  world you get another tattoo these are a rap sheet of your good or bad things
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.480]  you've done you're a percent right

[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.520]  happening in El Salvador all the other issues that I did not plug one of the
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.040]  biggest enemies of info wars is actually Alex Jones because when I plug at least
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.960]  once an hour we can find the operation when I forget and don't do it we can't

[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.040]  info wars for the word about info wars and by product info wars I can tell you
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.560]  how many outside groups go and test the products we sell like Mike Adams is
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.280]  famous for his big testing lab we test all sorts of products also supplements
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.320]  and he I didn't know this happened with a family member he was given a family
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.160]  member that had some neurological issues CBD oil because all the studies it's
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.840]  really good CBD oil it really helps all sorts of neurological things Parkinson's
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:30.280]  epilepsy narcolepsy list goes on and on joint pain you name it and he went and
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.000]  tested ours and his testing lab checked it as degrees and this said this is the
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.320]  highest quality we've seen we've seen another brand this good but this is this
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.560]  is the very top there should be a hundred and sixty dollars a bottle or the
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.160]  one thousand milligram that he puts out and that's true they recommended we sell
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.160]  it for 150 I went to these folks that own a big company that's one of the top
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.800]  distributors the country of wide spectrum CBD and they said we recommend 150
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:08:00.000]  retail then discount it 100 bucks well I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna do 200
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.360]  percent markup so at sixty seven dollars there's a hundred percent markup to
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.120]  fund ourselves you're getting the best CBD thousand milligram 25 milligram and
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.400]  10 milligrams and the one you want at over 50% what you're gonna get this
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:23.440]  anywhere else that's what the discounted it's well I guess it's about 35% after the
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.840]  discount so if you look at retail it's like a 70% discount the point is is
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.960]  that point blanks everybody knows CBD is great doctors are prescribing and
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.560]  everywhere you know it's not prescription this is the best you're gonna get
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:40.000]  info or store.com and it funds the info or a total 360 win only way we fail is we
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.800]  don't take action and I know less than 1% of the viewers who I love and I think
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.680]  I'm not bitching by the product if just one more percent would just do it we
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.560]  wouldn't just be good we could expand so we're not going anywhere those of you
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.280]  that have about the products you know who you are those who haven't hey keep

[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.640]  got incredible lineup right here straight ahead Jeffrey Prather coming up at
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.480]  the bottom of this hour talk about fifth-generation warfare sabotage of
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.920]  infrastructure and so much more we're also going to be joined at the bottom of
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.640]  this hour I'm sorry yeah Jeffrey Prather's coming on here shortly and
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.040]  then at the bottom of this hour Eric Coppolino joining us to talk about the
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.720]  East Palestine a train wreck chemical bomb we've got new information there
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.920]  that's come to light about the EPA's actions and also the diversion of the
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.660]  toxic chemicals they were supposed to be sent to Texas reportedly 500,000
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.520]  gallons were already received in Texas some of that has been diverted to
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.960]  Indiana now and there are lawsuits flying all over the place and a lot of
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.460]  people experiencing new injuries now when they return to East Palestine so
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:54.560]  again Eric Coppolino will be joining us for a full hour to cover that and then
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:59.840]  we have Brian Festa attorney for We the Patriots USA is going to be joining us
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.360]  at the bottom of the third hour here on the Alex Jones show about a lawsuit that
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.680]  is being filed with lots of victims with exposure to these toxic chemicals and
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.520]  seemingly the inability of Norfolk Southern to move quickly in evacuating
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.920]  people who were exposed and many other issues coming up in that lawsuit so all
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.440]  of that is coming straight ahead but our first guest coming up here shortly will
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:35.600]  be Jeffrey Prather and he is of course a former DEA former top operations guy
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:41.640]  certain kinds of I don't know how much we can say about Jeffrey Prather but he's
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.680]  he's been in the thick of it and he's been blown the whistle and he's working
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.160]  to help America save itself from the takedown that is taking place right now
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:57.040]  now one thing I want to bring your attention to folks is a story on from
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.840]  Wall Street Journal SOS for the US Electric Grid Wall Street Journal
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.960]  article showed up yesterday and it's authored by the editorial board of the
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.840]  Wall Street Journal and this story confirms exactly what Jones and others
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.240]  have been warning about for a number of years it confirms that there is a
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.560]  deliberate takedown of the power grid affecting the United States but especially
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.320]  in this case the eastern states that as coal-fired power plants are taken off
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.200]  line there are no sufficient replacements there's no real effort to
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.760]  bring back any kind of capacity that could keep the system running for people
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.040]  and so unless something changes we're looking at rolling blackouts across
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:50.120]  eastern states that's 13 states affecting 65 million people the Wall Street
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:56.160]  Journal now confirming this again in for wars tomorrow's news today because Alex
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.360]  and others have been talking about this for many years and now here it is
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:05.000]  confirmed by the Wall Street Journal the point is the green cult takedown of the
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.760]  US power grid is attempting to thrust the United States into a third world
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.480]  existence where you will have no reliable power grid which means you'll
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:21.200]  have no reliable industry no employers that can stay online and you won't even
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.280]  be able to have power in your own home reliably and guess what if you went out
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.880]  and bought an electric vehicle good luck charging it you won't be able to charge
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.640]  it when the power grid is down obviously and that's all by design so just one
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.520]  more example of how we nailed it here you all the supporters of infowars you
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.400]  nailed it and by the way thank you for your support Alex mentioned the CBD oil
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.680]  at the beginning of the segment I have to concur the CBD product from infowars
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.000]  store.com is truly outstanding I've got one of my family members on it and it's
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.600]  working wonders it is highly potent it's very effective we've tested it in the
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:06.200]  laboratory and it's an extraordinary value infowars store.com check out the
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.600]  CBD oil I think that's the 1000 milligram bottle that I'm referring to there but
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.960]  there's some other formats that are available as well now what we're going
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.760]  to be talking about here coming up shortly again Jeffrey Prather will be
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.280]  joining us we're going to be talking about what I call molecular terrorism
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.640]  which is the new form of asymmetrical terrorism that unleashes cheap toxic
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.840]  chemicals to cause massive economic and medical damage across the population at
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.480]  large also we're seeing people getting sick as they return to East Palestine
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.680]  even when they felt better after leaving so they were there during the toxic
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.840]  event they got sick they got weird rashes and symptoms and bronchial effects and
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.120]  difficulty breathing some people were coughing up blood animals were dying
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.600]  many of these people evacuated and then they got better and then as they return
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.960]  to the town their symptoms are coming back why because there's something still
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.960]  in the air folks because the chemicals are still there and this is something
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.720]  that's not being talked about by the EPA nor by Ohio State officials but we're
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.280]  going to talk about it here on this show we're also going to cover how the EPA
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.400]  can actually fake the tests for dioxins and other chemicals how do we know the
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:29.000]  EPA even wants to conduct an accurate test my guess is they don't actually my
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.320]  guess is the EPA has already conducted dioxin testing and they're sitting on
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:39.160]  the results but they just don't want you to know what those results really are so

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:08.440]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:39.520]  last year we published a report entitled evidence that us government
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:45.040]  targeted red states with deadly batch of vaccine a story that most outlets
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.800]  ignored private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:56.640]  only certain lots are included the very same lots found to be highly toxic in
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.200]  part of Cooper's database this mode of deployment allows governments the
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:07.100]  ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations such as red
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:13.600]  states analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.680]  us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:23.760]  states second smartest guy in the world on substack also reported on it and has
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:29.120]  recently published an update writing that now we have a more robust and far
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.480]  more damning view of this carefully distributed depopulation scheme back in
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:42.240]  Ohio of 2021 the expose publishes a report on data found in the USA's
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:49.760]  there's vaccine adverse event reporting system which reveals that 100% of
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:56.960]  COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been caused by just 5% of the batches batches that
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.640]  can be identified and these deadly batches were not distributed evenly the
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.040]  top eight states with the highest vaccination death rate Kentucky Arkansas
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:15.440]  West Virginia Montana Alaska North Dakota Wyoming and Tennessee are all
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:23.320]  red states 19 of the top 24 on the list are red states and California has been
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.600]  the least affected by the deadly lots of COVID vaccine the numbers show that
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:36.360]  Kentucky has a 1900% worse vaccination death rate than California suggesting
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:42.000]  that Kentucky received 20 times the amount of deadly batches than California
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.680]  did Florida number 20 on the list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.160]  received three times the amount of deadly batches than California with its
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:23:00.360]  vaccination death rate at 200% higher than California's the author points out
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:06.600]  that these deadly batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:13.360]  slow kill lots as we are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time and
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:20.280]  the evidence shows that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots this
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:26.440]  would go along with the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan which seeks to move the
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.360]  entire population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.920]  the name of climate change they have less than seven years to accomplish this
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:44.200]  and they are deadly serious about it the US government is in lockstep with the
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.600]  United Nations and they will resort to murder and
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.720]  democide to accomplish their goals of total control many are suggesting that
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.960]  this is what is happening in East Palestine Ohio right now the people of
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.480]  America are under attack by their own government who is never going to quit
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.400]  until they accomplish their goals or unless they are stopped reporting for
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:34.520]  infowars this is Greg Reese
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:54.600]  stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.840]  at least in government but there's a new avenue for those who would like to
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:04.240]  censor what you say and think and that's corporations the left have wised up to
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.880]  this if you want to stop someone from telling the truth use companies to do
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.240]  it the social media giants and they are for many on the left the view seems to
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.200]  become that if you can't beat them prevents them from speaking so far the
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.160]  most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.360]  radio show host Alex Jones there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.040]  and multinational corporations in big tech to silence conservative and
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.800]  nationalist and populist voices there's also guys on CNN that spend their whole
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.520]  day calling Facebook and saying can you ban this person he may be America's
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:42.160]  best-known conspiracy theorist but this week Alex Jones's content will be a
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.120]  little harder to find shame on the mainstream corporate media for not
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.840]  defending the First Amendment but instead a tap dogging calling for federal
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.480]  regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech people know

[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.480]  little busy so I didn't sign the books we didn't have them for sale but now I
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:57.200]  signed the last books you get them right now
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.240]  thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.520]  applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the army there is a
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:14.520]  bulletin from CBS News. President Kennedy has been shot. This is a different kind of war.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.240]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and computer birds. The CIA
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.240]  that manipulates the news in the United States. They took the babies out of the
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.120]  incubators and left the children to die on a cold spot. It was almost as if it were a plant in the
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:37.040]  bush. We need to go into the capital. You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.600]  They are nothing but distract. You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:47.680]  silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is push to reset but soon as we
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:33:03.800]  start exposing the great preset. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:22.400]  World Order. It's Alex Jones. From the front lines of the information war it's
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:31.360]  Alex Jones and now your host Mike Adams. Welcome back folks. Mike Adams here on the
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.680]  Alex Jones show and we are going to be joined by Jeffrey Praetha here in just a minute to talk
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.240]  about the sabotage of the infrastructure. What's happening in America. Fifth
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.960]  generational warfare and a little bit more. Just want to apologize. We had a couple of
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.920]  video synchronization glitches there. Got it all worked out. Happy to be joining you today.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.080]  And remember we've got Eric Coppolino coming up too in the next segment to talk about
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.600]  dioxins and other toxic chemicals that are falling out from the whole train wreck,
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.840]  literal train wreck in Ohio. So we're joined by Jeffrey Praetha right now. Mr. Praetha,
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:11.760]  sir, welcome to the show. It's great to have you on. Good to be with you again, Mike. It's
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.520]  always good to have you on. I'm glad you're doing well and you do excellent analysis on
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.240]  so many subjects. But I wanted to ask you starting with what is your take on the food
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.480]  infrastructure takedowns. Now the energy infrastructure takedowns and we even have
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:30.600]  the Wall Street Journal openly admitting that, you know, putting out an SOS now saying that 13
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:35.640]  eastern states are not going to have a reliable power grid because they're not replacing, you
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.000]  know, the fossil fuel systems that are taken offline. What do you make of all of this,
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.720]  Jeffrey? Give us your best analysis. Well, the covert war by our government against us and
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:54.840]  unfortunately, the military that I served in is comprehensive and encompassing very similar to
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:03.000]  the overt proxy war in Ukraine. But in East Palestine, Ohio, it is particularly bad. Team
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.920]  America, Ohio was there on the ground. My friend Lieutenant Colonel Doc Pete Chambers was there
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:18.520]  as well. And it looks like that the vinyl core is not even the worst element there. It's also
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:28.200]  17 injection wells that are getting radioactive heavy water from Kentucky, West Virginia,
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:34.840]  and Pennsylvania injected in the air and coming back up to the surface. And that's part of the
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:41.160]  destruction on top of the food processing plants and the chickens being destroyed. And this is a
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:50.760]  complete resource siege happening globally, but simultaneously happening in America while it is
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:56.760]  happening in Ukraine as well. So it's much worse than people have thought.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:03.960]  Jeffrey, don't don't you wonder why? I mean, surely the people carrying this out realize
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.640]  that the American people will notice when they have rolling blackouts, right? They will notice
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.080]  as more and more of food scarcity emerges in the grocery stores over the next year or so.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.560]  How do you think that the people in charge of this obvious sabotage of these takedowns,
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.360]  how do they think they're going to get away with it? Any ideas?
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.640]  Well, they don't study history. They don't study scripture. They haven't looked at Sri Lanka.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.040]  There's an echo chamber. They think they're really smart, but they're just really ambitious.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.800]  They just talk at their Davos conferences. And they're not aware of really what's happening at
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:49.480]  all. The perfect example of that is Ukraine, where Bakhmut is about to fold. Wagner group has encircled
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:57.400]  that even in the midst of Rasput Siza, which is broken roads. And once that happens, that they will
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.520]  be able to move across there. And they're not noticing that the American people has turned
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.520]  against them completely. And no one will be able to carry this out. But things are still too easy
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:15.000]  in America. The American population is still, unfortunately, very soft, very drugged up,
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.880]  fattened up, dumbed down. And things just aren't that bad yet.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:26.760]  Okay. All right. Well, that's kind of scary. What's your take on the situation with Russia and Ukraine,
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:31.720]  also specifically about Nord Stream, because it seems like the Nord Stream pipeline destruction
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:36.840]  fits that pattern of infrastructure destruction that we are witnessing and suffering under in the
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:42.760]  United States. But in that case, Nord Stream, the taking out of that pipeline really harmed Germany.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.960]  It hurt Russia a little bit, but it really hurt Western Europe in terms of their industry shutdowns
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.960]  and their energy problems. What's your take on that whole situation?
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:01.000]  Well, I assessed 100 percent certainty that we sabotaged that. It's since come out through Seymour
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.560]  Hirsch. I actually know some of the Special Warfare Navy hardhat divers that have placed all of that,
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.920]  but that fits perfectly with what's happening with the food processing, with what's happening in
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:20.840]  Palestine, all of that resource. And what they are trying to do is support the global cabal,
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:27.320]  the World Economic Forum, but also their Chinese masters as well. What's happening in Ukraine
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.920]  is that Putin and Russia, who are our allies, not our friends, but the enemy of our enemy,
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.440]  which is our own government is our ally, is showing that third generation kinetic warfare defeats
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:44.120]  fifth generation information influence operations warfare, and that is about to collapse. So that's
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:51.960]  another huge inflection point. All that masquerade of us supporting Ukrainian Nazis is about to
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:58.120]  fall apart. And that's a critical point. Yeah, a critical point. You just made there, Jeffrey.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:04.760]  So you're saying that third generation kinetic warfare, you're saying artillery beats BS press
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.920]  releases from the NATO countries, basically, right? So Russia is actually launching artillery,
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.480]  while the West is launching press releases and just putting out propaganda that says Russia's
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:20.200]  losing and being destroyed and so on. But Russia is actually, you know, they've got the industry,
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.760]  they've got the munitions, regardless of what people watching, whether you are pro Russia or
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:30.280]  anti Russia, you can't argue with the fact that Russia has more military industry and domestic
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:36.040]  industry than does the United States or any European country at this point. So I don't know.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:42.120]  Are the Western leaders like Victoria Newland, are they so delusional that they think they can
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:50.760]  win this war with press releases and just fake news? I mean, what are they thinking, Jeffrey?
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.880]  Well, if you go back to the end of World War Two, when the Office of Strategic Services goes away,
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.320]  CIA comes out, Special Forces comes out, and they start, they decide that they have to destroy
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:07.560]  morals. And in Russia, it's the Orthodox Russian church is Christianity is the connection to God.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:14.120]  So that has been targeted. That's why Russia Communist China has never really been there is
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:19.000]  a Christian church there, but it's never really been a real force. So the focus of that for
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.800]  government to be God, for these now oligarchs in America, not Ukraine and Russia, oligarchs in
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  America, and the weft to control everything, that's why they have to target and destroy Russia. And
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:38.280]  that's the obsession that they have with that. But it's not even the third generation war of World
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.720]  War Two, because they're doing standoff drone attacks. And they're basically grinding down
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:50.120]  Ukrainian forces. So the military industrial complex is getting to supply more weaponry.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.960]  And that's fine. But it's really also the biological intelligence complex of the 46
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:03.720]  bio labs there that is being defeated there. So the defeat in Ukraine is a big wake up call to
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:11.000]  Weft that this doesn't work. But unfortunately, no one is really aware of the sabotaging of the water
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.280]  and the land. They are aware of the food processing and chicken and egg kills in America, but not
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:22.520]  of the sabotaging of the land that's happening as well. But it all fits the same pattern.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:29.640]  Okay, Jeffrey, I want to give out your website is Jeffrey praetor.com. And that's J E F F R E Y
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:34.600]  Jeffrey praetor.com. Tell us about your site and your show and anything else you want to
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:44.040]  plug here as a wrap up segment with you. Well, I'm a retired SOCOM soldier x D I a defense
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:50.200]  intelligence agency intelligence officer. And I was a drug enforcement administration special
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.800]  agent for 19 years until I blew the whistle that the DEA had a deal with the similar cartel
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.720]  to run drugs north in exchange for fast and furious guns going south. And since then,
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:08.280]  I've been trying to show the public what our government has turned against us. And it's
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:13.960]  sad to see that. But that's what I'm doing and supporting your efforts as well, your great
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:21.480]  efforts to get out the truth as America wakes up and we build the resistance legally, morally,

[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:39.080]  sponsors of info wars and if you go to info wars phone dot com you're going to see these
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.880]  products that i travel with that are absolutely critical we've got the in marsat satellite
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:49.960]  phone there we've got the iridium sat phone in the middle and then the bivvy stick which is the
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:55.240]  small item it's the size of kind of an ice cream sandwich there and that gives you two-way satellite
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:01.000]  text messaging for when the power grid is down or the cell towers don't work and then this guy right
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.680]  here is a bandwidth device so it gives you actual satellite bandwidth you can use practically anywhere
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:12.840]  on the planet and it it creates a wi-fi spot so you can have your laptop and phone uh join up
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:18.760]  with that connect to the wi-fi and have bandwidth you can get all of this at info wars phone dot
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:25.160]  com and again i do not travel without these because i don't trust the reliability of the power grid
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.960]  nor the cell towers and we've had all kinds of situations and storms and fires and hurricanes
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.160]  and you know whatever freezing weather that shut down the power grid in texas you know a year ago
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:40.520]  a couple years ago so uh check check this out support the broadcast get yourself some backup
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:46.200]  comms and travel with this so you can always keep in touch with your loved ones again info wars
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:52.760]  phone dot com now we're going to be joined by eric copolino here from planet waves dot fm and eric
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:49:00.120]  copolino is an expert in dioxins he's been covering it for actual decades and he joins us now to cover
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:06.360]  the latest developments in east palestine in the train wreck chemical bomb i guess situation you
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:12.360]  could call it uh mr copolino thank you for joining me today it's great to have you back on mic thank
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:18.120]  you very much for having me uh you you're coming in loud and clear that's awesome eric uh so give
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.720]  us your latest assessment we've had a lot happen since you and i talked i guess a week ago or so
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:27.400]  what what are the latest updates that you think are relevant for the audience to know
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:34.520]  well there are now repeated calls for dioxin testing in the east palestine area and and the
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:40.360]  surroundings but what i have been hearing talking to residents who are calling me is that people
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:47.240]  are sick um i i spoke to one woman yesterday where she and her children uh were down with
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:51.880]  with what they were describing as flu like symptoms her brother a few miles away was
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.880]  also down with the same thing and both of his kids were down and then she said that in a nearby
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:05.160]  school district a quarter of the kids are are out and they're calling it a stomach bug so we're now
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:12.520]  starting to see the influence i believe there was also a a piece on rents describing uh i'm not i'm
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:19.160]  pretty sure that it was rents describing a wide diversity of illnesses uh associated with you
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.960]  know timed with this incident people previously healthy and i've been talking to farms in pennsylvania
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:31.880]  these kind of grass fed and um amish type farms were uh they they are worried because they've
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:37.800]  taken care of the land for years and now uh they are dealing with this pestilence yeah we saw there
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.920]  was even a story in bright part kind of buried within the story it it said that people who had
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.640]  left east palestine they'd evacuated and then they felt better the minute they came back to the town
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:54.280]  they started to re-experience the same symptoms again which would seemingly indicate that there
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.200]  are still toxins floating around or somehow people are still being exposed these toxins but
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:04.680]  you and i know eric that these dioxins which are created by the burning of chlorinated compounds
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:12.440]  such as vinyl chloride and pvc these dioxins are toxic at insanely low concentrations we're talking
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:19.800]  you know uh parts per quadrillion or or femtograms or picograms it's i mean it doesn't take much at
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.960]  all in order to make people sick so maybe that's an explanation of what's going on what do you think
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.600]  well it doesn't take much dioxin to make people sick but we have to also remember
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:37.400]  the uh the i saw a photograph in the in the in the epa complaint uh with the with a aerial photo
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:43.960]  of all the wreck all the wrecked tanker cars and uh they're there and with a little line pointing
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:50.120]  to each car saying what was in the car and so there were probably 15 different substances
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.440]  released including things that are not considered hazardous hazardous material but certainly
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:02.440]  become hazardous in in the middle of a situation like this and and there are synergistic effects
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:07.800]  of these chemicals it's one thing to be exposed to one chemical and it's another thing to be exposed
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:14.920]  to 10 chemicals partially burned and then blended together in the middle of this partial burn it's
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:20.120]  absolute insanity yeah that that is insanity i was able to get my hands on this book right here
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:26.440]  the dioxin war uh robert allen and this was a little bit difficult to find but it says uh truth
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:33.480]  and lies about a perfect poison and and you know eric that this is called the perfect poison because
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:39.480]  it's almost impossible to destroy once it's created it's very difficult you know to dismantle this
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:46.920]  and it it it persists for you know what centuries or even possibly millennia so tell us what you
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:53.080]  know about billions of years millions of billions of years yeah well yeah we're talking about it'll
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:59.080]  still be here when the sun when the sun turns into a red giant so when they inject this underground
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:04.440]  as they were already doing in texas and now apparently in indiana because i guess the epa has
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:10.440]  diverted some of this toxic uh firefighting water waste to indiana and they're injecting it in
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:16.040]  in these deep wells i mean that doesn't make it go away it just puts it underneath all our aquifers
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:22.120]  and underneath our farms and you know things can move around obviously uh they do there's no aquifer
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:28.040]  that's contained this will contaminate the groundwater this is that that is that is equally
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:33.000]  insane as burning it but putting it in a pit and burning it this stuff has got to be stored above
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.840]  the ground and contain tanks till they figure out what to do with it i have never in my entire life
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:45.480]  heard of disposing of dioxin waste or any chemical waste by injecting it into a well
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:50.200]  this is the kind of thing that would result in an enforcement action if you did this if you
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:56.920]  poured it down your toilet you would find yourself in handcuffs well well yeah but i mean just to be
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:02.760]  clear that they are claiming and there's a company in texas called texas molecular and they are
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:08.120]  licensed to handle hazardous waste apparently i just learned about them and apparently they can
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:14.200]  handle vinyl chloride or they can you know drop it down a deep hole but they say oh it's it's so deep
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:19.240]  that this won't come to the surface of the earth it's so deep that it won't interact with the
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:24.520]  aquifers and so on this is what they say it's so deep you can forget about it i'm not sure i'm
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:29.720]  buying that what do you think i wouldn't i wouldn't buy it for a penny it is is an absolute rank in
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.000]  sanity this is not how dioxin waste is supposed to be disposed of it's supposed to be put in an
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:43.320]  incinerator and burned to what's called six nines 99.999 percent disposal with consumption by by
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:49.480]  the incinerator which is itself alive because you can't ever get it that clean because of the
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:55.960]  cooled cool down phases and warm up warm up phases of the incineration process but i have never in
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:04.440]  my entire life anywhere once read or heard of throwing it down a well i'm absolutely astonished
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.720]  by this all right here's i'm holding up a diagram of the molecule and maybe the control guys can
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:17.880]  actually find a better molecule there for dioxin this is 2378 tcd yeah there it is so i can tell
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.520]  you though the actual solution for sure i know because we have this in our lab we have a plasma
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:28.040]  torch on one of our mass spec instruments well a couple of them plasma torches will disintegrate
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:34.200]  these molecules but they use a massive amount of electricity so no seriously you gotta you gotta run
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.240]  you gotta take all this water you nebulize it you run it through a plasma torch and you get
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:44.840]  nothing but carbon and hydrogen and chlorine atoms all kind of dismantled that's the solution
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:51.320]  seriously well that's a lot better than dumping it down a well yeah i'm yeah but it was speechless
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.280]  well but the thing is of course it would cost a fortune to do that so this is the thing they took
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:04.040]  vinyl chloride which wasn't worth much right i mean kind of dirt cheap as a bulk material
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:10.840]  and pvc you know kind of dirt cheap as a bulk material and then through what i'm calling asymmetrical
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:15.880]  chemical terrorism they then created who knows how many tens of billions or hundreds of billions of
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:22.120]  dollars in damage to farms and people and homes and family and animals and rivers and and crops
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:26.920]  and everything i mean you talk about asymmetrical warfare what do you think about that eric i mean
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:33.160]  is the damage is insane incalculable look i mean let's let's go back to some of the early history
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:39.400]  of dioxin it was it was a component of a chemical weapon uh agent orange most people know of dioxin
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.920]  from their from their parents and grandparents dad and their grandfather who were exposed to it
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:51.880]  during the vietnam war and so it it is a component of a chemical weapon uh that was used for years
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:58.680]  in vietnam and then then it was dumped on the pacific northwest in organ so it is a warfare agent
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:06.840]  well absolutely and and we're we're in a war right we are being attacked now do you think that this
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:13.800]  even if the initial accident wasn't intentional they intentionally set it on fire they intentionally
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:18.920]  spread it they intentionally injected it deep underground things like that now um we got to
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.040]  go to break eric i'm sorry but hold your answer to that question and we'll be right back after
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:29.000]  this break we're going to continue with eric copolino here from planet waves dot org if you
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.040]  want to see his sub stack page planet waves dot org we'll be back with eric copolino and much more
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.720]  straight ahead here on the alex jones show i'm mike adams we continue through the entire next hour
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.600]  including with uh attorney brian best stuff filing a lawsuit we'll be right back after this break
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:53.800]  ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset in the world is a historic book that
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:59.320]  documents the globals in their own words planned for our future that is a hellish future now you'll
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:03.160]  be always while they still allow books i guess they're starting to ban them be able to get an
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.200]  unsigned copy of the great reset in the world at bookstores amazon or info or short i com
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.320]  but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:18.360]  run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now so get your copy of the great reset and
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.320]  the war for the world a signed copy at info or short i com and there is a markup there because
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:28.120]  this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air so you won't just have this historic memento and this
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.360]  powerful book you'll also know that you help keep info words on the air i'm going to thank those of
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:37.240]  you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies but i want to encourage all of you
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:42.280]  who haven't yet to go to info or short i com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:47.560]  copies and go to the library or give them to the local school this is an info war i'm counting on
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.880]  you and thank you for your support ladies and gentlemen info wars has proven itself the last
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:56.520]  28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.400]  tyrants and we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.640]  products at the same time so i want to thank all the viewers and listeners of support to some of
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:10.440]  the years by spraying the word praying for the broadcast and buying product but i really want

[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:13.160]  all right welcome back folks we're continuing here with eric copolino for this hour and also
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:18.120]  going to be joined by brian fessa from we the patriots usa at the bottom of this hour now
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:25.160]  continuing with mr copolino i got a question for you eric i i had supposed that the epa
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:31.800]  has already conducted dioxin tests secretly i think in in my mind at least there's no doubt
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.400]  they already have these tests and they're probably freaking out over it and figuring out
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.960]  you know trying to scheme you know how do we keep this from the public what's your take do you
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.840]  think the epa knows that dioxins are out there i would bet a lot of money that you're right i've
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:49.160]  been saying the same exact thing we're on the same page on this of course are testing for dioxin
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:55.640]  how could they not be testing for dioxin but the problem is that once that becomes public once
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:03.080]  there's a single dioxin test result that says that they've got this chemical in in in that situation
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:09.800]  then the conversation goes to two things one it goes to evacuation and then the second thing it
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:17.000]  does is it goes to how far did this spread i want my area tested and so they know that they are really
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:24.600]  opening up pandora's box by uh by by by even admitting that there's that there's any dioxin
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:31.560]  yeah but how long do you think they can keep this charade going because at some point you would think
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:37.640]  that even a lot of uh environmental groups are going to conduct testing maybe some universities
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:41.960]  are going to conduct testing i mean eventually we're going to have the dioxin testing equipment
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:46.680]  in place it's a few months out but we're going to be doing testing i mean they can't keep this up
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:55.480]  forever so what do you think their plan is here well i i don't know but look i mean they're trying
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.600]  to keep you know it's 100 pounds of poo and a 50 pound sack right now and they are being asked about
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:07.320]  it every time they turn around we've we've got the senators from Ohio uh demanding testing and
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:14.760]  the the the pressures on them and i think they know the extent of the problem they have the
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:20.520]  minute they admit that there's dioxin in in the situation and they've managed to keep it quiet
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.880]  for nearly a month and you know you know they're going to try to downplay the results or they're
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.800]  going to try to confuse them they have a whole playbook of things that they do from fake studies
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:40.280]  to losing losing test results and i i i can only imagine that it's really a crisis situation
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:46.840]  at the epa right now well well just to be clear i want our audience to know that the actual test
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:53.560]  here only takes it's about a 24 minute run on a triple quad mass spec with a gc interface
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:03:01.320]  so in 24 minutes they can have they can run water or if you have to do sample prep for
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:06.120]  like a meat sample or a dairy sample or something you know give yourself another half hour for the
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:12.920]  sample prep and so within an hour they can have results so there is no excuse for the epa to not
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:18.600]  have these results in fact it's got to be eric that if if they had the results and the results were
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:23.640]  zero they would have already shared that publicly they would have said oh we found no dioxin whatsoever
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  exactly your thoughts but the thing is we don't need just dioxin we need a full spectrum dioxin
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:36.840]  and full spectrum diabenzo furan and then that that results in one result called a teq a toxic
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:45.160]  equivalency or a 2378 tcdd equivalency and that number is a kind of a weighted composite of all
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:52.200]  of the different dioxins and furans that were found in in the situation so it's not merely a yes or no
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:59.000]  we want to know the the distribution of these chemicals in other words how much 2378 of each
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.920]  and then how much of the other isomers and congeners and and it has to be done at the point source
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:11.000]  and then it has to be done on rooftops all throughout east palestine and then we have to
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.920]  get we have to get our first fingerprint of the plume and how it's spread but the most important
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:24.200]  is what is actually in the burn pit exactly right so we're we're talking about they're really gonna
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:30.360]  have to take probably tens of thousands of samples across you know how many thousands of square
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:35.880]  miles ultimately in order to determine where the fallout took place and exactly what's there
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:41.480]  so you know good thing the epa has a multi-billion-dollar budget huh because uh they they're gonna
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:45.560]  need it to do all this test yeah well it's a thousand dollars it's not a cheap test i mean even
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.120]  when they do it in house the process is not it's not we've got to cut to break we'll be right back
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:54.520]  and just stay with us one minute away we'll be right back with eric capolino more about dioxin
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:05:04.520]  testing straight ahead right now i'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to

[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:18.440]  welcome to the third hour of the alex jones show i'm mike adams joining you from the remote studio
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:24.200]  today and so thank you for all your support of info wars store.com don't forget about info wars

[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:36.120]  when the cell towers go down now we're joined by eric copolino from planetwaves.fm and his
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:42.440]  sub stack site can be reached at planetwaves.org and eric i have i have a question for you here
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:48.040]  since we're going to be joined by an attorney at the bottom of this hour brian festa i want your
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:52.680]  take i know you've worked with a lot of attorneys on toxins and environmental contamination
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:57.880]  what's your take on the legal theories that can be invoked here and do you think that there is a
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:02.680]  criminal element that might be invoked here for example a criminal cover-up on the part of the
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:07.640]  epa what do they know about this and they're withholding it from people or a criminal cover-up
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:13.160]  perhaps on the part of other parties involved what's your take on it eric well though though
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:17.640]  though it would be challenging i think there is plenty of criminal exposure but we could we could
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:26.120]  go first to toxic torrents and what the what a cause of action might be and the most interesting
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:32.760]  and i think um potentially effective cause of action i've ever heard is uh to bring a battery
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:39.560]  case against people batteries another word for assault and assault based on case law can be as
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:46.440]  little as an unwanted kiss or tapping a person's cane can be counted as battery battery is harmful
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:52.520]  or potentially offensive touching and this is certainly harmful or potentially offensive touching
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:57.960]  and i think a very strong case to be made for battery battery is an intentional tort in other
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:04.120]  words it it is not necessarily an act of desire but it means that the person who did it knew or
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:10.120]  should have known about the outcome that they would have had and all of the environmental
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:17.160]  agencies have volumes and volumes of records talking about the creation of dioxins from
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:24.120]  vinyl chloride and from polyvinyl chloride this is a known issue going back many many decades
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:30.520]  so are you saying then i mean who who would potentially be responsible for the battery the
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:35.960]  the railroad company that set fire to it or the the responders or who who exactly are you referring
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:42.360]  to i would say that a proper complaint would go all the way up and down the line it would include
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.520]  litigating the manufacturers uh we still do not know who owned that vinyl chloride we don't know
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:54.440]  who was the buyer of that vinyl chloride i'm sure now that uh nobody wants to be known as the buyer
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:01.000]  of that vinyl chloride but i i've seen litigation that basically sues every single uh potentially
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:07.960]  responsible party as they're called in in epa language a prp and well but then in all fairness
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:13.160]  though eric i mean the the the company that makes the vinyl chloride or the company that purchased
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.120]  it uh i don't see how it could be their fault i mean didn't they hand it over to the railroad for
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.880]  safe transportation that's the railroad's job you know transport this from a to b don't spill it
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:29.480]  don't lose it right uh and that you know the manufacturer they didn't say you know tip it over
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:36.600]  instead on fire right that's not part of the no no they they didn't but we need to have discovery
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.800]  with these people we we need to know exactly who they are and what they knew and we need to know
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:47.880]  their accountability we need to know uh the terms of the shipping so i'm only basing this on on
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.720]  experience from lawsuits that i've seen where even the even the people who manufacture the components
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:10:00.040]  of the vinyl chloride could be in on on the liability chain everyone has to be held accountable
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:06.280]  every last person involved mike well i i do see a point where if for example if the the owner of
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:13.000]  this material did not for example have proper filing of the hazardous status uh with the railroad
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.440]  right so potentially maybe the railroad didn't know that that's exactly or maybe perhaps it wasn't
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:24.280]  labeled correctly or perhaps hazardous handling information but i i i get your point like we
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:29.800]  got to go up and down the chain and and dig into this probably attorneys will do this and find out
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.680]  was it uh documented correctly was it safely handled correctly did the people at the railroad
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:39.880]  understand how to handle this in case of an accident did they receive proper training or did they
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:45.400]  ignore their training because somebody screwed up big time somebody and we're talking yeah i think
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:53.320]  it may be tens of billions of dollars in damage here oh i mean by far i mean the the a a relatively
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:58.200]  minor spill on a college campus in new york cost more than 50 million dollars to clean up in the
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:03.880]  1990s uh a single building in binghamton new york called the binghamton state office building
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:09.800]  cost 50 million dollars in 1980s dollars to clean quote unquote clean one building and they didn't
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:16.840]  even get all the dioxin and pcb's out of out of that building there's ultimately no remediating this
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:24.040]  but the the you know from a a liability standpoint the thing we want now is we want discovery we need
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:31.400]  to see they all need to purge their files we need to know exactly what is in in in their files we
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:37.720]  need the emails we need everything that's that's how documents like this that i put on program last
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:45.720]  week uh we were on a different platform uh come come out in in the wash and this document gives gives
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:53.320]  the internal history of dioxin known by monsanto up until 1956 where they admit they've got a dioxin
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:59.960]  problem in all of their chlorinated phenol products but when they were dumping it on people in vietnam
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:05.880]  and on american troops in vietnam and then dumping it on the forest in the pacific northwest they were
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:12.760]  denying that they had any early knowledge of the contamination by dioxin until this document came out
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.560]  and and prove it this is the kind of thing we need thank you for getting me that document let me just
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.520]  summarize one of the key findings here so there are i think four companies mentioned in this document
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:29.320]  it's baer dow monsanto and basf and by the way two of those four companies were part of ig
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:35.400]  farben which was found guilty of nazi war crimes against humanity and my understanding is in the
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:41.480]  late 1940s and the early 1950s they they had an accident an industrial accident that accidentally
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.240]  created these dioxins killed or i should say entered a lot of people and then they in one of
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:52.680]  these accident rooms they cleaned it out they they cleared it out washed it out waited 10 days
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.880]  and then they put rabbits in cages and just left the rabbits in the room for one day
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:03.960]  and all those rabbits died and this is 10 days later okay so we're talking about yes go ahead
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:10.280]  even worse they removed the cages they put new rabbits in the cages and they died outside of
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:15.960]  the contaminant of that outside of that building where the accident happened so and this see to
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:19.640]  me this reminds me of the fact that people are coming back to east palestine and they're getting
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:26.760]  sick again because there's something about dioxins that lingers forever potentially but
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.400]  extremely low concentrations those rabbits kept dying and dying and they found out that the toxic
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:37.240]  dose on a rabbit is so small i think it ended up being five parts per billion of some small amount
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:43.080]  put on a on a rabbit killed a rabbit every time yep well we need to be asking people about their
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:48.440]  pets their bunny rabbits and their guinea pigs guinea pigs are even more sensitive to dioxin
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:54.600]  contamination and they would be the first to die right right and we've already seen stories
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:00.280]  documenting what 43 000 animals have died in the area mostly a lot of fish is what they're counting
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.760]  but surely there are millions more that they haven't counted i mean is anybody standing there in the
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  creek counting fish you know give me a break or is that is that a epa job um you know but
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:16.040]  people are going to be harmed for you know the other thing that came out of this is that
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.000]  some people didn't develop chloracne which is you know their their face all exploding in postules
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.880]  because of the dioxin exposure getting infections and everything all in their face it didn't show up
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:33.080]  for 10 to 12 months later after the exposure right well yeah and that's because it's because
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:38.840]  chloracne is evidence of systemic poisoning the skin is as you know is an excretion gland right
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:45.640]  perspiration is excretion right and and so the the the the dioxin is going to work its way through
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:51.400]  the body and the body will use every means it can possibly use to get rid of the stuff and so the
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:58.760]  the chloracne is evidence of systemic poisoning they and they knew this in the 1930s they knew this
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.040]  with something called the drinker study conducted by a harvard professor for a company called swan
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.120]  chemical that eventually became monsanto in in the 1930s and and they taught i'm sure you read
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:15.240]  that part in this document where they they they say oh now we understand what was making the people
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:21.320]  sick in in in previous decades yeah the whole thing how can we how do we commercialize that and turn
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:25.320]  it into a chemical weapon and make a lot of money off of it right instead of saying oh this is the
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.640]  most dangerous chemical in the world we should shut this down they said oh how do we make money off
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:35.480]  this right i mean essentially that's and they made plenty they did yeah and then that became
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:42.440]  agent orange and other other toxins so okay yeah but stay with us eric no stay with us eric we're
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.760]  going to go to break here we'll be right back after this break folks more with eric capolino
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:52.280]  and we're going to talk about faked lab testing potentially by the epa when we return stay with
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:59.720]  us here on the alex jones show we'll be right back after this break i've got some good news our

[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:02.280]  every time i talk to you you're either like on the border exposing the cartels in like coming
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:06.760]  under fire or you're on the streets of some american city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:11.400]  and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill are you addicted to the dangers
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.880]  savannah have you ever considered that for a second no i'm addicted to helping my fellow
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:20.520]  americans i'm addicted to spreading the truth and again i you know i have info wars to thank for
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:26.120]  that looking back on the day i was able to ask president donald trump two questions i was so
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:30.760]  grateful because you know i truly was classically trained under alex jones and under the info wars
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:37.080]  team i really do credit that as to why i'm able to you know get these types of clips because alex's
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.920]  whole mentality was you know go where the story is go where the mainstream media refuses to so it's
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:47.160]  not that i'm addicted to the insanity i'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:52.040]  american people and i really do credit alex for you know really instilling that within the early
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:18:04.920]  on in my career it's hard to believe that we're already going into march 2023 and the world is
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:09.560]  an insane place world war three has already started biden is a puppet and is dissolving our
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:13.880]  borders there's mass censorship james oak he's been removed from project veritas the list goes
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:17.800]  on and on of the bad things that are happening but the good things that are happening is humanity
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:23.240]  is really accelerating it's away but those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the

[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.520]  mike adams here giving you a look at our new studios our bright town studios i'm broadcasting
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:26.520]  from today and uh tell you what building out this studio has given me so much appreciation
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:33.240]  for the info wars studios which the people there running info wars are truly amazing they have
[02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:39.000]  mastered this art they are light years ahead of what we're pulling off here we're just covering
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:44.680]  the basics but uh thumbs up to all the info wars guys and gals there who are making it work you guys
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:49.960]  and gals are awesome and thank you for having me on today alex so okay we're continuing with
[02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:56.440]  eric capolino now i want to shift gears just slightly eric and i want to tell you that i believe
[02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:03.240]  the epa also knows how to fake a lot of the testing and i believe that this is happening across law
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:09.240]  enforcement labs across america now let me just set this up and i'll let you respond to this eric
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:12.520]  and and you know i'm sorry to throw you a curve ball i don't know i don't know where you stand on
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:16.760]  this but here's the thing you know i'm pro law enforcement because i don't want criminals running
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:21.960]  loose in the cities but i also know because i run an iso accredited lab and i talk to lab people
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:28.120]  i know labs have been shut down for faking lab results all the time for law enforcement you
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:33.560]  know a cop hands them here's a bag of a white powdery substance and what is it and they will fake
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:38.760]  like it's cocaine they won't even run the test and there are innocent people convicted all across
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:43.720]  this country and there are innocent people on death row believe me who have been convicted by
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:50.680]  faked law enforcement lab results from labs that are just making it all up literally making it up
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:55.400]  not even doing the science and i think the epa right now is is involved in a cover up but what
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:22:00.120]  are your thoughts eric about lab testing and long law enforcement if you don't mind me asking
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:07.480]  about that topic yep so first there there have been one lab scandal after the next in terms of
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:13.400]  chemical companies the most famous was industrial biotest labs which was busted by the
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:21.720]  fda in the late 1970s for for putting out thousands of falsified tests on chemical products including
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:27.080]  a lot of pesticides and food additives and deodorants and things like that and most of those
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:35.080]  chemicals which were approved by the fda and the epa with phony tests are still on the market but
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:42.120]  second i've i've spent approximately the last like 1067 days on the covet story and at the very
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:48.840]  center of the covet story is a molecular test called the polymerase chain reaction and what the
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:56.520]  whole covet story boils down to is testing fraud they they have no original of sars-cov-2 to prime
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:01.960]  the test with you know if you're testing for wine components you have wine components to prime the
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:08.520]  test and at the end of this i you know i'm not quite at the end but it's been a while it has
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.720]  occurred to me many times through the process of doing the story that there is very likely to be a
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:21.480]  problem with with with dna testing out of out of out of these criminal cases i i you concur with
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:26.120]  you critical point the pcr testing fraud a lot of people are aware of how fraudulent that was when
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:32.040]  it came to covet right so they do a swab they stick it in a machine and then they crank up the cycle
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:37.800]  thresholds to insane levels until they get quote a signal the problem is and i know this as a lab
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:44.120]  tech you know a published lab scientist their signal to noise ratio doesn't compute it's all
[02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:49.240]  noise so you can get any kind of a signal if you just crank up the noise high enough right you can
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:53.640]  find a peak quote you know a peak in if you just crank up the noise which is what they're doing
[02:23:53.640 --> 02:24:01.160]  with pcr so the question is when they say oh this guy uh his dna was found at the scene of this murder
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:07.480]  and it's a 99.99999 percent match and i'm thinking well wait a second you did that with pcr so you
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:13.000]  just cranked that up until you found a guilty signal in the noise basically is what's going on
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.560]  but a lot of people don't even they don't have the the knowledge to be able to fight back against
[02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:21.560]  that even attorneys don't have necessarily the knowledge to say wait a minute that's bogus you
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:26.920]  can't identify that person's dna by just cranking up the pcr test but they do it all the time go ahead
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:32.360]  yeah and and the problem with the with the covid pcr was they never had a crime scene sample
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:38.680]  they made up their crime scene sample this is just like average perpetrator sample and then they
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:47.240]  take the then they run the accused persons and dna and they they create a match but they never even
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:55.240]  had an original to to work from and so the the testing scandals take every possible shape size
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:25:01.240]  and color i've seen many many many of them and i think that all of these dna cases have to be
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.520]  rerun we need to be checking on the integrity of the original samples we need to be checking the
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:12.920]  cycle threshold because the pcr is used in all of this molecular and and genetic testing and we've
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:17.800]  got to figure out what's going on inside the box you know people just accept that there's just this
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:24.920]  that there's just this like a miracle truth machine you know called dna testing but it's not there's
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:31.640]  not any miracle truth machine no you i'm so glad you said it that way because even in the courtrooms
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:37.560]  they refer to quote the science oh it's the science it has to be truthful and the scientist is
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:43.000]  is speaking in language that nobody else can decode so therefore it must be truth no it's not
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:49.640]  it's uh it's a lot of hokum just hogwash it and uh you know protein fraud basically is what we're
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:54.120]  talking about here protein with these pieces yeah it's protein fraud oh we found these proteins
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:59.960]  okay whatever you're you're you're creating uh all kinds of protein strands you don't even know
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.840]  what you're replicating in your your pcr machine no they have no idea what the background noise
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:09.480]  right and then oh you found a match of the sequence well so what i mean that's you didn't
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.280]  find a little person in there did you you didn't find a little tiny person i mean what what did you
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:19.160]  find out the the sequence you say is a match ridiculous it's ridiculous but with the chemical
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:24.840]  companies i mean it was completely insane i mean look look this up i mean uh if you search industrial
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.200]  biotest labs in my name uh it'll it'll come up and i can i will push actually at the top of
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.640]  planet waves fm there's an interview with a guy named peter von snackleburg who broke the story
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:41.320]  in the in the early 1980s singlehandedly and i i'm i'm honored to know this person and count
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:48.280]  him as a friend and you it is absolutely astounding the the extent of the laboratory fraud and and
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:55.320]  ibt labs was only one of many many labs that were were busted and three of its executives uh were
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:27:00.680]  were convicted of federal mail and wire fraud for this well let me add something else here that's
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:07.720]  highly relevant i call it the not detected fraud because any lab can if they wish if they are so
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:12.440]  motivated they can tune their machines to not detect something you can always decrease the
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:18.120]  sensitivity of your instruments the hard part is increasing sensitivity and we spend all kinds of
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:22.600]  time increasing sensitivity you know you have to have the nebulizer the flow rates have to be
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.880]  correct the the axis has to be correct you know all the all the the plumbing has to work correctly
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.840]  to get the sensitivity so if the epa is taking dioxin samples and if they put out a report i'm
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:38.040]  just going to say this ahead of time if the epa puts out a report and says not detected that's
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:42.920]  nonsense because there's so much dioxin out there right now they should always detect it even without
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:48.200]  the train crash correct this is part of their problem right now this is part of their problem
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:53.080]  people are well enough informed now that they can't just come out and say whoa good non-detect we
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.120]  didn't find any it's all good bring the bell everyone go home they can't do that too many people are
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.960]  paying attention this will cause a firestorm if it's another firestorm if they if they do this
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:10.120]  yeah exactly i mean epa we're putting you on notice right here put you on notice i'll show and show
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.920]  mike adams health ranger eric capolino we're putting you on notice if you lie you're going to get
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:18.840]  caught you're going to get caught if you cover this up you're going to get caught and eventually
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:23.640]  we're going to test for dioxin even if you don't do it and and the truth is going to come out so
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:29.240]  all you can do epa you can run and hide and cover but you can't stop the truth from coming out okay
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.520]  final thoughts here eric before we go to break yeah they can't they're not going to be able
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:39.000]  to hide this for long they're just not going to be able to do it people are too savvy now they know
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:46.680]  the issue is out their best defense was keep it secret but it's all right stand by eric i'm
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.200]  going to see if we can bring you in on the next segment with brian festival we'll be right back
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:54.520]  after this break here on the alex jones show on mike adams stay with us we'll be right back
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:03.160]  ladies and gentlemen this book the great reset in the world is a historic book that documents
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:08.280]  the globals in their own words plan for our future that is the hellish future now you'll be
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:12.440]  always while they sell our books i guess they're starting to ban them be able to get an unsigned
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:17.080]  copy of the great reset in the war for the world at bookstores amazon or info or short i come
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:22.200]  but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:27.240]  run out and there's about a thousand left of them right now so get your copy of the great reset and
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:32.200]  the war for the world a signed copy at info or short i come and there is a markup there because
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.000]  this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air so you won't just have this historic memento and this
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.240]  powerful book you'll also know that you help keep employers on the air i'm going to thank those of
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:46.120]  you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies but i want to encourage all of you
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:51.160]  who haven't yet to go to info or short i come and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:56.280]  copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school this is an info war i'm counting
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:02.600]  on you and thank you for your support it's hard to believe that we're already going into march
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:09.160]  2023 and the world is an insane place world war three has already started biden is a puppet and
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:13.640]  is dissolving our borders there's mass censorship james oakie's been removed from project veritas
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:17.240]  the list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening but the good things that are happening
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:22.920]  is humanity is really accelerating it's away but those of us on the forefront are under more
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:27.240]  attacked by the establishment that's why i'm counting on you to spread the word about the
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:31.640]  broadcast to pray for the broadcast and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:35.720]  at info or short i come and whether it's a final signed copy they're almost all sold out with a
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:39.960]  great reset in the world or open bone broth finally back in stock after over two years it's all
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:45.160]  available info or short i come these are truly amazing products so get your info or products
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:50.040]  at info or short i come and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air it is your
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:54.200]  decision whether or not we stay on air so please take action now at info or short
[02:30:57.640 --> 02:31:03.400]  i've got some good news our high quality supplements really work and we have about an
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:09.800]  80 percent reorder rate with customers that's the good news they're amazing the bad news is
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:14.120]  around one percent or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to info
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:18.360]  war store dot com and ever actually buy the products so you're missing out on these products
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:23.800]  plus it funds the info war think of what we've done with just one percent of our massive audience
[02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:29.640]  actually buying products think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to info
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:34.840]  war store dot com and got some of these amazing products i would recommend tumor 95 for your
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:39.640]  joints your bones inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great

[02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:58.440]  the product fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together info war store dot com thousands
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:04.200]  of former nazis went to work for the united states government applying this has been found and is
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:09.720]  now in the possession of the army there is a bulletin from cbf news resident kennedy has been
[02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:17.320]  shot this is a different kind of war the uss liberty had just been attacked by israeli jets
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:22.840]  and torpedoes the bia could manipulate the news in the united states they took the babies out of
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:28.440]  thank you mares and let the children to die on the phone it was almost as if it were a plan in full
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:35.880]  get your tank and we need to go into the capital that you would always have conspiracy theories
[02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:42.200]  they are nothing but distract you guys censored harvard educated doctors you silence those voices
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:49.080]  what we want to do in davos is push to reset but as soon as we start exposing the great reset
[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:56.200]  as soon as these globalists are going to prison
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:05.480]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:17.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover us you want answers well so does he
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:20.440]  it's mike adams
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:29.320]  all right folks welcome back this is mike adams here alex jones show at info wars dot com and
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:35.000]  conspiracy fact dot info and we're going to be joined now in this segment well the the next two
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:42.200]  segments by brian festa with we the patriots usa and also eric capolino who we've been speaking
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:48.680]  with here about dioxons and the epa and the the pcr cover up and many other topics
[02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:55.320]  so we're going to actually bring in brian festa here because his group has filed a lawsuit or is
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:59.960]  in the process he'll give us the information mr festa thank you for joining me today can you
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:06.200]  give us a brief please about exactly what you're filing what are the allegations of this lawsuit
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:11.240]  and how many people have been harmed in your view by the the events that have taken place go
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:17.720]  ahead sir thank you mike thank you for having me on yeah we filed a lawsuit actually just
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:23.480]  yesterday in federal courts this is the district court for the northern district of ohio we filed
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:30.200]  that just yet we had a press conference in akra announced that but yes this was a lawsuit it is
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:37.000]  a lawsuit against the united states environmental protection agency the epa as well as the ohio epa
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:46.200]  and the governor of ohio as well as epa and local public health officials who did not take
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:52.440]  the proper steps in our view to protect the public health there was a lot that wasn't done that
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.240]  should have been done i know you've been all over this mike talking about asking people to send
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:02.440]  you know samples and testing and that's absolutely the right thing to do because
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:08.920]  uh people are being harmed we have expert witnesses that we intend to bring forward
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:15.080]  that are have years of experience in environmental testing environmental safety that are going to
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:22.440]  be able to testify specifically to what the uh federal government did wrong here um the federal
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:29.640]  government has uh an affirmative duty uh under the 14th amendment um this is a substantive due
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:36.440]  process claim so without getting too technical uh the federal government uh cannot in any way take
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:42.760]  away or harm or do harm to someone's life liberty or property without due process of law and here
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:50.600]  by not giving truthful information about these toxins and toxicants that were actually released
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:57.000]  into the environment this chemical plume that was released by not providing uh accurate data
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:03.320]  or not doing accurate testing they have placed the public in harm's way their life on their property
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:09.160]  in harm's way and we intend to hold them accountable okay mr festa i want to get eric's uh
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:14.920]  response to that in a second but what about the railroad um is your lawsuit named norfolk southern
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:19.240]  or is that not part of this lawsuit or is that a separate action or what what's your take
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:25.080]  yes so that is not part of this lawsuit there are other organizations and individuals that
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:29.800]  have already brought suit against norfolk southern uh and in fact that was one criticism we had when
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:33.720]  we first announced the lawsuit some people were saying well you know isn't the isn't the railroads
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:37.480]  fault why are you you know going after the government in this shouldn't you be suing the
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:43.640]  railroad well in the mass tor action that we do believe is coming and we're certain is coming
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:49.160]  absolutely frick southern will be named this is not a mass tor action though this is trying to protect
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:54.760]  the life and the health of the individuals living in east palestine and the immediate surrounding
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:37:00.120]  area now because there are people that are still in harm's way they're being told because by and
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:05.720]  large and i don't know why but after what we've seen the last three years but by and large uh the
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:11.240]  the general public still relies on the federal government and their state government officials
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:16.200]  to give them accurate information they're the only ones norfolk southern can't order an evacuation
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:21.080]  they they can't do it do the proper testing you you make a critical point there so now i want to
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:26.040]  bring in eric now i don't know if you two have ever met but eric capolino has a lot of experience
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.320]  working with litigators on on the subject for for many decades so eric give us your take on what
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.680]  brian fester just just said and the lawsuit is from what you know about so far brian first
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:41.880]  a question i'm asking if you have a file for injunctive relief demanding diots and testing
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:49.560]  diots and testing and furan testing so the effect you have we have filed for injunctive relief so
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:54.760]  what we're asking for in our lawsuit is a declaratory judgment uh finding that they've engaged
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.400]  in conduct that is uh what's known as a state created danger to the plaintiffs and all similarly
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.600]  saturated residents of that area and also a writ of mandamus ordering the defendants to conduct
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:09.400]  an industry standard occupational contaminant testing which would include i believe i'm not
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:13.240]  a scientist and i'll leave that to our expert witnesses but that would include the testing
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:19.000]  that you just mentioned okay i mean that's very important because they they're going to test for
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.960]  the wrong thing in the wrong place i mean that's the mo of the epa is to you know test the air
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:29.320]  for vinyl chloride and say that it's safe and so these are not ordinary you know these not ordinary
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:35.640]  chemicals we need to be looking for here and let me add to brian uh relay this message because
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:41.320]  because you know i'm i'm a lab scientist we we specialize in food contamination i i own six
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:46.600]  mass spec instruments and we're adding dioxin testing interface a gc interface to one of our
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:53.880]  triple quad mass spec instruments but uh watch out for them saying not detected if they test
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:59.320]  samples for dioxin and they say not detected that's a fraud it means that they're they're probably
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.240]  tuning their instruments so that it doesn't have the the limit of detection as it's called their
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.240]  lod that is able to see those chemicals because these chemicals are in all all the you know the
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:15.240]  dairy products and meat right now at some tiny tiny level it is detectable if they say not detected
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:18.840]  they're lying i just i just want to get that on the record and eric and i've talked about that but
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:26.600]  go ahead brian your your thoughts on what's next well i i absolutely agree with you the testing
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:33.320]  they've done is woefully inadequate and inaccurate um because christin megan kelly uh who's one of the
[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:37.480]  experts she actually hosts a podcast for us called vets and visionaries eric we the patriots you have
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:42.920]  usa she's an industrial hygienist with years of experience who's government trained worked you know
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:48.840]  while she was in the air force for for many years and she has talked at length about these these
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.480]  exact uh you know compounds that you're mentioning now and why the testing they're doing is not
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:58.120]  accurate for instance just doing spot testing rather than testing over an eight-hour period
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:02.920]  for instance just testing you know a foot above the ground level for air quality instead of you
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:07.240]  know five feet six feet where most people are breathing just testing at the surface of the
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:11.080]  water rather than going down into the sludge i mean i could go on and on and on and on about it
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:16.520]  i'm not even a scientist um that all the things they're doing wrong we intend to expose that in
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.760]  in excruciating detail because it's not just christian we have other experts as well who have
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:26.200]  come forward and are going to be providing uh testimony and evidence to say this is how it
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:31.560]  should be done and this is how it's not being done and and that's we intend to hold them accountable
[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:38.280]  because if we can't go to a court of law like to address these things to to redress these wrongs
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:44.200]  where else can we go so you know that's why we filed this federal lawsuit and we do need support
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:49.160]  for it at anyone who wants to support the lawsuit and support our efforts we are still in great need
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:55.640]  of funding for it so that's at we the patriots usa.org um i understand you know times are tough and
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:00.440]  but you know for the people of east palestine uh really times couldn't be any tougher right now this
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:05.800]  is the yeah i'm glad you mentioned that we the patriots it's one of the top groups that even
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:11.240]  my listeners told us that that they wanted us to support and we actually uh we we gave a donation
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:17.720]  to your group as you know um i don't know a couple months ago and um got got some money your way it
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:22.360]  wasn't wasn't a huge donation but folks we the patriots usa.org if you want to support this
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:28.920]  effort now we're going to be donating uh lab testing uh time you know instrument time and uh
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:33.960]  eric you had said earlier do you know what is the current market rate of a dioxin test right now
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.880]  in a in a like a commercial lab any idea it usually goes for over a thousand dollars per
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:45.080]  per test which is pretty pretty pretty high i mean but look you know they're they're not going to
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.880]  find dioxin in the air and they're not gonna they're unlikely to find it in water right now
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:55.160]  they've got to have soot samples they have to be compelled they've destroyed evidence by backfilling
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:01.320]  that pit they have to go into that pit and take samples and run those samples for dioxins and furans
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:09.400]  and produce a point source level we need to know exactly what was in that fire and and we need
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:15.880]  thousands of samples basically just in a in an expanding radius around ground zero right there
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:21.400]  so we're talking many thousands of samples and if you keep finding uh elevated levels of dioxins
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:27.560]  then you have to keep going farther and farther away from ground zero and i can tell you uh the
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:33.640]  instrument just the instrument to do this uh six hundred thousand dollars for the triple quad mass
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:39.960]  spec and a gc interface not to mention the lab the fume hoods the sample prep uh the audits the
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:44.680]  inspections the personnel you have to have you know train chemists and analysts to run all of this
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:49.960]  so this is it's a multi-million-dollar effort to even run one test we'll be right back with
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:54.120]  brian festa and eric capolino stay with us here on the alice jones show i'm mike adders

[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.640]  okay welcome back to the alex jones show mike adams here we're joined by attorney brian fesser
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:24.280]  from we the patriots usa and also eric capolino from planetwaves.org a dioxin expert and we also
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:30.680]  understand we have breaking news from christin megan who is i believe in east ohio right now
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:36.760]  and to the producers as soon as you have her on the phone let me know we'll bring her in immediately
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:43.960]  brian do you know what breaking news christin is going to bring us here i do not but she is the one
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:48.360]  or actually uh tammy clark who's with her as well as the one that just texted me she's there with
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:52.600]  christin and just texted me and said they have some breaking news report and they'd like to call
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:58.200]  in so i texted your producer and hopefully we're going to make this work okay all right we will
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:02.440]  break for that i mean we'll jump right to that as soon as we have a connection with christin
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:09.160]  but eric and thank you for staying with us eric for for this segment you know at some point this
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:15.640]  the dam of the cover-up breaks wide open doesn't it are you still calling for an evacuation as a
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:21.400]  precautionary principle until we know more yeah of course doesn't make any sense to have a have
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:27.640]  a release where there's certain to be dioxin and and then you wait for the testing and you leave
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.160]  the people there to build up you know to accumulate higher body burdens the pregnant women have to get
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:38.520]  out immediately the children have to be removed immediately and then in order kind of like on
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:45.160]  the titanic uh you know girls and women who plan to have babies and and and everyone i mean there's
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:49.800]  no reason for anyone to be there right now while this mystery is hanging over it's like if you're
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:54.760]  in a hotel we've all had this happen you're in a hotel and the and the alarm goes off at three
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:49:00.200]  o'clock in the morning you don't you don't wait till you smell smoke you you're standing out there
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:05.160]  in your bathrobe along with everybody else out out in the parking lot exactly and then started
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:09.720]  started to cut you off we've got now joining us by phone with some breaking news from iso high
[02:49:09.720 --> 02:49:15.560]  i believe it's christin megan who is an industrial hygienist christin if you can hear me welcome to
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:21.080]  the show yes thank you so we are actually traveling and i was listening and i want to tell you
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.560]  something that i figured out yesterday and it's blowing my mind that i'm a single person that
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:31.240]  i know of has addressed this so my colleague tami clark and i were on the ground we dealt with a
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:36.600]  lot of coughing a lot of issues and it brought me back to my air force days where i worked at a
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:43.080]  depot maintenance space and they would stand these five c one and guess what they were containing
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:51.160]  cadmium chromium uh chrome six all these what osha considers expanded standards nobody is paying
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:58.760]  attention to the airborne hazards now from burning the actual rail cars so i think actually
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:04.040]  i met a massive exposure that's being ignored is these exposure to these carcinogenic metals and
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.480]  everyone talking about the metallic case which we had and it made my tongue tingle and go numb
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:15.240]  that is what happens when you're exposed to cadmium from six tronium chromates so this is not only
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:21.400]  just the metal from the cars but whatever the corrosion control coatings and paints that existed
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:27.400]  on those cars so these are things that also need to be part of the demanded testing and it explains
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:33.400]  so much that i saw on the ground okay okay very important point christin and stay on the phone
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:39.480]  with us now the the the cadmium uh is uh cancer causing heavy metal that's something that we can
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:45.800]  test for right now by the way so if you can get samples uh from that area we can run icpms testing
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:51.000]  using mass spec for the elemental analysis and look at cadmium now the uh i think you mentioned
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.680]  hexavalent chromium uh that is a different that's a different test we can test for chromium as an
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:02.920]  element but not the molecule known as uh hexavalent chromium that's a different test but get samples
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:08.280]  while you can there now christin one more question uh you mentioned some of the reports what are the
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:12.280]  symptoms that people are telling you they're experiencing on the ground right now as they
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:19.160]  return to east palestine headache fatigue and i guess the best way to explain it because i felt it
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:27.320]  it's like having full uh mild acid reflex all the way down your airway um it's a very uh i know this
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:31.160]  sounds silly but i can't think of the name it reminds me of those candies from the 80s that
[02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:35.640]  are hardshelled and when you bite into them they fizz that's what the back of your tongue starts to
[02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:40.120]  feel like so when i'm thinking of synergistic toxicity and all these different exposures with
[02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:44.680]  the same target organs i'm thinking oh my gosh this reminds me of a time i was in the military
[02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:49.640]  people were wearing the wrong PPE and they were being exposed to these metals but one thing i
[02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:54.360]  wanted to point out real quick mike is i understand this doesn't happen in the environment but i'm
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:59.720]  sure you are aware of in my field um when we have these types of expanded standards whether it's
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:05.800]  lead abatement asbestos abatement um they're called regulated areas when we're cleaning up um the
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:10.840]  space of exposure so you see how friable asbestos is a regulated area and guess what no employees
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:16.760]  can go in there so what they need to do is they need to stop with the absolute negligent and
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:22.040]  purposely wrongful testing they need to do swipe sampling which will only provide presence
[02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:27.400]  abscess but someone needs to go in there with a hapsite it has a fluid non-site device that's
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:34.200]  gcms that can really touch the unknown because they are not doing an all-hazard approach and they are
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:39.720]  blowing air into the water of the creek and it's used if they're using aerating devices and it's
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:43.560]  going back up into the breathing zone so when they're using these pit detectors
[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:48.040]  which are you know it's it's a laughable to say that that's any form of air sampling
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:53.560]  again it's more presence abscess and it's not contaminant specific all of this is going back
[02:52:53.560 --> 02:52:58.280]  into the breathing zone they need to sample surfaces we use something called ghost wipes in
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:04.200]  the lab by the way a ghost wipe is something that wipes a surface gathers material and then
[02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:09.560]  the ghost wipe vanishes or dissolves into the sample prep solution let's go to brian festa
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:14.440]  by the way thank you christin for for your report on the ground there let's go to brian talk to us
[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:20.920]  about the long-term medical costs that are likely to emerge from this and who is going to pay those
[02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:28.920]  medical costs well in my opinion and again i am not a scientist like like you all are who are on
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:36.040]  with me today but in my opinion this is the worst chemical disaster on american soil in our lifetimes
[02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:43.480]  at the very least if not ever um you know people uh compare you know i was on a twitter space recently
[02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:48.040]  and people are trying to talk well well no there's the exon valdez and other things but as far as the
[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:54.680]  human cost the cost of human lives i think this could be the greatest disaster we've ever seen
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:54:01.160]  and it will be years that we'll continue seeing if not decades that will continue seeing the effects
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:07.160]  of this i think you could be talking like i mean if you're talking about mass toward action i wouldn't
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:13.960]  be surprised if you saw you know a billion dollars um somewhere in that range uh as as some kind of a
[02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:19.400]  settlement or an award if there's an award that would not surprise me because of the loss of life
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.920]  and the devastation let me let me jump in here brian i'm sorry to cut you off um i just got
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:30.600]  confirmation and eric you're gonna love this i just got confirmation by text that we have uh i'm
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:35.400]  going to be interviewing an epa whistleblower so there's an epa whistleblower that's stepping forward
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:39.960]  that's going to do an interview with me it looks like that's getting set up for next week uh i'll
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:44.760]  bring you more details about about that and of course we'll post that on band dot video as well
[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:51.800]  eric your thoughts eric about the um the long-term health care costs associated with this because
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:57.160]  that can easily run you know i mean just depending on how widespread the damage is there may never
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:01.720]  be enough money to compensate people for the long-term health complications your thoughts eric
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:09.000]  no this is completely unprecedented and it should have been planned for but it it was not and nothing
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.120]  like this has ever happened before but we're talking about medical monitoring for 20 30 years but
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:19.320]  basically indefinitely this is a if we're just talking about and it's a three at least three
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:27.880]  generation poison and uh you know in lawsuits for glyphosate even in individual people are
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:34.600]  bringing in three quarters of uh bringing in 250 million dollars or more and so a billion here is
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:39.880]  absolutely nothing uh in terms of being able to take care of people plus we've got a problem
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:47.400]  of needing to monitor food throughout the entire region because there's 125 000 farms in Ohio and
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:53.640]  Pennsylvania and many of them are very small family farms they're the kind of grass fed farms you
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:58.760]  depend upon uh when you know when you when you go to a health food store and you buy like grass fed
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:04.040]  bison or or organic chicken they're coming from these small farms in this area and and they are
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:09.560]  very concerned and they do not know what to tell their customers uh and and they you know they want
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:14.760]  to be honest with their customers but they don't know what to say yeah exactly and and the EPA is
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:19.880]  actually causing economic damage to all those farmers by not doing the dioxin testing and not
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:24.520]  releasing the results of that if indeed there are no dioxins in that area why wouldn't they
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:29.960]  share the test results and announce that you know and and clear the zero chance of that there's zero
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:34.920]  chance yeah I know I know um because of cause and effect and molecules and and the the table of
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:40.840]  elements as well but yeah go ahead Brian and thank you Mike and if that EPA whistleblower is willing
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:46.360]  to speak with us please please do connect him or her to us because I would do that that person could
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:51.480]  be very very useful in our lawsuit and Eric also I believe I have your email I'm going to be reaching
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:57.640]  out to you if you're willing to lend some of your expertise we may be able to use that as well in in
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:03.560]  our suit and I've been qualified as an expert witness in these cases so yes let me thank all

[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:20.440]  going so you're now hosting the fourth hour here of the alex jones show and i was watching
[03:00:21.160 --> 03:00:23.320]  mike adams host with the great guests
[03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:30.520]  and as mike said before he signed off this is breaking news this is huge news and i'm reacting
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:37.240]  to it i'm like yeah okay you can't really how do you how do you not go back to that subject
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:43.000]  but what i like to do and this is why info wars is so important and we've done this with so many
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:52.120]  other stories it's the human intelligence angle and the human intelligence aspect of what we do here
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:01:00.040]  to have the experts on and then break a new story and then call and have people on the ground
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:05.800]  confirm it and so that's what we're going to do here in the fourth hour so if you are in the east
[03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:15.160]  palestine ohio area or an area affected by this because we just saw a report yesterday where
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:23.720]  dead deer are popping up all along these creeks and river banks around east palestine now no gun
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:29.160]  shot wounds no nothing just dead i mean who knows as to why but that was being reported yesterday we
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:39.640]  played that clip so the situation doesn't seem to be getting better other than just time is passing
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:45.080]  and some of the reporters that went there said that they could tell
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:50.200]  it just felt different in the air their skin felt a little different after being there and then
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:02:02.600]  leaving and coming home but you can only imagine what it's like last month in east palestine the
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:14.120]  month of february 2023 from a train derailment to a chemical bombing essentially you get napalm
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:24.360]  you get chemical napalm done by norfolk southern and now in the aftermath you realize that that was
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:29.160]  like the worst decision they could have made of all the decisions they chose the the worst
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:34.600]  it really makes you wonder
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:46.840]  but is the town just going to be devastated by this forever in their water
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:56.120]  how long is it going to take for them to recover or is everything just fine in fact you know every
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:01.400]  i'm sure it's no big deal oh the oh see because you're actually you're actually in the year
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:08.680]  3023 you think it's the year 2023 no it's the year 3023 and you're getting hit with
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:13.880]  weather weapons and you're getting hit with chemical explosions and infrastructure collapse
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:20.520]  and biological weapons and chemical weapons and poison demandatory injections population control
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:26.520]  no that's just the world that you're in now and i think people are finally starting to get it and
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:31.160]  look around like what is going on all these disasters so i want to take calls from people
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:36.040]  in ohio or that area if you have friends and family and you're talking to them do they have any
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:42.840]  hope for the future are they seeing the effects in the water and the food still are they concerned
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.000]  or have we heard from the amish i'm not hearing anything about that angle what about all the
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.520]  amish farmers in the area are they going to be feeling the impact of this so i'm going to give
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:57.880]  out the number now i'll give it back out on the other side as well just because a lot of radio
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:02.440]  stations don't pick up this first five minutes eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:07.320]  nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine so if you're in the ohio area the east

[03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:11.880]  on the air but the crew the audience so how do we communicate how do we get the truth out we know

[03:08:31.640 --> 03:08:38.840]  forget about the lack of humanity that we have from the current democrat party to be holding
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:45.400]  political prisoners for political stunts for their agenda mostly against donald trump
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:53.400]  and of course to well turn america into whatever diabolical hellhole they have in mind
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:00.760]  but hell you know these are the people that celebrate abortion that's what they do

[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:25.080]  on the line and so let's start with julie who's from east palestine in ohio julie
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:34.200]  you are on the alex joneshow go ahead making my call um so i i grew up in east palestine
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:41.640]  i live just outside of town now but my parents my family also live there um and it's just a
[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:47.080]  mess we just we don't know what to believe and we don't know what's going to happen long term
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:55.560]  now is your family still there or have they had any left they evacuated initially so my
[03:09:55.560 --> 03:10:02.440]  father is about a quarter mile from ground zero of the actual derailment so he was evacuated that
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:09.240]  friday on the third and he was gone for about a week to ten days then the epa came in they
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:16.520]  told him it was safe and so he did go home because he was sick of not being at home um he's 72 he has
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:24.200]  one lung and he's already survived cancer so i'm extremely concerned about what this is doing to him
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:31.240]  i've begged him to leave to come closer to where i am i'm about 30 miles away um but he he's lived
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:36.040]  there his whole life this town is deep root people have lived there for generations and they don't
[03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:45.640]  want to leave man one lung and still toughen it out after the chemical fire that just engulfed
[03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:53.800]  large land mass right outside of your town and he goes back in and is he telling you that he's
[03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:59.960]  having any problems breathing or anything like that he's telling me everything is fine um but
[03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:05.960]  i can hear in his voice labored breathing yesterday when i talked to him he was coughing and i was
[03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:10.200]  i just you know i questioned him what's going on why are you coughing he said he's got the cold that's
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:15.640]  going around town so you know it's there's everybody the cold is going around town
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:22.600]  and that's reassuring everyone has flu like symptoms right now and a lot of people are having
[03:11:23.400 --> 03:11:27.720]  nosebleeds um you know a couple of the girls i went to high school with they work right down
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:32.840]  town right behind the railroad tracks i mean the tracks run straight through the middle of town so
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:38.600]  all of the businesses in town they're right there by the track so they're all having nosebleed issues
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:45.240]  rashes on their skin um a lot of my friends pets have hair falling out it's it's just i don't even
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:54.360]  know what oh my gosh yeah are they hearing about uh any other any other news with like pets and
[03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:59.880]  animals because i mean we saw a bunch of animals dying right after this now we're seeing dead deer
[03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:07.960]  along river banks and creek banks we we are seeing dead deer right outside of town um not so much in
[03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:14.600]  town it's mostly smaller life like you know the minnows in the creek immediately were just floating
[03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:19.240]  i mean that basically that getting into the water basically nuked whatever was in that water and
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:25.480]  probably any deer that drank it are probably just on you know a timer at this point i guess right but
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:30.920]  the good news is we are starting to see like for the first few days after they did that quote unquote
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:35.720]  control burn there was no bird song there were no little critters like squirrels and chipmunks
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:40.200]  running around but we're starting my dad saying the past few days he's been woken up by the birds
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:45.720]  chirping so that's positive to me because we did see a lot of dead birds in the area and as far as
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:52.040]  bigger animals the dogs the cats um what my friend is a cattle farmer her cattle her goats they all
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:57.640]  seem to be okay but their water sources on their pasture had to be fenced off because they're all
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:13:03.400]  covered in a film so they're having to bring in you know bottled water for their cows for their
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:09.800]  bigger animals which it's not sustainable long-term at all yeah that's that's tough i don't know how
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:17.240]  you do that and we get a lot of a lot of plastic gallon of water coming in to that well president
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:22.200]  trump a lot of water that was you know we got water from trump oh we haven't gotten anything
[03:13:22.200 --> 03:13:30.040]  from by oh oh yeah biden yeah he's not interested no no no you don't bring biden up no but uh booty
[03:13:30.040 --> 03:13:34.920]  judge gave him a visit he stopped by for a camera moment you know he had a kodak moment he had his
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:44.520]  photo op and he left yep yeah he didn't do anything well now booty judge now booty judge is uh
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:51.480]  inspector general to audit pete booty judges use of f a a planes this is like sam brinton
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:57.160]  stealing luggage pete booty judges flies around on the government's jets and he says well i don't
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:03.560]  know if he used one to fly to east palestine but he says i mostly fly on commercial flights
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:09.480]  in economy class and when i do use our agency's aircraft it's usually a situation where doing
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:15.800]  so saves taxpayer money i'm not sure how flying private would ever save taxpayer money but um
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:22.760]  that's his excuse well if he just needs to send more black construction workers to east palestine
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:28.600]  and then we'll be fine that's his solution all right julie thank you so much for that report

[03:15:53.000 --> 03:16:01.400]  imagine the frustrations of the people there i talk a lot about the great successes info wars
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:07.240]  has had i don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us
[03:16:07.960 --> 03:16:12.040]  but when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the riders
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:19.080]  they really have been the mvps in this fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and stroyer
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:24.840]  and the hard work they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible
[03:16:25.720 --> 03:16:30.280]  so for myself the whole info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you

[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:45.560]  partially off the tracks in manatee county this morning the trained rails and six cars tipped
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:53.400]  over one of the cars contains about 30 000 gallons of propane fire and hazmat crews
[03:20:53.400 --> 03:21:01.320]  are monitoring the propane car for leaks until it can be rited or rited so uh you know why don't
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:10.280]  we just go in there and blow it up you know that seems to be the idea worked in east palestine right
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:18.840]  uh this one does not appear to be nearly as bad however but seems to be every day there's some
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:26.520]  sort of a trained arraignment or plant that blows up or a large fire i mean this is just the trend
[03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:34.360]  this is just the future the future you were promised we've got more calls from ohio i want
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:41.080]  to get to talking about finishing up with this east palestine story and let's go to jason now
[03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:48.440]  jason you're on the alex joneshow go ahead what's up owin long time listener i'm uh
[03:21:48.440 --> 03:21:56.040]  about 24 miles west of the thing i work about 12 miles from it every day you can see there's
[03:21:56.040 --> 03:22:02.360]  like fallout clouds still floating around it's like i'm a geoengineering watcher so i'm always
[03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:07.240]  looking up and we're getting like we got like summer thunderstorm clouds everybody here they're
[03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:13.160]  just like a lot of people are complacent the people around there i mean i went there i'm a health
[03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:20.120]  conscious person so i can like tell chemicals and five minutes headache stomach ache girlfriend got
[03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:25.880]  a rash the people in that area think it's okay they're just there it's not good it's not good
[03:22:25.880 --> 03:22:31.160]  there and uh just that chemical load the more toxins you take in it just gets worse and worse
[03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:36.920]  and worse but we just started getting rain so that fallout everywhere i have a pond i had a film on
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:43.400]  my pond um i'm checking the drainage ditches every day and taking pictures there's this weird like
[03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:51.560]  brown filmy bubbly stuff everywhere it's pretty wild but it's like it's widespread and who knows what
[03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:57.720]  that stuff is and they're just denying everything and i don't know you're saying the rain caused your
[03:22:57.720 --> 03:23:04.040]  pond to have a film on it too like the rain caused that yeah like it rained and then the
[03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:08.600]  wind blew in the morning and like pushed like the little film on the top all the one side
[03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:13.400]  i have videos of all this stuff i've been the drainage ditches around like it rains and then
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:17.960]  this area like the the water all goes to the drainage ditches so i've been going to the
[03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:23.720]  collection point and there's just like this foam and this it's just weird stuff but i've never seen
[03:23:23.720 --> 03:23:27.800]  and it's everywhere it's like it's stuff you would see next to like a pig farm or something
[03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:35.000]  but like it's everywhere you said you have these on you have this on video uh tons of them give me
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:40.840]  a what's the email or something i'll send you a bunch of them well every day and i'm 20 i'm 24 miles
[03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:46.200]  west and every day i look out my house and you just see like from east palestine and like when i
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:51.480]  drive to work i go to this high range and you can just see this just it's weird i don't know what it
[03:23:51.480 --> 03:23:58.520]  is but it's east palestine weird and then like at night you can go outside here and it was super bad
[03:23:58.520 --> 03:24:04.520]  like the few days after they blew it up and point a flashlight in the air at night and it looks like
[03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:10.600]  you're in the middle of a blizzard snowstorm with all this stuff who knows what it is just like
[03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:17.480]  particulate dust yeah but like a lot there's a little bit here and there and there's water
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:22.440]  vapors all this but i mean it's it's it's crazy to see but i i don't know i don't know if we
[03:24:22.440 --> 03:24:28.920]  gotta like move or what i'm gonna do i have a homestead here like a little mini farm who knows
[03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:35.800]  because like you want to eat that stuff many people are having the same concerns you are
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:42.680]  let me put you on hold and let's give jason an email to send that video to and we may have
[03:24:42.680 --> 03:24:46.760]  the writers write up a story they may be interested in writing a story about that uh so yeah we'll
[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:54.120]  gladly uh review that video that you that you have jason so guys put him on hold and we'll
[03:24:54.120 --> 03:25:01.880]  get him an email to send it to and then in the meantime we will go to craig let's go down to
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:11.800]  craig here in ohio as well craig you're on the air go ahead hey allen hi craig hey um i uh
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:22.280]  uh i'm uh west upstream upstream of the uh of the spill and i'm also west of the spill so i'm
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:26.920]  really not at any super risk but um last weekend i was down in Cincinnati with my daughters for
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:33.240]  soccer and you know we had to eat out we were crossing over the Ohio river right which is all
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:38.680]  downstream of this spill and so i thought well we're gonna have to eat out so i started looking at
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:42.680]  where the water came from and you know down in Cincinnati obviously it's coming right off the
[03:25:42.680 --> 03:25:48.680]  river and we were staying 30 minutes north so i started looking it up and i looked at the google
[03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:54.920]  you know and i started seeing that in Cincinnati it said um you know it didn't say anything about
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:59.560]  a risk of water being contaminated but when i looked at the city north where i knew it was safe
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:06.760]  it said clearly you know no risk of pollution from the water from the river so so you know it's
[03:26:06.760 --> 03:26:13.320]  just funny how everybody's covering themselves and protecting themselves you know i knew that
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:19.640]  but it's just funny to see it and then watch everybody cover their trail it this concerns me
[03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:26.440]  so much because you know we go back to covid and you know it was all over everywhere i mean it was
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:32.840]  non-stop 24 seven right the only way that that was a real risk is shoving people in the hospitals
[03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:37.320]  and injecting or killing them with remdesivir and stuff you know this is an actual real risk
[03:26:37.320 --> 03:26:42.840]  right and they make they make the common flu into covid 19 and they make it the biggest deal ever
[03:26:42.840 --> 03:26:47.880]  they hide the truth about it in a lab and then they don't talk about this true disaster in east
[03:26:47.880 --> 03:26:52.440]  palestine this ecological disaster health disaster humanitarian disaster they don't talk about that
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:56.440]  they build up covid and and you know why that is that's because they have a narrative they have an
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:27:01.960]  agenda i want to quickly make sure we at least get uh daniel a shot to talk here in this segment
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:06.200]  before we take a break daniel's a pilot who's in the air right now and wants to comment on what he's
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:12.680]  saying uh daniel you're on the alex joneshow go ahead oh and uh i apologize for the uh
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:18.280]  bad audio here i'll do my best uh my uh i applied for an aerial survey company and my boss lives
[03:27:18.280 --> 03:27:26.680]  about 40 miles to the east of uh of east palestine ohio and uh it's just one of the things that she
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:32.760]  has mentioned to me was she doesn't understand why all these people are are getting on radios and tv
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:37.240]  and stuff and talking like they know what's going on around there but they're not even getting the
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:43.160]  name of the camera right she said that the name of the town of these palestine has always been that
[03:27:43.160 --> 03:27:50.280]  way since she was a kid like 50 years ago and so i would the argument the other day you know if
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:55.560]  somebody was running around talking about chai cargo they've probably never been to chicago
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:28:01.320]  they've probably known nothing about chicago so anybody that wants to call in and act like they've
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:06.120]  got some kind of inside information about what's going on there at least get the name of the
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:14.120]  town right if you're claiming to be from there you know what i'm saying well i i'm gonna have to
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:19.800]  double check on that because the people i've talked to said it is palestine and and we have somebody
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:24.920]  on the crew who's from ohio who said it's palestine so i don't know i mean i i was told that was the
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:30.520]  right pronunciation you'd think palestine you'd think palestine but it's i've been told it's steen
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:35.000]  has there ever been a guy are daniel are you flying the plane right now
[03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:41.320]  calling it a different name now you know it's hold on no hold on are you flying right now are you

[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:55.880]  sort of a landmark occasion i mean how about this guy flying a plane called into a talk show

[03:34:00.200 --> 03:34:04.920]  all right we're gonna go back to the phone lines here we've still got people on the line from
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:13.080]  ohio that went away in on what's going on in east palestine 8777892539 if anybody else from
[03:34:13.080 --> 03:34:19.400]  the area wants to comment on the news that broke today on the alex joneshow with mike adams let's
[03:34:19.400 --> 03:34:27.400]  go to jonathan who is in cincinati another caller from cincinati talking about it uh
[03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:36.600]  jonathan go ahead are you doing good thanks for calling so i mean uh i remember when
[03:34:36.600 --> 03:34:46.120]  that first i came out and then i immediately emailed my local epa and then um see of me i'm
[03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:53.400]  about to go to the email she immediately said thanks for reaching out and then she sent me
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:59.080]  the press release that they sent everybody like i'm just a normal resident trying to get some
[03:34:59.080 --> 03:35:05.800]  information about water which should be available to everybody but um that was and i'm guessing
[03:35:05.800 --> 03:35:09.000]  the press release says nothing to worry about just like the last caller was saying
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:17.080]  yeah it said nothing to worry about everything's good um but what i'm really trying to call in
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:27.160]  about is being some people from my university are um putting together a fund to get some crates of
[03:35:27.160 --> 03:35:35.880]  water together so we can keep bringing that out to the people in east palestine but um i emailed
[03:35:35.880 --> 03:35:42.280]  a lot of people like toxic colleges at my university just to see if it's okay to go out
[03:35:42.280 --> 03:35:53.400]  or precautions to take and i got nothing also so looking for some well take your own water uh i would
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:36:00.360]  say for sure yeah um what are you at the university of cincinati or what university are you at yeah
[03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:07.560]  uh so pretty big university and are our students talking about it this is a topic that the students
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:14.600]  talk about i feel like when i go out i'm the only one early even like thinking about it
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:23.320]  man i remember that i remember that i remember that feeling it is it's actually it's eerie no
[03:36:23.320 --> 03:36:29.720]  it's actually eerie i i remember specifically one night um me and buddy my my buddy mine were
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:37.480]  out drinking at a bar and this is when crimea was being invaded and we were talking about it

[03:37:21.960 --> 03:37:27.560]  nope you don't get that as a human interest story huh that's crazy man it's eerie but that's
[03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:32.600]  part of this dystopian future we're in that's part of this twilight zone we're in like you're
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:36.520]  looking around at the fellow humans and it's like they don't even know they don't even care
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:44.360]  like uh okay i guess this is why bill gates and claus Schwab want to eliminate humanity i don't
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:50.840]  you know the issue too because i'm from cleveland and i know like you talked about the 15 minute

[03:38:29.800 --> 03:38:37.080]  uh i just wanted to say i've had a slight headache the base of my i'm uh what 18 miles northeast
[03:38:37.880 --> 03:38:44.600]  of uh east palestine and youngstown um i got a slight headache for uh a week and a half two weeks
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:50.520]  hasn't been anything too crazy but just listening to the callers like you know what
[03:38:50.520 --> 03:38:56.840]  they could have something to do with it probably nothing but also i wanted to say uh one of the
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:39:03.160]  local carpenters unions is uh donating time and resources uh to the efforts that he's in east
[03:39:03.160 --> 03:39:11.720]  palestine well what's wild is we're gonna have to find out all this information for ourselves
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:18.520]  we the people independent researchers investigators and we're gonna find incredible stuff and it's
[03:39:18.520 --> 03:39:23.720]  just gonna get ignored by the mainstream media it's gonna get ignored by the u.s government
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:29.560]  and covered up and then they'll report on it in five years and tell us that they're breaking
[03:39:29.560 --> 03:39:35.080]  the exclusive story oh yeah for sure just like they're doing with covet now out of a out of a
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:43.160]  chinese lab i mean do you know how laughable that is that's hilarious it makes me wonder why it makes
[03:39:43.160 --> 03:39:48.200]  me think something else is going on like this is the information war against china and biden's like
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:54.120]  oh or whoever you know biden's probably not even thinking oh you want to help russia you want to
[03:39:54.120 --> 03:39:59.160]  arm russia okay well why don't we tell the world that you made the virus it's like even china's
[03:39:59.160 --> 03:40:02.920]  probably like everybody already knows that you guys covered that up for us thank you
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:14.360]  oh you're not wrong i mean you really got to think five years ago uh we're we're all crazy
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:24.200]  anything that was declassified that we we want to bring up you know it's on paper it's on record
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:30.520]  you can prove it but it's conspiracy theory there was a story and and matt thank you for the call
[03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:36.040]  there was a story i think it was the new york times it was like masks didn't work or masks don't work
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:42.440]  what did we learn or what let lessons were learned i don't remember who but who published it
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:48.680]  it and it's just like nothing you if you're if you're you're the one that needs to learn the
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:55.320]  lesson and if you're asking the question then the answer is nothing the answer is you were wrong
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:02.120]  but not just about the masks about everything so no you haven't learned i don't know what it's
[03:41:02.120 --> 03:41:10.760]  going to take for you to learn but you'll never learn write about the wuhan lab write about the
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:16.680]  masks write about the vaccines what lessons were learned well you're the one that needs to learn
[03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:22.840]  lessons so if you have to ask you clearly haven't learned but it's like going to be the same thing
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:28.280]  here oh biden did a great job but they don't even claim they're not even claiming biden's doing a
[03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:33.000]  good job they're just acting like it's not a problem like oh everything's fine the water's
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:39.160]  fine the air's fine the land is fine nothing to see here and the fact that there was a a movie
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:44.040]  just released about the exact same scenario four months prior you know what's the big deal
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:52.200]  the fact that they ran a simulation with a thing called my id the week before what's the big deal
[03:41:53.560 --> 03:41:58.680]  the fact that the epa lowered the standards for what was considered to be a toxic amount of
[03:41:58.680 --> 03:42:05.720]  final chloride what's the big deal what's the big deal none of that means anything all right

[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:20.760]  all right guys do not laugh when i read this headline this is very serious stuff
[03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:27.880]  biden administration's secret weapon jill biden visits africa
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:35.080]  it's the biden administration's secret weapon is jill biden is it
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:42.280]  the secret weapon is jill biden wow well this just i thought that was mind blowing
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:49.080]  and then i saw a statement apparently jill biden made today so unreal i don't even believe it
[03:47:49.080 --> 03:47:54.920]  it and i'm thinking it has to be fake but it doesn't look fake i mean but there are a bunch
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:48:00.040]  of fakes out there now and so you just wonder but also joe biden says things like i like kids
[03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:04.760]  rubbing my legs down in the pool so you know that's real he said that so you never know what joe
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:13.480]  but a video of him talking about a nurse whispering sweet nothing's into his ear i'm not kidding
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:19.880]  this this is joe biden this is the democrat president by the way
[03:48:23.080 --> 03:48:28.200]  what's the difference between andrew yang and maryan williamson and bernie sanders
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:34.440]  is that when andrew yang realized that the democrat party process and primary was rigged
[03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:43.720]  he left and started his own party maryan williamson and bernie sanders either don't realize that or
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:49.560]  they don't really want to win i think that's the case with bernie i think he just wants to run
[03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:54.680]  make a million dollars buy a new lake house and then not be president and work for four years
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:49:00.920]  he's not a working guy he doesn't work much uh he's a bum and then there's maryan williamson
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:07.480]  with her crystals and orbs i kind of like maryan but she's complaining because her and bernie
[03:49:07.480 --> 03:49:11.640]  are getting left out of all the democrat party polls and they don't get invited to the democrat
[03:49:11.640 --> 03:49:16.680]  events and they don't get treated like a good democrat candidate should and yeah you don't say
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:21.560]  you don't say yeah the democrat party is totally rigged and corrupt and they don't want you in
[03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:27.240]  there yeah i thought you already figured that out no you didn't so she's upset she's not getting
[03:49:27.240 --> 03:49:37.240]  recognition now i want to play this video and we've got the pushback happening and this is
[03:49:37.240 --> 03:49:44.200]  what the left is not used to specifically the social justice group class type left
[03:49:46.280 --> 03:49:52.840]  they're used to just shoving their agenda down your throat and not getting any pushback
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.600]  specifically with the lgbtq stuff and so now that there's pushback they don't know what to do
[03:49:58.600 --> 03:50:02.360]  and now when they call you a homophobe and you don't care they don't know what to do
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:09.560]  and so there's a book that's now been written by the creator of libs of tiktok shia rychik
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:17.880]  libs of tiktok creator shia rychik who helped set off the moral panic that led to countless
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:23.160]  lgbtq people being falsely accused of grooming kids is publishing a book for children says media
[03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:32.120]  matters arie drennan i love this falsely accused of grooming kids oh you're right i can't sit here
[03:50:32.120 --> 03:50:39.880]  and play you an hour of video with grown men pretending to be women dancing around in lingerie
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:51.000]  accepting cash tips in their underwear a san francisco gay choir saying we're coming for your
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:57.880]  children i've attended the damn events where they have grown men in leotards and tutus dancing
[03:50:57.880 --> 03:51:03.000]  for kids and they bring the kids up to the front of the stage and they shake their junk for the
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:11.400]  kids yeah but falsely accusing says media matters arie drennan falsely accusing it's just it's just
[03:51:11.400 --> 03:51:17.000]  going on everywhere and they promote it as a good thing and then they say we're not doing that by the
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:24.120]  way drag queen storytime at noon in the library we're not doing that we're not grooming kids there's
[03:51:24.120 --> 03:51:29.080]  no evidence stop falsely accusing us by the way bring your three-year-old to drag queen storytime
[03:51:29.080 --> 03:51:37.400]  for kids in the library tonight mrs. mrs kitty litter is going to be there

[03:51:49.240 --> 03:51:55.560]  though and so now there's pushback in sydney where they put up all these billboards in public in
[03:51:55.560 --> 03:52:06.360]  downtown with men in gimp outfits and a teddy bear mask and they had this giant mural of rainbow wings
[03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:15.480]  ladies and gentlemen i kid you not in public rainbow wings made out of a assortment of male
[03:52:15.480 --> 03:52:22.280]  genitalia meant for you to go stand a kid to go stand and take a picture like its wings
[03:52:22.280 --> 03:52:27.640]  and then you've got a bunch of you got a bunch of dicks for kids
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:33.560]  and they're mad because this is the pushback they're finally getting the pushback that they
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:37.720]  never thought they'd get they thought they could call you a racist a homophobe a transphobe
[03:52:37.720 --> 03:52:45.080]  and then and then never get any pushback and so in sydney roll the roll the clip for me guys in
[03:52:45.080 --> 03:52:52.600]  sydney groups are now going out and painting over all of this propaganda including the penis wings
[03:52:53.560 --> 03:52:59.080]  i mean literally that's what they i just you can't even make this up and so they're going
[03:52:59.080 --> 03:53:05.480]  around this group is painting over it so that the kids don't get groomed by this propaganda
[03:53:06.040 --> 03:53:11.960]  there's your there's your teddy bear kink for kids your teddy bear gimp kink for kids
[03:53:11.960 --> 03:53:18.520]  and there they are painting over that so the children don't have to be propagandized
[03:53:19.880 --> 03:53:25.240]  and then there was a they leave signs that say leave the kids alone and then there was a church
[03:53:26.440 --> 03:53:32.280]  a catholic church that had the trans gay flag and painted their stairs in the rainbow flag
[03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:40.360]  because they love jesus they love jesus and so they came and they painted over the rainbow flag
[03:53:40.360 --> 03:53:45.640]  on the steps and so this is going to become the counterculture soon enough of course info wars
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:51.000]  with paul joseph watson conservatism is the counterculture uh we announced that that was like
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:56.440]  what is that like a decade ago and so now it's it's finally starting to catch up but they never
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:54:01.480]  expected this pushback and that's why they're they're going so crazy stop falsely accusing us of
[03:54:01.480 --> 03:54:10.920]  groomers by the way does your kid want to take a picture with the dick wings all right do we have

[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:46.760]  apparently talking about a nurse whispering sweet nothing's into his ear
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:53.960]  she'd come in and do things that i don't think you learn the medical school nursing school
[03:56:54.920 --> 03:56:59.000]  she'd whisper in my ear i couldn't understand him she'd whisper and she'd lean down
[03:56:59.800 --> 03:57:03.960]  he'd actually breathe on me to make sure that i was there was a connection the human connection
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:07.160]  she went home and brought back her pillow
[03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:14.520]  i hope that's fake but i don't think it is
