[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.180 --> 00:18.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.720 --> 00:41.240]  Texas Alex Jones well it's a showdown John Kerry gives Russia until Monday
[00:41.240 --> 00:48.120]  just two and a half days away to basically hand over all of their interest
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.760]  in eastern Ukraine or quote face serious repercussions I think Russia is
[00:53.760 --> 01:01.120]  already facing the repercussions of the West destabilizing their country and
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.040]  again it's not that I'm saying the Russian government's flawless or
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.480]  perfect in this but clearly the West is the aggressor the EU globalist combine
[01:09.480 --> 01:14.480]  is trying to start a major destabilizing regional war that could lead to
[01:14.480 --> 01:24.320]  something much larger now continuing here ladies and gentlemen Russian troops
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.720]  of course have been massing on the border with eastern Ukraine New York
[01:27.720 --> 01:32.120]  Times reported that yesterday Kremlin website today hit by powerful cyber
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.120]  attack we're gonna be breaking that down Russian government banned several
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.120]  websites critical of the government again war is the health of the state this
[01:40.120 --> 01:45.120]  is gonna let Putin submit power what's happening by the way and we'll reverse
[01:45.120 --> 01:52.120]  any freedom reforms that were actually taking place in Russia Bloomberg reports
[01:52.120 --> 01:55.920]  that Russia is preparing to invade east Ukraine Estonia says I mean these are
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.000]  just incredible headlines and they're not top news anywhere but info wars.com
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.680]  and Roger port.com and real media sites that actually care about not having
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.520]  World War 3 and again this is not even about Ukraine is run by something like
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.160]  North Korea and the Russians are involved so we're gonna attack them to
[02:15.160 --> 02:19.960]  liberate people in death camps no the globalists that run our country will
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.840]  put in authoritarian regimes in many cases they're overthrowing Ukraine
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.240]  because it was elected and because they didn't join the EU it's just amazing
[02:28.240 --> 02:34.240]  that we're just here on the eve of possible destruction surfing the
[02:34.240 --> 02:42.800]  apocalypse and I mean there's like a I don't know a 10% chance that we could
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.160]  have a hot war start I'm being very conservative there it could be much
[02:47.160 --> 02:49.680]  higher percentage and I told you I've had a lot of dread the last six months
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.440]  and it's been intensifying exponentially and there's a lot of reasons the
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.880]  economic meltdown the cultural decay evil being released on every level the
[02:59.880 --> 03:05.760]  hedge of protection falling from our Republic clearly the Russia situation
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.160]  the funding of al Qaeda publicly the fact that all this is public now that
[03:10.160 --> 03:13.800]  our government runs al Qaeda and is using the threat to take our rights the
[03:13.800 --> 03:17.080]  government spying on us all illegally and using it destroy their political
[03:17.080 --> 03:21.920]  opponents and shut down the press that there's just Ruth was looting going on
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.320]  everywhere government interests run most than
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.400]  narcotics trafficking laundered the money with the big banks and it's all
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.840]  come out but then none of it gets reversed it just gets worse and worse
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.320]  and worse and historically when governments don't get restrained and
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.400]  corporate interests don't get restrained you get a world war one a world war two
[03:40.400 --> 03:46.880]  you get a huge European continent war you get a Napoleonic war I mean it just
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.880]  follows a path and I hope we don't go down this path all the way but we've
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.520]  already gone down at about 80% and we're fast approaching all out war and then
[03:58.520 --> 04:01.600]  Homeland Security will be used to clamp down domestically and organize the U.S.
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.800]  into a giant paramilitary force for all the wars you'll have to get in line
[04:05.800 --> 04:10.280]  because America's losing a war on multiple fronts and they'll be able to
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.640]  then teach the kids how to wear dresses little boys and put them all on drugs
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.880]  and forced inoculations and forced abortion and eugenics because that'll
[04:18.880 --> 04:22.320]  all be on the back burner now politically you know we got to do what
[04:22.320 --> 04:28.560]  we're told of Lord Obama with the big war going with Russia and Russia is
[04:28.560 --> 04:33.280]  going to use this to clamp down and seize power not like Putin needed to to
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.520]  begin with it's just a bad situation and that's putting it lightly obviously I
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.280]  don't have words at this point to describe how serious this is well we're
[04:41.280 --> 04:44.440]  busy worried about the Malaysian flight but some new developments on that will
[04:44.440 --> 04:52.120]  give you we are literally on the edge of thermal nuclear war anyway you look at
[04:52.120 --> 04:59.920]  it and I'm sorry that's more important than Justin Bieber or cayenne west hi

[08:22.920 --> 08:34.480]  resistance it's alex jones well we have got a jam-packed transmission lined up
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.000]  today to say the least quite frankly I should just cancel both the guests that
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.600]  are coming up today but I'm not going to do it because both of the topics they're
[08:41.600 --> 08:45.720]  gonna be covering are so incredibly important but the situation with Russia
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.280]  has deteriorated so fast and is going the worst possible direction it could go
[08:52.280 --> 08:58.040]  and exactly the way we thought it probably would go but hoped it wouldn't
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.800]  that we should all be at prayer vigils we should all be getting right with God
[09:03.800 --> 09:10.680]  people should be freaking out right now because John Kerry has said and NATO has
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.800]  said and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman has said Dempsey that the
[09:14.800 --> 09:19.280]  United States with NATO is preparing military action not just massive
[09:19.280 --> 09:25.360]  sanctions against Russia by Monday if Vladimir Putin does not hand over
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.680]  Crimea and the gas pipelines at the Russian zone and their bases basically
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.880]  to the EU for full looting and it's two different global mafia is fighting over
[09:36.880 --> 09:41.800]  control of that plum the bread basket and the gas basket where they bring most
[09:41.800 --> 09:46.000]  the gas to Europe out of Gazprom the problem is it's Russia's backdoor
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.400]  Crimea used to be part of Russia and the West started this so it's kind of like
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.920]  Stalin was bad but Hitler attacked Russia so he's known as the bad guy but
[09:57.920 --> 10:04.760]  Putin is no Stalin he's certainly becoming crazed and expelling Western
[10:04.760 --> 10:08.960]  executives who he believes are operatives for things like jaywalking and
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.240]  speeding any excuse they've got because you mean that quite frankly they know
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.320]  they're operatives a lot of them that's in Bloomberg
[10:17.920 --> 10:25.720]  look at this I now get amber alerts on the company phone I have two company
[10:25.720 --> 10:31.160]  reporter phones in here this is the new world order we get Obama alerts on these
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.640]  as well where the state's gonna be taking over TV radio you name it even
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.880]  with video feeds of El Presidente even when the audio was turned off on these
[10:40.880 --> 10:47.680]  it it it overwrote it that's that's all the backdoors and everything folks great
[10:47.680 --> 10:51.720]  example right there I've got two reporter phones right here that I've been
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.360]  reviewing footage of when the footage you're curry shot at the Super Bowl stuff
[10:56.360 --> 11:05.000]  like that where was I going back you know their alerts going off in there I mean
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.040]  this is just total government control and at first it's amber alerts about
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.320]  floods or missing kids and then it's reporting legal guns or report this
[11:13.320 --> 11:19.320]  alleged terrorist Alex Jones who's on the run and your your alert went off as
[11:19.320 --> 11:25.880]  well in there yeah there you go it's temple Texas Amber Alert that's 90 miles
[11:25.880 --> 11:34.920]  away a 2007 maroon Mazda six today and here come get your phone thanks thanks
[11:34.920 --> 11:38.800]  and then coming out they're gonna have all the license plates federally
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.320]  controlled that are gonna be digital little TVs and you'll pay for that with
[11:43.320 --> 11:46.480]  your taxes and then it's gonna be giving you constant brainwashing messages
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.240]  constant tattletell messages I mean this is a hellish system that's being built
[11:51.240 --> 11:55.120]  because we're letting technocrats use our money use our ingenuity use our
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.720]  taxes to build a hellish nightmare that's why the sky's the limit because
[11:59.720 --> 12:05.600]  they're just totally going for broke the public is just now figuring out that
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.560]  everything is being totally criminally surveilled to socially engineer
[12:09.560 --> 12:18.400]  society and to give select inside corporate data to the insiders to be
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.760]  able to corner every market and and Snowden has now come out with that you
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.280]  know you heard it here 16 17 years ago and you know now the documents have been
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.520]  released of course they're using spy data to corner markets of course they're
[12:29.520 --> 12:32.720]  using spy data on the Senate in the house of course different intelligence
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.000]  agencies are spying on each other of course they're using it to steal patents
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.800]  and technologies and give them to select corporations of course it's used
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.680]  to wreck the free market and that's why it's a crime to spy on someone
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.320]  illegally you got to have a warrant with an oath or affirmation and the person
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.400]  place papers and effects to be seized and the oath or affirmation of why
[12:57.400 --> 13:03.840]  that's happening I saw dead bodies in a trunk in John Doe's basement when I was
[13:03.840 --> 13:12.280]  there fixing the pipes on April 14th and I have sworn this and I can be a
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.760]  confronted in court they got rid of the right of facing your accuser with
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.000]  confidential informants folks who go around lying and setting people up
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  professional wires professional snitches who will say anything the system
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.320]  wants you notice the media and the system always demonizes defense lawyers it's
[13:34.320 --> 13:37.080]  really the defense lawyers that are holding back the total onslaught of
[13:37.080 --> 13:42.920]  evil takeover I mean these prosecutors in many areas and the federal
[13:42.920 --> 13:50.160]  prosecutors are absolute flaming crux do they go after the trillions being
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.440]  wanted to the big banks every decade do they go after the white slavery grids do
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.520]  they go after any of the real stuff Dincor the answer is no but if you are
[14:00.520 --> 14:03.680]  selling marijuana out of your house they're gonna SWAT team raid you kill
[14:03.680 --> 14:08.360]  your dog the SWAT team's gonna beat you up and say shouldn't be a doper and I
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.760]  was on this website I sent it to Watson I forget the name the other night
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.400]  watching SWAT team raid videos that they shot and like half the time they come
[14:17.400 --> 14:23.360]  in the house the people are all asleep don't resist a fat basset howl runs out
[14:23.360 --> 14:26.880]  and they shoot it and squealing and they've got night vision cameras and
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.120]  it's bloods everywhere and then they beat up the dad everything they go look
[14:30.120 --> 14:35.640]  and it's like a you know half pound of marijuana look at this you doper you're
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.520]  going to jail I mean it's just what a joke well the government brings in the
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.520]  hard narcotics on record and they push psychotropics and and Fetimans and
[14:44.520 --> 14:48.560]  Adderall and the kids and then GMO and add deadly chemicals to the water over
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.240]  200 plus chemicals on average are added to the water in the so-called fluoride
[14:52.240 --> 14:57.680]  mix lead mercury arsenic brinyard reagents heavy metals of every smattering
[14:57.680 --> 15:03.080]  total brain damage massive cancer total psychotake over tens of thousands of
[15:03.080 --> 15:06.800]  declassified government projects some cases thousands of people killed per
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.560]  project radiating foster children injecting aids and foster children
[15:11.560 --> 15:16.080]  Bayer injecting people with HIV I mean just on and on just mass murder
[15:16.080 --> 15:26.320]  forced sterilization ongoing currently just total psycho-evil and now they
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.480]  want to start war with Russia it's just funny that you know Napoleon finally
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.880]  was taking over everything so he tacked the Russians Hitler did the same thing
[15:35.880 --> 15:44.280]  and now the New World Order is going to do it just never ends absolutely never
[15:44.280 --> 15:52.120]  ends ladies and gentlemen never ends and if you go out try to talk to the
[15:52.120 --> 15:55.960]  average person about it they just go what are you for Putin I say nuke him
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.120]  well the only problem is it's not like Iraqis or somebody that don't have
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.000]  anything to fight back with and and any other the United States run by the
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.160]  globalist probably has double the nukes that are deliverable in reality and a
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.320]  lot of high-tech weapons but it's not gonna matter a lot of those Russian
[16:12.320 --> 16:17.720]  nukes are gonna make it here and the cruise missiles are gonna make it and
[16:17.720 --> 16:24.920]  they're gonna nuke Western Europe and you know where's that gonna be for all
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.640]  you trendies I mean that's gonna kind of mess up your plan to make all the
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.820]  little boys wear dresses isn't it I mean a few people are out of control the
[16:33.820 --> 16:37.240]  polian Bonaparte was a lot smarter than you are Adolf Hitler was smarter than
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.440]  you are and and and look what happened to them I mean you just really need to
[16:42.440 --> 16:48.840]  back off right now and not start World War 3 I mean John Kerry looks like I was
[16:48.840 --> 16:52.800]  on a Knoxville one of our affiliates in the talk show some of those guys on his
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.320]  guests sometime they made the point that he looks like the Eastern Island
[16:56.320 --> 17:02.680]  statues Kerry I've always described him like lurch or something from the Adams
[17:02.680 --> 17:05.760]  family there's so much Botox but why get into what he personally looks like
[17:05.760 --> 17:15.520]  he's a skull and bones occultist who thinks he's invincible on a power trip
[17:15.520 --> 17:22.440]  and he publicly tried to launch a war with al-Qaeda with the U.S. and its
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.960]  Air Force the military said no five six months ago and that was all about a
[17:26.960 --> 17:32.920]  proxy war with Russia and now they are launching a big attack in Ukraine and
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.500]  again it doesn't mean the Russians are perfect doesn't mean they're good the
[17:36.500 --> 17:42.960]  West is starting this folks it's dangerous it's bad it's not good and I
[17:42.960 --> 17:49.200]  know that's a simple way of putting it I mean it's outrageously dangerous it's
[17:49.200 --> 17:58.680]  over-the-top insane there are no words to describe how bad this is and we're
[17:58.680 --> 18:13.440]  just so used to being comfortable we are so accustomed to just getting away with
[18:13.440 --> 18:16.320]  everything and everything's comfortable everything's nice because we've been
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.480]  living off the liberty and freedom and due process that our ancestors fought
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.480]  for but the banks empty now and the chickens are coming home to roost and
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.800]  you know I got articles here were Zuckerberg phones Obama to blast him
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.800]  about NSA we have the New York Post PR pieces the Facebook is the NSA on record
[18:35.800 --> 18:41.340]  so that's PR and George Soros comes out and says we better not have sanctions on
[18:41.340 --> 18:46.200]  Russia we better de-escalate this because he doesn't want his name on this big war
[18:46.200 --> 18:50.760]  that's about to start while he's in the middle of it because he realizes that
[18:50.760 --> 18:54.600]  once he starts a war flat out what she's doing with Russia that you know your
[18:54.600 --> 18:59.640]  names on this boy your names on this you think you're gonna get away with this
[18:59.640 --> 19:03.160]  well he tried to shut down the first amendment second woman here you think
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.480]  you're gonna just you're not you're not gonna get away with this Soros in the
[19:07.480 --> 19:12.080]  French news agency saying this here it is it's very important to respond and
[19:12.080 --> 19:15.600]  respond the right way which is not necessarily to impose sanctions on Russia
[19:15.600 --> 19:19.440]  but to actually help Ukraine financially that means come in and loot them and also
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.040]  technical assistance something like European Marshall plan for Ukraine
[19:23.040 --> 19:29.440]  yeah OECD that would be the right response he's like let's be friendly to
[19:29.440 --> 19:35.240]  Russia yeah let's come in build them up militarily financially loot them don't
[19:35.240 --> 19:40.520]  run we are your friends Russia and then they just spin all that of course you
[19:40.520 --> 19:47.600]  know Soros has got access to SideR there in Maryland but you don't have access
[19:47.600 --> 19:52.720]  to SideR or to Cheyenne Mountain or to any of the other deep cover bases those

[24:21.360 --> 24:26.560]  public it is a mutated form of culture a predatory system where the
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.000]  establishment set themselves up like the Moorlach and we the Eloy of H.G. Wells
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.720]  time machine which is an allegory in his own words of how the world system
[24:34.720 --> 24:40.600]  actually works he was a top Fabian socialist and bioethicist eugenicists
[24:40.600 --> 24:47.600]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen or simply put an adherent of this system

[25:37.840 --> 25:42.760]  to ban cars I spent kid Daniels one of our great reporters out to ask hey if
[25:42.760 --> 25:46.800]  people want to ban guns when somebody kills a bunch of folks with guns people
[25:46.800 --> 25:51.160]  use cars just as much for mass murder if there's more people that use cars every
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.080]  year to run over folks it's over 200 it's 160 something that died mass shootings
[25:56.080 --> 25:59.520]  every year most of them gang related so should we ban cars and I thought they
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.040]  would go no no don't blame the inanimate object blame the driver but a bunch of
[26:04.040 --> 26:10.080]  them said no ban cars so England is moving to make you get a license to have
[26:10.080 --> 26:13.680]  a butcher knife because they have the stabbings are up 10 full the last 15
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.200]  years since they banned guns you can look that up in the BBC they're very proud
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.080]  of it with straight face they say ban butcher knives unless you're a registered
[26:22.080 --> 26:28.960]  chef because they are deadly weapon it is the butcher knives fault so there you
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.800]  go ban the cars ladies and gentlemen they certainly live in La La Land don't
[26:33.800 --> 26:42.040]  they and we're also going to get into a bunch of really important news but you
[26:42.040 --> 26:46.160]  know I mentioned this and I'm just gonna finish up with this now and then get
[26:46.160 --> 26:51.120]  into all the other news John Kerry on the heels of the chairman of the joint
[26:51.120 --> 26:54.200]  chiefs of staff Dempsey saying they're prepared for military action anytime
[26:54.200 --> 26:57.640]  they're ordered to do so Ukrainian government is mashing their 1 million
[26:57.640 --> 27:03.720]  man reserve army near the Crimean border the Russians are mashing hundreds of
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.360]  thousand troops and weapons systems armored vehicles helicopters you name it
[27:07.360 --> 27:14.600]  I guess to repel that attack Russia has until Monday to reserve and reverse
[27:14.600 --> 27:21.120]  course on Ukraine Terry says and don't forget that in 2008 on the start of the
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.640]  Olympics when they thought Russia wouldn't respond they launched attacks
[27:25.640 --> 27:30.040]  in South Ossetia and Abkhazia both similar to Crimea being zones along the
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.000]  Russian border and they actually attacked Russian military bases and killed
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.040]  the people in the barracks and then started putting NATO troops on the
[27:39.040 --> 27:47.000]  ground Russia rolled medium-range mobile nukes in that can't be easily targeted
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.560]  by cruise missiles because they move every 10 minutes and then retarget move
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.800]  10 minutes retarget move 10 minutes retarget move 10 minutes retarget you
[27:56.800 --> 28:00.400]  know the big missile trucks and they were targeting Western Europe by the way
[28:00.400 --> 28:07.720]  NATO bases and the West backed off but they're doing it again just to see you
[28:07.720 --> 28:11.200]  know we just poke the grizzly bear just see what it does and now they've got a

[28:21.320 --> 28:25.960]  army's public manuals it's total high treason it's had the byproduct effect
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.560]  of the blowback effect that the military is totally waking up because they are
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.600]  being trained to take our guns and they're they're freaking out because
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.120]  they're good patriots on average the most patriotic most awake people are US

[28:52.400 --> 28:56.560]  pull but they're going to fall on their face the problem is it may turn the
[28:56.560 --> 29:03.800]  surface of the earth into molten slag so it won't matter but the military is
[29:03.800 --> 29:08.800]  freaking out folks because they're training to take on the tea party and

[29:25.560 --> 29:30.520]  that's the new mission you know what they did in the Army times when that first
[29:30.520 --> 29:33.940]  was published four years ago they went and pulled the Colonel's quote that we
[29:33.940 --> 29:41.560]  have the page saved yes they're training for treason and you know all the
[29:41.560 --> 29:46.960]  commies are is that run things think it's cool but the military is waking up

[35:06.520 --> 35:22.200]  crack oh now you feel it there's no turning back 1776 worldwide 1775 worldwide
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.640]  all right ladies and gentlemen again thank you for joining us here's the
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.960]  bottom line the Russians are expelling Western executives who are obviously
[35:30.960 --> 35:36.320]  part of infraguard and our FBI operatives FBI has a giant foreign
[35:36.320 --> 35:41.480]  intelligence service they'd rather folks not know about and then the CIA is not
[35:41.480 --> 35:45.840]  supposed to operate domestically but of course they do and they're all just
[35:45.840 --> 35:48.640]  running around power grabbing over there and the Russians are kicking them all
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.320]  out the Russians are massing troops and the Russians are probably end up taking
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.640]  half of Ukraine now there could be a deep double cross where they've made a
[35:55.640 --> 35:59.840]  deal with Obama to divide the country in half and act like there's a war going on
[35:59.840 --> 36:09.040]  that's very immoral and that may be the saber-rattling that's going on but you
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.840]  wouldn't see all of these sanctions and the type of nastiness going on if that
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.680]  was the case so I think that's in the cards that if the West can't get what
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.720]  they want they may go with that or they may be trying to tell Putin to do that
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.680]  but he thinks it's a setup I think it's very fluid because what they do is his
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.320]  Kissinger has read a lot of his books they create the chaos and then try to
[36:33.320 --> 36:42.280]  gauge like pool they break the balls on the first on the first go and then kind
[36:42.280 --> 36:48.600]  of look at the angles and so they've kind of cued the balls up you know racked
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.880]  them broken the rack and now they're looking at how they want to cut this
[36:53.880 --> 36:57.760]  diamond basically and both sides are doing that the problem is the Russians
[36:57.760 --> 37:03.120]  may be corrupt medieval in ways but they're smart and so they've already
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.520]  thought of every angle just like the globalist have and that's why it
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.760]  doesn't work out because the Russians will fight folks I mean again if the
[37:10.760 --> 37:18.920]  globalist can't beat the Afghanis they can't hold Baghdad because the Iraqis
[37:18.920 --> 37:22.720]  are willing to fight and of course the globalist don't care because they just
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.640]  want to be there and make money off the no-bid contracts the only reason the
[37:25.640 --> 37:28.880]  globalist can win an unwinnable war is because they don't want to win a war
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.480]  they want a bunch of chaos see so they really have won the drug war more drugs
[37:33.480 --> 37:36.280]  on the streets more people in prison more money being laundered it's not a
[37:36.280 --> 37:39.720]  failure it's a success they've won the war on a literacy dumbing people down
[37:39.720 --> 37:43.160]  they've won the war in Afghanistan they won the war in Iraq destabilizing the
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.000]  country turning the western side of it over al-qaeda putting burkas on the
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.440]  women kicking them out of college getting rid of you know western music on
[37:50.440 --> 37:52.840]  the radio
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.440]  understand the globalist want want stone-age chaos everywhere but in their
[37:58.440 --> 38:05.040]  reservations their command bases they is fighting fish fascinating creatures
[38:05.040 --> 38:12.160]  brave but dumb the whole stupid yes they're stupid except for the occasional
[38:12.160 --> 38:21.320]  one such as we have here let's the other two fight he waits
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.920]  wait until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself and then
[38:30.920 --> 38:39.200]  like specter he strikes I find the parallel music our organization did
[38:39.200 --> 38:43.600]  not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement number
[38:43.600 --> 38:51.880]  three come in cronstein sit down number three while we listen to what number
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.640]  five is devised for us I hope cronstein's efforts as director of planning will
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.840]  continue to be a successful as is just literally or sorrows literally your
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.940]  instructions I've planned for specter to steal from the Russians their new
[39:05.940 --> 39:10.560]  lecture decoding machine 15 top-notch the services of a female member of the
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.200]  Russian cryptograph section in Turkey and the hell that's who we're up against
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.840]  like service naturally neither the Russians nor the British will be aware
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.840]  that they are now working for us number three is your section ready to carry out
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.200]  cronstein's directives yes number one the operation will be organized according
[39:28.200 --> 39:31.960]  to cronstein's plan I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.840]  consulate in Istanbul she's capable cooperative and how loyal to the state
[39:36.840 --> 39:41.280]  is beyond question and you're absolutely sure she believes you're still head of
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.400]  operations for Soviet intelligence it is most unlikely she would know I'm now
[39:45.400 --> 39:49.720]  working for specter Moscow has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few
[39:49.720 --> 39:55.520]  members of the presidium for your sake I hope so cronstein you're sure this plan
[39:55.520 --> 40:01.640]  is foolproof yes it is because I have anticipated every possible variation of
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.840]  counter move but what makes you think that M the head of British
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.180]  intelligence will oblige you by falling in with your plan for the simple reason
[40:10.180 --> 40:14.920]  that this is so obviously a trap my reading of the British mentality is that
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.600]  they always treat a trap as a challenge and in the case they couldn't possibly
[40:18.600 --> 40:21.960]  pass up even the slightest chance of getting their hands on the lecture
[40:21.960 --> 40:28.160]  decoder they have wanted one for years mm-hmm all that you say could be true
[40:28.160 --> 40:32.200]  what else as an audit refinement I think that specter will probably have the
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.120]  chance of a person revenge for the killing of our operative a doctor no
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.240]  because the man the British will almost certainly use on a mission of this sort
[40:40.240 --> 40:46.920]  would be their agent James Bond let his death be a particularly unpleasant
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.680]  humiliating one good I should put my plan in cooperation straight away and
[40:52.680 --> 41:00.120]  there will be no failure and that's exactly what's going on literally the
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.760]  globalist playing the Russians and the United States off against each other and
[41:04.760 --> 41:11.560]  there's a big fight in Afghanistan over the 500 billion a year in opium it was
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.760]  only 50 something billion a year before the liberation now it's up to 500
[41:16.760 --> 41:22.960]  billion look those numbers up 93% of world opium production turned into loving
[41:22.960 --> 41:29.000]  heroin for your daughter's veins loaded on C-130s and flown into Europe in the
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.440]  United States
[41:32.880 --> 41:37.200]  publicly and then the police pull you over and want to ask if you have any
[41:37.200 --> 41:41.600]  drugs in the vehicle as you're driving your children to school where they'll
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.920]  be propagandized every week about all the different serotonin reuptake
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.120]  inhibitors and infetamin drugs they need to take the government cares about
[41:51.120 --> 41:57.040]  everyone it's run by good people who want to help us know the government's run
[41:57.040 --> 42:03.280]  by the Bilderberg group the government's run by George Soros literally run by
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.200]  specter by the way you know specter is basically real you know he and Fleming
[42:09.200 --> 42:16.320]  was in MI6 OSS and wrote all those books and he was a spy chief you know
[42:16.320 --> 42:19.600]  they're just fronting it all in your face when you go see movies like the
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.320]  latest born supremacy film that's actually real that viral research that's
[42:24.320 --> 42:30.520]  on record real that's 20 years old real they just flaunted all in your face it's
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.680]  all public they're geoengineering the atmosphere they admit they're doing it
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.160]  but the details are classified it's a giant gotta be a hundred billion dollar
[42:39.160 --> 42:42.640]  program a year what we know about five billion Department of Energy I mean who
[42:42.640 --> 42:47.200]  knows what these nutcases are up to all I know is it's going on we better find
[42:47.200 --> 42:50.520]  out exactly what's happening and we don't have time to sit here and debate
[42:50.520 --> 42:59.760]  this anymore and they've got a plan during a foreign war to get us all lined
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.200]  up behind the executive to stage attacks and say domestic groups in the
[43:04.200 --> 43:08.000]  tea party have joined with foreign powers and they're think the military is
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.440]  dumb enough to actually go up against the gun owners in a civil war while the
[43:14.440 --> 43:19.720]  communists is Zars and Neural Order minions working for the banks sit in
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.840]  their armored fortresses and watch us kill each other and you know what we
[43:23.840 --> 43:31.160]  may be dumb enough to do it I don't know I mean it's just so frustrating to know
[43:31.160 --> 43:34.520]  how it all works to understand basically every angle of it and and just
[43:34.520 --> 43:40.680]  sit here and watch it happen the good news is the Pentagon was it already five
[43:40.680 --> 43:45.960]  six months ago said no about the Syria escalation and the open public
[43:45.960 --> 43:51.280]  arming of Al Qaeda because the military knows about Benghazi now they were all
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.760]  watching on drone feeds and hundreds saw it folks thousands were told about it
[43:55.760 --> 44:00.280]  and people don't care anymore in the military they're not scared of getting
[44:00.280 --> 44:06.680]  arrested or disappeared they picked Bradley Manning to blame because they
[44:06.680 --> 44:11.320]  knew they could talk about him being a transgender and just credit anybody that
[44:11.320 --> 44:16.000]  was a whistleblower to scare everyone in the military from leaking information
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.120]  but you can't stop the enlisted and non-commissioned officers when they're
[44:20.120 --> 44:23.800]  being given manuals demonizing the tea party and gun owners and veterans who
[44:23.800 --> 44:31.480]  are their daddy and their mommy at home it's over you traders have been
[44:31.480 --> 44:35.840]  identified you think we were just gonna sit here the Patriot movement while you
[44:35.840 --> 44:39.480]  built this tyranny over the last 50 years we've been holding you back we've
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.800]  been exposing you we've been laying your program out people warned me and I
[44:43.800 --> 44:50.140]  activated as an organic Texan against the enemy and others are activating we
[44:50.140 --> 44:52.960]  don't need to be part of an organization a group or have any formal
[44:52.960 --> 44:56.280]  training we got guts we got resistance we've been trained in the streets
[44:56.280 --> 45:02.960]  fighting you 19 years on the air up against the enemy and now I'm not a
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.640]  learner I'm a master but becoming a master I know how little I do know but
[45:08.640 --> 45:13.080]  compared to the general public oh it's unbelievable compared to the average
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.040]  even commissioned officer they don't understand what's happened they've got
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.640]  pieces they're smart up they're smart but they don't have it
[45:21.640 --> 45:26.600]  decompartmentalized and the magic of this broadcast and the importance of
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.160]  this transmission is we are decompartmentalizing in front of everyone
[45:31.160 --> 45:36.440]  the entire system the enemy's been very sloppy because all their pieces are
[45:36.440 --> 45:40.640]  right there and they even have master documents that Brzezinski and others have
[45:40.640 --> 45:44.280]  written describing how the pieces go together so that they can communicate
[45:44.280 --> 45:48.840]  with high-level State Department CIA defense intelligence and DARPA groups
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.840]  because even their top people that have gone to MIT and Harvard bought the
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.320]  lower-level brainwashing of the system and still believe the system's good and
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.080]  don't understand three and fourth dimensional warfare and don't understand
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.360]  full-spectrum globalist dominance and a war against humanity and the eugenics
[46:06.360 --> 46:11.840]  program so they have to be given books that were secret like tragedy and hope
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.600]  that the plates leaked and they try to quickly tried to stop the publication
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.400]  later but they didn't and we've got folks that republished it and we sell it at
[46:20.400 --> 46:28.440]  info wars store.com 1100 pages detailing their entire plan and it gets worse
[46:28.440 --> 46:34.200]  than that hey guys give me a favor and get me a pair of pliers it's not a big
[46:34.200 --> 46:37.880]  deal but the earpiece just came off in my ear and it was feeling weird this
[46:37.880 --> 46:41.480]  morning it was halfway on there and it's about to slip completely into my ear and
[46:41.480 --> 46:44.560]  I just want to get it out right now you can go ahead and do it on camera this
[46:44.560 --> 46:48.400]  will be interesting for all viewers just just just just bring me pliers small
[46:48.400 --> 46:52.960]  needle nose pliers don't have a lot of time to go I'm not mad or anything it's
[46:52.960 --> 46:56.040]  not your fault I just feel it slipping deeper in my ear right now I want to
[46:56.040 --> 46:59.560]  stick the pliers in my ear and get it out right now and that's why I want those
[46:59.560 --> 47:03.160]  fancy earpieces that are contiguous not with these ends I've been wanting those
[47:03.160 --> 47:07.400]  for a couple years I think we even have them in the boxes in there in fact after
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.120]  today I'm not gonna have this earpiece anymore that's a directive if I come in
[47:11.120 --> 47:14.520]  here tomorrow and I'm just saying this now because I can't live like this I may
[47:14.520 --> 47:17.120]  have to go off air then if you guys can't give me any notes it's not a big deal
[47:17.120 --> 47:19.720]  it's just that you know I got the earpiece in my ear I need needle nose
[47:19.720 --> 47:27.920]  right now okay anyways long story short folks this is a serious situation that
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.360]  we're dealing with and and we have to admit that the globalists are doing
[47:32.360 --> 47:40.800]  this we have to look at their programs look at their plans and we have to
[47:40.800 --> 47:50.960]  stop being so naive about all this really needle nose but try to get this out
[47:50.960 --> 47:58.720]  here I'm gonna do this myself can one of you come in here and stick these in my
[47:58.720 --> 48:02.160]  ear and get the damn thing out I mean you know it's not a big deal I just

[48:06.200 --> 48:09.840]  we got them in there I don't understand it we got piles of equipment to the
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.000]  freaking ceiling around here and you say just grab it's no big deal I've had
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.240]  one go all the way in before and I think you know just go to rebroadcast all do
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.520]  it let me let me have the damn things
[48:23.520 --> 48:41.400]  aries armor a california gun parts manufacturer has filed a temporary
[48:41.400 --> 48:46.480]  restraining order against the Bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.480]  for fears the federal agency could soon bust down its doors what the hf as
[48:51.480 --> 48:55.560]  determined time and time again is that there is five operations on the air
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.600]  15 receivers that need to be left undone that still need to be moved by the
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.360]  customer in order for it to be considered not to be a firearm here's the
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.680]  problem a manufacturer has made one in plastic with different material and
[49:07.680 --> 49:11.560]  colors this is plastic this is metal which show the person building it
[49:11.560 --> 49:16.120]  exactly where to drill aries armor says the ATF is threatening to shut them
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.640]  down if they don't hand over some 5,000 names of people customers show that to
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.480]  everyone who says registration doesn't lead to confiscation the ATF demanding
[49:26.480 --> 49:31.480]  customer records of a product they don't approve of we already see magazines
[49:31.480 --> 49:36.240]  being banned in parts of California and Connecticut and guns banned in New York
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.560]  based on cosmetic features and on the other side of the ranch the ATF ran
[49:41.560 --> 49:46.480]  guns into Mexico under operation fast and furious a fact that the attorney
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.400]  general Eric Holder purged himself about attorney general Eric Holder was sent
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.880]  briefings on the controversial fast and furious operation as far back as July
[49:55.880 --> 50:00.720]  2010 that directly contradicts his statement to Congress listen to what
[50:00.720 --> 50:04.920]  Holder told a judiciary committee hearing on May 3rd this year I'm not
[50:04.920 --> 50:07.960]  sure the exact date but I probably heard about fast and furious for the first
[50:07.960 --> 50:11.800]  time over the last few weeks yet internal justice department documents show
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.160]  that at least 10 months before that hearing Holder began receiving frequent

[53:59.960 --> 54:05.840]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[54:05.840 --> 54:13.320]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.240]  we're here in the Red River district of downtown Austin Texas where last night a
[54:20.240 --> 54:24.200]  suspected drunk driver crashed through a barricade killing two people and
[54:24.200 --> 54:27.840]  injuring 23 others now we're gonna ask some of the locals as well as the out of
[54:27.840 --> 54:32.280]  towners if we should consider banning cars just like how gun control advocates
[54:32.280 --> 54:36.280]  are always demanding that we ban guns after a shooting so do you hear about
[54:36.280 --> 54:41.400]  what happened last night with the so what's your what do you think about it
[54:41.400 --> 54:45.520]  drunk people suck I think those kinds of things happen when you have a bunch of
[54:45.520 --> 54:48.880]  drunk people all together in one place I hate to say it is almost like
[54:48.880 --> 54:54.000]  terrific like what happened last night is is bad yeah I don't know I guess there
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.120]  was an accident I think that uh people are idiots considering that the driver
[54:59.120 --> 55:03.800]  drove a car and killed people using a car you think we should have a ban on
[55:03.800 --> 55:09.000]  cars probably I think so band cars for sure absolutely we should just ban
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.520]  everything and everything and pencils band knives hell band walking on the
[55:14.520 --> 55:17.640]  street because hey you can trip and fall and kill yourself I mean people are
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.160]  always saying we should ban guns after a shooting event so maybe we should just
[55:21.160 --> 55:31.200]  ban cars too right no but I I don't think we should have so many guns there
[55:31.200 --> 55:35.480]  should be I mean there are weapons in the right hands I mean just like a plane
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.520]  can be used as a weapon I do believe it's important to keep laws
[55:39.520 --> 55:45.360]  progressing towards reducing firearms and reducing cars and the use of cars I
[55:45.360 --> 55:51.000]  mean we should just stay in our bedrooms with mattresses strapped to us but for
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.600]  a straight jacket on you and maybe I could put pillows over my head they're
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.320]  not really comparable I mean you ban cars people can't get around you ban
[55:58.320 --> 56:04.880]  guns people can't I don't know be stupid and shoot each other I think guns are
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.760]  they're made to kill like you don't get a gun thinking oh I'm just gonna like you
[56:09.760 --> 56:13.080]  know play this guns are made to kill things and kill people and I think
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.160]  people should it should be harder for people to get guns I have a lot of guns
[56:16.160 --> 56:19.680]  myself but they never killed anybody I mean I'm not saying I think you're
[56:19.680 --> 56:24.240]  crazy but I think it should definitely be harder for people to obtain things
[56:24.240 --> 56:27.360]  that are made to kill people I know it was like a certain right that we were
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.400]  given in the beginning but I mean at the end of the day facts are facts the
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.800]  Constitution is what to going on 300 years old so I mean it was a whole
[56:35.800 --> 56:39.320]  different situation and now you know that the reason the founding final of
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.320]  others wrote the second amendment was based on ancient philosophers such as
[56:43.320 --> 56:51.440]  Cicero Livy and even Machiavelli who was known for giving advice to tyrants that
[56:51.440 --> 56:57.480]  they all wanted an armed population to defend against tyrants and not so much
[56:57.480 --> 57:03.480]  for hunting did you know that I did not know that now you know if we're using
[57:03.480 --> 57:06.960]  the guns to like fight against tyrants that would make more sense but seeing as
[57:06.960 --> 57:11.960]  we live in America I don't really feel like that's necessary anymore because
[57:11.960 --> 57:18.520]  you don't I don't actually you know because we're we don't really need guns
[57:18.520 --> 57:22.280]  I guess the people are just gonna get hurt it's like what's the point I do
[57:22.280 --> 57:26.160]  realize that majority of the murders that happen around the world have been
[57:26.160 --> 57:29.680]  committed by governments which has been termed democide what's your take on that
[57:29.680 --> 57:35.320]  well I don't believe in violence yeah we should ban pizza hey hey pizza yeah
[57:35.320 --> 57:39.880]  fat whatever that's my choice personal choice so you're saying that you're
[57:39.880 --> 57:45.120]  responsible and not the pizza correct yeah life choices so you'd say that the
[57:45.120 --> 57:51.360]  driver was responsible and not the car right hey it's an instrument so you
[57:51.360 --> 57:56.440]  would say the shooter is responsible not the gun correct yeah I would you believe
[57:56.440 --> 58:00.840]  in personal responsibility yeah I do now in the filming of this report I had to
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.440]  stay out of the way of multiple cars I almost got hit by a golf cart at one
[58:04.440 --> 58:08.240]  point yet we do not see Michael Bloomberg spending millions of dollars to
[58:08.240 --> 58:15.320]  find an anti-car movement this is Kit Daniels reporting for info wars calm so
[58:15.320 --> 58:20.600]  folks there is the report with Kit Daniels and I think it basically says
[58:20.600 --> 58:24.880]  it all that now we need to ban cars because it's the fault of the car that
[58:24.880 --> 58:29.920]  ran over a bunch of people and dozens got injured several died it's not the
[58:29.920 --> 58:34.840]  fault of the driver and that is the new system where we're all guilty for what
[58:34.840 --> 58:41.680]  other people do and in admin objects are guilty as well thank you for listening

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:13.080]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:21.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:32.680]  I have a real sense of urgency Alex Jones here we just joined us that's why I
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.840]  want to get everything done now I want to get out of the procrastination phase
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.120]  I've been in on every front I want to just really aggressively attack the
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.040]  globalist and that's why I've been a lot more serious on air a lot of days and
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.040]  and you know quite frankly angry because the establishment is trying to start
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.920]  World War 3 right now with the Russians and it's not America versus the
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.840]  Russians it's the globalist playing us all off against each other there's
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.440]  globalist operations in Russia there's globalist operations here they are the
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:09.040]  private central bankers that control the society because they control the
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.360]  issuance of currency and credit and they've been able to buy off most
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.360]  governments because they've had that unfair trade advantage to call an
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.440]  unfair trade advantage doesn't even give it justice it is it is a group of
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.960]  elites that are allowed to have money machines basically and so of course
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.680]  they're competing against real industry real jobs so they want to bring in
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.440]  regulations they're exempt from that make all other human activity restricted
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.760]  and controlled by them to make their fiat money absolute king because there's
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.800]  other forms of money there's barter there's ideas there's culture there's
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.680]  art there's so many things that that they don't control so it's not enough just
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.280]  have the money machine so they can buy it up they want to control it on every
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.000]  front and that's what they're doing that's what's happening that's what's
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.200]  unfolding now coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.680]  amazing second amendment developments ATF is rated a receiver manufacturer this
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.520]  has happened many times before has been proven in court to be a fraud they went
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.040]  out and got an injunction against the ATF we've also got a bunch of other
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:31.960]  reports here that we need to be breaking down dealing with the fact that there's
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.720]  been a landmark settlement reached in a case dealing with the police arresting
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.760]  folks in Baltimore that videotape the police this is a landmark case we're
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.320]  gonna be breaking it down big news on the front of Obamacare cash prizes for

[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:11.200]  that is coming up as well today we are also going to recap the huge
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.600]  developments with John Kerry and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.720]  saying they basically have prepared sanctions military actions nothing's
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.440]  off the table against the Russians it is unprecedented threatening Russia on
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.760]  its border just so huge that it's got me absolutely on the edge of my seat and
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:35.800]  every everybody really should be white knuckles right now and and and really
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.480]  trying to get right with God now that this situation is unfolding but
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.480]  Americans are so accustomed to having freedom and having security and
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.800]  Europeans are as well they have no idea how much danger we're in on average it's
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.960]  just like when folks will arrive on some island that has deer on it that have
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.360]  never seen humans and they'll walk right up to you and they're fearless because
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.920]  they don't understand the danger they're ignorant like dodo birds were on an
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.040]  island and after a few years they were all extinct because the sailors would
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.440]  just walk up consum on the head and roast them that's why he calls money is
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.200]  really dumb and clueless a dodo and if Americans don't wake up I mean I believe
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:23.600]  the new flag of the United States should be a dodo bird a dodo bird on one side
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.680]  and then on the other side an ostrich with its head stuck on the ground not
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:39.560]  an eagle or maybe just a turkey that's been roasted or cooked in the oven on a
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:45.480]  silver platter with a goblin about to eat it because I mean that's what we've
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.440]  become just absolute food to the new world order I look at how helpless the
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.600]  average person is out there they don't know what planet they're on folks and the
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.960]  globalists are just gonna absolutely run over everybody and they've mistaken the
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:04.000]  Russians for us in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.440]  foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.040]  around the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.680]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:24.080]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.760]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.040]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:12.400]  at the same time that's info wars life dot com waging war on corruption it's
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:30.000]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war we are
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.320]  broadcasting worldwide and coming up at the start of the next segment for the
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:40.720]  balance of the hour we have a retired state police officer joining us who is
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.040]  a private investigator and has been looking into the sandy hook situation
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.280]  he's been threatened he's been censored they have been covering up what really
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:57.360]  happened there we're going to talk to that gentleman Wolfgang Halbig coming up
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:04.520]  in the next segment cl Bryant is going to be joining us he is the star you could
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.200]  say a runaway slave an excellent film exposing the Democratic Party and their
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.120]  history of the Ku Klux Klan and their plan to domesticate blacks it's just a
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.560]  fact the Republicans are not perfect either and kind of flip places of the
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.080]  Democrats to a certain extent but I mean the Democrats are the party of race
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:27.080]  pimping and racial division and race hustling so that's going to be coming
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.840]  up with cl Bryant who was the head of the NAACP in garland which is a major
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.840]  city in the suburbs of Dallas or actually was part of my stomping grounds
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.200]  growing up so he's going to be joining this pretty dynamic fellow I look forward
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.720]  to that interview quite frankly almost canceled both these guesses because the
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:51.200]  Russian situation it's got me really on edge I mean I am very upset about what's
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.600]  going on I know my crew is as well I have a really great group our reporters
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.720]  the folks that work here the board ops the directors everybody has a very
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.200]  stressful job because we're in the middle of reality here and if people
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.480]  notice that I've been a lot more serious and angry lately on air it's because
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.680]  this Russian situation deep downs got me really upset you got the chairman of
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.440]  the Joint Chiefs Dempsey at the Secretary of State Kerry saying all
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.360]  options are on the table including military and they're prepared for
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.400]  military action against Russia they didn't even talk like this during the
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:31.760]  Cold War so I hope everybody understands this is this is dangerous and here are
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.560]  the headlines John Kerry Russia has until Monday a reverse course on Ukraine
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.320]  and it's got all the quotes that's up on drugreport.com Russian troops massed at
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.360]  border with Ukraine Kremlin website hit by powerful cyberattack Reuters
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.880]  Bloomberg Russia is preparing to invade East Ukraine Estonia says
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.160]  January customers run on banks and Crimea Vladimir Putin is stronger than
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.320]  President Obama in a new poll that's just some of the headlines and then here's
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.600]  the really important one Putin deport executives for speeding and J walking as
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.040]  sanctions loom they're basically kicking out Western executives who they
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.080]  believe are operatives that's just some of the news on that front now speaking
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.600]  of the guests that's coming up this story has just gone viral and info wars
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.680]  calm and prison planet calm Homeland Security conducts unannounced school
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.800]  lockdown drill notice they're suddenly at bus terminals train stops downtown
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:43.400]  Austin always popping up unannounced on the local news we can never get we never
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.920]  discovered till later they only tell local establishment media what they're
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.440]  gonna be doing they don't tell us the Department of Homeland Security is
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.000]  expanding its operations by running unconstitutional school lockdown drills
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.920]  on the side of the federal agencies encroachment in more areas of America's
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.520]  lives and it goes over what they're doing and this is again to create the
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.680]  perception of mass shootings and fear and to turn the schools into prisons
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:11.080]  that's how you mainline turning them into prisons even though a hundred and it's
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:18.800]  below 170 people it's 163 166 167 you can look at the numbers from 2012 2011 we
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.000]  don't have 2013 yet and it's flat basically it's a hundred and sixty plus
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.200]  shootings almost all of them are gang members shooting each other but if three
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.840]  gang members shoot three gang members it's called a mass shooting honey bees
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:36.880]  kill over 230 people a year wasp kill over 250 people a year spiders kill more
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.880]  than 500 people a year water moccasins kill more than a thousand people a year
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.200]  rattlesnakes kill more than 300 people a year and you can pull these numbers up
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.120]  and we've got whole reports on them we pioneered this years ago and now it's
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  been in Forbes and even the S issue of Esquire I was in had an article in this
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.680]  last year admitting that terrorism is a total hoax it's not dangerous and it's
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.080]  total mental illness and they just listed you know falling in your bathtub
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.240]  you're eight times more likely to die from that it varies year to year that's
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.120]  the number they had eight times more likely to die falling in your bathtub
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:14.040]  than being killed by a gun and guns kill 12,000 people a year most of them
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.240]  suicides and people shooting criminals but the point is is that more people
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.920]  killed by bees drowning in bath and from terrorism there's the Steve Watson
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.160]  article that broke that down back in 2012 but I mean just just go look at the
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:33.560]  statistics folks I mean I know people who've had family members that died from
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.880]  honey bees I mean I know I bet you know people died from bees I think you know
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.240]  people that have died from peanut allergies that's online to be like a
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.320]  thousand people a year dying from peanuts you do you have TSA guys in blue
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.680]  uniforms at the restaurant to make sure you know you don't eat a peanut or get
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.160]  a peanut peel in your food in the back of the restaurant this is all pure bull
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.400]  and they have these drills in the schools where the quote home schoolers
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.760]  against public school come and kill everybody or supporters of the NRA come
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.040]  to that's in the federal documents that's in the Associated Press look it up a
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:16.560]  much okay I'll have Watson added to his article just to be neurotic probably
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.560]  already in there haven't read the whole article that they go in and say we're
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.760]  here for guns and we're gonna blow your brain out so like little kids and
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:31.800]  teachers and teachers are suing this is in the news last week in Missouri not
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:38.280]  wanting to be part forced under law to be part of these drills like fire drills
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.520]  I mean yeah fire drills folks there's real fires you have earthquake drills
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.080]  in California because there's earthquakes you don't need to have mass
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.520]  shooting drills folks but you know what else it does copycats they know and I've
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.200]  used this a lot of times I read this in some criminology book I read when I was
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.640]  like 18 years old some big thick encyclopedia of criminology I think was
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.400]  the name of it I scan through and to talk about the copycat effect and use
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.320]  examples of Chicago in New York anybody that's got a graduate degree in
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:06.560]  criminology ago yeah I know about those cases I'm just am I that went and read
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.880]  the textbooks where they put glass up in barriers at the Empire State's
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.920]  building now in places but every time one crazy would jump off every few months
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.680]  they would immediately have to post cops there for two days because when it was
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.560]  in the news that somebody jumped off the Empire State's building somebody else
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.480]  would go you know what I think I'm gonna commit suicide that's a good way it's
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:32.440]  like a mass liming effect and they would then run up and jump off it's the same
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.280]  thing you start advertising hey don't commit suicide go commit suicide by cop
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.000]  so you go out and pull a gun on a cop they have to shoot you that's a phenomenon
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  or what do you do if you're on a bunch of Prozac type drugs you play shoot them
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.040]  up video games all day and you're into devil worship and your family's hooked
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.800]  into DARPA you're gonna be the cut out guy we blame for it oh excuse me I mean
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:16:00.240]  you're Adam Lanza every one of them on drugs and then what do you do well you
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.760]  go into school you shoot a bunch of kids because that's what you do because the
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:10.200]  media taught you how every time they have suicide education even 2020 to
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:18.400]  report on this in 2001 one year after they started anti-suicide and death
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.880]  education at Columbine it was the pilot school they had mass suicides at the
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.400]  school within the next two years some schools had more than 15 people commit
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.040]  suicide within one year of this being brought in because they taught you how
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.040]  to commit suicide and all the little girl went and committed suicide because
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.680]  she was down and this is how you do it with shoelaces in the bathroom stalls
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.720]  and then little girls go highly impressionable and of course they found
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.720]  this with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that sometimes women would be so
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.280]  touched by the love of Romeo and Juliet that they would go home and kill
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.840]  themselves after watching the play it's a phenomenon folks of highly
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:08.880]  impressionable people that can be hypnotized via suspended disbelief and
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.720]  that's what's going on here they are teaching people to go to schools and
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.960]  murder children so they don't have to stage them but they've been unable to get
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.880]  that going so they you know have to give us sandy hook that was clearly staged
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.760]  we don't know exactly what they did but we know the official stories of
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.400]  fraud and there was a drill and there was people from anti-terrorism squads
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.000]  running around in the bushes that they tried to deny but we confirmed and that
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.760]  they're covering everything up and we're gonna be talking to an expert about
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.000]  that coming up but the story is up on info wars calm and prison planet calm
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.240]  homeland security conducts unannounced school lockdown drill federal occupation
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.360]  of America expands and I've just been told it's linked in the middle lower
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.560]  column of drudge report dot com so there you go ladies and gentlemen now let's
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.800]  talk about the highly impressionable that that that make it a fad to want to
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.240]  kill yourself or a fad to be a slave or a chump
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.200]  Obamacare is designed to enroll people in a health care system run by offshore

[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.840]  can get to do it is the chumps and that is the trendies and they're literally
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.000]  hiring people with shaved heads and beards I'm not against shaved heads and
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.440]  beards I think it's fine for them to have beards it's manly I just can't

[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:41.560]  Wolfgang W. Halberg is our guest for the balance the hour I appreciate him coming on
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.960]  he's been on the nightly news he could not have a more extensive background
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.200]  Taylor made to investigate what really happened in Sandy Hook Connecticut that
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:56.480]  was used and is being used to try to create a mass guilt to be projected on
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:02.040]  the American people and make us collective killers of the children that
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.000]  reportedly died there they bulldozed the site they have declared national
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.640]  security and state security on all the details I believe people died there for
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.920]  my research but clearly the official story is not true and there were people
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.880]  given scripts to put out official lines and we now know that Bloomberg was
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.920]  activated days before saying prepare the social networks for a mass shooting so
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.640]  we see a lot of preparation here this could bring them down because I've
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.120]  never seen the American people reject something like this Wolfgang W. Halberg
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.760]  I'm not gonna go over his whole bio but he was of course a Florida state trooper
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.800]  in Miami Florida and a United States custom inspector and of course after
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.680]  that he was the executive director of the National Institute of School and
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.360]  Workplace Safety Wolfgang Halberg has recently formed a new safety and
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:54.840]  security company WK and associates previously he worked in public education
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.000]  as a teacher dean assistant principal director of alternative school the
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.560]  director of school safety and security of the Seminole County public schools huge
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:09.440]  area a public school district of 65,000 students and again he was also before
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.200]  that law enforcement experiences as state trooper and then customs inspector as
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.320]  a result of his unique background about law enforcement education Mr. Halberg
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.160]  has been invited to provide presentations and keynotes to a variety of
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.480]  audiences and I'm not gonna go over all this but he advises police across the
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.920]  country he's very well respected very well known to the top of his field this
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.400]  is a short segment long segment coming up but he's been threatened and he's the
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.440]  guy in there he's the you know the good cop you're looking for the real guy like
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.560]  in FIFA vendetta that's that that is good and can't be intimidated and
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.840]  believe me he needs to be prayed for folks because we don't I don't know
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.920]  exactly what went on I just know as an investigator a lay investigator that the
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.960]  official story is not true this we're being lied to and so we've only got
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.360]  about three minutes here 18 minutes coming up sir but Wolfgang thank you
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.920]  for coming on Mr. Halberg just give us the basics of a preview of what you
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.040]  think's really going on here in the cover-up and then break down what we
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.560]  know when we come back well I think I think Homeland Security and FEMA has
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.600]  probably pulled off one of the best illusions on all of the American people
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.360]  I've never seen it I bet you that they had it and planning for over three years
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.680]  and you know I just have 16 simple questions and hope that we talk about
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.600]  today but Alex I they won't respond they don't return phone calls they don't
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.720]  respond to FYA request and you know until they prove to answer those 16
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.120]  questions I don't think children died at San Diego and I hope we have that great
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.680]  discussion you know as we come back well I mean it's starting to lean that
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.160]  direction it's just the boldness of a total hoax but we've got green screens
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.240]  we've got people clearly being actors we've got I mean this man I tell you
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.000]  they really are sloppy that's all I can say well somebody needs to win the Oscar
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  because I'll tell you what they have split families across this country we
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.920]  have some family members believing it happened we have the other half the
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.720]  family members believing you know it was a hoax I mean they have divided this
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.720]  country the one thing I've learned about government being an American
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:22.000]  government teacher and history teacher you divide this country and they conquer
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.600]  I think the government's trying to conquer this country and that's not the
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:31.680]  America that I grew up in Alex well undoubtedly that is it the globalist
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.480]  from the government and they are conquering it and they admit they're
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.600]  involved in divide and conquer well I'll tell you what it's time for us as
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.440]  Americans to come together and this is the greatest opportunity Sandy Hook if
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:49.080]  we can show that this thing was an illusion the dominoes will fall and a lot
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.560]  of people need to go to jail Alex now now briefly how have you been threatened
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:00.440]  well it's ironic for over 10 months I mean when Sandy Hook unfolded I went into
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.360]  shock I'm a national school safety consultant I'm sitting there and watching
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.840]  television breaking news children shot teachers shot and killed I mean I mean it
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.800]  took me a week to figure it out I'm going whoa I'm a FEMA trainer I teach
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.360]  incident command I train people how we're supposed to respond that's not
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.880]  what we're supposed to do and then you know I kept asking questions for 10
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.560]  months Alex I did not want to offend the parents I didn't want to send the
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.800]  police department in Newtown Connecticut State Police next thing a week
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:36.320]  before Christmas I got two homicide investigators ringing my doorbell I
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.120]  looked out my window and I thought maybe they were selling termite inspection
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.120]  stay there sir this is incredible look over your 16 points former state police

[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.600]  caught lying and they were pre-planning before it and rolled out with it so
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.000]  clearly I agree with you that something's rotten under the floorboards but is it
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.840]  a possum or is it a human well regardless they're not letting a good
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.760]  crisis go to waste but but you're the expert break it down for us I wouldn't
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:58.360]  be here today you know had those two homicide investigators not come to my
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.080]  house and that's why we're talking about how you got threatened yeah and I can't
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.000]  believe they're telling me that if I don't stop asking questions about the
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.640]  Sandy Hook school shooting that the Connecticut State Police were going to
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.360]  come down and charge me with felony harassment now all I've done is use the
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.840]  Connecticut Freedom of Information Act and you know what that's the first thing
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.240]  we learned as a citizen is you got to be able to ask questions I taught that in
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.160]  school Wolfgang Wolfgang Wolfgang I'm gonna give you the floor I promise I'm
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.360]  gonna walk I want to walk back here because you got interrupted by the
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.160]  break start over because they explained you know the day that happened what went
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.680]  on you know and bad things are gonna happen to you if if you don't stop
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.720]  investigating this I mean why would they fear an investigation to break down
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:48.960]  what happened well you know they're just telling me not to ask questions and you
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.040]  know the questions that we're going to talk about here are so simple they do
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.840]  not hurt any of the parents that do not sure describe what happened describe what
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.520]  they said to you well they came to me and first of all they did what you did
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.240]  they went over they had my whole background my whole history of my life
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.840]  where I went to high school where I played football at Abilene Christian
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.480]  College they knew me about being a state trooper customs agent they thanked me
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.520]  for my service to my country and then they said you need to stop asking
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:20.000]  questions or they're going to come down from Connecticut and they're going to
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.680]  arrest you and I said for what for asking freedom of information requests I
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.000]  mean they need to go to jail for not responding and then they told me I need
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.400]  to hire an attorney you know and I'm sitting there going I said well you
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:37.680]  guys need to call them up and tell them I'm not going to stop asking questions
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.640]  that's one of the things I believe in and you know what the question the first
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:50.160]  one is why who who would have directed the New Haven FBI field offices to
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:56.200]  classify the Sandy Hook school shooting Alex that's never heard of Columbine
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.120]  Virginia Tech Jonesburg Paduca you name it the FBI has never ever classified a
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.760]  school shooting why would they do that and then when I called the New Haven
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:14.440]  field offices I wanted to make sure my information was correct this lady FBI
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:19.560]  agent you know I asked her how do I get this information she says you're never
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.880]  going to see it in your lifetime it's been classified and the public will not
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.560]  see it and I think everybody who's listening to your show today ought to
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:32.880]  pick up the phone call their congressman their US senator in demand and I
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.000]  mean demand a copy of that report because we as American we have a right to
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.280]  know especially when they're using children and teachers as a ploy to
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.800]  scare the living hell out of us Alex and the next question is really simple
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.240]  you know I want to know who the incident commander was I mean one of the things
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.240]  Homeland Security and FEMA has shut down every school district private and
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:01.120]  parochial that when you have a mass casualty event you have got to have an
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.880]  incident commander and and you know what they won't tell me who was in charge on
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:12.680]  that day now that tells me a serious problem because that incident
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:19.360]  commander was in charge of requesting trauma helicopters I'm 67 years old I've
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.680]  never ever seen a school shooting where we don't get the quickest and the fastest
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.320]  medical help and there's nothing like the trauma helicopter they got the best
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.400]  experience best paramedics they got the tools that they need why would you not
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.000]  order trauma helicopters for those children and for those we have the
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.320]  videos of them the same kids going in circles in and out of the building
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.840]  unmistaken drill and then they just tell them they were all shot you keep
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.880]  going well I mean for anyone to understand what you and I today are
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.560]  talking about I got your listeners need to pretend that they have a child in
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.320]  that school on December 14th 2012 please listeners pretend that you have a first
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.560]  grader a little girl little boy you love of your life and they don't order
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.560]  trauma helicopters knowing they may be seriously shot cleaning the life and
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.280]  then why would they not let the paramedics and the EMTs inside the
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.720]  school now who made that decision that is just unheard of it's cruel you need
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.880]  to provide medical attention so they overwrote the default they overwrote
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.160]  the default settings
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.480]  Wolfgang you're saying just standard operating procedure was ignored correct
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.160]  oh can you think about it you're the incident commander once the school is
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.760]  deemed safe you get all the medical help that you can inside the school
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.840]  because guess what we don't know if they're dead or not then we find out that
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.320]  within eight minutes of the first shot supposedly being fired Alex they're all
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.520]  declared dead we have 18 children and six school staff members declared
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:08.440]  legally dead within eight minutes that's unheard of and by Connecticut law only a
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:14.000]  doctor can declare them legally dead so who did that they won't respond to my
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.480]  questions so you know I keep doing this day in and day out no phone calls no
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.520]  response and where did the 500 children go that day and the 60 teachers there's
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:33.560]  not any helicopter video footages of 500 children being evacuated how is that
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.240]  possible every school shooting that we're seeing lately you got kids coming out
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.000]  of school with their hands raised the news media is all over it and here we
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:50.520]  have Sandy Hook and we can't even find 500 children that's unheard of and then
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.800]  they had all the police going to the houses telling the so-called families
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:41:01.120]  and people not to talk to anybody absolutely I mean you know I mean I've
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.080]  been doing this I've traveled the country from one state to another I've been in
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.480]  school shooting events I've been there I had hired as an expert witness after the
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.320]  fact when I was an assistant principal yeah I've seen a student shot in our
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.960]  school and you know what I learned Alex when you hear shots fired in your high
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.880]  school those parents will come at you with every ounce of energy they are
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.680]  ready to tear down the fence to get to their child and Sandy Hook as you said
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.680]  guess what they're doing they're going in circle I didn't see any parents have
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.360]  any sense of urgency to go get their child and then you read about this guy
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.640]  there's a guy in the woods he was supposed to come build gingerbread houses
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.080]  he's running away from the school knowing that shots are fired if I was that
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:52.480]  father Alex I'd be running into the school not away from the school it just
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:42:00.000]  does not make sense and then you know this is a simple request because I did
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.600]  this at Columbine you know Columbine we had 14 students shot and killed 23
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.240]  seriously injured we had a great teacher by the name of Dave Sanders that was
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.920]  shot and killed trying to save kids and one thing that I learned but three days
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.040]  four days later I saw how they contracted a certified environmental
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.200]  company to come in to clean up all of the biohazards Alex there was blood in the
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:28.960]  media center everywhere brain matter skull fragments the carpet it was
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.560]  stained with blood I mean windows were shot out broken out the police
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.160]  department you know they fired over 354 rounds inside the school our kids were
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.280]  still in there but what I got to see is how they clean up and sanitize and
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.240]  decontaminate you know I nobody will tell me who did that at Sandy Hook I
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:56.440]  mean Sandy Hook had three crime areas room 8 room 10 and room 9 yep they
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.440]  shot out the window but nobody will tell me who the company is that the new town
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:07.240]  public schools contracted with to come in to sanitize and decontaminate why is
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:13.720]  that a secret it's something that you should be doing by law continuing on
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:20.800]  the 16 points and this is one of my this is the one that is my attention new
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:26.280]  town police has a lieutenant and he's working in off-duty detail at a
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.200]  construction site less than two miles from the Sandy Hook elementary school
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.160]  when he they hear shots fired now you would assume somebody who's in
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:40.640]  management law enforcement management would automatically break away from his
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:47.200]  duty and respond to the school Alex that man stays at his off-duty job for over
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.200]  four hours and then he responds but what people don't know I read the police
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:58.680]  report there was another female officer female and she left the duty side to go
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:04.680]  to the shooting now why would he not go I mean there's just so many questions and
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:10.120]  I think I think they're coming at me not just one time because they send another
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:15.480]  two police officers a couple weeks later they want me to stop asking these
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.240]  questions why we're going to find out when we go up to the new town but why
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:25.360]  would a lieutenant not leave his duty another one is that you know the
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:31.560]  environmental new town public schools the Sandy Hook elementary school Alex
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.840]  had the highest level of lead paint they had the highest level of asbestos
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:43.200]  throughout the school they had the highest level of PCP groundwater inside
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.520]  the school is around the school and you know what I've asked for the tri annual
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:53.120]  asbestos inspections which are required by a school district every three years by
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.640]  a certified outside contractor they refuse to hand over those inspection
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:05.080]  reports and the district is required by law Connecticut law to let the parents
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.680]  know each school year of any any hazardous materials that reside within
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.640]  the school because we don't want the children to have lifelong you know health
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.840]  issues and there's a total cover up of that and then they bulldoze the school
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.440]  now they will not release any of the photos any of the transcripts there's
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.920]  clearly a massive cover up here what do you make of the green screen with
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.960]  Anderson Cooper down there on the ground what do you make of the obvious
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.160]  stage interviews and and multiple actors playing the part of multiple people I
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:40.160]  mean this is undoubted something's going on your best guesstimation of this
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.840]  is what a drill which they told the world was a real shooting I mean that's an
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.880]  operation Northwood to declassified plan by the Pentagon to commit mass shootings
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.680]  to blame the Soviets but they never went ahead with it because Kennedy nicks the
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.760]  plan so so we know these ideas have been thought of before we know this was
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.040]  their push to get the guns I mean we know that's the motive we know they've
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:05.480]  staged other stuff but I mean I tell you this is just so bold well it's really
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.440]  bold when you talk about Anderson Cooper because when you look at the breaking
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.840]  news here's Anderson Cooper using supposedly a live feed with seven
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.640]  Canadian the Connecticut State Troopers charging a school and they made it
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.800]  pretend that it was Sandy Hook Elementary School I mean I actually thought
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:28.720]  these guys were storming in to try to neutralize the shooter and then we find
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:33.440]  out it's not even the school and they're using it to scare the living heck out of
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.400]  all that's it there's this fake video everywhere like like I was watching this
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.640]  blue screen I only his nose disappears when they cut to a wider shot you can
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:46.320]  see some garbage that's blowing and and then it blows back again because they
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:51.040]  they didn't loop the tape right I mean they just think we're total morons I
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:54.800]  mean I don't I just don't know what to say I totally agree with you and I've
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.440]  never seen all of the major news stations all of the major news station
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.760]  come out with so much misinformation I want to know who gave him the script who
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:10.160]  told him that this mother of Adam Lanzar worked there for 15 years I mean who
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.000]  made up these scripts for all of these newscasters because you know what not
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.120]  one of those national television stations are asking what you and I ask
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.160]  that's right that's right simple questions I want to go over the rest of
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:26.040]  the 16 but really looking at why I question it because it's just
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.960]  undoubted that they're making stuff up I just don't know again what's being made
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.480]  up but it's it's clearly they're lying clearly they have the motive one of the
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.960]  biggest piece of evidence is that Bloomberg had his social network folks
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:43.080]  ready two days before absolutely they had the website there were websites up for
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:49.040]  donations contributions very sick in memorandum I mean who does all that I
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.360]  mean I could see one or two being a mistake but when you got multiple
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.240]  multiple people going online looking for money before they're shooting we have
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.200]  serious problems that's right you're right I want to add something totally key
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.000]  here Anderson Cooper is in the CIA it's on record was in the CIA comes from a
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  major robber Baron family and it's been pointed out even in international news
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:21.920]  he put out the fake Syrian murder videos he put out a bunch of other fake
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:29.200]  hoaxes and so he's the guy that runs the hoaxes at CNN so because obviously it's
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.640]  compartmentalized in those operations so it's very fitting that he's
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:37.360]  quarterbacking the disinfo and that CNN put out the official talking point today
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:42.440]  one well I hope at the end of the day that we find the truth about Sandy Hook
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.600]  and I'm gonna tell you what Anderson Cooper CNN and every one of those major
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.840]  networks or I'm gonna tell you what they need to apologize to the American people
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.040]  because Alex I'm telling you I'm a naturalized U.S. citizen and I pray to
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:00.000]  God that I'm wrong I mean my wife is so mad at me for doing what I'm doing today
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.520]  I mean it's almost costing me a marriage but I'll tell you what if I am wrong I'm
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.520]  willing to tear up my naturalization papers because I've embarrassed America
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.440]  and all those people that believe in me right now I can't I wouldn't want to be
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  an American if I lied to them or accusing America of fraud well it's not
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:23.440]  America it's criminal elements we're showing right now famous 1990 1991 fake
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.040]  video that CNN admit was totally fake where they claimed that they were being
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.440]  attacked in Saudi Arabia by scud missiles and they were in Atlanta on the
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:34.920]  roof I mean they've been doing this for a long time as the point well this be
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:39.760]  a but I believe that if we come together as Americans and we really focus on
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.600]  Sandy Hook and we find the truth and the only we're going to do that Alex we're
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.720]  gonna go to Newtown we're gonna get people to raise their right hand we're
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.600]  gonna file a class action lawsuit and the government is not expecting us to do
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.760]  that but until we get them to raise their right hand nothing's ever gonna
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:01.640]  happen we're gonna talk about it forever and ever but we need to go we need to
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:06.400]  hold them accountable and people need to go to jail I agree let's go over the
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.080]  rest we're coming back to break but I want to get over your other 16 points
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.400]  and what your battle plan is but I understand you you see lies you've got
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.280]  to tell the truth even though it's hard and but in the beginning of Patriots a
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.880]  scarce man but in the end the Tim had joined him because then it cost nothing
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.640]  to be a patriot as Mark Twain said to paraphrase I mean look I don't want to
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:28.760]  come out look the Boston bombing we sent reporters it was staged as well no
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  doubt we had the FBI and Obama's people the Secret Service threatened our
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:40.560]  reporter we proved that was a drill I mean they're running hoaxes folks and it
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:43.960]  is it is extremely dangerous and I don't like having to do this either I mean
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.560]  it's but I mean look these people got to be stopped and if they'll stage Boston
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.880]  bombing and Sandy Hook they will do anything the good news is most people
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.640]  I've seen do not believe Sandy Hook I think it really blew up in their face

[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.600]  from Oklahoma City was the second cop to respond with cop of the year that drug
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.280]  out a bunch of people who they killed Taryn shaggy in Oklahoma City and FBI
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:31.360]  walked in said you keep investigating this room you and your wife are dead and
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.440]  I said on air I said name the names and he turned white and gulped and Don
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:40.560]  Browning and he said the names on there he was a Marine Corps combat vet and
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:43.720]  folks he started shaking a little bit because you know when the FBI comes in
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.240]  says we'll kill you and your wife boy but tell you learn what this government
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:56.600]  really is real quick you stop being so naive I'm not saying the whole FBI is
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.480]  bad most of Martin's compartmentalized they've used national security to set
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.360]  this up and they stage Sandy Hook I don't know how much of it I don't know
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:10.240]  exactly what went on I just know it's a it's fake and they've done it before
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:14.760]  but this is bold and they came after our guns and Wolfgang we got you for five
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.520]  more minutes I want to invite you back for a full hour soon or more thanks a
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:23.240]  lot well let me leave you with this one and remember I said parents visualize
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.680]  that your child in there I couldn't believe that within three hours of the
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.400]  first shots fire with everybody responding the incident commander is
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.120]  ordering porta-potties I mean think about this they're ordering porta-potties
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:42.640]  for Sandy Hook elementary school it took me a week to figure it out I call the
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:47.080]  porta-potty company and I talked to the lady and I said who ordered it when
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.520]  were they ordered well we're not allowed to give out that information we're
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:54.080]  directed by the police not to respond to those let me stop you what about them
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:58.360]  bringing the kids back into the crime scene oh absolutely why would they ever
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:05.360]  do that you know and but the big thing Alex here with the porta-potty here we
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.480]  have there's somebody at the command center that morning who's thinking about
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.840]  porta-potties but he's not ordering the trauma helicopters he's not letting the
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:19.120]  paramedics in the e-mail was a PR carnaval carnaval and then they're
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.360]  ordering lunch I mean you can see the police vehicles who eats lunch when you
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:30.040]  have a mask I would be I would be vomiting and in the bathroom breaking down
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.440]  and crying well they got porta-potties so when they're eating their lunch during
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:39.080]  the massive killing it just you know what it just it just angers me and every
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.840]  American would get angry about this and they need by the way I've seen car wrecks
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.280]  with dead people where I pulled over to help folks that wrecked and I did vomit
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.000]  I couldn't imagine having a six-year-old daughter seeing a bunch of dead five and
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  six-year-olds I guarantee you I wouldn't be eating lunch well you know what Alex
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.240]  you and I on the same page it just you know America just needs to see it it's
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:03.600]  not don't listen to what my opinion is I what I'm saying today's what's in the
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.360]  police report you have to read what they say and think about the two children
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:13.360]  that were transported to Danbury Hospital they died at Danbury Hospital but
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.200]  you know what nobody had how do they get there only come back we got a couple

[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.200]  man they are covering stuff up folks I mean they are acting super suspicious

[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:27.120]  alex jones wolfgang w. how big you can hear it in his voice how freaked out he
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.360]  is
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:36.440]  natural school safety expert former state police u.s. customs he goes and
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.480]  investigates that there's a cover-up at every front and it never happens with the
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.440]  other shootings I gotta say the aurora thing was definitely a wind-up toy as
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.520]  well that's all come out and they're doing these black ops to get our gun
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:52.320]  sir talk about your bottom-line gut dead reckoning obviously I agree with you
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.760]  there's something's going on they're covering up it's all staged but what is
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.320]  staged as best you can tell what do you think really happened in your
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:05.920]  hypothesis at sandy hut I think it's just it was just a plan massive fema
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.160]  whole homeland security I think it was a major drill portrayed as one of the
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:16.760]  best delusions ever and I think it was trying to create empathy across the
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:22.840]  country for making us feel bad that so many children were killed and look what
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:27.240]  happened in Connecticut it's work they're taking the guns away from people in
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.280]  Connecticut guess what they're just law-abiding citizen and they're using
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:35.800]  Sandy Hook as a nexus it's a beginning and if they're doing it in
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:42.200]  Connecticut who's just the next state what's the next state all because of Sandy Hook that's right
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.880]  and then there'll be another shooting and oh how dare you see it's your fault
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:51.000]  it's so obvious they're using it to disarm us they admit it and it's just a
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.040]  total hoax any way you slice it and so sloppily done what about bringing the
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:05.960]  kids back into the so-called death dens 945 31 on the police transmission you
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:11.080]  can see a police officer lieutenant he sees a little girl in the hallway at
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:17.000]  Sandy Hook elementary school he takes her and pushes her back into room 8 well if
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.960]  anybody reads the report room 8 is the crime scene there are dead bodies in
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.280]  there 70 rounds have been fired in there and this police officer shoves this little girl
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:32.360]  back in the room 8 with dead bodies then you got to Connecticut state troopers they
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.440]  go into room 10 and they see a little boy hiding in the bathroom and they tell
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.920]  him well just stay there we'll be back when it's safe well room 10 is where the
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:46.720]  other bodies are how did they get the state police to play along with this
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.840]  tell them it's part of national security well I think it is and I think there's a

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.360]  justice and opportunity and free market the real renaissance the Constitution
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.840]  Bill of Rights were never properly realized but they were the most
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:27.640]  revolutionary idea in history up to that point when they say oh it's 230 years
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.480]  old 240 years old yeah but what we're going back to his old-fashioned tyranny
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:38.360]  the state ruling everything so what we have is cutting edge and we are just
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:41.840]  beginning to try to realize it and it made us the most wealthy country in
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:48.440]  world history and CL Bryant is a son of World War two veteran roots run deep in
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.440]  the Cane River area Louisiana he studied Western civilization mortgage
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.360]  finance and master's degree in theology he's a Baptist minister and for 35 years
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:01.880]  has traveled extensively in South America on missionary journeys he's a
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:07.600]  former president of LACP in Garland it's a major city of Dallas the Texas
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:12.000]  chapter and self-professed democratic radical turned conservative now believes
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.080]  the values that he wants vehemently upheld has led the black community into
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:19.680]  a state of bondage to the US government well there's no believe it that's a fact
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:24.400]  not even really the US government it's the social engineer you Genesis Margaret
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:30.880]  Sanger types and he of course is the main star of the great film runaway
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:36.600]  slave and he's also involved with a column in SB magazine and a lot more and
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:43.680]  he joins us I really appreciate you coming on because I mean I've known
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.480]  the stuff that's in your film for basically ever because I say history but
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.840]  when it really hits you it's outrageous that the Democratic Party says if you
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:56.880]  don't want Obamacare you're a racist or if you don't turn your guns in your
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:02.560]  racist or the talking point the NRA is the clan when the NRA was founded to
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:08.280]  arm freed black slaves on record I mean it's so frustrating that it was Lincoln's
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.880]  party that supposedly ended slavery was really the Christian abolitionist and I'm
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:15.240]  not even glorifying you know the South or the North the point is they have
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:20.360]  inverted history and then domesticated everybody including white folks
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.400]  everybody's going on the plantation the model they pioneer with blacks has now
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.440]  been deployed against everyone to devastating effect and you break it
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:32.040]  down in your film but but just from your perspective formally heading up the
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.920]  NAACP in a major city what is it like as you discovered all this because when I
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:42.280]  talk about it in SNBC the White House run grips go completely wild and say
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.200]  none of it's true because they're scared of it what do you say sir and thanks
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:53.360]  first of all Ellen for having me on Alex and I thank you all of you for
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:13:00.880]  listening what happened with me as far as the switch the change the crossover
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:06.400]  was concerned I came to the realization that not only did the organization the
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:13.320]  NAACP want to control the agenda they wanted to control me and then use me to
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:18.800]  control a block of people this is the modus operandi of an organization like
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:25.280]  them and when I decided that I wanted to act as an individual on my core values
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:31.320]  who I was then I noticed that my star that was rising in the organization
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:39.720]  began to abruptly set and that's when an awakening began to take place and my
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:45.520]  journey now and my duty now for the last 19 years after that awakening is to make
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.160]  certain that others are awakened as well that's what it's all about it's the
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.480]  awakening I really woke up 19 years ago as well that I needed to get involved in
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:58.840]  the fight for liberty because I could see the tyranny growing break down the
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.520]  basics because we have a lot of affiliates out there folks that may have
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.520]  never heard about the Democrats how they operate what they've done how the NAACP
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:11.440]  operates I mean what's the core message of what's happening the progressive
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:19.760]  liberals the Democrats in particular are masters at co-opting various groups the
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:26.520]  black church in particular has been co-opted very effectively by progressive
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:32.480]  liberals over the course of the last 50 60 years since the great society of
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:40.160]  Lyndon Johnson and unfortunately black folks are not aware of the method in
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:47.200]  which they are used and enslave shackled and the black preacher not all of them
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:53.280]  but many black preachers have unwittingly and many times winningly been
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:59.600]  willingly the pawns of those them progressive Democrats who would in
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:06.800]  fact progress their agenda through the church the church was always the hub of
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:12.280]  the community control the black church you can put control the black vote
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.640]  control the black preacher you control the black mindset and what they don't
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:23.280]  tell their parishioners is that the masters the Democrat masters the
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:27.920]  progressive liberal masters they don't want you to love God they want you to
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:32.440]  love them they don't want you to love that wife or that child they want you to
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:40.160]  love them and as you see in the policies the planks in the Democrat policies in
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:45.280]  their conventions and so forth you see that these types of ideas that I'm
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.040]  sharing with you are absolutely true they operate against the core values of
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:55.880]  the people who have differences with them well you know your judge a tree by
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.040]  its fruits you break this down in the film what's happened to the black
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:05.320]  community since it adopted the Margaret Sanger liberal trendy progressive
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:14.080]  stance whole communities have been pressed down since the time of Lyndon
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:21.440]  Johnson and since the time of the signing of the civil rights bills and you
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:28.200]  have seen a good decline a steep decline in the black culture in its black
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:35.640]  society the Negro project that Margaret Sanger had some seventy years ago now
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.680]  that she started she actually started that through the black church where
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:47.840]  certain people were called out and identified as undesirable you see that
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:52.760]  even today with black people they they don't realize that there is an elite
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:58.720]  group of people who many black people in Hollywood are part of and they work
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:04.840]  against that segment of society black society in particular to keep them and
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:10.480]  make them an underclass we use top that type of thing sometimes you people look
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:16.560]  at you like you're crazy but in the idea of the runaway slave that guy who ran
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:22.080]  away he came back occasionally he told those who were still in bondage you can
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.120]  be free but what would happen those people who were still on the plantation
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.560]  they would run and tell their masters oh Bryant has come back and he's causing
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:39.160]  trouble among those who are still here in this tyranny in this slavery and what
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:44.520]  would happen the master then would capture bride or at least try to make a
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:51.400]  public example of him and that same type of attitude exists toward those of us
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.240]  who are black conservatives those of us who are black Republicans those of us
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:01.480]  who are preaching a message of freedom that same type of method is used on us
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:08.640]  they want to make us examples so that others who are still locked in that
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:14.120]  mindset won't dare try to escape it well that's right and I knew some of the
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:18.880]  history of this but when I was on first on access TV going back 19 years ago it
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:24.680]  was in East Austin there was a lot of black preachers and folks that would you
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.920]  know use the facility as well and black folks were probably you know percentage
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:32.560]  wise some of my biggest viewers because you know they liked the message of
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:35.320]  liberty I was putting out and I was also putting on an anti-establishment
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:39.240]  message about government being oppressive but then I would have the black
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:44.200]  leaders particularly in the parking lot or at the grocery store or in the
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:49.240]  hallways who had shows there literally get in my face and say don't be talking
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.720]  to black people you know that's basically our group and then I would go out to
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:56.440]  abortion clinics or mainly the black area and covered some demonstrations and
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.360]  I would have them come over and literally get in my face and say nobody
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:03.920]  wants all these black people nobody and they would say actually racist things
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.760]  about black people and I was like what is this were black people all the ones
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.560]  driving Mercedes were putting down and hating the black community they were
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:16.080]  leading and I've since run into other quote black liberal leaders and you
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:20.880]  go out to dinner with them they are racist what you were doing and what I am
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.560]  doing and others like me around the country are doing Alex and the reason you
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:31.520]  meet with such venom is because you are breaking into their hustle it is a
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:40.420]  hustle to race bait it is a hustle to keep a certain people victimized and
[02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:46.440]  when you try and liberate them what you are doing is trying to help someone
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:51.040]  escape what I call a Stockholm syndrome mentality I agree stay there I want to

[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:15.120]  used electronic warfare systems over Crimea at a down a US predator drone
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:21.480]  they're saying this is in the French news agency Russia says intercepted US drone
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.320]  over Crimea arms group I'll give you more details coming up in the next
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:29.160]  segment when we cover some other news before we go back to our guest but they
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:34.360]  say the surveillance drone was down from 4,000 meters 12,000 feet up virtually
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.760]  invisible from the ground it was possible to break the link with US
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:42.360]  operators the complex radio electronic technology the drone fell almost intact
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:48.240]  in the hands of self-defense forces this is getting really out of control they
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:53.760]  belong to the 66th American risk condisons brigade based in Bavaria so
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:59.080]  it's escalating quickly folks pray for peace is all I can say man we're talking
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:04.360]  to Reverend C.L. Bryant you can go to revclbrient.net to find his
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.400]  website and I want to quantify this because when this used to happen the
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.440]  first time the third time the fourth time the fifth time the tenth time it's now
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:15.320]  been caught on tape with Asian and black abortionist and I'm just saying that
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:18.320]  you remember the video guys where people come and say we like to adopt the
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:21.840]  babies the black babies you're aborting and they say nobody wants the nappy
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.560]  hair and ugly black babies I heard those exact quotes over and over again by
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.920]  people that drove new Mercedes that ever that the black folks will come up to
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.600]  groveling like they were kings and I always heard anybody that wasn't a
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:38.320]  basically a socialist or anti-gun or whatever was an uncle Tom or any
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:42.600]  conservative or libertarian blacks but the truth is behind the scenes these
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:47.840]  these black leaders a lot of them literally were like clan members or
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:52.480]  something they would talk horrible about black people and say we need to get
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:56.120]  rid of these black people and we had a quote black leader here for a film I
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:59.120]  never ended up putting the film it was so shocking I went to dinner with Rob do
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:02.240]  with him Rob do heard this stuff the guy basically later been he was a
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:05.800]  communist said when we need to keep abortion going there's too many black
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.680]  people this is a black guy so this goes back to Margaret Sanger 70 years who
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:14.960]  said we got a higher blacks to get rid of these weeds close quote and man I'm
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.600]  telling you it's so over the top that the average person just can't believe it
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.440]  but you were in the middle of it see all Brian when I talked to Reverend
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:26.640]  Childress of the black genocide project he says he's heard exactly what I'm
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.880]  saying have you heard exactly what I just said before oh of course growing up
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:38.000]  in the segregated South you see out Alex I remember black and white water
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.480]  fountains I remember riding on the back I've written on the back of the boss
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:49.480]  four years old when Dr. King in 1959 spoke at my home church Galilee Baptist
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.520]  Church there was an idea that came out of the black community actually out of
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:59.320]  the black church that black people need to be controlled and also they need
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:05.600]  leaders and today you'll understand this that black people are the only group
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.120]  of people that if somebody comes into the neighborhood or if they talk
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:13.680]  nationally on behalf of black people they'll want to talk to the so-called
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:18.880]  black leaders my question always is why is it that black folks have to be led
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:24.440]  around where the Irish leaders where the Italian leaders where those folks but
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:29.520]  what every time you talk about black folks even from people in the community
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.440]  they talk about where are our leaders you'll hear that what happened to our
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:38.760]  leaders heck I know what's in my pocketbook I know what my mortgage is I
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:44.280]  know what my children need I know what I need in order to get by and make it in
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.160]  this country I don't need anybody to lead me anywhere only thing I need is for a
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:54.680]  big government to get out of my way and I'll get my own my grandparents my great
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:28:00.160]  grandfather former slave my grandfather and my father they were all very
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:06.200]  independent men and they were men who did not have affirmative action they had
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:11.640]  the sweat of their brow and they taught me my grandfather in particular said to
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:15.600]  me son I didn't go through all that I went through so that you could be black
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:20.080]  I went through all that I went through so you could be free and he was talking
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:24.680]  to me about having the same things that everybody else has regardless of color
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:30.400]  in this country and so yes there has been that attitude in the black community
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.920]  and it has become a part of the mental fiber of too many black folks if they
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:39.560]  need to be led out of a situation I was about to say these new black leaders
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:44.640]  they are like the new slave master they are and and the idea was back in
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:50.000]  slavery time was to drive the slave out into the field so he could get his
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.440]  cotton master could get his cotton picked now the new overseer his job is to
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:00.240]  make sure that that same slave gets to the voting booths every two years so they
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:05.240]  get their votes picked and so that's where we are in this country as far as
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:11.840]  the mentality is concerned and believe me black folks were the test case this
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:20.160]  particular feeling of entitlement and being used by the master is beginning to
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:25.400]  grow all through this country oh they admit it's beta testers for everybody
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:32.200]  absolutely and they want that they need that to happen Obamacare is not just
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:38.840]  some type of health care idea Obamacare is a mechanism to further enslave

[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:25.160]  covered this a few weeks ago with tucker carlson it's just a fact we had
[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:32.640]  john bound to a special report on it the democrats in the kkk and they had ms mbc
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:36.160]  do like three four shows on it young church did shows on over and over again
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:39.560]  admitting some of it was true but basically saying i was exaggerating and
[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:43.800]  lying about the rest of it folks i'm not exaggerating i remember the politics of
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.640]  my grandfather coming back from world war two and he didn't like the democratic
[02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:51.200]  party and the racism stuff so he became a republican ran for office in his
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:55.600]  county in one and that was a big split in some of the family not because they
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:58.840]  were really into race stuff but because we they were southerners you know he's
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:03.600]  texas and you voted democrat and so i grew up hearing about that i mean i knew
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:07.280]  about that and then i knew about lbj and his letters about i'm gonna have all
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.040]  these inwards vote in democrat for two hundred years they couldn't stop eyes and
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.400]  hour and all the people passing the civil rights act and stuff and and and
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:20.760]  republican you know presidents like guys an hour you know opening up the schools
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.640]  with the military and and and of course there was still some racist elements
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.200]  the republican party as well but the democrats were the party of the grand
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:32.360]  dragons like senator bird and nixon later once the democrats doubled back and
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.920]  got the minorities using race politics that have been so successful with poor
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:40.200]  whites nixon did have a southern strategy to try to go to the south that
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:45.640]  felt betrayed and get them with some lip service but the point is the democrats
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:51.520]  when they get up there and they promote race this race that constantly and if
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:55.320]  you don't do what we say you're a racist i mean throw me in that briar patch
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:00.960]  every day i am sick of it and it is a whopper when they have fox sports
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:04.640]  commentators and everybody you know saying you know the nr a's a kook looks
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:09.360]  plan they want to kill black people i mean it's like saying martin luther king
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:14.200]  wants to kill black people because the nr a was found at the end of the civil
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:18.200]  war to teach northerners how to shoot and to arm free black slaves and there
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:23.400]  was a program to arm black people and it's so frustrating that christians did
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.120]  that because they believed in everybody being free and then nowadays the
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:31.640]  democratic party so anti god and at their convention takes god out of it and
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:35.480]  gets off on it when they are such an evil group of people and i don't mean
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:39.120]  the well-meaning liberal black person or white person that buys into it and
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:43.840]  drinks the poison i'm talking about the leadership of the democratic party i've
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:48.000]  been around them they are into manipulating people they are into playing
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.240]  people off against each other they are not liberals folks thomas jefferson was
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:57.960]  a liberal and and i'm sick of these definitions that they hijacked and act
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:02.680]  like they are the civil rights movement or they are the abolition movement when
[02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:07.240]  it has nothing to do with them in fact they were the people that opposed it and
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:11.080]  i'm almost cursed with knowing the history and then sitting here and watching
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:16.440]  these liars race bait all day now we're talking to reverend cl bryant revs cl
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:21.840]  bryant net he's the main expert in the excellent film runaway slave you just
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.200]  google runaway slave the film and find the website and get it i want to carry
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:27.840]  it we haven't got that deal done yet i told the guys i want to carry this
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:32.600]  excellent because this is a subject i noticed reverend that when i cover it the
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:39.560]  the the race pimps go into linda blare like convulsions and almost start you
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.160]  know vomiting green pea soup but you were trying to get into obama care so
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:51.760]  break that down obama care is a tool to further enslave not only black folks but
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:57.000]  all folks once they control your health care they control you you were saying
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.040]  something alexa was very interesting that i want to chime in on it was
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:06.160]  democrats who stood in the doorway of the university of alabama in the person
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:10.720]  of george wallace saying segregation now segregation for illa it was
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:16.960]  democrats who tried to stop the little rock nine from going to little rock
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.000]  high school and it was a republican president eisenhower you mentioned him
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:29.160]  who in fact uh i wrote the first civil rights legislation back in 1957 and that
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:34.080]  same legislation in that year was filibustered and watered down and
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:38.480]  basically had his teeth taken out of it by two united states senators their
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:45.160]  names were linden johnson and john f kennedy nearly ten years later the same
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:51.560]  civil rights bill that eisenhower tried to get past in 1957 linden johnson
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:58.680]  with the help of a republican congress and senate got that bill passed it was
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:02.600]  not democrats who had the interest of civil rights for black folks but
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:07.800]  somehow they have become identified as the saviors of black folks and they use
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:12.840]  people like alsharpton they use people like jesse jackson and been jealous to
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:19.760]  perpetuate a lie that has been existing now for 50 years and it is time to set
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:26.080]  the record straight well you're doing that and what about the issue expanding
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.400]  on that of of the race baiting the race pimping i mean when you turn on msnbc
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:38.520]  it is almost comical how over the top it is that again if you don't agree with
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:42.480]  anything they say you're a racist i really see this backfiring and people
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:47.520]  that i've known my whole life or most my life who've never actually been racist
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:52.120]  they're not racist now but they're so tired of being accused of being racist
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:56.160]  that it's starting to actually cause division and i think clarence thomas got
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:59.960]  criticized a few weeks ago for saying when i was going to college in the 60s
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:03.240]  there was less race problems that i'm seeing now because of all this race
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.440]  baiting and i got to say obama has been the biggest divider that i could have
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:14.000]  ever imagined i'm going to show you what race baiting and what racist really is i
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.320]  throw the gauntlet down right now on your show to alshark and any person who
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:26.400]  calls themselves a black liberal i dare you to say anything against msnbc
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:34.520]  nbc cbs or abc i dare you not to speak the party line that they want you to
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:40.160]  speak and i want you to see what happens if you speak your core value mind i
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:46.000]  dare you to say the truth or speak the same language that our grandfathers and
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:52.840]  great-grandfathers spoke i dare you to talk against the idea that they have
[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:57.320]  planted in your mind in order to give you a paycheck and see just how long
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:02.640]  your gravy train lasts that's racism when they control your thought when they
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:07.760]  control your mindset and what you're going to say what you're looking at when
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:13.840]  you look at me is a free man i go where i want to go i associate with who i want
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.560]  to associate with and alex i hope you know that after today i'm going to say
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.880]  what's on my mind and the chips will follow where they're made i am not
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:31.080]  beholding to any network any party any organization i'm a free man i do exactly
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:35.920]  what that old granddad of mine said i should do he didn't go through all that
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:40.080]  he went through so that i could be black he went through all that he went through
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.160]  so i could be free and to understand for myself that america is the greatest
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:52.640]  success story the world has ever known absolutely we have to throw down the
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:55.480]  gauntlet because that's really what the democratic party is all about the
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.320]  public certainly have their problems i'm a libertarian it's that they constantly
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:04.760]  are on this moral high ground and i'm somebody who's protested the cook less
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.160]  clan probably more than a dozen times when they would come to town and things
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:14.640]  over the years and it's very insulting to have them say with steel the former
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:19.000]  head of the republican party that alex jones is quote deeply racist and then
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.840]  not show what i said it's like they don't even have to it's like saying you
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.320]  know alex jones robs banks and then showing no proof it's a new level of
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:32.880]  slander libel defamation but i've got to say it doesn't work anymore because they
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:36.360]  say it to everybody and i've seen them say if libertarian or conservative or
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:42.760]  christian black leaders that that that they're racist or they're anti-black it's
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:49.320]  just such a hoax and i see that you know 95% of blacks vote democrat i mean
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:55.480]  that is just bizarre how do you break that hoax how do you break that mind
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:42:01.120]  control by doing exactly what we're doing right now alex screaming it from
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:08.480]  the rooftops but this is what i want to say to you so called a white the sake of
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:14.520]  conversation it's necessary there has been a method biology used for a number
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:19.960]  of years now particularly from the 70s forward it's called white guilt and white
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:27.600]  guilt is something that right now is in fact being exercised by so many on the
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:34.480]  left whenever there is anything that they want to brand us with or they want
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:39.600]  to disrail a program or an idea that we're trying to push forward and it's
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:46.200]  in total disagreement with them and it may be about to expose what's going on
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:50.800]  they throw out the race card or they throw out the uncle tom card and but
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:57.080]  particularly works on white folks conservative white folks white guilt i
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.440]  want to say to your white audience in particular get over it you know that you
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:06.680]  were not there for any lynchings or anything of that nature you know who
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:13.040]  you are and so i would say to you if they want to fight this fight then let's
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:17.240]  fight this fight and get it over with because as long as you run away from
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:22.680]  this fight they'll chase you with that white guilt and as far as myself and
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:27.840]  people like Herman and Alan West and and and and people like that i would say
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:33.600]  that when you look at the democrat party you are looking at a plantation and let
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:39.560]  me tell you why i say that back in the days of slavery when that slave ran away
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:45.000]  to the north he didn't see many free black faces like he saw in the south
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.720]  where he was in a system where there was nothing but black faces i see in the
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:55.560]  democrat party often so many blacks and people ask see how come there's more
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:59.960]  blacks in the democrat party than there are in the republican party it's the
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:04.760]  same reason there were more slaves on a plantation than there were in the north
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:10.000]  it's because there were very few of us who had the courage to leave that system
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.920]  of tyranny and find freedom for ourselves and so i would say that your
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:18.920]  white audience get over the white guilt and i would say to the black audience
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:24.440]  it's okay to leave the plantation as my good friend mason weaver has wrote a
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:30.320]  book about well there's no doubt that the democrats were set up in modern times
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:34.440]  by Margaret Sanger and it's just been absolutely devastating and that same
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:38.680]  cultural destruction is being visited on everybody because the state with
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:42.400]  cloward and piven as you know wants us dependent on the system and it's more
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:45.960]  of a sharecropping system which is slavery as well where we literally owe
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:51.640]  our soul to the company store which is the establishment is the food stamps is
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:55.320]  the system can't have men in the house i mean this has been a systematic program
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:58.440]  for those that don't know reverend break down as you do a great job in the film
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:04.120]  runaway slave break down how they have brought blacks back on to the share
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:08.160] cropping system because you do a great job on that on the film and what the
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:13.120]  numbers are the illegitimacy the drop in income that the incarceration all of it
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:21.640]  72% of black babies are born outside of wetlock those are the ones who are born
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:25.800]  but this is a more grabbing statistic for you taking consider and i don't care
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:30.280]  what your politics is on this particular subject that i'm about to to mention but
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:36.440]  just look at these numbers you have 43% of all abortions performed in this
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:43.520]  country performed on black babies we're only 12% of the population in the state
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.840]  of new york in 2008 more black babies were aborted than born now doesn't matter
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:54.440]  what your politics is on that again those numbers though are very troubling
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:46:01.240]  when you talk about just 7% of the population when we talk about how to get
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:05.920]  them further enslaved this is what the government is found and this is what
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.880]  they use barack obama to do they have found that the slave or the person that
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:16.560]  they want to bring into shackles he doesn't necessarily want freedom what
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:22.280]  he wants is comfort more food on the table a more comfortable florida lay on
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:28.080]  those types of things he doesn't necessarily want freedom he wants
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.400]  comfort and so we'll give him a cell phone we'll make him think that he's
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:36.880]  going to get free health care we'll make him think that we're going to make his
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:44.040]  life better with words but all the time taking those things away from him
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:49.760]  making him codependent there's a sick relationship that black people have
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:54.600]  developed not only with government but with money and I gotta tell you this
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:47:01.040]  Alex back when I was growing up before integration before 1968 here in Louisiana
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:07.280]  before it all began to happen there was a thriving black business community you
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:12.960]  had all types of businesses that were black owned why because we had to rely
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:18.040]  on ourselves segregation was good but that which does not kill you only makes
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:23.520]  you stronger absolutely right absolutely right and of course we wanted to
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:29.560]  progress from the point where it was black only or white only of course we
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:36.720]  did but this is one thing that we must know we were a better people in every
[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:42.800]  way morally we were a better people as far as family values were concerned when
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:49.920]  we were segregated then we are now that we can go anywhere we want to go and do
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:56.000]  anything we want to do why because we were not codependent upon somebody
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:00.840]  giving us some type of handout sure the analogy I use is like if you they don't
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:04.760]  think it's any humans tomorrow so they develop some type of antigrav because
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.720]  your heart falls apart your bones turn to jello you turn weak and it's not that
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.160]  the oppression was good but then but it was better than a nanny state because
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:16.600]  at least the oppression made you have cultural muscles to know who you were
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:21.360]  and to be independent and strong which is the case in any part of history or
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:26.280]  any culture now it's this creeping death nanny state which is totally
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:31.080]  destructive even in our school systems then when the schools were segregated
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:37.000]  and Lord knows I don't want anyone to get me wrong I'm not saying that that the
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.800]  field was level back then it was not sure they just traded one evil for
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:46.040]  another exactly and but this is what I knew about that black teacher in the
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.480]  school room when I was in a segregated school I knew that she wanted me to excel
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:58.200]  she wanted me to achieve she wanted me to be the hope of the future and once
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:05.920]  that went away that type of infuse made into my my personal character also went
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:10.720]  away exactly going under real oppression made people work harder you know to be
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:14.200]  able to be strong and resist but then the new system makes you think you've
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.440]  won here's your government paycheck and the society degenerates that is the
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.300]  nanny state that is clowered and piven that is collectivism that is
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:26.960]  communism that is slavery that is dehumanization and look at the facts
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:34.600]  it is it absolutely is and that is also the hardest thing to get black folks to
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:37.600]  understand and when you look at affirmative action it was Richard
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:42.220]  Nixon who actually put that into into play when you look at Martin Luther
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:46.320]  King day it was Ronald Reagan who gave us Martin Luther King day you know all
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:51.680]  the major achievements that have been won for black folks over the years have
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:57.440]  actually come from the Republican Party but somehow the Democrats have hijacked
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.560]  what has happened to us historically I tell you and Barack Obama has been the
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.760]  secret weapon he just it's unbelievable what he gets away with it is
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.400]  unbelievable but he was a grand deception you know I say this sometimes
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:17.720]  and people look at me like I'm out of my mind but the fact of the matter is Al
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:23.080]  Sharpton would have made a better president than this guy did because at
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:27.520]  least we know where Al's coming from most folks don't understand the global
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:34.600]  world view that Obama has of America and its its role in the world I think Al
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.320]  or Jesse would have been a better president even though I would not have
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.240]  voted for either one well they're definitely more American than Obama I
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.840]  mean Obama is like a synthetic manufactured you know he just is I

[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.400]  and the older I get especially I realize what goes around comes around I want
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:45.120]  everybody to prosper I want everybody to be happy and you know I go off the
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:48.760]  character of what people stand for and I mean if somebody's got beautiful music
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:51.440]  they make I don't care what color they are I'm a fan of them if somebody's a
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:54.520]  great painter I don't care what color they are I'm a great fan if somebody can
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:57.960]  carve great cabinets for my house I don't care what color they are if
[02:54:57.960 --> 02:55:01.560]  somebody's trustworthy I don't care what color they are and the system is so
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:08.520]  corrupt it wants to make it all about color instead of about deeds just like
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:13.400]  they want to collectivist system not based on free will free association and
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  it's so frustrating to see this that a lot of white folks voted for Obama to
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:21.760]  get him elected and I I didn't think he'd be good but I thought well at least
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.760]  maybe I was so naive maybe it'll create more unity boy I was stupid and I don't
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:30.920]  usually make mistakes and I wasn't a supporter of Obama I just I said well
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:34.240]  maybe at least this will no no they don't want to bury any of this stuff they
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:38.920]  want to make it worse they want to keep it going and it really has made me from
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:42.240]  just being someone who didn't like the Democrats to really realizing they are
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:47.240]  really a group of nasty scum and at the top not not not you're running the mill
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:52.280]  Democrat and they've got to be dealt with how do we defeat Obama and and how
[02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:55.800]  do we take over the Republican Party and make them actually stand for good
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:58.840]  stuff instead of playing ball with the system because there's not going to be a
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.400]  country down the road if we don't turn this around Reverend I'm gonna need
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  people like you on the trail with me this summer and into the early fall we
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.000]  have what's called the content of character tour that we'll be doing about
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:19.040]  five of them on college campuses or across the country here in the coming
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:23.360]  months and weeks and what we're telling young people we're gonna have to
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:27.960]  recapture the hearts and minds of young people with the truth we're gonna be
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.400]  telling young people that any fool can take off the table what someone else is
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.160]  placed on the table but it takes the content of character to contribute to
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:41.560]  the betterment of your society and I think our young people are very well
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:47.840]  prepared right now to receive that message because they understand that
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:52.240]  yes we want to help people but young people don't necessarily want to support
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:57.280]  other other folks we want to help them but they don't want them you to ride
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:03.200]  their back and right now young people are beginning to awaken and I think it's
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:08.640]  going to take people like yourself myself and others like us like minds to
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:16.840]  in fact carry this message I may know I am a fellow with Freedom Works and very
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:23.080]  libertarian leaning but also we are working in order to perhaps revamp the
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:28.000]  Republican Party and I like the word that you use take over we're gonna take
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:31.880]  it over and we got to revamp it and make it into something that they may go
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:38.240]  kicking and streaming to become but if we are to win in this war we're going to
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:42.620]  have to do something different than we've been doing I agree and look folks if
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:45.880]  you want to still be a Democrat take over your party it's just it's we've got
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:50.280]  I mean you watch MSNBC it's like a Twilight Zone episode I mean the lies
[02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:55.720]  the division it's like listen to a clan rally but for minorities and it's just
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:59.080]  disgusting Reverend Brian thank you so much and you've just made great

[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:52.040]  stage some war so Putin concedes more power and Obama can that wouldn't be the
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:55.880]  first time they pulled stuff like this the globalist Hitler installing it over
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:00.920]  Poland that's a possibility but I don't think that's what's going on I think
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:05.840]  this is probably real and I it's just so over the top I don't even know what to
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:10.920]  say right now it's so over the top with the chairman joint chiefs said they're
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:18.280]  ready for military action Kerry saying do it we say or else by next Monday I think
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:21.560]  the Russians are going to obstinately sit there all they've done is take over
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:25.080]  military bases that were already theirs and secure their gas pipelines when the
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:28.200]  West overthrew the elective government you can say what you want about it the
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:32.000]  West started this we lose the moral high ground we're overrun by criminals that
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:40.160]  run the government and it's just we it's classic arrogance by an elite classic
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:45.000]  arrogance by an elite and they already almost had World War three with the
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:51.200]  Russians back in 2008 with Georgia so I've never been to Russia folks I'm an
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:56.360]  American and that but the media is like well if you're pro-america you got to
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:01.840]  be for attacking Russia what I'm pro-america I got to set myself on fire
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.520]  to or if I'm not a racist I got to turn my guns in you know I'm sick of all this
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:12.160]  moral high ground garbage Ron Paul's come out and said Ukraine has a right to
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:18.000]  be annexed into Russia if they choose to secede under common law and it's already
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:22.520]  been part of Russia and they've got military bases there the US has got
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:25.800]  military bases everywhere doesn't mean we've invaded all those countries I'm
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:28.600]  not even saying that's good and he says quote he's no angel
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:32.680]  Putin's no angel and Russia's got big problems but the West is starting this
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:38.040]  any geopolitical analyst who wants to be honest look Ron Paul's job he's on
[03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:43.720]  next week and my job is really easy you study all the angles you tell people the
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:49.160]  truth okay and from a common law perspective folks from a justice
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:59.920]  perspective what we're being drug into with the Ukraine is bad mojo period you
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:03.320]  can't point at the other guy and go well he's a bad guy too if you're the one
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:06.480]  climbs into the ring and knocks him upside the head you don't have anything
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:13.840]  to say when he starts swinging back you know don't write checks your butt can't
