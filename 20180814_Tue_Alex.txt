[00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:26.467]  Only 84 days left, the most important election in U.S.
[00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:27.448]  history.
[00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:30.369]  The balance not just of this country, but the world is in the balance.
[00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:43.856]  The CHICOMs are now openly involved in the manipulation of our internal elections in a big way.
[00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.437]  I'm going to go to a special report.
[00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.498]  When we come back, I'm going to re-kick off the transmission.
[00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:56.065]  Because we could not have more momentous things to deal with, more momentous issues to cover.
[00:00:56.065 --> 00:01:09.451]  And I'm just telling every listener and viewer, if you just tuned in for the first time, find out who we really are, not what the corporate media has to say about us, and realize whether you're listening on local radio stations or TV stations, or whether you are.
[00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:11.793]  Listening to us online.
[00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:18.378]  However you're listening or watching, spread the word because they're attempting to snuff out not just our First Amendment, but your First Amendment right now.
[00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:26.163]  And even the Washington Times has one of their military correspondents and Fox News contributors saying they believe the Chi-Coms are behind my deplatforming.
[00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:28.965]  But first, I want to go to this short report.
[00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:34.229]  H3 podcast stream is terminated for talking about Alex Jones.
[00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.650]  We reported this over the weekend, but there's many examples of this.
[00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.451]  But now we actually have the video.
[00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:38.792]  Here it is.
[00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:46.156]  Alex Jones, you all know him, the notorious conspiracy theorist, right wing.
[00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.818]  I want to say a lot of people consider him right, right wing.
[00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:49.879]  I don't consider him right wing.
[00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.201]  I consider him an alien.
[00:01:53.201 --> 00:02:01.747]  I feel like I'm making him affiliated with a political party is like trying to pin down like what country you exist to on Mars.
[00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:08.071]  He was recently banned by YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Facebook.
[00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:08.591]  Banned.
[00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:09.632]  All the channels removed.
[00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:21.675]  Just days after banning Alex Jones from their platform, YouTube cut off the popular H3 livestream just minutes after they began discussing Alex Jones.
[00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.074]  And for what it's worth, they were defending YouTube.
[00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:29.276]  I don't think he really believes what he says.
[00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:36.483]  Like, about all the crazy stuff that... Well... Yeah, that's definitely debatable.
[00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:39.446]  Um... Hey guys, uh, let me cut in real quick.
[00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:42.709]  Um... Yeah.
[00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.070]  Wow.
[00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.512]  We, uh, we just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:46.253]  They just killed our stream.
[00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:47.953]  Really?
[00:02:47.953 --> 00:02:48.734]  Yep.
[00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:49.634]  Why?
[00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.255]  Community guidelines.
[00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:51.975]  Wow.
[00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:54.316]  We can't even show his footage.
[00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:54.977]  What?
[00:02:54.977 --> 00:02:55.497]  What?
[00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:57.298]  Are you fucking stupid?
[00:02:57.298 --> 00:02:57.598]  I'm not.
[00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:59.118]  Because it's been removed?
[00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:06.642]  We were live streaming and right as we were getting into it, you guys saw after watching the VOD, you two, in their infinite wisdom,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.842]  Removed our live stream and gave us a strike.
[00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:14.984]  Which, basically, when you get a strike, you can't live stream anymore.
[00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:20.488]  So some genius over at LiveTube... LiveTube?
[00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:23.230]  I'm having a f***ing... I'm not!
[00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.251]  You see what it's doing to me?
[00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:24.331]  I'm...
[00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:33.015]  My whole rant, as I was just getting into, was very, I'm taking YouTube's side.
[00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:48.122]  That Alex Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist, who violated the terms of service, was doing all this s*** that shouldn't, that by YouTube's terms of service shouldn't be allowed, and what the f*** does YouTube do?
[00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.899]  They're like, you know what we need to do?
[00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.760]  Ethan is defending us.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.421]  Ethan is defending us against Alex Jones right now.
[00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:09.083]  Do you know what we can do in one fell swoop to legitimize Alex Jones and to piss Ethan off and turn him against us?
[00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:15.304]  Let's shut his channel down and give him a strike mid-livestream.
[00:04:15.304 --> 00:04:16.144]  It's brilliant.
[00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:17.045]  Let's do that.
[00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:17.565]  Shut it down.
[00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:17.885]  What the f***?
[00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:21.986]  Full reports on Infowars.com.
[00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:23.507]  This is being done to a lot of people.
[00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:24.789]  It's called deplatforming.
[00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.230]  It's like China.
[00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.313]  If you talk about the dictator looking like Winnie the Pooh, you get banned from the internet.
[00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:37.939]  It's a global social score, and you guys complying with it, all you podcasters going along with it are going to bring it into America.
[00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.402]  This is the admitted global plan.
[00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:46.526]  Now, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, the big news is straight ahead.
[00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.330]  They are preparing the fake n-word tape.
[00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.197]  We've been warning of this for years, and of course YouTube deleted our video about it, detailing how they can do it.
[00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:57.460]  If they already had it, they would have already used it.
[00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.827]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:12.971]  There's a big event coming.
[00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.094]  A group of big events.
[00:06:16.094 --> 00:06:17.418]  A firestorm.
[00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:21.508]  We're now only 84 days out from the most important election in U.S.
[00:06:21.508 --> 00:06:21.749]  history.
[00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:27.253]  November 8th, 2016 only established the beachhead to return the Republic.
[00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:32.335]  Prosperity began to come almost instantly, as the globalist boot was lessened on our neck.
[00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:44.659]  But now, they're striking back with every form of propaganda and disinformation they've got, and they're deplatforming and banning conservatives, nationalists, and patriots across the board, as Communist China spreads its wicked wings.
[00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:47.901]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:49.703]  This is the info war.
[00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:57.229]  Why is Amorosa out there floating this fake n-word tape that she's never heard or never seen but some aides told her they might have heard?
[00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:06.898]  It's all been cooked up from the beginning according to our inside sources that warned of Amorosa when he first hired her that she was a Trojan horse set up to make sure the black vote doesn't go to Trump.
[00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:08.839]  Why are they panicking?
[00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:12.440]  With African Americans and Hispanics, Trump's numbers have doubled in the last year.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.341]  No Republican's ever had such support.
[00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:16.602]  The landslide's accelerating.
[00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.263]  The Democratic Party wants to keep folks on the plantation.
[00:07:19.263 --> 00:07:22.565]  And to stop things like this.
[00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:24.686]  We are drugged out!
[00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:26.947]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:30.865]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:32.745]  Today, it all changes.
[00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:35.485]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:07:35.485 --> 00:07:38.566]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:43.307]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:07:43.307 --> 00:07:46.448]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:07:46.448 --> 00:07:48.828]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:51.248]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:07:51.248 --> 00:07:52.889]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.049]  We have the resources.
[00:07:57.452 --> 00:08:00.895]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:08:00.895 --> 00:08:02.437]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:04.058]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:08:04.058 --> 00:08:05.119]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:06.201]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.603]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:08:08.603 --> 00:08:13.768]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:17.892]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:19.634]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:33.165]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:39.769]  Hard to believe it's already the 14th day of August 2018.
[00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.772]  We have a lot of news, obviously, to break down and a lot of news to cover here.
[00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:53.218]  They are cracking down, not just on my shelf, but thousands of other prominent nationalists and conservatives in organized crime.
[00:08:53.218 --> 00:08:56.861]  They have CNN and the mainstream corporate media lying about what we've said and done
[00:08:58.234 --> 00:09:06.277]  To build the straw man and then have us de-platformed to set the precedent for everyone else to be de-platformed.
[00:09:06.277 --> 00:09:08.438]  And it's all moving into high gear.
[00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:22.123]  Now coming up in the next segment, I'm gonna lay out the scientific facts, the evidence, what we covered a year and a half ago about Photoshop for voice faces backlash two years ago.
[00:09:22.123 --> 00:09:27.305]  They released it to a limited group, had to pull it back because it can break voice print codes.
[00:09:29.364 --> 00:09:33.589]  It is indistinguishable from the real person's voice.
[00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:39.957]  If they can get a recording of you for even 30 seconds, they can perfectly fake it.
[00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:42.260]  And now, you know they would have used an inward tape.
[00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.812]  If they had it back during the election or after, but they haven't.
[00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:53.534]  So now it's, oh, Abe's talking about, yeah, we hear there's one.
[00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:57.737]  He feels real bad about it, as if you can't get operatives inside the White House, which we know happened.
[00:09:57.737 --> 00:09:59.197]  We know Emma Rosa.
[00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:01.158]  We warned about Trump-Iron to begin with.
[00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:05.340]  Roger Stone's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.762]  We know that it's very easy for people to then sit there
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:24.910]  and basically repeat rumors or say what they want and then that becomes the thing that counters double the number of black americans, hispanic americans supporting trump as they see the economy coming back, optimism you know the lie about saying he hates all mexicans and says they're all rapists and criminals never was said.
[00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:34.737]  He said a lot of great people coming across we just want to vet who they are but you've also got a lot of rapists and murderers coming across which is totally true and the left is so behind covering this up that when the guy
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.923]  Shoot Kate Steinlein in the back and she dies.
[00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:46.989]  The government and the system says she's wonderful out in San Francisco and they let her go.
[00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:47.830]  They let the killer go.
[00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.033]  Even though he admits he shot her in the back.
[00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:56.958]  And there's other examples of that coming up today with all these Islamic terror attacks that we've been seeing.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.206]  With Westminster, it's been attacked several times by cars.
[00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:03.730]  Four people run over, thank God none of them are dead.
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.919]  We've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cars all over Sweden with the Stockholm Syndrome burned by Islamic gangs.
[00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:21.286]  You've got the media for a week with the report and the police saying they found a dead body of a child who'd been tortured and summed up a ritual, reportedly, according to the police, allegedly, but they now admit there's a dead body.
[00:11:21.286 --> 00:11:30.192]  And underground tunnels and all these weapons and they said they had witnesses that talked to the kids and others that gave them tips, that they were starving to death and didn't have water and were being trained for this.
[00:11:30.192 --> 00:11:35.456]  And the liberal judge, because they got up and said, oh, you're racist, oh, you're bad, oh, you're evil,
[00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:52.809]  The lawyer got up and said that for the five Muslim men who are connected to the famous mosque and all the rest of it and the World Trade Center bombing in the early 1990s, she releases them on $20,000 bond.
[00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:54.449]  That's $2,000 you have to pay.
[00:11:54.449 --> 00:12:01.630]  And waives that fee altogether and says she feels sorry for them.
[00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.310]  So that's the level of censorship.
[00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.911]  That's the level of virtue signaling that's going on.
[00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:25.695]  That the lawyer, I have the transcript here, for the Islamicist, said that if they were white or Christian, they wouldn't be here.
[00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:27.417]  We have that video and audio coming up as well.
[00:12:28.772 --> 00:12:31.333]  And it's just crazy.
[00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:56.118]  If you are Christian, and in a compound with rubber tires around it, and underground tunnels with starving people, and they found the body of a dead kid who got reported missing from another state, and the families are calling the police saying, please do something, and they just released people who had the body, admittedly, of a dead child who died in a ritual, according to witnesses,
[00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:17.844]  No, if you were a group of white people or black people or Hispanics or anybody else and you were out in a compound with tunnels in the ground and there's a dead body and the witnesses that called about it said they're training to go do school shootings and attack police, you would not be released from jail five days after you got arrested.
[00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:34.093]  But that's what, I mean, you can't even hardly find in the news that these are Islamic attacks in Sweden, or Islamic attacks in England, or Islamic attacks going on constantly.
[00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:35.733]  That's coming up as well.
[00:13:35.733 --> 00:13:45.876]  And then obviously the big story, all the censorship that's going on, and how it's expanding, and how people have got to counter it.
[00:13:45.876 --> 00:13:49.197]  But first, the whole Amorosa situation, when we come back,
[00:13:55.447 --> 00:13:56.628]  From the break on the other side.
[00:13:56.628 --> 00:14:02.955]  It's just, this is the coordinated attempt by the globalists to bring this country down.
[00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:05.017]  Let me stop right there.
[00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:11.024]  As everyone knows, we have had unmitigated attacks.
[00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:13.026]  They're trying to take our servers down right now.
[00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:16.330]  They are filing false reports, criminal false reports.
[00:14:18.088 --> 00:14:31.556]  Corporations, individuals, boards of governors and privately traded companies are defaming us with the claims they put out in the news for PR and to curry favor with big tech.
[00:14:31.556 --> 00:14:32.257]  It's all happening.
[00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:33.978]  This is how they shut down America.
[00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:36.760]  This is how they bring the Chinese-style credit score to America.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.562]  This is how they bring you can neither buy nor sell to America if you're not a good globalist.
[00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:45.020]  They've taken us off 26 platforms.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.741]  They're trying to get our credit card processing right now.
[00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:58.624]  They kicked us off Credio after we were kicked off AdRoll last year saying that we're promoting hatred when all we were selling was water filters, air filters, and high-quality supplements.
[00:14:58.624 --> 00:14:59.765]  We are being put into a
[00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:03.097]  Electronic gulag.
[00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:06.741]  We're being removed from the electronic ghetto, the electronic gulag.
[00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:11.846]  We're moving from being shadow banned to totally banned, and it's an incredibly dangerous time.
[00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.227]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:15:13.227 --> 00:15:20.775]  I want to thank you all for spreading the word, but the globalists are betting you're going to forget about what they've done to us and everybody else and just move on.
[00:15:20.775 --> 00:15:23.378]  No, this is the big issue for Congress, for the President,
[00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:28.792]  In fact, I had a stack in there from last night when I went live till 10, and I really need it bad.
[00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:36.194]  It had the new Senator Warner stuff where he wants EU-style censorship and to shut down, quote, fake news.
[00:15:36.194 --> 00:15:40.015]  And then I had the Chris Murphy news and all the rest of it saying shut us down.
[00:15:40.015 --> 00:15:42.736]  So they're all official now saying they're coming for all of you.
[00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:52.195]  Now, we have the only news app that has a 5.0 rating, a perfect rating, and is number one, and so they obviously want to shut that down too.
[00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:53.996]  That's how un-American these people are.
[00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:58.960]  They want to control what you hear and see, and they're allied with the greatest mass murderers in history, the Chi-Coms.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.561]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:06.864]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:16:06.864 --> 00:16:08.444]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:16.808]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:22.491]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:24.493]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:16:24.493 --> 00:16:26.775]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:31.159]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:33.361]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:03.761]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:05.544]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:16.817]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.578 --> 00:18:26.768]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.768 --> 00:18:37.319]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:40.441]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.162]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:52.147]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.147 --> 00:18:54.809]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:59.512]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:06.494]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.

[00:19:51.368 --> 00:19:55.489]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:59.610]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:21.535]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.535 --> 00:20:31.300]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.281]  Okay, I'm gonna get into
[00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:44.541]  This operation inward that the Democrats in the deep state have launched to try to keep black Americans and others on the Democratic Party plantation.
[00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:49.984]  Because they are absolutely waking up and coming over to the side of Trump.
[00:20:49.984 --> 00:20:52.025]  And I'm seeing it on the ground with everybody I know.
[00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:54.066]  That's very, very exciting.
[00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:57.188]  So right on time, this whole thing comes in here.
[00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:09.338]  To derail that, if they had a tape of Trump doing this, if NBC had a tape or anybody else had a tape, they would have already played that tape back in the election.
[00:21:10.913 --> 00:21:13.313]  And they would already be trying to leverage that on Trump.
[00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:27.296]  Trump has denied it, he says it's not true, and he says they also heavily edited the famous thing from him, you know, 14 years ago or whatever, 13 years ago, on the bush, where they're out there recording him, knowing he's mic'd up, about to come out.
[00:21:27.296 --> 00:21:35.578]  Imagine being the president now, surrounded with everybody with phones, they're trying to edit it, they're trying to take it out of context, it's incredible.
[00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:37.118]  And I've experienced this with Megyn Kelly.
[00:21:38.598 --> 00:21:52.206]  YouTube has now deleted the video that had millions of views, where I showed what I did live on air, unedited, where I said, I don't know if Hillary's running child sex rings, but I know she represented child molesters in court, made jokes about it, said she didn't care.
[00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:53.967]  Her husband settled a bunch of rape cases.
[00:21:53.967 --> 00:21:57.349]  They're in bed with Epstein, politically, flying on his airplane.
[00:21:57.349 --> 00:22:00.010]  He's a known child sex trafficker.
[00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:07.435]  But her funding the Middle East and her funding the Arab Spring has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, tens of thousands of women and children sold into sex slavery.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.081]  And then I showed news articles.
[00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:22.666]  So I said, so she is guilty of raping and murdering children because under federal law and common law, if you're the mafia boss and you order a murder, you're just as guilty as the person that does the murder.
[00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:23.926]  In fact, more.
[00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:24.987]  It's capital murder.
[00:22:24.987 --> 00:22:25.727]  It's premeditated.
[00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:29.366]  So I said, so she is guilty.
[00:22:29.366 --> 00:22:34.148]  That was video, sitting here in this chair, with an American flag behind me, whole nine yards.
[00:22:34.148 --> 00:22:41.851]  They took it, edited it, played audio on Fox News, Megyn Kelly, saying I said there were kids in a basement, and that she murdered them.
[00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:43.831]  They edited two different shows together.
[00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:46.152]  That is criminal.
[00:22:46.152 --> 00:22:50.254]  That is pure evil.
[00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:54.836]  So, I've experienced this, and I've seen them say that Trump took Martin Luther King's bust out.
[00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:57.641]  It was right there in the video.
[00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:02.686]  Or they didn't visit Congressman Scalise, or he fed the fish wrong, or blah blah blah.
[00:23:02.686 --> 00:23:08.792]  And by the way, we have some cards in the deck we haven't played dealing with what Trump thinks about black people.
[00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:11.716]  And I've been asked not to play those cards, so I'm not going to play those cards.
[00:23:12.981 --> 00:23:15.362]  People ask me not to, I won't, but it's the truth.
[00:23:15.362 --> 00:23:16.762]  Robert Jones joining us for the next segment.
[00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:26.404]  I want to play little snippets of the edited audio that CBS is playing, and then I want to show you what the real issue here is, because this is mainstream news right here.
[00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:30.505]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the internet.
[00:23:30.505 --> 00:23:31.625]  That's Reason.com.
[00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:34.366]  They're already doing it.
[00:23:34.366 --> 00:23:36.746]  They're already doing it.
[00:23:36.746 --> 00:23:39.987]  You don't announce an operation when you're doing it.
[00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:40.727]  We're in the middle of it.
[00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.511]  Zero heads.
[00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.351]  The revenge of Hillary.
[00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:46.812]  Senator Mark Warner proposes the end of free speech.
[00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:56.217]  A week after this came out, in reason, he now goes public and says, yeah, we're going to adopt EU rules that totally shut down free speech.
[00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:59.259]  I told you, Google and Facebook are going under EU fines.
[00:23:59.259 --> 00:24:00.780]  That's why this is coming here.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.920]  And the Chinese are involved.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.782]  This is foreign powers meddling in the Internet.
[00:24:04.782 --> 00:24:07.943]  Trump's leaving the web alone as Mr. Capitalist.
[00:24:07.943 --> 00:24:11.185]  But that's the same as giving it to China and the EU, Mr. President.
[00:24:13.226 --> 00:24:20.890]  Senator Murphy, Infowars, the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.952]  These companies must do more than take down a website.
[00:24:23.952 --> 00:24:25.613]  The survival of our democracy depends on it.
[00:24:25.613 --> 00:24:28.335]  They mean their corrupt globalist system.
[00:24:28.335 --> 00:24:31.036]  And then Noam Chomsky for four days warns this is pure evil.
[00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:35.799]  No one covers it but Drudge.
[00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.260]  They're making their move.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.421]  Now, before I go to this tape,
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.162]  Let's look at these articles right here.
[00:24:43.162 --> 00:24:49.808]  This is from years ago, and you can go to InfoWars.com and read our articles about it, but our videos demonstrating it are gone.
[00:24:49.808 --> 00:25:05.722]  We'll have to redo the videos demonstrating how we can record my voice and have me just read out the newspaper for 30 seconds, and then you can type in what you want it to say, and in a minute it translates it and is my voice, and you could have me never saying the N-word,
[00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:09.064]  And you could have me saying whatever you wanted.
[00:25:09.064 --> 00:25:11.726]  You could have me saying the most outlandish things.
[00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:14.727]  Adobe creates voice Photoshop.
[00:25:14.727 --> 00:25:18.249]  New technology allows users to alter speakers' words.
[00:25:18.249 --> 00:25:20.450]  2016.
[00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.672]  But the sensors say, nope, we can't see that now.
[00:25:24.597 --> 00:25:25.797]  All destroyed.
[00:25:25.797 --> 00:25:28.398]  Photoshop for voices.
[00:25:28.398 --> 00:25:29.259]  Faces backlash.
[00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:39.002]  They put it on the market, BBC reported, pulled it off because it allows people to take public recordings and then get voice prints, whatever you want, and frame people.
[00:25:39.002 --> 00:25:40.742]  So, that's the report.
[00:25:40.742 --> 00:25:41.843]  Read about Adobe VoCo.
[00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:43.483]  There's many other programs that do it.
[00:25:43.483 --> 00:25:47.365]  You've all seen, you know, 20 years ago, Forrest Gump shake hands with JFK.
[00:25:47.365 --> 00:25:48.005]  It never happened.
[00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:51.284]  This is how they fake it, this is how they do it.
[00:25:51.284 --> 00:25:53.626]  So, if they had this tape, they would have released it.
[00:25:53.626 --> 00:26:01.953]  But now they get people talking about rumors, people who denied it, people that said, you know, that it hadn't been said with this Frank Luntz.
[00:26:01.953 --> 00:26:05.316]  And then now, again, it's back to it.
[00:26:05.316 --> 00:26:10.480]  And then, obviously, if they're hypothetically talking about what if this comes out, then they're going to discuss how to spin it.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.162]  So, these are all highly edited tapes.
[00:26:12.162 --> 00:26:15.124]  Someone illegally recorded a lot of this in the Situation Room.
[00:26:16.052 --> 00:26:16.915]  This is just amazing.
[00:26:16.915 --> 00:26:18.461]  Let's go ahead and go to that tape.
[00:26:20.114 --> 00:26:27.296]  Manigault Newman claims to have heard a recording of President Trump using the N-word during his time on The Apprentice.
[00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:29.216]  You would never imagine he'd talk that way.
[00:26:29.216 --> 00:26:35.958]  In her new book, Unhinged, Omarosa claims the Trump campaign was aware of the existence of the tape.
[00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:47.001]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynne Patton, then assistant to Eric Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pierson, and campaign communications director Jason Miller.
[00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:51.507]  In which they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.271]  And they just didn't?
[00:27:01.271 --> 00:27:06.434]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then-candidate Trump about making the slur.
[00:27:06.434 --> 00:27:11.257]  I said, well, sir, can you think of any time that this might have happened?
[00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:12.337]  And he said, no.
[00:27:12.337 --> 00:27:13.478]  Well, that's not true.
[00:27:13.478 --> 00:27:16.820]  He goes, how do you think I should handle it?
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:23.944]  And I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa, which is, well, it depends on what scenario you're talking about.
[00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:26.446]  And he said, well, why don't you just go ahead and put it to bed?
[00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:28.998]  I don't know what the scam was.
[00:27:28.998 --> 00:27:29.878]  Yeah, he said it.
[00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:30.839]  He's American.
[00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:33.400]  Pearson denied the call ever took place.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.241]  Hit pause again.
[00:27:34.241 --> 00:27:35.641]  Back this up.
[00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:37.662]  Notice they're saying Trump said he didn't do it.
[00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:39.263]  So they're just wargaming.
[00:27:39.263 --> 00:27:40.204]  What if this is real?
[00:27:40.204 --> 00:27:41.745]  And he goes, no, it's not real.
[00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:44.306]  And Amorosa goes, no, that's not true.
[00:27:44.306 --> 00:27:47.768]  She's in there recording this, setting everybody up.
[00:27:47.768 --> 00:27:50.389]  And they can't even get what they want.
[00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:53.811]  And so now they're trying to pick this all apart because people sat there and wargamed it.
[00:27:53.811 --> 00:27:54.311]  Let's continue.
[00:27:56.162 --> 00:28:01.606]  Pearson denied the call ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[00:28:01.606 --> 00:28:04.888]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it.
[00:28:04.888 --> 00:28:06.470]  Did that happen?
[00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.570]  No, Ed.
[00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.651]  That did not happen.
[00:28:08.651 --> 00:28:12.954]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[00:28:12.954 --> 00:28:14.556]  CBS thinks you're stupid.
[00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:16.697]  We're going to go over this some more today.
[00:28:16.697 --> 00:28:18.359]  She said he denied it.
[00:28:19.355 --> 00:28:20.936]  Emma Rosa goes, that's not true.
[00:28:20.936 --> 00:28:22.818]  You can tell she's recording a phone call.
[00:28:22.818 --> 00:28:29.082]  So what she's saying is, is it isn't true that he did say he said it, not that she didn't have the phone call.
[00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:38.729]  And imagine trying to remember all this, while Emma Rosa, who begged for the job, is running around, this reality TV star, with the recording, wanting to be somebody big in mainstream media.
[00:28:38.729 --> 00:28:39.950]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.430]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.511]  Please remember, without you, you are who finances InfoWars.
[00:28:44.511 --> 00:28:45.192]  We won't be here.
[00:28:45.192 --> 00:28:50.934]  Go get some Mean as a Wolverine, Reelect45, InfoWars.com, Moe Enlave shirts.
[00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:51.714]  They're all there.
[00:28:51.714 --> 00:28:54.755]  There's no excuse not to support free speech and InfoWars.
[00:28:54.755 --> 00:28:58.076]  We've got the globalists on the run, but we need your support now more than ever.

[00:30:00.305 --> 00:30:04.266]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:30:04.266 --> 00:30:07.007]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:30:07.007 --> 00:30:11.808]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:30:11.808 --> 00:30:14.229]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:31:00.014 --> 00:31:10.605]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.605 --> 00:31:12.687]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:31:12.687 --> 00:31:15.550]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.731]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.372 --> 00:31:18.333]  We're good to go.
[00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:52.446]  Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.446 --> 00:31:55.749]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:58.892]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:01.174]  We knew it was coming.
[00:32:01.174 --> 00:32:02.615]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:15.885]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:16.886]  And then voila!
[00:32:16.886 --> 00:32:26.934]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:32:26.934 --> 00:32:27.814]  Go to InfoWars.com
[00:32:28.695 --> 00:32:29.015]  I think so.
[00:32:58.507 --> 00:33:02.849]  I don't want you to see.
[00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:11.152]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.152 --> 00:33:14.454]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.454 --> 00:33:16.094]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:36.418]  I wanted to get Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, on because when Trump was getting ready to hire Omarosa, he flipped out on air.
[00:33:36.418 --> 00:33:41.783]  And I know begged the White House not to do it, warned them.
[00:33:41.783 --> 00:33:46.708]  Here's Morgan has come out and said that she tried to get him to have sex with her to win Celebrity Apprentice.
[00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:49.955]  You can hear these tapes.
[00:33:49.955 --> 00:33:54.057]  You don't know if they're talking about the grabber by the you-know-what tape, this tape.
[00:33:54.057 --> 00:33:55.677]  Did Trump say the n-word?
[00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:57.418]  No, he says he didn't.
[00:33:57.418 --> 00:33:58.999]  No one's saying they heard a tape of this.
[00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:11.245]  This is all just rumors and innuendo of a lady running around with a phone for almost a year inside the White House and before that working with the campaign.
[00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:16.588]  But she's got a history in Haiti, too, so we're talking to Roger about this, but this is how they try to derail things.
[00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:18.189]  Meanwhile, even mainstream news
[00:34:19.656 --> 00:34:34.059]  Is having to admit that the shy comms are more and more taking control of this country and that they are the ones financing and pushing the takedown of yours truly off of the internet.
[00:34:34.059 --> 00:34:34.979]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:34:34.979 --> 00:34:38.820]  China is the threat and it may be too late.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:46.062]  The Washington Times, L. Todd Wood is a national security advisor to Fox News contributor.
[00:34:47.298 --> 00:34:49.039]  Military veteran from Special Operations.
[00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:52.321]  I'm not going to get into all the things he's done from the U.S.
[00:34:52.321 --> 00:35:02.988]  Air Force Academy, but he lays it out right here, some other scholarly work, that everything is CHICOM run, except the military and a few branches of the government.
[00:35:02.988 --> 00:35:06.190]  They totally took us over with the help of the Democrats and the globalists.
[00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:13.355]  So, remember when somebody's trying to get us back under the control of the people and bring rent prosperity, that the CHICOMs
[00:35:16.755 --> 00:35:17.215]  Are you kidding?
[00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:39.885]  Please tweet it from the Washington Times, not from InfoWars.
[00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:40.925]  I did post it in full.
[00:35:40.925 --> 00:35:43.605]  I don't normally do that, but it's all about me, and it's very, very accurate.
[00:35:43.605 --> 00:35:51.847]  So I posted the whole thing on InfoWars.com, and I'm going to tweet the Washington Times version to the world because it's so important.
[00:35:51.847 --> 00:35:54.028]  So understanding the threat, there it is.
[00:35:54.028 --> 00:35:57.669]  We'll get more into that coming up and the censorship that's happening.
[00:35:57.669 --> 00:35:58.909]  But right now, let me lay this out.
[00:35:59.997 --> 00:36:02.479]  They are suing us and trying to shut us down.
[00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:09.063]  Those suits aren't going well, but it's costing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for the big suits to defeat them.
[00:36:09.063 --> 00:36:12.485]  And they've got three Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[00:36:12.485 --> 00:36:15.187]  They've got a bunch of others that are very, very serious.
[00:36:15.187 --> 00:36:19.910]  If they can shut us down, it will be a big victory for the globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:25.794]  And they admit a overturning of the New York Times versus Sullivan, and basically the First Amendment.
[00:36:27.782 --> 00:36:29.623]  We can defeat this and we can be strong.
[00:36:29.623 --> 00:36:41.647]  They're trying to take our payment processors, they've taken our Credio, third-party advertising so we can't advertise on platforms, just supplements and air filtration, water filtration.
[00:36:41.647 --> 00:36:46.049]  We're not just here on air trying to get you to finance this operation.
[00:36:46.049 --> 00:36:54.932]  I reach out to other audiences and advertise, spend a lot of money to bring in the money we need to fund this operation.
[00:36:55.825 --> 00:36:58.586]  I love capitalism and I love businessmen and women.
[00:36:58.586 --> 00:37:06.267]  This is a patriot military operation, a organic resistance to the globalists.
[00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:16.690]  And so that's how I see it, is I'm an independent Texan, I'm an American, I know the globals are trying to take over, I built a system to fight them, we've been successful, we've helped reboot the resistance worldwide, not just here.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.201]  And the enemy knows that.
[00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:21.121]  So do you know how important InfoWars is?
[00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:22.062]  I know a lot of you do.
[00:37:22.062 --> 00:37:22.662]  Pray for us.
[00:37:22.662 --> 00:37:23.343]  Support us.
[00:37:23.343 --> 00:37:24.983]  Spread the articles, the videos.
[00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:27.244]  Tell people by hand, with little cards.
[00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:29.886]  Find out about Verboten InfoWars.
[00:37:29.886 --> 00:37:30.386]  You've done it.
[00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:33.307]  We have a 5.0 app.
[00:37:33.307 --> 00:37:39.150]  The only app in the App Store that's new is we're number one in both formats of Android and Apple.
[00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.431]  I tweeted this out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:37:40.431 --> 00:37:43.152]  I'll put it on screen, please.
[00:37:43.152 --> 00:37:43.792]  It is number
[00:37:45.968 --> 00:37:49.749]  One, and it is a 5.0.
[00:37:49.749 --> 00:37:53.471]  Just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, like I said during the break.
[00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:55.091]  Gotta set up for that.
[00:37:55.091 --> 00:38:06.335]  Just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, and it's one of the tweets from today, that it's a 5.0 in the Apple Store.
[00:38:06.335 --> 00:38:11.997]  And so that's why they're trying to get rid of it.
[00:38:11.997 --> 00:38:14.038]  That's why they're trying to remove it.
[00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:20.237]  Is because we launched it a month ago and it went into the top 40.
[00:38:20.237 --> 00:38:21.358]  Unheard of.
[00:38:21.358 --> 00:38:27.564]  Then it shot past the New York Times, CNN, Fox News, everything to the top.
[00:38:27.564 --> 00:38:28.985]  They don't know what to do.
[00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:31.587]  It's gonna go to number one period very, very soon.
[00:38:31.587 --> 00:38:33.149]  Not just in news.
[00:38:33.149 --> 00:38:35.030]  So, what happens when you're number one?
[00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.552]  CNN lobbies to have it removed.
[00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:45.258]  That is Chinese Communist-type behavior, and they have military officers in high-level Pentagon positions saying, no, it's the Chai Koms.
[00:38:45.258 --> 00:38:46.399]  Well, I was told it was.
[00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:56.229]  I was talking about Apple officially moving to China, Google helping censor over there and here, and we're helping put oxygen into that fire that'll save the country, and I'm a patriot.
[00:38:56.229 --> 00:38:59.772]  And I love all of you, and I know you appreciate me, but I'm just telling you.
[00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:10.461]  You need to go to InfoWarsTore.com and you need to get products that are game-changing, like our Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch for adults and children with the amino acids, or DNA Force Plus.
[00:39:10.461 --> 00:39:12.322]  Other leading brands are $300.
[00:39:12.322 --> 00:39:13.563]  It's discounted to $70-something.
[00:39:13.563 --> 00:39:15.784]  It's got very expensive PQQ, CoQ10.
[00:39:15.784 --> 00:39:18.326]  It's just huge levels in it.

[00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.612]  Very similar to Alpha Power, but a different formula.

[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.481]  You have to have iodine.
[00:40:08.481 --> 00:40:09.461]  It's electrochemical.

[00:40:32.485 --> 00:40:39.552]  But whatever you do, understand this is a war, and if they can shut us down, we have the Democrats officially saying they're going after everybody.
[00:40:39.552 --> 00:40:44.437]  And I want to spend a few minutes on that with Roger Stone, who's being sued by Obama and the globalists and everybody else.
[00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:46.399]  They're trying to set him up as well.
[00:40:46.399 --> 00:40:48.281]  We'll get into Amoroso when we come back.
[00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:52.465]  But in the few minutes we have here, I just read earlier when we started this segment,
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:07.786]  The Democrats are, it was secret documents a month ago, now they're officially saying, we're going to go with the EU model and the Chinese model, and we're going to have credit scores, and if you criticize the government or anybody, you're not going to be able to buy or sell, and we're going to fine everybody, and we're going to end freedom for our democracy.
[00:41:07.786 --> 00:41:08.406]  Those are quotes.
[00:41:08.406 --> 00:41:12.247]  This is, there should be millions in the streets calling for their resignations.
[00:41:12.247 --> 00:41:18.330]  They have gone pure authoritarian, Roger, and they're planning something big in the next 84 days before the election, I believe.
[00:41:22.108 --> 00:41:26.829]  What's been amazing is the way you called this from the very beginning.
[00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:41.594]  The phony harassment lawsuits, distorting what you said about Sandy Hook, distorting what you said about other important matters in the media, the false accusations against you that you were
[00:41:42.418 --> 00:41:46.500]  grooming someone who worked at InfoWars for gay sex.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.841]  The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[00:41:48.841 --> 00:41:54.564]  These were all laid out there to generate distorted negative headlines.
[00:41:54.564 --> 00:42:07.290]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to bump InfoWars and everything we do here off of all of these important social media platforms.
[00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.030]  It's insidious.
[00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:14.411]  It was a plan, it was formulatic, and you called it from the very beginning.
[00:42:14.411 --> 00:42:18.315]  Well, I've seen what they've done in other countries, what they've done where they're banning speech in France and in Brazil.
[00:42:18.315 --> 00:42:28.264]  We're going to talk about this more a little bit in the next hour when I come back into Amorosa and their big play, obviously, to get minorities not to vote for Republicans in the midterms and not to vote for their American birthright and freedom.
[00:42:29.065 --> 00:42:35.267]  They've been doing similar things to you, Roger, and the reason they had to panic and fully de-platform us is it wasn't working.
[00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:45.209]  But think about how bold that is, listeners and viewers, to literally begin unpersoning someone off of every platform and then targeting those that even talk about you or show you.
[00:42:45.209 --> 00:42:58.193]  This is the total end of free speech, using the big Google-Facebook system to censor everybody, with the head of Apple orchestrating the whole thing from his slave factories in China.
[00:42:59.184 --> 00:43:03.287]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:43:03.287 --> 00:43:10.371]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:15.194]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[00:44:13.163 --> 00:44:18.487]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:46:01.169 --> 00:46:05.731]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:06.311]  Thanks for calling.
[00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:07.731]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:11.333]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:24.477]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[00:46:24.597 --> 00:46:28.378]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[00:46:28.378 --> 00:46:35.279]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.
[00:46:35.279 --> 00:46:36.279]  It's all amazing.
[00:46:36.279 --> 00:46:36.879]  Thank you, brother.
[00:46:36.879 --> 00:46:45.481]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:46:45.481 --> 00:46:50.361]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:53.202]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:46:53.422 --> 00:46:56.484]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[00:46:56.484 --> 00:47:03.789]  1776 World War.
[00:47:03.789 --> 00:47:14.336]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.336 --> 00:47:18.499]  Sweden is on fire after organized car firebombing blitz.
[00:47:19.896 --> 00:47:23.897]  Another car rammed into four pedestrians at Parliament in England.
[00:47:23.897 --> 00:47:28.838]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:28.838 --> 00:47:30.699]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.699 --> 00:47:33.280]  A liberal judge from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.721]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[00:47:39.721 --> 00:47:49.024]  A liberal judge just released five people living in an armed compound with tunnels of starving children and the dead body of a young teenage boy.
[00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:56.220]  Because their lawyer said it was racist to hold them.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:04.924]  Even though witnesses and people that contact the police said that they were allegedly training for mass shootings and an uprising to kill police.
[00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:10.747]  Vimeo said that when I reported that it was fake news and banned me two days ago.
[00:48:10.747 --> 00:48:12.908]  I am sworn to defend this republic.
[00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:17.588]  And I gotta tell you, Roger Stone's here with us for this segment and the next.
[00:48:17.588 --> 00:48:24.193]  I wanna get into the whole Amorosa thing, but Roger, they are working around the clock to take our servers down right now.
[00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:28.677]  I've gotta have people up here at like midnight just to keep InfoWars.com up.
[00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:30.418]  NewsWars.com is up.
[00:48:30.418 --> 00:48:31.639]  PrisonPlanet.com's up.
[00:48:32.179 --> 00:48:35.702]  Uh, Europe Wars was down earlier today with stuff going on.
[00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:38.104]  I mean, we are under DDoS attacks, everything.
[00:48:38.104 --> 00:48:42.268]  And it just becomes the normal background that everyone's recording the president and editing it.
[00:48:42.268 --> 00:48:45.110]  Amorosa was the African-American liaison first.
[00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:49.214]  Sounds like they're talking about how to spin what's reportedly... So remember, they leaked it.
[00:48:49.214 --> 00:48:51.096]  Oh, also on the NBC tape.
[00:48:51.096 --> 00:48:52.077]  You can see what's happening now.
[00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:57.426]  Our best dead reckoning on this is that he'd always said that was edited.
[00:48:57.426 --> 00:48:59.327]  They're discussing, grab him by this.
[00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:00.628]  They say, did he say the N-word?
[00:49:00.628 --> 00:49:01.329]  No, he didn't.
[00:49:01.329 --> 00:49:04.391]  Amorosa goes, that's a lie.
[00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:06.413]  Jumps in, it's clearly all edited.
[00:49:06.413 --> 00:49:10.856]  Trump's denying it, but the media's spinning it like the aides are saying it was true.
[00:49:10.856 --> 00:49:14.759]  But when we played the audio earlier, we'll play it again in a moment, that's not what you hear, Roger.
[00:49:14.759 --> 00:49:17.521]  But let's get into Amorosa herself and her character first.
[00:49:19.637 --> 00:49:21.097]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:49:21.097 --> 00:49:39.242]  As you know, we broke the story here at InfoWars that early in the Trump administration that Omarosa had persuaded the president to send a delegation from the White House to Haiti for the inauguration
[00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:58.139]  of the new regime, which is really the old corrupt regime with some new front men that has robbed the Haitian people blind, which stole all of the earthquake relief money after that horrific natural disaster.
[00:49:59.001 --> 00:50:02.144]  And I think she should have been fired right then and there.
[00:50:02.144 --> 00:50:09.991]  The common denominator was a Democratic political consultant named Ron Daniels, who is a friend of Amorosa's.
[00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:15.676]  Amorosa traveled to Haiti with... By the way, let's go back, because I want to... Give me those exact headlines.
[00:50:15.676 --> 00:50:18.738]  I remember you... I was like, get off this Amorosa thing.
[00:50:18.738 --> 00:50:25.004]  You were coming on, you know, back then, like almost every day, and it was Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa.
[00:50:25.464 --> 00:50:30.028]  And you said, listen, she's a Democratic operative, she's going to set things up, and she's tied to corruption in Haiti.
[00:50:30.028 --> 00:50:31.590]  So, what were the headlines back then?
[00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.772]  Because I want to pull those up for viewers.
[00:50:33.772 --> 00:50:37.936]  The actual headline, I think, is, why is Omarosa helping the Clintons rape of Haiti?
[00:50:39.844 --> 00:50:43.486]  I think it's up on the InfoWars site.
[00:50:43.486 --> 00:50:46.768]  I believe it's also up at the Stone Cold Truth site.
[00:50:46.768 --> 00:50:49.190]  I think we cross-posted it at the time.
[00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:56.874]  I interviewed Azealia Odonto right here on InfoWars about this at least twice.
[00:50:56.874 --> 00:50:58.435]  So this woman is evil.
[00:50:58.435 --> 00:50:59.856]  She is not one of us.
[00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:03.178]  Now, I recognize why during the campaign,
[00:51:03.878 --> 00:51:16.345]  Having a person of color willing to campaign for the president to someone who knew him personally, someone who could attest that he is not a racist, he's not, was valuable.
[00:51:16.345 --> 00:51:22.069]  And she was loyal to Trump and Trump was loyal to her during the campaign.
[00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:31.394]  I think she did an extraordinary disservice to the Trump administration and to the country, trumping for these criminals in Haiti.
[00:51:31.394 --> 00:51:31.954]  But now,
[00:51:33.451 --> 00:51:38.834]  He'll have no scorn, he'll have no fury like a woman scorned.
[00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:41.215]  She was soaking up a huge paycheck.
[00:51:41.215 --> 00:51:43.357]  She was doing nothing.
[00:51:43.357 --> 00:51:47.459]  She was abusive to other members of the staff.
[00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:54.863]  She seemed to think because she had a prior personal relationship with the president that the rules did not apply to her.
[00:51:54.863 --> 00:51:57.084]  Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[00:51:57.084 --> 00:51:59.445]  Trump doesn't dislike black people or black women.
[00:52:02.062 --> 00:52:04.023]  We need to win this midterm.
[00:52:04.023 --> 00:52:07.744]  So I just, I have to know, there's some real ace cards floating around out there.
[00:52:07.744 --> 00:52:13.627]  And I just wonder, Roger, if that'll ever come out.
[00:52:13.627 --> 00:52:14.627]  Well, look.
[00:52:14.627 --> 00:52:17.088]  About Trump and Amorosa?
[00:52:17.088 --> 00:52:21.550]  I don't think Donald Trump ever had a romantic relationship with Amorosa.
[00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:27.453]  I do know that he did once date an African-American supermodel.
[00:52:27.453 --> 00:52:29.454]  Oh, wait, so you're going to go ahead and put this out now?
[00:52:29.454 --> 00:52:29.794]  Go ahead.
[00:52:30.552 --> 00:52:44.537]  At a time that he was single, a woman who appeared multiple times on the cover of Vogue, a stunningly beautiful woman who happened to be African American, he was single, she was single, so much for the idea that he is a racist.
[00:52:44.537 --> 00:52:47.158]  He doesn't have a racist bone in his body.
[00:52:47.158 --> 00:52:51.679]  And Roger, there's even more to the story, but we're just going to leave it at that, because this has not been reported.
[00:52:51.679 --> 00:52:57.161]  And I really think, regardless of what the president wants, at a certain point, we have to do what's best for him.
[00:52:58.103 --> 00:53:07.668]  Well, I'm going to be in Dallas, pardon me, I'm going to be in Austin for the next two days, and I think perhaps we can lay this whole story out, because I know Donald Trump.
[00:53:07.668 --> 00:53:08.908]  Forty years.
[00:53:08.908 --> 00:53:09.949]  He is not a racist.
[00:53:09.949 --> 00:53:14.691]  Well, let's just say that you were his wingman, and you know abso-100%-lutely he's not a racist.
[00:53:19.828 --> 00:53:21.029]  I know that for a fact.
[00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:22.909]  Look at some of his friends.
[00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:25.670]  Mike Tyson, Don King.
[00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:37.054]  Look at his courtship of this absolutely stunning black model, who was really on the cover of Vogue, I believe, three or four times, which is a record.
[00:53:37.054 --> 00:53:44.757]  Perhaps Anna Rosa may have aspired to have a romantic relationship with him when he was single, but I doubt he was interested.
[00:53:44.757 --> 00:53:47.658]  And now she turns out to be a lying viper.
[00:53:48.538 --> 00:53:56.185]  Let's take, for example, the claim in her book that the Republican pollster Frank Luntz heard Trump use the N-word.
[00:53:56.185 --> 00:53:56.685]  Not true.
[00:53:56.685 --> 00:53:58.186]  Well, I know Luntz.
[00:53:58.186 --> 00:54:00.488]  I've known him since he was 13 years old.
[00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:01.509]  He denies it.
[00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:06.813]  He said he never heard anything whatsoever, and that she never confirmed the same with him.
[00:54:06.813 --> 00:54:09.675]  So, look, her book is a piece of garbage.
[00:54:09.675 --> 00:54:16.020]  Well, I was about to say, though, I'm going to play this tape when we come back, but if you listen to it, the women are like, no, he said he didn't say it.
[00:54:16.781 --> 00:54:17.602]  But then they move on.
[00:54:17.602 --> 00:54:18.443]  What about the other stuff?
[00:54:18.443 --> 00:54:19.445]  Well, he's embarrassed about it.
[00:54:19.445 --> 00:54:23.971]  They're talking at the time, during the campaign, about the famous grabber by the you-know-what tape.
[00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:27.576]  So you can tell it's all edited, and then the women are saying, no, he didn't say it.
[00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:29.238]  She's like, no, no, that's a lie.
[00:54:29.238 --> 00:54:31.802]  You can see her trying to set him up back then.
[00:54:33.004 --> 00:54:34.084]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:34.084 --> 00:54:35.545]  This is all about her.
[00:54:35.545 --> 00:54:39.766]  It's all about her being fired in the blow to her ego.
[00:54:39.766 --> 00:54:41.686]  She was trying to acquire power.
[00:54:41.686 --> 00:54:45.187]  She was trying to acquire turf inside the White House.
[00:54:45.187 --> 00:54:47.647]  But essentially, she's incompetent.
[00:54:47.647 --> 00:54:53.529]  And she was not even effective in her outreach to the black community on behalf of this administration.
[00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:55.589]  My question is an obvious one, Alex.
[00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:58.850]  What's going to matter more to African American voters?
[00:54:59.945 --> 00:55:03.830]  The lowest unemployment rate among black Americans in U.S.
[00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:04.231]  history.
[00:55:05.143 --> 00:55:09.204]  Or the fact that Emma Rosa is butthurt about being fired.
[00:55:09.204 --> 00:55:10.904]  I think the answer is pretty clear.
[00:55:10.904 --> 00:55:15.705]  Well, even the Democrats at first said, illegally recording people in the Situation Room saying Kelly threatened her.
[00:55:15.705 --> 00:55:16.625]  That's the standard deal.
[00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:18.066]  Hey, you ought to resign.
[00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:19.106]  This will be a lot easier.
[00:55:19.106 --> 00:55:21.286]  I wouldn't tar your name.
[00:55:21.286 --> 00:55:22.506]  I wouldn't look disgruntled.
[00:55:22.506 --> 00:55:23.547]  We'll try to help you out.
[00:55:23.547 --> 00:55:25.547]  We'll give you a good recommendation.
[00:55:25.547 --> 00:55:30.128]  That's the standard deal when you work in a media or governmental type deal is, hey,
[00:55:30.996 --> 00:55:31.857]  I couldn't agree more.
[00:55:31.857 --> 00:55:33.718]  Look, we know that she asked to hold her wedding in the Rose Garden.
[00:55:50.129 --> 00:55:55.210]  No staff member has ever held a wedding in the Rose Garden.
[00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.811]  Members of the First Family, Tricia Nixon, for example, was married there.
[00:55:59.811 --> 00:56:03.892]  One of President Johnson's daughters was married there.
[00:56:03.892 --> 00:56:04.892]  That's appropriate.
[00:56:04.892 --> 00:56:06.732]  Staff members, not appropriate.
[00:56:06.732 --> 00:56:14.914]  So when that request is rejected by General Kelly, Omarosa just barges into the place and does what she wants anyway.
[00:56:14.914 --> 00:56:17.675]  There's grounds for firing right there.
[00:56:17.675 --> 00:56:19.415]  So this is all about her.
[00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:25.499]  What's amazing to me is the way the mainstream media, particularly CNN, has whipped this into a story.
[00:56:25.499 --> 00:56:27.400]  This is tabloid crap.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:38.508]  We've got the Chinese communists on the verge of taking over this country by the hijacking, or it's even worse, the sales of all our technology, and all they want to talk about is Omarosa.
[00:56:39.088 --> 00:56:40.328]  Tired of it!
[00:56:40.328 --> 00:56:41.068]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:43.289]  We're going to air this tape and then talk about the censorship.
[00:56:43.289 --> 00:56:46.490]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:50.571]  And please don't forget, we'll tell you about the Stone legal defense file when we come back.
[00:56:50.571 --> 00:56:52.131]  Without you, we're not going to be here.
[00:56:52.131 --> 00:56:53.991]  We are the folks taking action.
[00:56:53.991 --> 00:56:54.611]  We love you.
[00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:55.432]  We appreciate you.
[00:56:55.432 --> 00:56:57.092]  Without you, we will not be here.
[00:56:57.092 --> 00:57:05.894]  We're running a mega sale, free shipping on our best-selling supplements, t-shirts, books, films, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:07.076 --> 00:57:10.518]  You've driven the app to number one, and it's got a five star rating.

[00:57:22.426 --> 00:57:24.807]  The power of you and word of mouth is incredible.
[00:57:24.807 --> 00:57:27.609]  That's why they did thousands of articles a day lying about me until Sunday.
[00:57:28.129 --> 00:57:31.550]  And then the head of Apple, quarterbacking it, had a meeting and said he's getting too much attention.
[00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.391]  No more coverage.
[00:57:32.391 --> 00:57:36.132]  Well, we're covering it here, and thanks to DrugsReport.com, it's getting out as well.
[00:57:36.132 --> 00:57:38.653]  But InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:07.343]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:58:07.343 --> 00:58:09.524]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[00:58:09.764 --> 00:58:15.987]  Is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[00:58:15.987 --> 00:58:23.751]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:30.654]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:37.778]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:57.814 --> 00:59:01.597]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.597 --> 00:59:10.283]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.283 --> 00:59:14.886]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:14.886 --> 00:59:16.347]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:19.870]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:31.936]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.936 --> 00:59:39.899]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.899 --> 00:59:46.963]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.963 --> 00:59:49.704]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.878]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:20.516]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:24.882]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:29.067]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:29.067 --> 01:00:30.689]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.117 --> 01:00:41.262]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:50.412]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly.
[01:00:50.832 --> 01:00:56.857]  And a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:56.857 --> 01:01:07.684]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[01:01:07.684 --> 01:01:11.968]  But then the record skips, you hear the car crash sound, and all of it's gone.
[01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.489]  Five billion views, all of it destroyed.
[01:01:14.489 --> 01:01:16.851]  Because they don't want people to go back and see how right we've been.
[01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:17.452]  They're desperate.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.707]  But I am, unfortunately, having to prepare legal action to defend the First Amendment.
[01:01:23.707 --> 01:01:27.493]  And I've got letters going out to Google right now because they worked with a cartel to ban us.
[01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:28.915]  They made a big mistake.
[01:01:28.915 --> 01:01:31.799]  They're in antitrust violation right now, caught dead to rights.
[01:01:33.783 --> 01:01:34.644]  Going back to Roger Stone.
[01:01:34.644 --> 01:01:36.826]  Roger, let's play some of this CBS piece.
[01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.247]  Again, I could go over this for an hour.
[01:01:38.247 --> 01:01:39.968]  I could teach a college course on this.
[01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:48.535]  But just like Megyn Kelly edited tape of me talking about Hillary having people killed in Iraq, then they edited it to say kids in a pizza place on Fox News before she left.
[01:01:48.535 --> 01:01:51.037]  You can hear the women saying, no, he didn't say the N-word.
[01:01:51.037 --> 01:01:56.102]  And this is the famous debate when they were saying there was a rumored N-word on the grabber by the you-know-what tape.
[01:01:56.462 --> 01:02:07.475]  So they're then wargaming that, and Amorosa, day one, is like jumping in on the phone trying to say it's a lie, when she's acting like she's Trump's friend, before she even gets hired once he gets elected.
[01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:11.519]  This whole thing, like you said, she's been brought in by one of these top Democrats.
[01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:17.206]  I mean, my God, I wish Trump would have listened to you, because I know before he even hired her at the White House, you told him, don't do it.
[01:02:18.041 --> 01:02:19.401]  That is correct.
[01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:21.742]  I think she's been a quisling from the beginning.
[01:02:21.742 --> 01:02:27.543]  It's all about her, the aggrandizement of her, the accumulation of power by her.
[01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:30.484]  She's never shared the president's agenda.
[01:02:30.484 --> 01:02:33.044]  What she did in Haiti is disgraceful.
[01:02:33.044 --> 01:02:38.205]  During the campaign, the president pledged to be a friend to the Haitian people.
[01:02:38.205 --> 01:02:44.926]  The Bushes and the Clintons ripped off millions of dollars of the Haitian earthquake money, as we now know.
[01:02:44.926 --> 01:02:47.747]  Amorosa essentially helped perpetuate that.
[01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:55.439]  So she did no favors for this country or this administration and frankly, I was delighted to see General Kelly tan her.
[01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.943]  It was about time.
[01:02:57.943 --> 01:03:02.030]  Let's go ahead and roll the heavily edited tape and even the edited tape you can hear them stretching.
[01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.310]  Here it is.
[01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:18.991]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynne Patton, then assistant to Eric Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pearson, and campaign communications director Jason Miller, in which they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[01:03:18.991 --> 01:03:25.717]  I'm trying to find out at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure
[01:03:27.173 --> 01:03:28.714]  Has AIDS been it?
[01:03:28.714 --> 01:03:33.879]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then-candidate Trump about making the slur.
[01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:38.682]  I said, well, sir, can you think of any time that this might have happened?
[01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:39.783]  And he said, no.
[01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:41.104]  Well, that's not true.
[01:03:41.104 --> 01:03:41.625]  So?
[01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:44.267]  He goes, how do you think I should handle it?
[01:03:44.267 --> 01:03:51.373]  And I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa, which is, well, it depends on what scenario you're talking about.
[01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:53.895]  And he said, well, why don't you just go ahead and put it to bed?
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.581]  I don't know what to say.
[01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:56.441]  He said it.
[01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:57.302]  Yeah, he said it.
[01:03:57.302 --> 01:03:58.263]  He's a man.
[01:03:58.263 --> 01:04:03.706]  Pearson denied the call ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:06.988]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it.
[01:04:06.988 --> 01:04:07.549]  Did that happen?
[01:04:08.562 --> 01:04:09.663]  No, Ed.
[01:04:09.663 --> 01:04:10.743]  That did not happen.
[01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:12.964]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[01:04:29.572 --> 01:04:31.794]  You hear that hammered, edited tape.
[01:04:31.794 --> 01:04:34.136]  You hear the woman say, no, he didn't say it.
[01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.838]  Somebody jumps in and says he does.
[01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.279]  And it's October 2016.
[01:04:37.279 --> 01:04:42.043]  They admit they're discussing what could be on the NBC grab-em-by-the-you-know-what tape.
[01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:44.565]  And it was all rumored at the time that was in there.
[01:04:44.565 --> 01:04:47.888]  So they're wargaming all angles and arguing about this.
[01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.149]  Hysterical.
[01:04:49.149 --> 01:04:50.490]  Clocking around.
[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.812]  And that becomes the proof of this.
[01:04:52.812 --> 01:04:53.592]  Unbelievable.
[01:04:53.592 --> 01:04:56.155]  We'll put bookends on this straight ahead with Roger Stone then.

[01:05:20.515 --> 01:05:22.937]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:22.937 --> 01:05:26.499]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:26.499 --> 01:05:30.383]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.

[01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.392]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com.
[01:05:41.952 --> 01:05:44.454]  About winter sun, vitamin D3.
[01:05:44.454 --> 01:05:50.379]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:52.521]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:05:52.521 --> 01:06:01.409]  Visit Infowars.com today, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:01.409 --> 01:06:04.111]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:09.276]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:31.655]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and let me tell you, people ask me, how are you doing being demonized in thousands of articles, every news channel being lied about?
[01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:41.218]  Well, this is a war to take back the country, and this is what I expected would happen to the people at the turning point, but I didn't know I'd be right at the tip of the spear here.
[01:06:41.218 --> 01:06:45.239]  So we're going to be wargaming all this geopolitical and more with Joel Skousen.
[01:06:46.319 --> 01:06:51.540]  World Affairs Brief coming up here in about five minutes, but I wanted to finish up with Roger Stone, former head of the campaign.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:07:08.303]  You're going to be coming to Austin tomorrow, and we're going to spend a few days, and I know you have not wanted to ever break any confidence with the president you've known for 40-plus years, and who you were, even the New York Times admitted 20 years ago, were his wingman for decades.
[01:07:08.303 --> 01:07:15.044]  When he was not married, you guys would go out and date ladies together.
[01:07:15.684 --> 01:07:41.755]  And you, and I didn't just get a lot of this from you, I read about it in the New York Times back when they were more accurate years ago, because I was trying to figure out who Trump really was about four or five years ago when all this started, or four years ago, and how, you know, his lawyer was the head of the House Un-American, Senate Un-American Committee for, you know, obviously the fellow that led the fight against that, famously, and who's now been proven completely correct.
[01:07:42.595 --> 01:07:43.096]  I don't
[01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:11.799]  So you agree this is their attempt with double the number of black Americans and Hispanics saying they're going to vote for Republicans in the midterm, turning around, really liking Trump, getting it's all a big lie.
[01:08:11.799 --> 01:08:12.639]  This is the counter.
[01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:20.964]  This is their play amongst others to try to make sure that the Republicans lose this critical midterm election.
[01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:21.904]  There's no question.
[01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:26.467]  Look, the declarations by Kanye West have had a devastating effect on them.
[01:08:27.165 --> 01:08:32.367]  So this is, in the pop culture, this is an attempt to undo that.
[01:08:32.367 --> 01:08:43.310]  Record number of African Americans now moving towards the Trump position, moving towards the Republican Party, which of course is logical because we are the party of emancipation.
[01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:45.510]  We are the party of civil rights.
[01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:47.271]  We are the party of Lincoln.
[01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:53.916]  And therefore they're hysterical about it because a small shift in that vote can make the difference.
[01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:56.477]  Let's look at the 2016 elections.
[01:08:56.477 --> 01:09:01.541]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Detroit gives Donald Trump Michigan.
[01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:07.405]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Milwaukee gives Trump Wisconsin.
[01:09:07.405 --> 01:09:12.229]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Philadelphia gives Trump Pennsylvania.
[01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:18.394]  Places where Mitt Romney and John McCain fell short.
[01:09:18.394 --> 01:09:25.079]  So they are petrified that Trump is changing the political zeitgeist.
[01:09:25.079 --> 01:09:28.601]  He's changing and forging a new coalition.
[01:09:28.601 --> 01:09:30.963]  Hopefully a permanent coalition.
[01:09:30.963 --> 01:09:32.184]  So what do we do?
[01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:36.888]  We trot out Omarosa and her pack of lies and her pack of fabrications.
[01:09:37.288 --> 01:09:41.851]  Where she consistently contradicts everything she said previously.
[01:09:41.851 --> 01:09:45.773]  This is so transparent, Alex, it's almost nauseating.
[01:09:45.773 --> 01:09:47.675]  I don't think the American people will buy it.
[01:09:47.675 --> 01:09:49.055]  I'll tell you why.
[01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:57.641]  Jobs in our inner cities, jobs in our black community, opportunities are far more important than anything Omarosa has to say.
[01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:02.422]  And especially black Americans know they were totally abandoned by Obama.
[01:10:02.422 --> 01:10:04.363]  Their unemployment almost doubled under Obama.
[01:10:04.363 --> 01:10:05.083]  It was just hellish.
[01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.124]  He just thought he had them, so he threw them to the curb.
[01:10:07.124 --> 01:10:11.085]  Trump has really been focusing on this and really trying to get factories in, and folks know that.
[01:10:11.085 --> 01:10:12.405]  So it's very exciting.
[01:10:12.405 --> 01:10:13.385]  Let me just add this point.
[01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:15.066]  They're really trying to take us down.
[01:10:15.066 --> 01:10:21.388]  We've had NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and EuropeWars all targeted because they're not on the biggest servers.
[01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:23.328]  They're on huge ones.
[01:10:23.328 --> 01:10:29.351]  InfoWars is on really fancy, high-tech systems with systems in front of it, you name it.
[01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:31.832]  But it's been going down since this weekend intermittently.
[01:10:31.832 --> 01:10:37.634]  InfoWars.com is now down and under attack.
[01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:41.676]  And we've had people inside companies, you tell us, oh, your software, you can't use it now.
[01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:43.316]  And then we contact the head of the companies.
[01:10:43.316 --> 01:10:45.117]  I'm not going to say names.
[01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:47.638]  It's not Cloudflare that's doing this.
[01:10:47.638 --> 01:10:49.699]  And they say, no, that's a mutiny inside our operation.
[01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:50.139]  They say, well,
[01:10:50.819 --> 01:10:54.081]  Basically, someone did that who's unauthorized.
[01:10:54.081 --> 01:11:02.268]  Show, and I want to be clear, it's not CloudFlare, it's a software company, one of the top ones everybody knows the name of, that had that happen over the weekend.
[01:11:02.268 --> 01:11:07.491]  And they didn't ask me not to say their name, I'm just trying to, you know, have some privacy here.
[01:11:07.491 --> 01:11:10.774]  But they're not trying to take us off our payment systems, they've actually taken one
[01:11:12.415 --> 01:11:13.696]  Chopping cart down.
[01:11:13.696 --> 01:11:16.137]  They are taking our comment section away.
[01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:18.638]  We had to put a new one in that isn't as popular yet.
[01:11:18.638 --> 01:11:20.599]  Discuss has got rid of us.
[01:11:20.599 --> 01:11:22.020]  Mail chimps, we couldn't send emails to you.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:22.860]  Now we're on a new system.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.861]  They're attacking that.
[01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:25.502]  It is total.
[01:11:25.502 --> 01:11:30.144]  They've got three New York Times reporters down here basically full-time following me around and others.
[01:11:30.144 --> 01:11:32.525]  Washington Post writers, BuzzFeed people.
[01:11:32.525 --> 01:11:34.486]  I mean it is, I'm followed around everywhere.
[01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:35.647]  This is a total war.
[01:11:35.647 --> 01:11:37.468]  The Chi-Coms are involved in all of it.
[01:11:37.468 --> 01:11:38.609]  It is insane.
[01:11:38.609 --> 01:11:40.389]  So we'll keep watching InfoWars.com.
[01:11:40.389 --> 01:11:41.210]  But if it's down,
[01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:42.531]  And if that persists
[01:11:54.502 --> 01:11:56.123]  This is our total de-platforming.
[01:11:56.123 --> 01:11:57.444]  This is China involved.
[01:11:57.444 --> 01:12:10.813]  The Washington Times is reporting with one of the national security consultants to Fox News, contributors, saying that they concur that the Chinese are involved with Tim Cook, who's officially moved there, and that they're making their move right now in Hollywood, everywhere.
[01:12:10.813 --> 01:12:15.416]  So we'll be discussing that with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com, Editor-in-Chief there in just a moment.
[01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:16.737]  You're going to be here in studio.
[01:12:16.737 --> 01:12:18.018]  People need to support you.
[01:12:18.018 --> 01:12:19.599]  Get your book at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:12:19.599 --> 01:12:20.140]  That's still up.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:27.582]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:12:27.582 --> 01:12:33.603]  As I think anybody who's watching TV, CNN, or Fox knows, Robert Mueller has me in his sights.
[01:12:33.603 --> 01:12:35.343]  Not that I've committed any crime.
[01:12:35.343 --> 01:12:39.404]  My crime is supporting Donald Trump for president and being effective about it.
[01:12:39.404 --> 01:12:42.405]  But my legal bills are through the sky.
[01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:44.406]  They threaten to destroy me.
[01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:48.166]  So folks can go to stonedefensefund.com.
[01:12:50.807 --> 01:12:57.669]  Uh, like InfoWars and my family members there, we are under siege and we need help as never before.
[01:12:57.669 --> 01:13:03.470]  So, if you go to StoneDefenseFund.com, anything you can send would be a godsend.
[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.051]  Alright, thank all the listeners and viewers.
[01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:06.391]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, look at this.
[01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:06.831]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:08.711]  You'll be in the studio tomorrow.
[01:13:08.711 --> 01:13:09.051]  Yes, indeed.
[01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:09.712]  We're doing.
[01:13:09.712 --> 01:13:10.792]  Pardon me, sir?
[01:13:14.522 --> 01:13:15.703]  I think your audio is going up and down.
[01:13:15.703 --> 01:13:15.983]  Thank you.
[01:13:15.983 --> 01:13:17.623]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:13:17.623 --> 01:13:23.146]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[01:13:23.146 --> 01:13:24.166]  This is just from last week.
[01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:24.806]  Reason Magazine.
[01:13:24.806 --> 01:13:25.627]  Then look.
[01:13:25.627 --> 01:13:26.807]  Boom!
[01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:29.368]  Infowars is down.
[01:13:29.368 --> 01:13:30.509]  This is concerted.
[01:13:30.509 --> 01:13:32.950]  Turns out Senator Warner is running it all.
[01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:42.094]  Senator Mark Warner proposes the end of free speech to bring an EU-style social score with the Chinese and fine you if the bureaucrats say you're fake news.
[01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:45.595]  We're taking off Vimeo video platform.
[01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:57.023]  They said because we claimed that Muslim training camps have been busted that were reportedly and allegedly in the indictments saying that they were planning to carry out school shootings.
[01:13:57.023 --> 01:14:05.649]  They found a dead body of a child who'd been reported missing from another state reportedly killed in a ritual and they let him go on $20,000 bond.
[01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:06.229]  That's $2,000.
[01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:08.491]  And the judge says she's going to waive that even.
[01:14:09.226 --> 01:14:15.979]  Because they said it's racist, because they're black, and that if they were Christians in a compound like that, they would never have had...
[01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.453]  They're children taken.
[01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:23.497]  They got emergency calls, people starving to death, and on the compound has tunnels.
[01:14:23.497 --> 01:14:24.558]  It looks like hell on earth.
[01:14:24.558 --> 01:14:28.561]  They were out there, reportedly, people that called it in said this was going on.
[01:14:28.561 --> 01:14:37.809]  But the point is, if they found a dead body in my nice five bedroom house of a dead kid, I guarantee you that I'd still be in jail a week later, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:40.552]  If Alex Jones was found with a dead kid,
[01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.445]  Was found missing months ago from another state.
[01:14:44.445 --> 01:14:46.452]  Who reportedly died in a ritual.
[01:14:46.452 --> 01:14:48.398]  Do you think I'd be out of jail right now?
[01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:48.438]  No!
[01:14:50.421 --> 01:14:51.862]  Firebombings all over Sweden.
[01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:52.862]  Firebombings in France.
[01:14:52.862 --> 01:14:54.103]  They're not even hardly reporting it.
[01:14:54.103 --> 01:14:55.584]  Another Westminster truck attack.
[01:14:55.584 --> 01:14:56.964]  Four injured.
[01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:57.985]  All of this going on.
[01:14:57.985 --> 01:15:01.447]  Building, building, building, building to the chaos to remove Trump.
[01:15:01.447 --> 01:15:08.431]  Building, building, building with the Antifa attacking people and running around saying they're going to kill Trump outside the White House and NBC and CNN covering it up.
[01:15:08.431 --> 01:15:12.853]  We'll talk all about it with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com on the other side.
[01:15:12.853 --> 01:15:14.454]  And remember, no matter what they do to InfoWars,
[01:15:15.034 --> 01:15:27.202]  There's still Daily Caller, and there's still Drudge Report, and there's still worldaffairsbrief.com, and there's still, you know, all the other great people and organizations out there that let the truth get out, like George Norrie and others.
[01:15:27.202 --> 01:15:38.170]  But I'm telling you, we have been chosen for destruction, and then you are next, because they've tracked back to us the catalyst with all these guests and everybody that's info wars you, the audience.
[01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.031]  I'm just one part of it.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.141]  Literally, sometimes the problem in it.
[01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:43.261]  But that's the way God works.
[01:15:43.261 --> 01:15:46.462]  And we are changing the world and populism and nationalism is exploding.
[01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:48.823]  But the chi-coms are breathing down my neck.
[01:15:48.823 --> 01:15:52.324]  They are breathing down my neck and InfoWars is down as we speak.
[01:15:52.324 --> 01:15:53.645]  NewsWars.com is still up.
[01:15:57.296 --> 01:16:01.178]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:16:01.178 --> 01:16:06.161]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:10.984]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:29.203]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[01:16:29.203 --> 01:16:37.809]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[01:18:02.233 --> 01:18:07.957]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:18:07.957 --> 01:18:15.822]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.822 --> 01:18:18.984]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:18:19.164 --> 01:18:24.448]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[01:18:57.844 --> 01:18:59.205]  We knew it was coming.
[01:18:59.205 --> 01:19:00.647]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:19:00.647 --> 01:19:13.520]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:24.948]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:19:24.948 --> 01:19:33.814]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:19:34.494 --> 01:19:43.957]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[01:19:43.957 --> 01:19:56.081]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:19:56.081 --> 01:20:01.262]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:20:01.262 --> 01:20:03.883]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:29.590]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:44.401]  Well, Joel Skousen and his family, and patriots of the FBI like his uncle, Cleon Skousen, were the first to expose how big, rich robber barons were funding communism, helping put communist China in place, all of it.
[01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:46.863]  It was John Birch who got tortured to death.
[01:20:48.011 --> 01:20:54.112]  At the end of World War II and when Mao was taking power in the late 40s because he knew that our government was aiding it.
[01:20:54.112 --> 01:21:06.494]  And so it's folks like Joel Skousen, best-selling author, former Marine Corps naval aviator in the Vietnam era, Patriot editor-in-chief of worldaffairsbrief.com can really speak to this.
[01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:09.115]  But the Washington Times has a big article.
[01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:13.676]  And by the way, I've been told, leave the Islamists alone, leave China alone, you're gonna be taking off these platforms.
[01:21:13.676 --> 01:21:15.356]  And Tim Cook's officially moved to China.
[01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:20.831]  Google has been caught building secret censorship systems that they're already testing here.
[01:21:20.831 --> 01:21:22.212]  It's here.
[01:21:22.212 --> 01:21:23.112]  And here's the article.
[01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:24.032]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:21:24.032 --> 01:21:26.713]  China is the threat and it may be too late.
[01:21:26.713 --> 01:21:28.694]  That's L. Todd Wood.
[01:21:28.694 --> 01:21:33.195]  He's a national security advisor and expert contributor to Fox News and a bunch of other groups.
[01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:35.696]  And he breaks it all down there as well.
[01:21:35.696 --> 01:21:36.856]  Must read.
[01:21:36.856 --> 01:21:40.098]  China literally owns most of Hollywood now.
[01:21:40.098 --> 01:21:41.338]  Two years ago, three years ago,
[01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:45.312]  Michael Savage.
[01:22:04.139 --> 01:22:08.000]  It seems to me, though, that the Chinese are going into overdrive right now.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.541]  I'm going to get his expert take on this and what he thinks about Infowars.com being down right now and the total deplatforming we're facing.
[01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:16.882]  What does that signify?
[01:22:16.882 --> 01:22:20.282]  Because they're already going after everybody else right now ahead of the midterms.
[01:22:20.282 --> 01:22:26.544]  I think they wouldn't be doing something this illegal, we've talked to top lawyers, and draconian if they weren't planning to go for broke.
[01:22:26.544 --> 01:22:27.704]  Joel Scalzin, thanks for joining us.
[01:22:30.964 --> 01:22:33.385]  Well, the issue is conspiracy, Alex.
[01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:45.313]  You mentioned there are other people, Infowars goes down, there's Breitbart, there's Dredgen, but they don't cover conspiracy in the degree with argumentation and evidence that you do.
[01:22:45.313 --> 01:22:46.373]  Now, I do.
[01:22:46.373 --> 01:22:52.697]  I've got a much smaller audience than either, but you are the kingpin of the conspiracy movement, like it or not.
[01:22:52.697 --> 01:22:55.679]  And that's why you're the target, Alex.
[01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:58.961]  And it's a test one taking, which I don't think they will be.
[01:22:59.995 --> 01:23:03.339]  Uh, this has got to be, uh, you know, very disconcerting.
[01:23:03.339 --> 01:23:08.604]  It's got to be a problem, you know, financially as they continue to harass you with these lawsuits.
[01:23:08.604 --> 01:23:14.550]  I can tell you that, uh, people on the outside say, hey, something's wrong with this picture.
[01:23:16.237 --> 01:23:21.079]  There is a vendetta against this guy and I better find out what's going on here.
[01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:35.028]  And so I think people are showing interest in finding out a little bit about you and they find out, you know, that you have made corrections to the things which they always promote in a false way that you've said about Sandy Hook or other things or the Pizzagate thing.
[01:23:35.028 --> 01:23:36.909]  They never talk about your corrections.
[01:23:36.909 --> 01:23:40.791]  They never talk about your improved position on these things.
[01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:44.613]  So this is a very strange piece of bias.
[01:23:44.613 --> 01:23:46.314]  It's not going to end.
[01:23:46.314 --> 01:23:48.735]  This is a powerful system.
[01:23:48.735 --> 01:24:04.522]  One of my major complaints is the conservative movement keeps saying, and a lot of this is due to Fox News, who talks about the deep state, but in their opinion, the deep state is simply Obama administration Democrat holdovers in the bureaucracies, which are out to get Trump.
[01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:06.063]  That's not the deep state at all.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:15.286]  The Deep State is a long centuries old conspiracy of power, which is satanic based, revelatory based.
[01:24:15.286 --> 01:24:18.649]  That's why it keeps going generation after generation.
[01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:20.310]  It isn't one person that runs it.
[01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:22.732]  When Brzezinski dies, there's Kissinger.
[01:24:22.732 --> 01:24:25.834]  And when Kissinger dies, there's going to be somebody else.
[01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:26.615]  It's a spirit.
[01:24:26.615 --> 01:24:28.737]  It's empowered by a spirit of wanting to hurt people.
[01:24:28.737 --> 01:24:30.618]  And as you've said this for years, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:30.618 --> 01:24:32.700]  Look at how the Koch brothers are now against Trump.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.482]  And again, Trump's not perfect, but why do they hate him so much?
[01:24:39.184 --> 01:24:41.866]  Well, it's hard to say.
[01:24:41.866 --> 01:24:48.851]  You know, I was very cautiously optimistic when Trump was elected because of his powerful campaign positions.
[01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:53.875]  I thought, boy, if even half of those come true, it's going to be a real win for us.
[01:24:53.875 --> 01:24:57.858]  And unfortunately, less than 10% have come true.
[01:24:57.858 --> 01:25:05.203]  And the major compromises, especially in foreign policy, has been a real disaster.
[01:25:05.203 --> 01:25:06.384]  The attacks on Syria,
[01:25:06.784 --> 01:25:09.887]  Certainly that's the case, but then why is he so embattled?
[01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:13.810]  Why are they so frothing and demonically energized to take him out?
[01:25:33.993 --> 01:25:35.774]  Because it has slowed down their agenda.
[01:25:35.774 --> 01:25:41.797]  You know, Donald Trump, they convince him of one thing and the next day he turns around and they have to reconvince him.
[01:25:41.797 --> 01:25:45.939]  In other words, they never get ahead with Donald Trump.
[01:25:45.939 --> 01:25:46.719]  It's the same thing.
[01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:55.283]  They can stop him from pursuing his agenda in favor of liberty, and they do so, but he keeps coming back around and tries again and they have to stop him again.
[01:25:55.883 --> 01:25:58.664]  I mean, this guy is not an insider.
[01:25:58.664 --> 01:26:00.985]  He is very much a flawed person.
[01:26:00.985 --> 01:26:10.047]  He's got good instincts, but his weaknesses and his lack of background, his lack of understanding of the facts on how the deep state operates.
[01:26:10.047 --> 01:26:11.448]  Who's in the deep state?
[01:26:11.448 --> 01:26:16.870]  What are the deep state operations like the supporting and the creation of ISIS and Al Qaeda?
[01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:18.170]  He knows nothing about those.
[01:26:18.775 --> 01:26:27.737]  So when they give him these false excuses, explaining away his instincts, he doesn't have the wherewithal to counter those very sophisticated arguments.
[01:26:27.737 --> 01:26:27.897]  Sure.
[01:26:27.897 --> 01:26:28.497]  Let me ask you this.
[01:26:28.497 --> 01:26:30.477]  I don't mean to distract off into Trump.
[01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:35.778]  With the, and I know information is important, but they're using the crackdown on me as a precedent.
[01:26:35.778 --> 01:26:38.719]  They're cracking down on so many people now ahead of the midterms.
[01:26:38.719 --> 01:26:42.400]  What is Congress going to do about this when you have top Democrats, Murphy,
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:48.045]  And others saying, we're going to end the First Amendment in official announcements.
[01:26:48.045 --> 01:26:51.849]  I mean, this is, this is just crazy.
[01:26:51.849 --> 01:26:56.074]  These statements, Senate Democrats circulating plans for government, take over the internet.
[01:26:56.074 --> 01:26:58.156]  Senator Mark Warner proposes end of free speech.
[01:26:58.156 --> 01:26:59.398]  I mean, they're really doing this.
[01:27:01.112 --> 01:27:05.476]  Well, they are, and that's why it's important to really address the arguments that they're using.
[01:27:05.476 --> 01:27:14.924]  I do so in this week's World Affairs Brief, which people can get a free copy of by simply emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:27:14.924 --> 01:27:20.148]  My top story this week is about the vendetta against Alex Jones and why it's unjust.
[01:27:20.148 --> 01:27:23.030]  First of all, they're basing this on hate speech.
[01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:28.415]  Hate speech can never be a legal basis for anything because it's undefinable.
[01:27:28.965 --> 01:27:33.688]  Now you can get to a definable level when you talk about incitement to violence.
[01:27:33.688 --> 01:27:35.369]  And we do that in our courts of law.
[01:27:35.369 --> 01:27:39.832]  You can't sit there and rally people to kill someone and get away with it.
[01:27:39.832 --> 01:27:41.353]  Like the Democrats do everywhere.
[01:27:42.864 --> 01:27:43.585]  Well, that's right.
[01:27:43.585 --> 01:27:45.386]  And they even talk about killing Trump.
[01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:50.170]  But the point is, the normal person can't get away with that incitement of violence.
[01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:55.955]  But you can't take hate... Hate speech is nothing more than strong criticism of another person.
[01:27:55.955 --> 01:27:57.996]  Now, I know you have been critical of Muslims.
[01:27:57.996 --> 01:27:59.157]  I have been critical of Muslims.
[01:27:59.157 --> 01:28:09.206]  You've been critical of... I have been about blacks and the work ethic or the unwed mother problem within that category.
[01:28:09.206 --> 01:28:11.688]  But we're doing that trying to help people, not because we hate them.
[01:28:13.137 --> 01:28:22.546]  Well, that's right, and we're also doing it to be able to stop or counter the left or the mainstream media attempt to cover up the problems within the community.
[01:28:22.546 --> 01:28:32.195]  I mean, you played a... I heard in Fox News talking about the problem with black unemployment, as if this is something that's systemic to the capitalist system.
[01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:49.684]  But when you look at the problems within the black homes within the nation, and the lack of work ethic and things, and the unwed mother problem, and the gang and the other things that hits the Latinos well, that's the basis for... Which is a product of the Great Society, which was a plan.
[01:28:49.684 --> 01:28:53.186]  We'll be back with Joel Scalzin about what could the big events be ahead of the midterms?
[01:28:53.186 --> 01:28:54.887]  What does he expect into the future?
[01:28:54.887 --> 01:28:56.088]  Infowars, by the way, is down.
[01:28:57.205 --> 01:29:01.968]  If you like alkaline water or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon Living Water Bottle.
[01:29:01.968 --> 01:29:06.310]  It creates alkaline water on the go while reducing plastic waste and saving you money.
[01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:14.254]  Made with surgical grade stainless steel, the Dillon Bottle increases the pH up to 9 to deliver both alkaline and antioxidant water anywhere you want it.
[01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:17.879]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:17.879 --> 01:29:18.439]  What if I told you
[01:29:31.817 --> 01:29:32.077]  I think so.
[01:29:58.979 --> 01:30:03.683]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:33:01.233 --> 01:33:19.196]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.196 --> 01:33:23.997]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:23.997 --> 01:33:27.438]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.438 --> 01:33:27.638]  Okay!
[01:33:29.008 --> 01:33:33.493]  You can study military history, you can study tactics, they have different names for it.
[01:33:33.493 --> 01:33:41.921]  But, take the invasion of Panama, right after George Herbert Walker Bush got into office.
[01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:49.148]  And I'm not saying the Panamanian dictator was a good guy, but he wasn't paying his drug money into the CIA anymore, that's all come out in court.
[01:33:49.148 --> 01:33:52.652]  Now, for six months before they invaded,
[01:33:54.212 --> 01:34:03.343]  They dropped flashbangs, they shot blanks off, helicopters did landings, until when they finally hit, people just thought, oh, it's just more of the attack.
[01:34:03.343 --> 01:34:09.371]  That's a tactic, where you build up the attack until finally the real attack comes, and you don't stand up against it.
[01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:10.252]  There's different names for that.
[01:34:12.185 --> 01:34:14.065]  They're trying to take our credit card processors.
[01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.306]  They just took one.
[01:34:15.306 --> 01:34:17.086]  They just took down one of our shopping carts.
[01:34:17.086 --> 01:34:27.148]  They took us off Credio after taking us off AdRoll that advertises with Google where we just sold water filters and air filters and supplements outside to fund this place.
[01:34:27.148 --> 01:34:31.249]  That was $4 million gross, like $2.5 million money.
[01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.509]  It takes a lot of money to run this.
[01:34:32.509 --> 01:34:34.050]  That was like all our extra money.
[01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:36.450]  I had to really work hard to get that back to even keep going.
[01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:37.871]  They just blew away Credio.
[01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:38.711]  It was at $3 million.
[01:34:40.928 --> 01:34:42.049]  Already this year.
[01:34:42.049 --> 01:34:43.890]  It was doing better than the last thing.
[01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:44.291]  Gone.
[01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:44.851]  Blown away.
[01:34:44.851 --> 01:34:45.832]  They sought us out.
[01:34:45.832 --> 01:34:49.575]  They said, our general counsel says we can't work with you for hate.
[01:34:49.575 --> 01:34:55.800]  As Joel Skousen just said, that's a Soviet globalist leftist think tank university term.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.883]  Uh, where they just say, oh, it's hate.
[01:34:58.883 --> 01:35:00.324]  We just say that's hate.
[01:35:00.324 --> 01:35:07.571]  They banned us off Vimeo for saying that an Islamic training camp got busted that reportedly, allegedly, was planning mass shootings at schools.
[01:35:07.571 --> 01:35:08.572]  That was mainstream news.
[01:35:08.572 --> 01:35:10.454]  They said, you're gone for that.
[01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:12.717]  They arrest you in Europe if you talk about Islamic terror.
[01:35:14.025 --> 01:35:27.681]  So it's here folks and it's all being segued over and now US Senators, Democrats are saying we're going to follow EU rules and Chinese systems and the Chinese dictator has been in the Wall Street Journal praising America going after fake news.
[01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:29.944]  So we're here.
[01:35:29.944 --> 01:35:31.306]  So this is the big attack.
[01:35:31.306 --> 01:35:33.969]  InfoWars we've confirmed has been artificially hit.
[01:35:36.474 --> 01:35:39.737]  It is down right now, even though we had systems in front of it that couldn't even do it.
[01:35:39.737 --> 01:35:40.858]  It has to be internal.
[01:35:40.858 --> 01:35:45.382]  This is what they said four months ago in Bloomberg, after I was already told this.
[01:35:45.382 --> 01:35:48.825]  People internally at YouTube put fake strikes on us and took us down.
[01:35:48.825 --> 01:35:49.906]  They reversed it.
[01:35:49.906 --> 01:35:52.388]  But they're so sick of rebellions inside Google and Apple.
[01:35:54.301 --> 01:36:01.565]  Google this year refused, their people walked off a US engineering project refusing to work for the Pentagon.
[01:36:01.565 --> 01:36:03.446]  That's how activist they are.
[01:36:03.446 --> 01:36:07.129]  Google's taking Christmas off their calendars along with Apple.
[01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:12.992]  So you have to understand, there aren't even so much Chinese operatives as they just hate the country.
[01:36:12.992 --> 01:36:17.755]  So we'll get Joel Scouser's take on that, but right now, InfoWars.com has been taken down.
[01:36:19.167 --> 01:36:21.508]  Oh, it's a private company, they can take you down.
[01:36:21.508 --> 01:36:35.551]  No, this is just, so they are exponentially, I believe, beta testing ahead of a big event, civil unrest, assassination of Trump, who knows what the false flag is, a group of false flags, attacks on the media, attacks on Apple, Google saying we sponsored it or something.
[01:36:35.551 --> 01:36:39.531]  I mean, I see that in the crystal ball, the kind of thing they would do politically.
[01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:42.392]  And then they don't want us there to counter it when they make that move.
[01:36:42.392 --> 01:36:46.513]  So they were hitting us thousands of articles a day until we
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.940]  We're number one on the app, number one on everything.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.601]  It panicked them.
[01:36:51.601 --> 01:36:58.922]  They kind of went quiet in the last few days, and then now, behind the scenes, they're going after stuff that's clearly torturous interference.
[01:36:58.922 --> 01:37:09.784]  So, Joel, I got you on about China and about the midterms and what you think they may pull, but I'm just kind of on us right now because I never really make a big deal about it now when we're under attack, and I've almost gotten kind of calm to it now.
[01:37:09.784 --> 01:37:11.424]  Like, oh, somebody's following me again.
[01:37:11.424 --> 01:37:13.124]  Oh, the New York Times is following me.
[01:37:13.124 --> 01:37:14.245]  Oh, I'm being harassed.
[01:37:14.245 --> 01:37:15.965]  Oh, you know, they're threatening me again.
[01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:19.308]  And I'm kind of getting into this punch-drunk situation.
[01:37:19.308 --> 01:37:29.159]  I mean, I know you're a veteran who dealt with stuff a lot more stressful than what I'm dealing with, landing on aircraft carriers and rough seas, but isn't there almost a problem where it's not like you have courage.
[01:37:29.159 --> 01:37:33.985]  It's that you've been doing it so long, you're not even worried anymore, and you lose that frostiness.
[01:37:33.985 --> 01:37:35.887]  I mean, do you get what I'm trying to get at here?
[01:37:37.526 --> 01:37:38.967]  Well, yes.
[01:37:38.967 --> 01:37:59.477]  The good danger, Alex, is that in the tension of the moment, you're under attack, there's no question about it on all sides, the best strategy that you can react to is to come through with more calmness than you've ever had before, so that when people come to you, with a lot of people coming to see, what's this Alex Jones all about?
[01:37:59.477 --> 01:38:06.020]  You know, they show the Wildman video clips on CNN, but when people come to your show,
[01:38:06.807 --> 01:38:12.228]  If you'll show increased calmness, they'll say, OK, this is a false attack.
[01:38:12.228 --> 01:38:15.469]  There's nothing about Alex Jones that I find objectionable.
[01:38:15.469 --> 01:38:25.592]  And I realize it's hard during the heat of the attack to be calm, but that's what I recommend in terms of a strategy could do more good than almost any other thing other than fighting back.
[01:38:25.592 --> 01:38:26.492]  No, I totally agree.
[01:38:27.133 --> 01:38:35.804]  And the Lord works in mysterious ways, so my clowning, sometimes out of context, brought part of the audience and broke through, but I think it's time to fully be serious and not joke around anymore.
[01:38:35.804 --> 01:38:36.785]  I think that's good advice.
[01:38:36.785 --> 01:38:44.055]  Describe your calmness when the jet aircraft or the private plane you were flying failed and you survived that miracle crash landing.
[01:38:45.715 --> 01:38:57.811]  Well, yeah, when my engine, you know, didn't respond to the throttle, I'll tell you, the adrenaline starts going and you realize, all right, we got a problem because that back of that carrier deck is coming up in your face.
[01:38:57.811 --> 01:38:59.694]  You know, I was really shocked, Alex, because
[01:39:00.798 --> 01:39:03.740]  It wasn't so much the technique of what to do with the airplane.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:10.985]  I could always pull the handle and eject at some point, but my major concern on the aircraft carrier was where do I put this thing?
[01:39:10.985 --> 01:39:16.088]  There are people on the deck that are scrambling and I'm gonna, you know, hit somebody.
[01:39:16.088 --> 01:39:20.411]  Now, when my personal airplane crashed, of course, I thought that I had made the landing.
[01:39:20.411 --> 01:39:22.973]  I was avoiding the populated area.
[01:39:22.973 --> 01:39:24.494]  I was heading for a field.
[01:39:24.494 --> 01:39:29.257]  There just happened to be a fence post there that caught my landing gear and made the aircraft tumble.
[01:39:30.038 --> 01:39:33.101]  And, you know, it was a severe crash.
[01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:37.406]  It broke my 2,000 pound test seatbelt and I didn't go anywhere.
[01:39:37.406 --> 01:39:38.307]  You think about that.
[01:39:38.307 --> 01:39:41.370]  How do you break your seatbelt and not go flying out?
[01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:44.074]  So I think there was a little bit of miraculous help there.
[01:39:44.774 --> 01:39:51.858]  But, you know, you train, you train so that you are calm, relatively calm in the situation.
[01:39:51.858 --> 01:39:56.981]  You know your procedures, you watch your airspeed, you make sure you don't stall and spin.
[01:39:56.981 --> 01:39:59.062]  That's how most people die in an airplane crash.
[01:39:59.062 --> 01:40:04.705]  They keep trying to extend the glide until they stall and spin and they fall out of the air and kill themselves.
[01:40:04.705 --> 01:40:11.829]  If you come in under control, still flying, unless you're heading for a pack of trees, you're going to generally survive.
[01:40:11.829 --> 01:40:13.770]  You may have some injuries, but you're going to survive.
[01:40:15.069 --> 01:40:17.671]  Well, they said that was amazing that you lived through that, Doug.
[01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:24.175]  Like you said, that powerful seatbelt broke, but you had a little scratch on your head and, like, walked off from it.
[01:40:24.175 --> 01:40:26.517]  Yeah, the whole airplane cracked open.
[01:40:26.517 --> 01:40:27.537]  I was sitting on the wing.
[01:40:27.537 --> 01:40:30.359]  I just stepped off onto the grass and I was fine.
[01:40:30.359 --> 01:40:32.721]  It was truly miraculous.
[01:40:32.721 --> 01:40:36.083]  And, like, what did you just zen out at that moment?
[01:40:36.083 --> 01:40:37.164]  I mean, go back to describing it.
[01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:38.685]  Just suddenly there was no power and what happened?
[01:40:40.327 --> 01:40:44.832]  Well, it turned out that the fuel line had become clogged.
[01:40:44.832 --> 01:40:56.445]  There was no way that I could get any power from the airplane, and I was only a quarter mile from the runway, and I realized I was not going to be able to glide to the runway, and so I had to turn onto the non-populated area to avoid crashing into buildings.
[01:40:56.445 --> 01:40:59.168]  This was very near a very populated area, so...
[01:40:59.428 --> 01:41:05.770]  Nigel Farage, even the French police and others confirmed, they were sabotaging his cars, cutting brake lines, unbolting the bolts on it.
[01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:07.290]  It happened at least three times.
[01:41:07.290 --> 01:41:15.893]  He didn't want to get into it, but I've talked to people that know him well, and they said that they think there was some sabotage with the aircraft that ended up later from the injuries, killing the pilot.
[01:41:15.893 --> 01:41:17.134]  It took him a few years to die.
[01:41:17.134 --> 01:41:19.394]  Farage walked off, his face all smashed.
[01:41:19.394 --> 01:41:21.455]  But do you ever wonder if somebody put something in your fuel?
[01:41:23.125 --> 01:41:36.789]  Well, we were able to pull the fuel filter apart afterwards and found fiberglass particles in it, which in an experimental aircraft, when they build a tank out of fiberglass, some of that fiberglass over time is going to slough off, and that did apparently.
[01:41:36.789 --> 01:41:41.271]  There's no way that that would be an appropriate way to sabotage because the
[01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:45.853]  It's a natural occurring thing that actually pertained to the airplane.
[01:41:45.853 --> 01:41:49.236]  So I think it was a fault of whoever built the airplane.
[01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:50.337]  I agree.
[01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:54.581]  So they should go to metal, aluminum gas tanks, right?
[01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:55.682]  Well, not necessarily.
[01:41:55.682 --> 01:41:58.845]  I mean, there's something to be said for composite construction.
[01:41:58.845 --> 01:42:04.630]  You just have to flush the things out really good to make sure that all that excess fiberglass gets out before you start flying it.
[01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:05.531]  What are you flying now?
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:17.871]  Well, I'm flying a certified aircraft, a Mooney, a turbocharged Mooney aircraft, and they're not without their problems too, but so you really have to be careful.
[01:42:17.871 --> 01:42:20.334]  I do a very thorough check of the airplane every time.
[01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:22.396]  That's my dad's favorite small plane.
[01:42:22.396 --> 01:42:23.437]  He's a pilot, is the Mooney.
[01:42:24.878 --> 01:42:27.679]  Yeah, it's a very, very good cross-country airplane.
[01:42:27.679 --> 01:42:31.079]  But you know, getting back to the world situation, Alex... We'll come back to the world situation.
[01:42:31.079 --> 01:42:34.900]  We'll do it right now, in five minutes, the next hour, at Joel Scowls and WorldAffairsBrief.com.

[01:42:37.841 --> 01:42:39.601]  It's really powerful information.
[01:42:39.601 --> 01:42:42.462]  We'll look at the midterms, China, big issues.
[01:42:42.462 --> 01:42:44.242]  InfoWars is down!
[01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:46.782]  I mean, this is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and it's artificial.
[01:42:46.782 --> 01:42:47.723]  We've confirmed that.
[01:42:47.723 --> 01:42:50.643]  They are trying to shut us down ahead of something big.
[01:42:50.643 --> 01:42:51.823]  NewsWars.com.

[01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.461]  We knew it was coming.
[01:44:59.461 --> 01:45:01.022]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:45:01.022 --> 01:45:13.892]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:45:14.272 --> 01:45:25.320]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:34.207]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[01:45:34.887 --> 01:45:44.335]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[01:45:44.335 --> 01:45:56.465]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[01:45:56.465 --> 01:45:58.407]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:45:58.407 --> 01:46:03.110]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWars life.
[01:46:03.971 --> 01:46:04.832]  It takes hours.
[01:46:04.832 --> 01:46:07.273]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.273 --> 01:46:08.454]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.454 --> 01:46:10.075]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:10.075 --> 01:46:13.278]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:13.278 --> 01:46:14.419]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.419 --> 01:46:17.581]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.581 --> 01:46:21.363]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:21.363 --> 01:46:24.466]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[01:46:24.466 --> 01:46:25.446]  So you can upload it.
[01:46:25.446 --> 01:46:31.691]  Our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is
[01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:36.734]  Super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.734 --> 01:46:42.076]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:42.076 --> 01:46:43.477]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.477 --> 01:46:53.382]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.382 --> 01:46:56.444]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:00.794 --> 01:47:11.289]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.289 --> 01:47:17.537]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.033 --> 01:47:21.255]  Okay, so InfoWars.com has been attacked.
[01:47:21.255 --> 01:47:22.716]  It's been turned off, it looks like.
[01:47:22.716 --> 01:47:25.058]  There's DDoS attacks going on, but we have stuff that blocks that.
[01:47:25.058 --> 01:47:29.662]  It's some type of internal sabotage somewhere, not here, but within the different systems out there.
[01:47:29.662 --> 01:47:37.489]  And that's this new trend of the people in the technology companies are mainly leftist now, and they just, like Reality Winner, they just do whatever they want.
[01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:41.432]  Joel Skousen, Editor-in-Chief at WorldAtFirstBrief.com is our guest.
[01:47:41.432 --> 01:47:44.075]  Talk about bizarre breaking news.
[01:47:44.075 --> 01:47:46.457]  They spent 10 plus days in the prosecution.
[01:47:47.566 --> 01:47:49.708]  Frankly, Alex, almost nothing before the midterms.
[01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:51.529]  The Democrats have a real problem.
[01:48:17.754 --> 01:48:27.053]  If they unleash Antifa in a series of riots and really social unrest, as people have been predicting, it's going to accrue to the Republicans' favor.
[01:48:27.957 --> 01:48:40.621]  Uh, and, uh, you know, there is this radical portion of the Democrats, uh, the Democrats in the middle really are at a loss because, uh, you know, Hillary Clinton is the one they're secretly planning on trying to run again.
[01:48:40.621 --> 01:48:46.563]  And, uh, if the radical left portion of the Democrats ruin that for her, it could be a real problem.
[01:48:46.563 --> 01:48:52.925]  I do think before the next election for Donald Trump directly, there's going to be a, they'll pull the plug a little bit on the stock market.
[01:48:52.925 --> 01:48:53.805]  So you get a 20 or 30% reduction.
[01:48:53.805 --> 01:48:54.625]  It'll cause pension.
[01:48:57.026 --> 01:48:58.587]  We're good to go.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.807]  I think this campaign, frankly, against you, Alex, is backfiring on them.
[01:49:23.807 --> 01:49:26.291]  I think people can see the unjust.
[01:49:26.291 --> 01:49:27.873]  They can see it's one-sided.
[01:49:27.873 --> 01:49:31.358]  Even people on the left are coming to your defense on the issue of free speech.
[01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.943]  And so... No, I agree, but here's the problem.
[01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:42.553]  Instead of just deplatforming off all the big places where I can reach people, which is what they wanted, now they're going after the payment processors or shutting the website down.
[01:49:42.553 --> 01:49:46.879]  And I agree, it's crazy and not... Why are they doing it?
[01:49:46.879 --> 01:49:49.242]  Because they're only moving forward.
[01:49:51.451 --> 01:50:01.077]  Well, you know, these are control freaks, a lot of people, and some of these people only know how to attack in a frontal way until it backfires on them.
[01:50:01.077 --> 01:50:10.482]  Now, to be frank, they've tried more subtle ways before, you know, as they started to censor YouTube, they started to cut your advertisers on YouTube, but that didn't work.
[01:50:11.275 --> 01:50:14.097]  And so they're having to take strong, strong action.
[01:50:14.097 --> 01:50:18.721]  Now, you know, this whole issue about we're a private company, so we can do anything.
[01:50:18.721 --> 01:50:21.363]  You know, that's a hypocritical legal position.
[01:50:21.363 --> 01:50:28.869]  How many times has the left told us after civil rights legislation that if you are a company open to the public, you can no longer discriminate.
[01:50:28.869 --> 01:50:30.370]  You are not private anymore.
[01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:32.231]  You are a public company.
[01:50:32.231 --> 01:50:37.255]  And yet they're hiding behind the privacy issue or the public, the private company issue.
[01:50:38.101 --> 01:50:41.303]  And that's why they're not saying we're discriminating against Alex Jones.
[01:50:41.303 --> 01:50:43.003]  We're discriminating against conservatives.
[01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.584]  They're calling it racist.
[01:50:44.584 --> 01:50:46.105]  They're calling it hatred.
[01:50:46.105 --> 01:50:47.646]  And these things are untrue.
[01:50:47.646 --> 01:50:48.926]  They're unprovable legally.
[01:50:48.926 --> 01:50:52.088]  And that's why we have to fight against those.
[01:50:52.088 --> 01:51:03.013]  I think that if Trump, as a president, were on the ball, he would go to his FCC and other people and say, all right, we need a rule that basically prohibits people from using
[01:51:03.713 --> 01:51:08.018]  You know, non-judicial legal terms like hate speech in order to ban things.
[01:51:08.018 --> 01:51:11.762]  We've got to protect free speech by making sure they cannot use these.
[01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:24.255]  I am most disappointed by what Trump and his Justice Department under Jeff Sessions has not done to protect us, has not done to uncover and root out the deep state.
[01:51:24.255 --> 01:51:35.040]  I think they probably got something on Jeff Sessions and that's why he's acting as a feckless attorney generally simply is not going to back for Donald Trump or liberty or anything else.
[01:51:40.054 --> 01:51:41.795]  My horse, my horse, my kingdom for a horse.
[01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:44.736]  We got one tweet out that InfoWars is down, but it had a link in it.
[01:51:44.736 --> 01:51:45.956]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:51:45.956 --> 01:51:46.857]  No.
[01:51:46.857 --> 01:51:49.638]  Go to NewsWars.com.
[01:51:49.638 --> 01:51:51.579]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:51.579 --> 01:51:53.159]  You can't go to InfoWars.com.
[01:51:53.159 --> 01:51:56.380]  I'm going to have to go off air and just deal with this, actually.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:02.463]  Because it's a big deal, but there's this psychology that we're not a big deal, which is fine.
[01:52:02.463 --> 01:52:05.124]  But, you know, it's just that
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:33.914]  The boldness and the craziness and the things they're doing, it is true, we're exposing their agenda, and I know you say there's three major power predatory centers, and I agree, there's groups competing, but more and more, our elite have sold out to China, they base things in China, China's double-crossing the globalists more and more, but the word is, and what we see is my criticism of Apple and Google moving to China, helping them censor, is that China's really exerting, through Hollywood and everything, its powers.
[01:52:35.003 --> 01:52:44.929]  I see the Pentagon and others pushing back against that, but it looks to me like right now that with everything China's been given, the rare earth minerals, the Panama Canal, a shooting at U.S.
[01:52:44.929 --> 01:53:01.438]  ships this week, it just seems like China is the big issue, and I certainly know that that's one reason they're mad at me, Joel Skousen, is that I keep pointing out Russia, Russia, I'm not saying Russia's our buddy or anything, but China is really what, in my own life, I've experienced that is in my business.
[01:53:02.785 --> 01:53:08.787]  Well, China is the biggest threat to world peace ever and will continue to be so.
[01:53:08.787 --> 01:53:15.430]  As I've said before, I think Russia is a predator state and they're intending to join with China in attacking the West.
[01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:20.431]  I think Russia is going down in the next war and China is going to be the new enemy completely.
[01:53:20.431 --> 01:53:28.454]  But you've got to remember there's a difference between assisting in building an enemy and actually getting in bed with them or letting China control.
[01:53:28.454 --> 01:53:30.315]  A lot of people have falsely
[01:53:31.255 --> 01:53:36.396]  I hypothesize that, for example, Israel and Assad controls the New World Order, and I don't think so.
[01:53:36.396 --> 01:53:40.797]  I think they're part of the New World Order, but they're not the controllers.
[01:53:40.797 --> 01:53:43.918]  The New World Order, the globalists, are bigger than Israel.
[01:53:43.918 --> 01:53:49.680]  But the New World Order has been continually building and protecting China.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:54.941]  This is part of the strategy of building an enemy to facilitate a future war, which will allow
[01:53:56.001 --> 01:53:59.363]  A sufficient amount of destruction of our military forces for the U.S.
[01:53:59.363 --> 01:54:02.725]  government to talk us into joining a militarized global government.
[01:54:02.725 --> 01:54:04.125]  That's where we're headed.
[01:54:04.125 --> 01:54:11.069]  Now, that's why, I mean, for example, if they really wanted to stop China and its influence in the United States, they'd pass a simple law.
[01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:17.152]  You have to be an American city to own property or invest in a company in the United States of America.
[01:54:17.152 --> 01:54:18.733]  You have to be a citizen.
[01:54:18.733 --> 01:54:21.174]  That would prohibit all of this Chinese influence.
[01:54:21.914 --> 01:54:25.701]  But they want the influence, not because the Chinese control the globalists.
[01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:31.131]  They are two separate powers, but they're continuing to build the best enemy that money can buy.
[01:54:32.245 --> 01:54:35.366]  And China is a real growing threat militarily.
[01:54:35.366 --> 01:54:46.968]  I'm doing an article for next week's World Affairs Briefs on the China finally reaching an international naval status and Russian and Chinese ships are plying the Atlantic.
[01:54:46.968 --> 01:54:49.128]  They used to stay clear of the Atlantic.
[01:54:49.128 --> 01:54:52.568]  They had only enough ships to handle the Pacific and now they're in the Atlantic.
[01:54:52.568 --> 01:54:58.009]  Russian submarines are spending an inordinate amount of time tracking over U.S.
[01:54:58.009 --> 01:55:01.410]  Internet cables that attach the United States to Europe and Asia.
[01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:06.091]  And I know they're tracking those because they plan on interdicting those cables.
[01:55:06.091 --> 01:55:13.393]  They're going to lose the internet someday when this war comes.
[01:55:13.393 --> 01:55:15.994]  I think they're trying to take us down to set the precedent to take others down.
[01:55:15.994 --> 01:55:20.316]  And also the EU is fining Google and others for not being under their hate speech laws.
[01:55:20.316 --> 01:55:23.276]  And as you said, that's all just made up communist garbage.
[01:55:23.276 --> 01:55:26.377]  America and the Congress, everybody has to stand up to this.
[01:55:26.377 --> 01:55:31.139]  And Trump's biggest failing right now, I think, is not doing something about this and not taking action.
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:33.321]  That's right, Alex.
[01:55:33.321 --> 01:55:38.525]  Where is the leadership in Congress, in the presidency, in the Department of Justice?
[01:55:38.525 --> 01:55:42.148]  I mean, there's very clear ways that you can attack these problems.
[01:55:42.148 --> 01:55:43.589]  You can defend free speech.
[01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:49.174]  You can make sure that these companies are declared public companies.
[01:55:49.174 --> 01:55:51.696]  And I'm not against private property in this regard.
[01:55:51.696 --> 01:55:58.762]  I'm just quoting the left who says, once you're in the public domain and you're open to the public, you cannot discriminate.
[01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:11.577]  And I think we need an anti-discrimination law in terms of political free speech, that you cannot discriminate, unless it reaches the level of incitement to violence, and that can be very specifically defined in law.
[01:56:11.577 --> 01:56:20.680]  A quick law on that would stop Google, it would stop any of these companies from banning you immediately over this, and you could take them to court based upon the law.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:26.202]  But there is no one in our movement, there's no one in Congress, no one in the presidency,
[01:56:26.914 --> 01:56:29.076]  Who is even hypothesizing about it.
[01:56:29.076 --> 01:56:36.581]  We're simply reacting to the left's use of their tyrannical powers with the media and the courts to do this.
[01:56:36.581 --> 01:56:43.926]  And the courts would be in a tough situation if we had such a law that protected directly free speech against these terms like hate speech.
[01:56:45.097 --> 01:56:46.839]  Well, most of the public's in a trance.
[01:56:46.839 --> 01:56:49.141]  They've literally been mesmerized by television and the culture.
[01:56:49.141 --> 01:56:49.782]  It's gotten really sick.
[01:56:49.782 --> 01:56:51.343]  We're going to do five more minutes with Joel Skousen.
[01:56:51.343 --> 01:56:58.970]  Please remember, just in the 30 seconds I have, that if you don't financially support us, and if you don't buy the products, then FortWorthStore.com, they will win.
[01:56:58.970 --> 01:57:03.415]  Yes, we'll defeat the frivolous lawsuits, we'll defeat the hack attacks, we'll defeat all the takedowns, but
[01:57:03.755 --> 01:57:05.535]  They're trying to take our payment processing.
[01:57:05.535 --> 01:57:07.096]  They're trying to kill everything right now.
[01:57:07.096 --> 01:57:08.676]  So, please rally behind us.
[01:57:08.676 --> 01:57:13.037]  We need a lot of funds to run this operation and continue our operations.
[01:57:13.037 --> 01:57:15.918]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:15.918 --> 01:57:18.779]  We've got water filtration, air filtration everybody needs.
[01:57:18.779 --> 01:57:20.359]  We've got non-gmo heirloom seeds.
[01:57:20.359 --> 01:57:23.440]  We've got great Patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.780]  We've got great supplements.
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:25.481]  They're all there.
[01:57:25.481 --> 01:57:29.722]  If you just shop with us and fund us, we will continue on because we're sponsored by you.
[01:57:29.722 --> 01:57:30.382]  If you don't,
[01:57:30.962 --> 01:57:32.063]  We're in big trouble, too.
[01:57:32.063 --> 01:57:34.504]  But they're betting that you don't care and you're an idiot.

[01:58:49.113 --> 01:58:53.695]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:58:53.695 --> 01:58:54.255]  Thanks for calling.
[01:58:54.255 --> 01:58:55.675]  Hey Alex, mate.
[01:58:55.675 --> 01:58:59.297]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[01:58:59.297 --> 01:59:08.040]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:24.320]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:33.426]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:59:33.426 --> 01:59:38.330]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:43.934]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1775th Worldwide.
[01:59:51.713 --> 01:59:58.741]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:58.741 --> 01:59:59.702]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:59:59.702 --> 02:00:02.946]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:22.512 --> 02:00:25.613]  You know, Joel Schausen says I should be calm.
[02:00:25.613 --> 02:00:28.175]  And I'm not even mad they're trying to shut us down.
[02:00:28.175 --> 02:00:29.175]  I expected all this.
[02:00:29.175 --> 02:00:32.136]  It's that I get frustrated that I can't fight them harder.
[02:00:32.136 --> 02:00:35.518]  And I'm like a race car engine kind of blowing up.
[02:00:35.518 --> 02:00:38.039]  So I appreciate the great crew, the listeners, and all the support.
[02:00:40.478 --> 02:00:41.399]  And you guys are great.
[02:00:41.399 --> 02:00:42.480]  I'm here talking to some of the crew.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.581]  All right, we are back live here.
[02:00:43.581 --> 02:00:48.486]  Joel Skousen, in the five minutes we have left, just other points you want to add.
[02:00:48.486 --> 02:00:53.491]  I'm just trying to probe because I know InfoWars is important and we have a lot of great guests and a lot of great info.
[02:00:53.491 --> 02:00:57.095]  We reach five plus billion people on YouTube by the time they shut us down everywhere else.
[02:00:57.095 --> 02:00:58.937]  And we're on a lot of radio stations and TV stations.
[02:00:59.978 --> 02:01:03.860]  Like you said, the vendetta, the foaming at the mouth, the obsession.
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:20.170]  When I was in court last week, when they were trying to take my kids away from me again, using lies in the media, they marched in journalism classes, New York Times reporters, others, and they all looked at me like I was worse than Charlie Manson, but it was beyond a look of hate.
[02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:21.611]  It was like a look of lust.
[02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:22.292]  I couldn't even, it was like a...
[02:01:25.021 --> 02:01:39.977]  And I had John Ronson here last year, who I've known for like 20 years, and I've turned around and he was looking at me going... And it's like, it's this Trump derangement syndrome, like were the darker demons released by the media saying it's okay to hate?
[02:01:39.977 --> 02:01:45.664]  Because these people have gone into like, this totally crazed mode, and I don't understand where the hate comes from.
[02:01:47.628 --> 02:01:54.311]  Well, oftentimes, like suicide, hate comes from people getting infected with letting Satan into their brain.
[02:01:54.311 --> 02:01:58.414]  And, you know, a lot of people don't understand that it comes in your own grammar.
[02:01:58.414 --> 02:02:03.016]  It sounds like you talking to yourself, but those deep, hateful, angry voices really are
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:09.042]  The dark side of the spiritual spectrum trying to influence people and they don't realize that they're being influenced.
[02:02:09.042 --> 02:02:17.706]  They think that they're legitimately angry and of course they lead themselves over time up to receiving those type of feeling comfortable with them.
[02:02:17.706 --> 02:02:28.710]  But Satan is a very real part of our society here and I think it's important that people realize that, that this is not just normal behavior.
[02:02:31.158 --> 02:02:32.159]  We've got three minutes left.
[02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:35.080]  Other key points, Phil Skousen, about things happening in the country and the world.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:35.840]  But I agree with you.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:47.126]  Whenever I may have anxiety or I'm angry at somebody, if I just think about Christ, my children, and being good, and just think about being peaceful, which I am when I'm not on air, then I just have great peace and can go back to sleep.
[02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:48.167]  You know, like late at night.
[02:02:51.346 --> 02:02:55.974]  So the things that I'm really concerned about is, one, not the midterm election so much.
[02:02:55.974 --> 02:02:59.039]  I don't think the Democrats are going to take the majorities in the House.
[02:02:59.039 --> 02:03:00.641]  They may well take the Senate.
[02:03:00.641 --> 02:03:04.948]  That's a fairly easy one to do with the small margin that we have there.
[02:03:06.615 --> 02:03:10.876]  I don't think they're going to take the House, so it's going to be a split Congress.
[02:03:10.876 --> 02:03:15.557]  It really won't change the dynamics anymore of Trump's difficulty in passing anything.
[02:03:15.557 --> 02:03:22.658]  He can't pass anything past the liberal Republicans, which block his every move anyway, and vote for the Democrats.
[02:03:22.658 --> 02:03:27.559]  So we really don't have a majority of Republicans that are backing the President in Congress.
[02:03:27.559 --> 02:03:30.380]  I don't think that's going to change significantly.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:34.561]  What's really going to change, though, is we're going to see this attack on Iran happen
[02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:46.114]  We're going to see North Korea get away with continuing to develop nuclear weapons because Donald Trump has completely defaulted on his pledge not to let this happen.
[02:03:46.114 --> 02:03:49.276]  And I'm very, very disturbed about Donald Trump for doing this.
[02:03:49.276 --> 02:03:55.360]  I'd like to be in the White House to hear what they're telling him to keep him from going back to the military option.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:00.343]  It may be that he has been succumbed to the promise of the Nobel Peace Prize, which they're never going to give him.
[02:04:00.928 --> 02:04:07.851]  But you know, they certainly laid that out there to get him onto the peace bandwagon completely.
[02:04:07.851 --> 02:04:12.352]  But why he doesn't get upset and say, all right, you played me for a fool long enough.
[02:04:12.352 --> 02:04:18.315]  I mean, look at Pompeo this week going to North Korea and say, just give us 60% of your nuclear weapons.
[02:04:18.315 --> 02:04:20.695]  Well, you don't even know what 100% is.
[02:04:20.695 --> 02:04:22.256]  So how can you talk about 60, 70%?
[02:04:22.256 --> 02:04:29.179]  You haven't even got an inventory for North Korea about what kind of nuclear weapons and you couldn't believe it even if they gave it to you.
[02:04:29.179 --> 02:04:30.059]  You have to have
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:33.981]  Hold on, I know you gotta go, but we're back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:33.981 --> 02:04:35.361]  Spend a couple minutes on Joel Skousen.
[02:04:35.361 --> 02:04:40.123]  What you think Trump needs to say to Kim Jong-un and how you think Trump got lured into this.
[02:04:56.522 --> 02:05:03.650]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[02:05:49.846 --> 02:05:52.528]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:03.352 --> 02:06:14.421]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:06:14.421 --> 02:06:23.628]  InfoWars.com has been down now for an hour, and it's definitely DDoS attacks, but I didn't take it down.
[02:06:23.628 --> 02:06:28.612]  That's been going on for a week and a half since Tim Cook announced, according to the New York Times,
[02:06:30.224 --> 02:06:32.266]  They were taking us off, and then they talked to Zuckerberg.
[02:06:32.266 --> 02:06:35.108]  He has these Sunday night meetings with all the other big tech heads.
[02:06:35.108 --> 02:06:39.251]  They admit the collusion, and then 20-plus groups do it.
[02:06:39.251 --> 02:06:46.137]  And then we got a top Fortune 20 company, I'm not going to name them, that does software and infrastructure, says, you're kicked off our platform.
[02:06:47.483 --> 02:06:50.984]  And then we send emails to the top going, my God, that's tortious interference.
[02:06:50.984 --> 02:06:53.425]  We have a contract, and they're like, we've been using you for years.
[02:06:53.425 --> 02:06:55.006]  And they go, actually, that's incorrect.
[02:06:55.006 --> 02:06:56.366]  Someone else was mistaken.
[02:06:56.366 --> 02:06:57.646]  You're still with us.
[02:06:57.646 --> 02:07:02.548]  So we're dealing with just insane levels of just mutinous, crazed behavior.
[02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:03.829]  And Joel Skousen was getting into that.
[02:07:03.829 --> 02:07:11.191]  I want him to finish up with North Korea and what he thinks Trump should do in an encapsulated piece about how he thinks he's been shut up.
[02:07:11.191 --> 02:07:15.492]  And I agree, as much as we want peace and things, this is starting to go sideways.
[02:07:15.492 --> 02:07:16.493]  And the left's going to love that.
[02:07:17.472 --> 02:07:21.197]  Obviously China's weighed in and put their pressure on.
[02:07:21.197 --> 02:07:29.907]  I want to finish up with China as well, but Joel, just briefly, on this Infowars.com being banned and this sabotage,
[02:07:31.345 --> 02:07:32.206]  And the craziness.
[02:07:50.678 --> 02:07:52.880]  Saying, oh, don't worry, we'll deal with fake news.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:59.604]  He came up with the idea that everybody put these notices up over news first that it wasn't real, run by Snopes and the Southern Primary Law Center.
[02:07:59.604 --> 02:08:02.646]  And now he's appearing to be a prime mover.
[02:08:02.646 --> 02:08:05.168]  I find it very interesting that he's moved Apple to China.
[02:08:05.168 --> 02:08:06.289]  It's become tax exempt.
[02:08:06.289 --> 02:08:12.273]  He put the iCloud codes with the government and said, oh, in China, when you move here, the government's part of your company.
[02:08:12.273 --> 02:08:13.633]  I mean, they're hiding that in plain view.
[02:08:14.754 --> 02:08:26.899]  I mean, I think it's outrageous to have a guy that runs some of the worst factories in the world with suicide nets and everything, moralizing how I need to be banned, and then everyone else, just like dominoes, goes, yes, sir, Mr. Cook, and falls into line.
[02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:32.882]  It shows the monopoly power of Google, Apple, and, of course, Facebook working in unison.
[02:08:32.882 --> 02:08:35.983]  It's classic trust behavior, classic monopoly, isn't it?
[02:08:37.179 --> 02:08:45.583]  Well, the thing you have to ask yourself is, how did these people get from normal, liberal, techie type people to globalists?
[02:08:45.583 --> 02:08:54.547]  There was a process that happened over the past decade, and I can tell you, if you knew what went on, you'd find there were some very private phone calls.
[02:08:54.547 --> 02:09:00.030]  Remember, every one of these tech companies had some government seed money from CIA and other dark places.
[02:09:00.603 --> 02:09:00.803]  I think?
[02:09:20.532 --> 02:09:28.418]  You've got to, you know, come on to the control system, to the system which is, you know, going towards this new, glorious new world order.
[02:09:28.418 --> 02:09:30.719]  They got converted at some point to globalism.
[02:09:30.719 --> 02:09:33.321]  It isn't that Tim Cook is pro-Chinese.
[02:09:33.321 --> 02:09:35.703]  He's a globalist.
[02:09:35.703 --> 02:09:36.624]  No, no, I agree.
[02:09:36.624 --> 02:09:38.285]  I mean, we're marrying into this global thing.
[02:09:38.285 --> 02:09:39.326]  It doesn't mean we're Chinese-run.
[02:09:39.326 --> 02:09:43.048]  It means we're merging and their values of oppression are now coming here.
[02:09:43.048 --> 02:09:45.030]  So let me ask this last question and we'll get into North Korea.
[02:09:46.829 --> 02:09:52.774]  Why would Jack Dorsey, who I know people have had dinner with him, multiple folks, they're like, no, no, Dorsey's scared.
[02:09:52.774 --> 02:09:53.594]  He doesn't like it.
[02:09:53.594 --> 02:09:56.677]  He's a liberal, but he thinks once this starts, it'll shut everything down.
[02:09:56.677 --> 02:09:58.338]  But he's been banning some conservatives.
[02:09:58.338 --> 02:10:01.761]  But then when they all did this, Jack Dorsey came out and said, no, we're not.
[02:10:01.761 --> 02:10:05.364]  Then CNN said, well, look at these tweets we think are wrong, which really were out of context.
[02:10:06.444 --> 02:10:09.025]  They just, Twitter just told us, please delete these.
[02:10:09.025 --> 02:10:11.366]  We did it just to see what would happen.
[02:10:11.366 --> 02:10:16.869]  But then, I know for a fact, I'm just going to leave it at this, Twitter then opened up some channels with messages to me.
[02:10:16.869 --> 02:10:22.511]  I don't know if I'm being suckered or what, but why do you think Jack Dorsey's doing that?
[02:10:22.511 --> 02:10:22.952]  I don't know.
[02:10:22.952 --> 02:10:32.376]  You know, it appeared when he put your tweets under review the very next day after he made that strong stand in support that I'm not going to ban, it indicated that he was under tremendous pressure.
[02:10:33.124 --> 02:10:35.648]  And he said, all right, we're going to put him through a review process.
[02:10:35.648 --> 02:10:38.552]  And that's why you got the messages of those to delete.
[02:10:38.552 --> 02:10:40.434]  He had to give them something.
[02:10:40.434 --> 02:10:42.537]  But apparently he isn't a globalist.
[02:10:42.537 --> 02:10:46.563]  I mean, if he were a globalist, he'd be, you know, saying yes to them.
[02:10:46.563 --> 02:10:49.347]  So they haven't got him converted yet, in my opinion.
[02:10:51.078 --> 02:10:53.219]  But I almost don't even want to tell the truth about that, though.
[02:10:53.219 --> 02:10:54.059]  We always tell the truth.
[02:10:54.059 --> 02:10:56.999]  It's like we have this, almost like a problem being honest about everything.
[02:10:56.999 --> 02:10:58.100]  We say things we probably shouldn't say.
[02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:00.620]  It's not lying to not say something you know.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:04.161]  But I just still have to almost blurt everything out unless it's in total confidence.
[02:11:04.161 --> 02:11:05.742]  But yeah, that's basically what I've heard.
[02:11:05.742 --> 02:11:11.003]  And I almost don't want to say that Jack Dorsey might be a good guy, because now they'll pile on him even more, Joel.
[02:11:12.967 --> 02:11:13.608]  Yeah, they will.
[02:11:13.608 --> 02:11:15.929]  You know, this isn't over.
[02:11:15.929 --> 02:11:21.214]  I mean, look what happened to the Verizon chief when he bucked government spying.
[02:11:21.214 --> 02:11:21.974]  He wasn't going to do it.
[02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:24.256]  They literally took this guy down.
[02:11:24.256 --> 02:11:26.919]  So his name, his days are numbered.
[02:11:26.919 --> 02:11:28.400]  These guys are very, very powerful.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:37.709]  Anyway, you know, this is one of the things I've covered in this week's World Affairs Brief that people really need to get read is this whole thing about taking down the deep state in the swamp.
[02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:42.093]  They are so much more powerful than we think, than Donald Trump thinks.
[02:11:42.093 --> 02:11:51.202]  Anybody who thinks they're going to take down the deep state, which runs every single federal law enforcement, at least the dark side of those law enforcement agencies, the judicial department,
[02:11:52.203 --> 02:11:55.506]  75% of Congress, they are just kidding themselves.
[02:11:55.506 --> 02:12:00.230]  If they're believing this guy called Q, well I'm convinced he's on his deep state.
[02:12:00.230 --> 02:12:06.495]  Oh, he's the guy that says trust Miller, trust this, uh, trust the Attorney General?
[02:12:06.495 --> 02:12:07.196]  What a joke!
[02:12:07.196 --> 02:12:08.497]  Q's been absolutely wrong!
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:13.685]  No, that's absolutely right, but it's amazing the following he's got.
[02:12:13.685 --> 02:12:15.607]  I mean, they got t-shirt factories pumping out.
[02:12:15.607 --> 02:12:16.849]  That means there's big money.
[02:12:16.849 --> 02:12:24.639]  They got a Hollywood producer that put out a video anonymously on cue and how wonderful this was that he's going to take down the Deep Swan.
[02:12:24.639 --> 02:12:27.363]  Look, why don't they put their name to it?
[02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:28.790]  What's illegal?
[02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:30.410]  What's dangerous about this video?
[02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:31.051]  Nothing!
[02:12:31.051 --> 02:12:34.091]  You don't put your name to it because this is Deep State.
[02:12:34.091 --> 02:12:34.591]  I agree.
[02:12:34.591 --> 02:12:35.631]  We're almost out of time.
[02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:36.732]  Finish up with North Korea.
[02:12:36.732 --> 02:12:37.812]  Just recap.
[02:12:37.812 --> 02:12:38.892]  Because we all want peace.
[02:12:38.892 --> 02:12:39.852]  We want a deal to happen.
[02:12:39.852 --> 02:12:41.813]  And Trump brought him to the verge.
[02:12:41.813 --> 02:12:43.933]  But then I saw North Korea run up there and meet with China.
[02:12:43.933 --> 02:12:45.873]  And I thought, oh boy.
[02:12:45.873 --> 02:12:46.293]  That's right.
[02:12:46.293 --> 02:12:47.434]  And they got there marching.
[02:12:47.434 --> 02:12:49.254]  Donald Trump could be played.
[02:12:49.254 --> 02:12:50.414]  And they did play him.
[02:12:50.414 --> 02:12:55.275]  I mean, Donald Trump got on an ego trip after that Singapore meeting and said he's promised me everything in the world.
[02:12:56.028 --> 02:12:59.171]  And the nuclear threat is over and now it clearly isn't.
[02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:00.131]  He's still building.
[02:13:00.131 --> 02:13:01.913]  Donald Trump needs to do this.
[02:13:01.913 --> 02:13:05.235]  You got two weeks, Kim, to let international and U.S.
[02:13:05.235 --> 02:13:12.521]  inspectors and take possession of all your nuclear facilities and weapons or we go back to the military option.
[02:13:12.521 --> 02:13:14.683]  And that doesn't mean an immediate attack.
[02:13:14.683 --> 02:13:17.525]  It just means we're going to take care of this militarily.
[02:13:17.525 --> 02:13:18.666]  It doesn't mean we're going to attack.
[02:13:18.666 --> 02:13:21.949]  It means tighten the noose again, start the drills again and move the forces into place.
[02:13:23.444 --> 02:13:28.526]  Yeah, but you really do need to take out his military so he's no longer a threat to North Korea.
[02:13:28.526 --> 02:13:30.927]  And that would take out the trigger event for World War III.
[02:13:30.927 --> 02:13:34.148]  North Korea has been preserved for decades as the trigger event.
[02:13:34.148 --> 02:13:47.394]  And by allowing Kim to get away with postponing any disarmament indefinitely, which is basically what he's doing, Trump is allowing that trigger event to be going into the next decade when the Russian front will be ready.
[02:13:47.714 --> 02:13:48.394]  You know, I agree.
[02:13:48.394 --> 02:13:52.976]  That's why it's critical to fix this, but if you look at Kim, he looked totally freaked out out of his mind at the meetings.
[02:13:52.976 --> 02:13:56.918]  The word is that some of those generals really run things, but he's got some control.
[02:13:56.918 --> 02:14:00.819]  I mean, isn't it that those generals are really CHICOM officers anyways?
[02:14:00.819 --> 02:14:01.399]  Absolutely.
[02:14:01.399 --> 02:14:04.721]  They're working for China, and Kim really does not run the country.
[02:14:04.721 --> 02:14:11.183]  They want the appearance of a crazy man so that when the war starts, Russian China can have plausible deniabilities.
[02:14:11.183 --> 02:14:13.704]  That crazy man who started the war wasn't us.
[02:14:13.704 --> 02:14:15.785]  But they are going to be ready to back it up
[02:14:16.866 --> 02:14:20.311]  So Kim probably does want peace when Trump hears that from Dennis Rodman.
[02:14:20.311 --> 02:14:22.755]  The problem is he's not running the show.
[02:14:22.755 --> 02:14:23.616]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:23.616 --> 02:14:25.860]  He doesn't know what the long-term game plan is.
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:31.428]  Now notice Kim writes nice letters, is a good cop, bad cop, but then the generals say another thing.
[02:14:31.428 --> 02:14:31.609]  Yeah.
[02:14:32.421 --> 02:14:38.308]  And so this is, I'm just afraid this is not going to go well.
[02:14:38.308 --> 02:14:41.571]  Donald Trump has completely given up the military option.
[02:14:41.571 --> 02:14:43.894]  I don't think he will go back to it.
[02:14:43.894 --> 02:14:47.178]  And so I think Kim is building nuclear weapons as we speak.
[02:14:47.638 --> 02:14:50.581]  And developing more rocket technology as is indicated by the U.S.
[02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:51.642]  government satellite photos.
[02:14:51.642 --> 02:14:52.463]  Sure, exactly.
[02:14:52.463 --> 02:14:56.967]  But Trump went with the angle that he thought no one really tried to do detente and try a peace deal.
[02:14:56.967 --> 02:14:58.328]  He did offer him everything.
[02:14:58.328 --> 02:15:00.170]  And if they reject it, that's their problem now.
[02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:01.791]  At least we've taken the high road though.
[02:15:01.791 --> 02:15:06.916]  But so now we have to, I agree, come in with strength now that they're starting to back off.
[02:15:06.916 --> 02:15:07.416]  Yeah.
[02:15:07.416 --> 02:15:09.939]  And Trump shows no indication of going back to strength.
[02:15:10.899 --> 02:15:11.300]  All right.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:12.782]  That's always great information.
[02:15:12.782 --> 02:15:15.345]  Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com, editor over there.

[02:15:29.639 --> 02:15:30.500]  You're welcome.
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:31.880]  I got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to.
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:33.861]  And quite frankly, I don't want us to be in the news.
[02:15:33.861 --> 02:15:36.603]  I'm tired of trying to keep stuff up here and running.
[02:15:36.603 --> 02:15:38.324]  They've shut down InfoWars.com.
[02:15:38.324 --> 02:15:40.605]  And I'm going to go during the break and try to find out what's going on.
[02:15:40.605 --> 02:15:42.967]  I've been ranting a little bit on there.
[02:15:42.967 --> 02:15:45.308]  Crew's doing a great job.
[02:15:45.308 --> 02:15:47.389]  And I just... This is America.
[02:15:47.389 --> 02:15:49.050]  They want to shut down everything.
[02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:52.112]  And I'm sick and tired of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:52.112 --> 02:15:53.173]  I'm sick and tired of it.
[02:15:55.208 --> 02:15:56.088]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:15:56.088 --> 02:15:58.469]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[02:20:13.345 --> 02:20:15.728]  Because there is a war on.
[02:20:15.728 --> 02:20:16.949]  Or you're mine.
[02:20:27.495 --> 02:20:28.195]  I just knew too much.
[02:20:28.195 --> 02:20:28.936]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:20:57.790 --> 02:21:02.615]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:21:02.615 --> 02:21:03.136]  Possibly.
[02:21:03.136 --> 02:21:11.926]  You see, when you're out there... Alright.
[02:21:11.926 --> 02:21:18.053]  I want to give the phone number out and take your call specifically on InfoWars.com being hacked, being taken down.
[02:21:19.795 --> 02:21:28.861]  And how they're trying to take our payment processors, how they're trying to shut down our emails, how they're shutting down Disqus Us, and just all these sick, evil companies.
[02:21:28.861 --> 02:21:44.551]  WebChimp, all of it, when Tim Cook, that runs the biggest slave factories, with suicide nets, forced abortion, trying to kill gay people, Buddhists, Christians, sells their organs, not a damn word out of him, and the New York Times says he's the man of the moral vision.
[02:21:44.551 --> 02:21:46.813]  And he's just banned in full wars a week and a half ago.
[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:59.019]  And then like dominoes it happens and now they're doing it to all these other conservatives and all these other Christians and all these other nationalists.
[02:21:59.019 --> 02:22:05.124]  And there's Congress just asleep at the switch wearing one of those little clown hats with a propeller on the top.
[02:22:05.124 --> 02:22:08.067]  Just having no idea what planet they're on.
[02:22:08.067 --> 02:22:13.011]  Trump's distracted with Amoroso and all her edited audio and all that crap.
[02:22:13.011 --> 02:22:16.053]  This is how the country dies.
[02:22:16.053 --> 02:22:16.674]  In the deep state.
[02:22:18.123 --> 02:22:28.326]  Globalists, multinationals, eugenicists, control freaks, they're allied with China, they're screwing the country over, and they think it's funny.
[02:22:28.326 --> 02:22:30.427]  They think you're stupid.
[02:22:30.427 --> 02:22:33.868]  And they do everything they can to make you stupid so they can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:22:33.868 --> 02:22:38.229]  And then you look at these globalists, almost none of them have children, they're all very unhappy themselves.
[02:22:38.229 --> 02:22:41.950]  It's just like, but they wanted power, so they're in charge.
[02:22:44.383 --> 02:22:49.766]  And they're just, this is totally un-American to have CNN all over the news saying, he's got the number one apps!
[02:22:49.766 --> 02:22:52.048]  Infowars official, take it down!
[02:22:52.048 --> 02:22:56.190]  People aren't like, whoa, you people are scum!
[02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:58.732]  I mean, folks are.
[02:22:58.732 --> 02:23:05.375]  But it's just the outrageousness of how they've, like an abused woman, the guys abuse them so long, they're just used to it.
[02:23:05.375 --> 02:23:08.257]  It's like, you know, he's got a tire iron out now, beating her in the head.
[02:23:08.257 --> 02:23:12.640]  It's like they let Antifa beat up whoever they want, even beat up NBC and CNN reporters.
[02:23:13.976 --> 02:23:16.638]  Yeah, people like Cuomo saying it's okay, it's good, or ignoring it.
[02:23:16.638 --> 02:23:19.701]  I mean, these people are a bunch of yes-men.
[02:23:19.701 --> 02:23:34.955]  And so now, the big tech companies that were born in this country are in China, because that's the globalist model of authoritarianism, and it's coming here, and we're the one ringing the alarm bell, so we've got to be shut down because we would dare to talk about it.
[02:23:34.955 --> 02:23:36.996]  There's a must-see article at Infowars.com.
[02:23:39.821 --> 02:23:42.763]  That I'm going to read, and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:23:42.763 --> 02:23:43.764]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:23:43.764 --> 02:23:44.805]  He's got his guest on.
[02:23:44.805 --> 02:23:48.307]  You know, most people, when their website's taken down, they're being shut down, would cancel the guest.
[02:23:48.307 --> 02:23:51.710]  But the guest, you know, is into social media and stuff, and that's great.
[02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:54.852]  So maybe we'll spend a little bit of time on influencers being shut down.
[02:23:54.852 --> 02:23:59.636]  But my whole deal is, would people notice if we completely shut down?
[02:23:59.636 --> 02:24:02.178]  Because, you know, once we go down, everything goes down.
[02:24:04.136 --> 02:24:14.746]  And they've said that, and the globalists, and the chi-coms, and Soros admit they're making their move, and Hillary, you wanted somebody to fight them, you wanted somebody to stand up to them, you wanted somebody to take action, and then we started having victory!
[02:24:14.746 --> 02:24:19.370]  Everybody's kind of like it's a video game or a TV show.
[02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:22.633]  It's not.
[02:24:22.633 --> 02:24:25.536]  And I look at the satanic hatred that mainstream media has for me.
[02:24:28.029 --> 02:24:32.170]  And they're all pathetic losers and they just want slavery.
[02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:37.852]  So, there's InfoWars.com before I hit refresh on it earlier.
[02:24:37.852 --> 02:24:42.554]  I wonder why this doesn't work.
[02:24:42.554 --> 02:24:43.574]  Doesn't matter.
[02:24:43.574 --> 02:24:46.035]  Why does anything need to work?
[02:24:46.035 --> 02:24:48.135]  Here, I'll just do this.
[02:24:48.135 --> 02:24:50.176]  That'll fix that mouse.
[02:24:50.176 --> 02:24:52.457]  Thing hardly works half the time anyways.
[02:24:52.457 --> 02:24:54.678]  So, that's where we are as a country.
[02:24:54.678 --> 02:24:55.698]  It's where we are as a nation.
[02:24:57.148 --> 02:24:58.909]  Torbjörn's World!
[02:24:58.909 --> 02:25:00.570]  And I guess they've got a splash page up.
[02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:02.572]  That looks pretty cool, coming for that quick.
[02:25:02.572 --> 02:25:04.333]  Infowars is under attack.
[02:25:04.333 --> 02:25:07.355]  Please visit our other channels now.
[02:25:07.355 --> 02:25:11.878]  Newswars.com, Infowars Store, PrisonPlanet.com and Twitter.
[02:25:11.878 --> 02:25:14.659]  And of course, they're hitting all of those.
[02:25:14.659 --> 02:25:23.045]  They see it as our extermination, our annihilation, is the answer to everything.
[02:25:23.045 --> 02:25:24.766]  And there'll be this beautiful, wonderful world.
[02:25:26.949 --> 02:25:36.293]  Once you shut it down, we might want to get somebody to write an article for InfoWars.com about, for about an hour and thirty minutes we've been down.
[02:25:36.293 --> 02:25:37.673]  There's a PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:37.673 --> 02:25:38.334]  We just might.
[02:25:38.334 --> 02:25:39.274]  I run a news organization.
[02:25:39.274 --> 02:25:41.015]  Everybody's great!
[02:25:41.015 --> 02:25:45.437]  We just might want to get a video out that we're down.
[02:25:45.437 --> 02:25:46.857]  Just maybe.
[02:25:46.857 --> 02:25:48.418]  Something like that.
[02:25:48.418 --> 02:25:55.181]  But, you know, they had the big, giant, ongoing attack last week and
[02:25:56.442 --> 02:26:14.169]  Now they're doing it to everybody else and now they want the sites shut down themselves because Congress and the President didn't respond to the payment processors and the emails and the Facebook and the Google and the YouTube and the Apple and the Stitcher and the Spotify and everything else.
[02:26:14.169 --> 02:26:15.090]  So why not?
[02:26:15.090 --> 02:26:16.810]  America is asleep!
[02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:17.651]  America wants...
[02:26:18.291 --> 02:26:19.272]  America wants to get gang-raped.
[02:26:19.272 --> 02:26:21.034]  America wants to get pushed over.
[02:26:21.034 --> 02:26:22.797]  America wants to get dominated.
[02:26:22.797 --> 02:26:31.167]  That's the big green light, the deep state, the hemiogenesis that funded Hitler and created China.
[02:26:31.167 --> 02:26:31.988]  That's where they are.
[02:26:31.988 --> 02:26:36.774]  That's what they want.
[02:26:36.774 --> 02:26:37.454]  That's what they're doing.
[02:26:38.444 --> 02:26:42.066]  Because we've been raised to be sat in front of a television.
[02:26:42.066 --> 02:26:43.867]  We've been raised to be spectators.
[02:26:43.867 --> 02:26:53.772]  So, those people, even though they're not wimps, somebody walks over and punches them in the face, they just sit there, because they think this is a video game.
[02:26:53.772 --> 02:27:01.376]  They think it's funny Tim Cook prances around and, you know, says, I'm a gay rights guy, and then, you know, loves China, you know, killing gays, and doesn't say a damn word about it.
[02:27:01.376 --> 02:27:03.877]  That's the worst, horrible, demonic factories.
[02:27:03.877 --> 02:27:08.019]  Even the Chi-Coms say, pay us two dollars more a day and they could have houses, and he goes, F them.
[02:27:09.448 --> 02:27:15.713]  But he's Tim Cook, because the media said he was this big liberal, he was this big god like Zuckerberg.
[02:27:15.713 --> 02:27:20.157]  An internal email saying F everybody, F you, F my users.
[02:27:20.157 --> 02:27:27.623]  But trust me, it's unconsciousness.
[02:27:27.623 --> 02:27:29.504]  It's the culture of TV heads.
[02:27:29.504 --> 02:27:31.266]  It's the culture of video game heads.
[02:27:31.266 --> 02:27:36.230]  It's the culture, everybody's just like... The Chinese aren't like that.
[02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:38.948]  Islamists aren't like that.
[02:27:38.948 --> 02:27:41.069]  They're just sharpening their knives constantly.
[02:27:41.069 --> 02:27:46.511]  They see weakness and a bunch of traitors that are ready to sell them out.
[02:27:46.511 --> 02:27:54.294]  And if Tim Cook sees, you know, a billion, 500 million slaves, and he goes, hmm, that'll be delicious.
[02:27:54.294 --> 02:27:57.055]  It's all about his power.
[02:27:57.055 --> 02:27:59.736]  Now they sell you a phone for three times what it should be sold for.
[02:27:59.736 --> 02:28:03.217]  And it just goes on and on from that point.
[02:28:03.217 --> 02:28:04.398]  So I'm going to try to be a nice boy.
[02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.091]  InfoWars is down.
[02:28:07.091 --> 02:28:08.072]  InfoWars has been hacked.
[02:28:08.072 --> 02:28:09.273]  InfoWars has been taken down.
[02:28:09.273 --> 02:28:10.894]  It should be a major news item.
[02:28:10.894 --> 02:28:12.836]  Obviously, no one even cares around here.
[02:28:12.836 --> 02:28:18.140]  So, the toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:19.161]  877-789-2539.
[02:28:19.161 --> 02:28:21.123]  Our phones work.
[02:28:21.123 --> 02:28:22.885]  They don't want you to be able to comment on InfoWars.
[02:28:22.885 --> 02:28:27.749]  They don't want you to be able to, you know, have any free speech in this country, but you can still call in on this subject.
[02:28:29.774 --> 02:28:37.002]  For people taking the calls, the subject of InfoWars being down, and what's happening, and the whole move to ban free speech, and what we should do.
[02:28:37.002 --> 02:28:39.564]  That's what the phones are open about.
[02:28:39.564 --> 02:28:45.891]  If I could have just one power in my life, it'd be occasionally on a topic I want to discuss, that people call in about that.
[02:28:45.891 --> 02:28:47.633]  It would be amazing.
[02:28:47.633 --> 02:28:50.636]  It would be really fantastic.
[02:28:50.636 --> 02:28:51.637]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:28:56.267 --> 02:28:58.008]  Let's talk tough.
[02:28:58.008 --> 02:28:59.409]  Let's talk comfort.
[02:28:59.409 --> 02:29:01.790]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:04.711]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[02:29:04.711 --> 02:29:06.732]  Like you wore as a kid.
[02:29:06.732 --> 02:29:07.633]  Remember?
[02:29:07.633 --> 02:29:16.277]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:29:16.277 --> 02:29:19.779]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:29:19.779 --> 02:29:22.560]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:29:24.528 --> 02:29:29.222]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:29:29.222 --> 02:29:31.930]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:29:33.803 --> 02:29:37.187]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:29:37.187 --> 02:29:38.669]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[02:29:38.669 --> 02:29:41.932]  In our Defender Motorcycle Jeans comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:29:41.932 --> 02:29:42.793]  See them at gusset.com.
[02:29:42.793 --> 02:29:43.915]  That's gusset.com.
[02:29:43.915 --> 02:29:44.475]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[02:29:44.475 --> 02:29:44.776]  That's 888-848-7738.
[02:29:44.776 --> 02:29:45.677]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:29:45.677 --> 02:29:46.037]  Others don't.
[02:29:57.392 --> 02:30:05.936]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globals to live in a free society.

[02:31:15.077 --> 02:31:15.857]  The revolution.
[02:31:15.857 --> 02:31:17.978]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[02:31:37.046 --> 02:31:39.347]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:31:41.468 --> 02:31:48.732]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[02:32:59.267 --> 02:33:01.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.583 --> 02:33:42.115]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:42.115 --> 02:33:44.219]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:34:08.312 --> 02:34:28.248]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:34:28.248 --> 02:34:32.412]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[02:34:39.650 --> 02:34:40.531]  Alex Jones!
[02:34:40.531 --> 02:34:41.892]  Scum!
[02:34:41.892 --> 02:34:45.296]  Russian scum!
[02:34:45.296 --> 02:34:50.121]  Until war comes to mind.
[02:34:50.121 --> 02:34:56.468]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:34:56.468 --> 02:34:57.949]  I will not let you down.
[02:34:57.949 --> 02:35:00.812]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:35:07.093 --> 02:35:30.570]  They have been trying to hack and DDoS attack and sabotage our servers and people within major companies bring us down since the head of the Chinese slave factory censorship combine, the head of Apple, Mr. Cook, Mr. Zuckerberg, and the heads of Google and Alphabet decided to unperson us last Sunday night, eight, nine days ago.
[02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:32.191]  And currently InfoWars is down.
[02:35:33.268 --> 02:35:34.949]  They were trying to bring it down this weekend.
[02:35:34.949 --> 02:35:39.471]  The crew had to stay up here basically to midnight many nights.
[02:35:39.471 --> 02:35:58.322]  And it's all a big vitriolic joke to the left online and all these newspapers and the nightmare image of Brian Stelter's crazy looking pumpkin head saying take off his apps, bring down his website, take his sponsors, bankrupt him, drive him into submission.
[02:35:58.322 --> 02:35:59.702]  It's so un-American.
[02:35:59.702 --> 02:36:00.963]  It's so illegal.
[02:36:00.963 --> 02:36:02.664]  It's so disgusting.
[02:36:04.497 --> 02:36:06.738]  That I get really, really angry.
[02:36:06.738 --> 02:36:18.044]  And I think about them taking our email system to be able to email you, taking Discuss Us away, WebChimp, Credio, after they took AdRoll away from us that was funding much of the operation a year and a half ago.
[02:36:18.044 --> 02:36:20.745]  Now they took this away, when Credio came to us.
[02:36:20.745 --> 02:36:33.892]  And then our general counsel wants the virtue signal, because Apple and Google and Facebook have made an internet monopoly, and we're all close to imploding, you know, so we have to grovel to the system, this is basically what's going on, hoping they buy us up.
[02:36:34.372 --> 02:36:45.198]  And just watching a nation of cowards and scum in corporate America who don't care about their birthright, the First Amendment, nothing!
[02:36:45.198 --> 02:36:49.900]  And the Chinese communists all over the news, controlling Hollywood, controlling what's happening.
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:37:03.007]  There is an article that is in the Washington Times today by a national security expert that works for Fox News, and he's a special operations veteran, and a graduate of the Air Force Academy.
[02:37:04.514 --> 02:37:08.095]  I want to get him on the show, L. Todd Wood.
[02:37:08.095 --> 02:37:23.802]  And he talks about how China is the threat, and how Hollywood's run by it, and the telecoms, and the media, and how Google this year walked off a Defense Department project because their engineers said, we will not work for America, we hate you!
[02:37:23.802 --> 02:37:29.444]  And so many of their operatives are either Chinese communists, or they're in league with it.
[02:37:29.444 --> 02:37:33.686]  The globalists completely sold us out, and now they're trying to shut down our free speech.
[02:37:34.847 --> 02:37:39.470]  I mean, hell, Europe Wars was down today being attacked before I went on air.
[02:37:39.470 --> 02:37:44.573]  Now it's Infowars.com's been down for two hours.
[02:37:44.573 --> 02:37:47.675]  And I haven't gone over all of it.
[02:37:47.675 --> 02:38:03.505]  I've got a bunch of the articles and a bunch of the documents right here, but I mean, I have to get on the phone with executives for major companies and find out how their employees are deleting our software licenses to run backend stuff for inventory
[02:38:04.045 --> 02:38:19.034]  That's the espionage level we're at, and it shows the Democrats will go to any lengths because they've been trained to hate America in college, and they've been trained to hate America by Hollywood, and China owns it now, and every Netflix show that's political is pro-communist China, anti-America.
[02:38:19.034 --> 02:38:24.377]  It's just everywhere, and it's even admitted they run the country now.
[02:38:24.377 --> 02:38:30.180]  I've got a stack of news here about China putting out government broadcasts into the United States.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:31.321]  That's in the LA Times.
[02:38:33.621 --> 02:38:38.545]  It's incredible how sold out we are, and there you go.
[02:38:38.545 --> 02:38:44.789]  So first it's, oh, you know, the people at Apple, Tim Cook can do what he wants, and Zuckerberg can do what he wants.
[02:38:44.789 --> 02:38:52.515]  When Zuckerberg makes statements about the publishing industry and other newspapers, he goes, I'll hold your hand while you are dying, like at hospice.
[02:38:53.831 --> 02:38:55.532]  But we're not dying, we're exploding!
[02:38:55.532 --> 02:38:56.232]  So what do you do?
[02:38:56.232 --> 02:39:15.579]  You shadow ban us, and you smother us, and you manipulate us, and you build straw men, and you lie about who we are, and you try to assassinate the truth, and then you censure all these other conservatives and libertarians and people, because it backfires on you, you stop covering it, and now you go after our actual infrastructure, which is totally illegal.
[02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:17.620]  Go read the article, it's up on InfoWars.org.
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.241]  I'm sorry, you can't go there, it's at the Washington Times.
[02:39:22.754 --> 02:39:23.775]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:39:23.775 --> 02:39:26.056]  China is a threat, and it may be too late.
[02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.497]  For now, you can read it on Twitter.
[02:39:27.497 --> 02:39:28.718]  I tweeted it at RealAlexJones.
[02:39:28.718 --> 02:39:45.848]  But you need to get upset like you got upset last week, and send a strong message that you know what's going on, and you know what's unfolding, and you're upset, and you're going to take action, and call Congress, and call the White House, and call talk radio, and say, we're losing our First Amendment now.
[02:39:45.848 --> 02:39:47.829]  Infowars is the first domino.
[02:39:47.829 --> 02:39:50.191]  They're already banning everybody from Laura Loomer to
[02:39:51.479 --> 02:40:13.696]  Gavin McGinnis and everybody else that stand up for this country and against the Antifa thugs that are attacking men, women, and children, and against the globalists, and against ABC got caught doing fake stuff with actors, where a guy in a MAGA hat goes over and is mean to other people and tries to throw them out of a restaurant, when it's the Democrats acting like that?
[02:40:13.696 --> 02:40:16.479]  These people are out of control!
[02:40:16.479 --> 02:40:17.860]  They're willing to do anything!
[02:40:19.192 --> 02:40:23.574]  And they've taken our acquiescence, and they've taken our kindness as weakness, and now they're going for broke.
[02:40:23.574 --> 02:40:24.795]  And I'll add this again.
[02:40:24.795 --> 02:40:43.025]  While it's still up, InfowarStore.com, while they haven't taken all our payment processes away, people need to vote with their dollars and let me know that A, you want great products, but B, you're gonna support the Infowar into the future, because this is when we need your support.
[02:40:43.025 --> 02:40:44.026]  This is when we need the help.
[02:40:44.026 --> 02:40:47.328]  The other times, I'm up here like, oh, I expect to be attacked, we're moving forward, blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:48.564 --> 02:40:52.527]  This is the main test right now, and I expect it to get even worse in the next few weeks.
[02:40:52.527 --> 02:40:54.168]  They want to break our will.
[02:40:54.168 --> 02:41:01.334]  I've got to cool off and be calm, like Joel Scouser said earlier, and not get too angry about what they're doing and trying to fight them, because I'm not depressed.
[02:41:01.334 --> 02:41:02.014]  It's the opposite.
[02:41:02.014 --> 02:41:07.058]  I am on fire wanting to fight, wanting to be politically active and involved and win.
[02:41:08.653 --> 02:41:14.241]  But as sure as the sun came up, they're calling for violence and they're getting ready to stage violence against themselves to blame Infowars and Trump.
[02:41:14.241 --> 02:41:21.491]  And I believe that's what this is, is preparation for a false flag against a big tech giant or CNN that they will stage.
[02:41:22.637 --> 02:41:25.640]  Or their surrogates will stage, then be blamed on us.
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:32.046]  And that's why this is so critical in such an emergency, because they wouldn't be doing this if they weren't planning something big going into the midterm.
[02:41:32.046 --> 02:41:38.132]  So now is the time of maximum vigilance on the streets, calling to talk radio, speaking at city council about this.
[02:41:38.132 --> 02:41:40.815]  Well, there's a buzz so big that we let the Democrats know.
[02:41:41.115 --> 02:41:43.416]  You're carrying out a criminal deal with the Chi-Coms.
[02:41:43.416 --> 02:41:45.678]  You think there's an American awakening?
[02:41:45.678 --> 02:41:49.900]  You're going to snuff it out and bring in civil war and civil unrest and shut us all down?
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:50.641]  It ain't happening.
[02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:57.745]  And every city council and every globalist organization and every newspaper politely and nicely needs to be let known.
[02:41:57.745 --> 02:41:59.946]  We know you guys are having your Antifa meetings.
[02:41:59.946 --> 02:42:02.908]  We know you're organizing this crap and we see through you.
[02:42:04.278 --> 02:42:07.920]  So we've got, why should I even, free shipping, the best products, everything.
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.582]  Right now we barely make money on a lot of these products, we sell them so low so we can be competitive in the market.
[02:42:12.582 --> 02:42:17.305]  But I need people to understand, fund us to fight the bullies, to save the internet, to save InfoWars.
[02:42:18.911 --> 02:42:25.738]  It's still standing right now, even though they're all over it, filing fake complaints on us, saying we sell child porn on there to take it down.
[02:42:25.738 --> 02:42:28.320]  I'm getting the reports, I'm getting who the people are.
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.064]  By the time I sue some of them, we'll already be through the election and civil war.
[02:42:32.064 --> 02:42:38.310]  But don't worry, I'm gonna start suing, because I gotta let these people know, just like with the lawsuits, you sue me, I go after you.
[02:42:38.310 --> 02:42:39.691]  But you want somebody to fight?
[02:42:39.691 --> 02:42:40.212]  I'm fighting!
[02:42:41.075 --> 02:42:43.996]  But I need your support and your prayers and to spread the links now.
[02:42:43.996 --> 02:42:44.596]  It's happening.
[02:42:44.596 --> 02:42:46.137]  It's just worse than last week.
[02:42:46.137 --> 02:42:48.298]  InfoWars.com is down.
[02:42:48.298 --> 02:42:50.838]  I'm gonna take this live video, put it on Twitter and everywhere else.
[02:42:50.838 --> 02:42:51.919]  Get it out, folks!
[02:42:51.919 --> 02:42:52.759]  Take action!
[02:42:52.759 --> 02:42:54.160]  Don't let them break their will!
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:55.120]  Your call straight ahead!
[02:43:00.219 --> 02:43:02.580]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:06.022]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[02:43:06.022 --> 02:43:12.386]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan-favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:43:12.386 --> 02:43:17.889]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the Powerhouse Preglanum product.
[02:43:17.889 --> 02:43:25.594]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process, with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[02:43:26.034 --> 02:43:32.459]  A powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.

[02:43:43.126 --> 02:43:47.569]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.
[02:43:47.569 --> 02:43:51.392]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at infowarrestore.com.
[02:43:55.267 --> 02:43:56.628]  We knew it was coming.
[02:43:56.628 --> 02:43:58.068]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[02:43:58.068 --> 02:44:11.333]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[02:44:11.333 --> 02:44:12.314]  And then voila!
[02:44:12.314 --> 02:44:20.897]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten
[02:44:21.277 --> 02:44:21.917]  News Feeds.
[02:44:45.689 --> 02:44:48.391]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[02:44:48.391 --> 02:44:53.495]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[02:44:53.495 --> 02:44:54.756]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:05.943]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:05.943 --> 02:45:13.806]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.806 --> 02:45:16.968]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:17.148 --> 02:45:22.431]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:45:22.431 --> 02:45:25.213]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:45:25.213 --> 02:45:34.178]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:45:34.358 --> 02:45:46.205]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro balancing properties.
[02:45:46.205 --> 02:45:51.028]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:51.028 --> 02:45:52.689]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:55.876 --> 02:45:59.858]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[02:45:59.858 --> 02:46:02.599]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[02:46:02.599 --> 02:46:07.402]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[02:46:07.402 --> 02:46:09.823]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:46:09.823 --> 02:46:12.845]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.
[02:46:12.845 --> 02:46:17.307]  bottles, Immune Gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen, or wherever you go.

[02:46:39.949 --> 02:46:41.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:16.869 --> 02:47:18.470]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson is coming up.
[02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:19.431]  I'm going to co-host some of them.
[02:47:19.431 --> 02:47:21.552]  He's got a very special guest.
[02:47:21.552 --> 02:47:23.414]  I just want to beat the censors.
[02:47:23.414 --> 02:47:25.075]  And yes, you've made the app number one.
[02:47:25.075 --> 02:47:27.296]  You've given it a five-star review.
[02:47:27.296 --> 02:47:30.679]  Millions have gone and signed up for the podcast.
[02:47:30.679 --> 02:47:35.562]  Same thing has gone on with the InfoWars.com forward slash newsletters.
[02:47:35.562 --> 02:47:37.984]  We can email you and get around the censors.
[02:47:37.984 --> 02:47:39.825]  But InfoWars.com is down right now.
[02:47:39.825 --> 02:47:41.887]  So let me just make this one-minute statement so I can get it out there.
[02:47:43.186 --> 02:47:45.327]  There is an attack on our birthright of free speech.
[02:47:45.327 --> 02:47:47.388]  They are taking people's speech across the board.
[02:47:47.388 --> 02:47:52.190]  All nationalists, all conservatives are being shadow banned and dialed down to nothing.
[02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:57.533]  Now they're going to total de-platforming with the Chinese communist social score system coming here.
[02:47:57.533 --> 02:47:59.794]  Apple and Google have moved to China.
[02:47:59.794 --> 02:48:02.575]  They are admittedly implementing it here with the Democrats.
[02:48:03.055 --> 02:48:09.779]  Senator Warner, Senator Murphy are admitting they're coming in with the EU style censorship and working with China.
[02:48:09.779 --> 02:48:11.220]  This is treason.
[02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:15.683]  This is outrageous and we're so used to freedom, we don't know what we're dealing with.
[02:48:15.683 --> 02:48:17.144]  We don't know how to respond to this.
[02:48:17.144 --> 02:48:20.646]  This is violating campaign finance law of the Democrats.
[02:48:20.646 --> 02:48:22.187]  It is manipulating the election.
[02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:24.521]  This is real.
[02:48:24.521 --> 02:48:27.584]  This is happening and InfoWars.com is down.
[02:48:27.584 --> 02:48:32.468]  We have NewsWars.com, we have PrisonPlanet.com, we have InfoWarsStore.com so you can support us.
[02:48:32.468 --> 02:48:33.749]  You can still get the apps for now.
[02:48:33.749 --> 02:48:39.254]  CNN's lobbying to have those taken down, along with the criminal New York Times owned by a foreign corrupt kingpin.
[02:48:39.254 --> 02:48:41.095]  This is like a sick nightmare!
[02:48:41.095 --> 02:48:44.699]  But this is how America falls if we don't wake up and take action.
[02:48:45.319 --> 02:48:50.323]  I'm Alex Jones, and I won't back down, I won't give in to these tyrants, and I'm counting on you to do the same.
[02:48:50.323 --> 02:48:54.968]  But now's the time to raise the alarm against this takeover.
[02:48:54.968 --> 02:49:04.216]  Alright, Julie, Michael, Duke, Mark, Aaron, Fernando, Stefan, Kevin, Carter, John, Lily, Matthew, we'll start taking your phone calls here.
[02:49:04.216 --> 02:49:06.998]  Who's up first?
[02:49:06.998 --> 02:49:08.359]  Let's go to Julie in Canada.
[02:49:08.359 --> 02:49:09.700]  Julie, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:09.700 --> 02:49:10.001]  Go ahead.
[02:49:10.563 --> 02:49:13.024]  Alex, thanks for taking our call.
[02:49:13.024 --> 02:49:15.065]  My husband and I watch your show every day.
[02:49:15.065 --> 02:49:16.026]  We love it.
[02:49:16.026 --> 02:49:21.128]  And I just wanted to say that your Super Glue toothpaste is a fantastic product.
[02:49:21.128 --> 02:49:22.809]  I recommend it highly to everybody.
[02:49:22.809 --> 02:49:28.491]  And I just wanted to mention that what happens in the States happens in Canada.
[02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:36.215]  And we're very, very concerned that Trump might not get elected if he doesn't deal with this issue.
[02:49:36.215 --> 02:49:38.196]  This is affecting a lot of people.
[02:49:38.923 --> 02:49:40.183]  I don't know what you think about that.
[02:49:40.183 --> 02:49:40.884]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:49:40.884 --> 02:49:41.804]  This is the issue.
[02:49:41.804 --> 02:49:43.004]  This is the end of the First Amendment.
[02:49:43.004 --> 02:49:44.545]  It's more important than the Second.
[02:49:44.545 --> 02:49:47.106]  Because it's absolutely critical.
[02:49:47.106 --> 02:49:49.766]  And we can't speak out for the Second Amendment or the Fourth Amendment.
[02:49:49.766 --> 02:49:50.807]  It's all gone, Julie.
[02:49:50.807 --> 02:49:52.367]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:49:52.367 --> 02:49:58.369]  And Trump is dropping the ball because he's always distracted with Amarosa and all this other crud.
[02:50:00.365 --> 02:50:03.907]  But somebody's got to be able to get a hold of him and talk to him.
[02:50:03.907 --> 02:50:05.407]  I don't know.
[02:50:05.407 --> 02:50:08.289]  I got him info three weeks ago and then all hell broke loose.
[02:50:08.289 --> 02:50:09.889]  That's another reason they're after me.
[02:50:09.889 --> 02:50:11.150]  They know we're getting stuff to Trump.
[02:50:12.631 --> 02:50:17.392]  And I'm trying in between trying to keep us on air to get a report up of the examples and what should be done.
[02:50:17.392 --> 02:50:20.553]  And some of my connections, the White House just went cold.
[02:50:20.553 --> 02:50:23.113]  I mean, it's it's this is some shit.
[02:50:23.113 --> 02:50:23.913]  They're making their move.
[02:50:23.913 --> 02:50:24.693]  God bless you, Julie.
[02:50:24.693 --> 02:50:25.374]  We love you.
[02:50:25.374 --> 02:50:25.714]  Yeah.
[02:50:25.714 --> 02:50:30.635]  Canada is under a lot of draconian censorship now, where if you read Bible verses, you get arrested.
[02:50:30.635 --> 02:50:33.875]  I mean, they're taking mother and father out of the national anthem.
[02:50:33.875 --> 02:50:36.396]  It's incredible.
[02:50:36.396 --> 02:50:40.937]  Let's take a call from Michael in the Netherlands over there in the Dutch areas.
[02:50:40.937 --> 02:50:41.597]  Michael, go ahead.
[02:50:41.597 --> 02:50:42.017]  You're on the air.
[02:50:42.912 --> 02:50:46.939]  Hi Alex, welcome in the Europe.
[02:50:46.939 --> 02:50:48.241]  Great show, it's a great show.
[02:50:48.241 --> 02:50:49.504]  I have one question.
[02:50:49.504 --> 02:50:50.906]  Yes sir.
[02:50:50.906 --> 02:50:56.195]  Why is InfoWars not working together with Wikileaks, Mark Dice and David Icke?
[02:50:57.186 --> 02:51:00.549]  Okay, I've been inviting David on for about a year and a half because I'm pro-Trump.
[02:51:00.549 --> 02:51:02.050]  He won't come on.
[02:51:02.050 --> 02:51:03.712]  And then WikiLeaks has their own thing.
[02:51:03.712 --> 02:51:08.435]  They've defended us, but they're mainly mainline leftist, but they're actually real liberals, so they're good people.
[02:51:08.435 --> 02:51:12.359]  It's just that they're scared of the propaganda about me, the strongman, so they don't come on.
[02:51:12.359 --> 02:51:13.640]  And then Mark Dice does come on.
[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:16.022]  He's a one-man show, and he needs a lot more help.
[02:51:16.022 --> 02:51:17.122]  He's very talented.
[02:51:17.122 --> 02:51:21.526]  And I've tried to hire Mark Dice, but he's kind of, you know, likes where he is in San Diego.
[02:51:21.526 --> 02:51:22.607]  So there's your answer.
[02:51:23.274 --> 02:51:29.459]  Okay, but it's about the mainstream media who is attacking our Infoboards.
[02:51:29.459 --> 02:51:34.502]  So I thought, when you're both together, fight to it.
[02:51:34.502 --> 02:51:35.643]  No, I totally agree.
[02:51:35.643 --> 02:51:38.025]  And we need all these other hosts, who I have all the niggas censored.
[02:51:38.025 --> 02:51:42.308]  When they took Mark Dice's YouTube channel away years ago, I rallied for him and helped him get it back.
[02:51:42.308 --> 02:51:43.289]  And Mark's been helping us.
[02:51:43.289 --> 02:51:45.431]  But just, yes, if they can get me, they can get everybody.
[02:51:45.431 --> 02:51:46.732]  God bless you, Michael.
[02:51:46.732 --> 02:51:48.173]  Okay, Duke in Tennessee.
[02:51:48.173 --> 02:51:49.454]  Duke, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:51:49.454 --> 02:51:49.754]  Go ahead.
[02:51:51.559 --> 02:52:04.586]  This is Duke contacting GI Joe headquarters to report that Cobra has in fact taken over the broadcast energy transmitter and has shut down Alex Jones and InfoWars.com.
[02:52:04.586 --> 02:52:12.670]  I do have photographic evidence dated August 7, 2018 verifying that Apple and their software
[02:52:13.795 --> 02:52:17.619]  Would not load Alex Jones live webcast feed.
[02:52:17.619 --> 02:52:23.466]  The media could not be loaded either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.
[02:52:23.466 --> 02:52:31.415]  Wait a minute, so what I've been told by IT is even though InfoWars is down, our streams are still going out, you're telling me you want an Apple platform and now they're not even loading the show?
[02:52:32.594 --> 02:52:36.537]  That was last Monday I had this happen to me.
[02:52:36.537 --> 02:52:39.820]  So this was going on since at least last Monday.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:43.303]  Today I went... Oh, I mean, I'm under total cyber attack.
[02:52:43.303 --> 02:52:46.905]  I'm getting reports from IT that China's not even hiding it.
[02:52:46.905 --> 02:52:54.571]  We have China out of Beijing and Peking hitting us with DOS attacks, but this isn't a DOS takedown, a D-DOS takedown.
[02:52:54.571 --> 02:52:56.213]  They're hitting us in the servers themselves.
[02:52:57.250 --> 02:53:00.133]  Well, the store may also be compromised.
[02:53:00.133 --> 02:53:10.542]  I just placed an order today because one of the only things I knew to do was to fight even harder was to contribute to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:10.542 --> 02:53:21.933]  I pledged an auto shipment every 30 days in the amount of $101 in honor of the 101st Airborne Division that I served with in combat twice in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:53:22.711 --> 02:53:26.473]  And I wanted to let every veteran know out there, now is the time.
[02:53:26.473 --> 02:53:27.573]  We need to stand up.
[02:53:27.573 --> 02:53:28.994]  We need to speak out.
[02:53:28.994 --> 02:53:31.095]  We need to get the word out.
[02:53:31.095 --> 02:53:35.317]  Alex Jones, InfoWars, the first domino in this war.
[02:53:35.317 --> 02:53:37.218]  The fire is burning.
[02:53:37.218 --> 02:53:40.079]  And I've got a message for the globalists.
[02:53:40.079 --> 02:53:41.100]  We'll never give up.
[02:53:41.513 --> 02:53:43.454]  We'll stay till the fight's won.
[02:53:43.454 --> 02:53:43.854]  G.I.
[02:53:43.854 --> 02:53:47.457]  Joe is there because Alex Jones is the real American hero.
[02:53:47.457 --> 02:53:50.999]  The Cobra believes you will be defeated!
[02:53:50.999 --> 02:53:55.822]  China and Kim Cook and Zuckerberg will defeat you!
[02:53:55.822 --> 02:53:56.802]  God bless.
[02:53:56.802 --> 02:53:57.603]  Having some fun there.
[02:53:58.928 --> 02:54:05.210]  Seriously, the store is all secured and super high quality and has all the certificates and things.
[02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:09.732]  It's their kind of take the payment processors where the companies won't then process your order.
[02:54:09.732 --> 02:54:11.192]  So get your orders in while you can.
[02:54:11.192 --> 02:54:16.994]  I mean, they did this to the NRA a year ago and then six months ago and NRA had to sue and file injunctions.
[02:54:16.994 --> 02:54:21.996]  For a couple days, you know, NRA could not take your orders for a t-shirt or a membership.
[02:54:21.996 --> 02:54:22.416]  Remember that?
[02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:25.634]  And they were doing it to like Cabela's and stuff.
[02:54:25.634 --> 02:54:28.038]  So, I mean, they're moving against everybody, folks.
[02:54:28.038 --> 02:54:32.547]  This is them telling you, you can't commerce, you can't talk to who you want.
[02:54:32.547 --> 02:54:32.767]  Shub.
[02:54:34.585 --> 02:54:36.547]  I'll tell you, bottom line, I just want to win this war.
[02:54:36.547 --> 02:54:45.834]  And I want to see big dollar signs in Fort Worth store because, you know, we've been kind of in the red the last six months with all the censorship and stuff, but I'd save money to pay for things.
[02:54:45.834 --> 02:54:48.416]  So, but now it's like the lawsuits and all of it.
[02:54:48.416 --> 02:54:49.937]  We need to make a lot of money now.
[02:54:49.937 --> 02:54:56.182]  We need to bring it in to fund things so I can just fire hose the enemy and get injunctions against them and get top lawyers.
[02:54:56.182 --> 02:54:58.984]  We're getting it all set up and we'll have some big W's.
[02:54:58.984 --> 02:55:00.486]  That's why they're doing all this de-platforming now.
[02:55:00.486 --> 02:55:01.687]  I've been beating their fake lawsuits.
[02:55:02.685 --> 02:55:10.352]  And I don't want to get into the details of that, but they haven't filed any new ones in months and months, because I sue the people that sue me.
[02:55:10.352 --> 02:55:14.235]  Except for Sandy Hook, I waived that, where you counter-sue, and then he lied and said I did sue.
[02:55:14.235 --> 02:55:18.579]  So, it's total deception, the media thinks they'll defeat you, they're not going to defeat you.
[02:55:18.579 --> 02:55:23.062]  Okay, Mark, Aaron, Fernando, got a whole bunch of callers here.
[02:55:23.062 --> 02:55:25.725]  Stefan.
[02:55:25.725 --> 02:55:27.186]  How do you beat censorship, they're asking?
[02:55:27.186 --> 02:55:29.408]  You just spread the word by word of mouth, nothing can stop you.
[02:55:31.561 --> 02:55:32.562]  Alex, it is so good to be with you.
[02:55:32.562 --> 02:55:37.605]  The last time I spoke to you was the day of the State of the Union when I said that Trump should declassify the Nunes Memo and go out there and read it.
[02:55:55.487 --> 02:56:05.513]  Um, you know, last season of Homeland, they really tried to drive the point home of the character that's supposed to be like you, being a nut, and really who's a coward, and it was fake news.
[02:56:05.513 --> 02:56:08.334]  So they've been trying to set this up for everybody.
[02:56:08.334 --> 02:56:09.035]  Oh, exactly!
[02:56:09.035 --> 02:56:13.757]  They've had like 10 TV shows where they admit it's supposedly me and I'm a bad guy.
[02:56:13.757 --> 02:56:16.278]  Exactly!
[02:56:16.278 --> 02:56:20.881]  What we really need to do for you, Alex, is your listeners and supporters and InfoWarriors
[02:56:21.411 --> 02:56:25.374]  Is we need to start a hashtag, something like, who is Alex Jones?
[02:56:25.374 --> 02:56:31.860]  Where we can counter the narrative of the straw man and go out there and support you and show who you really are.
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:33.020]  I agree because it's bigger than me.
[02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:34.782]  I mean, I'm already signed on to this, whatever.
[02:56:34.782 --> 02:56:37.984]  I don't care what they say or do about me, but it's reflected on everybody now.
[02:56:37.984 --> 02:56:39.866]  If people could say, Alex predicted this and was right.
[02:56:39.866 --> 02:56:41.087]  He was predicted that and was right.
[02:56:41.087 --> 02:56:43.249]  And just say, here's the real Alex Jones.
[02:56:43.249 --> 02:56:45.490]  Maybe a hashtag, real Alex Jones.
[02:56:45.490 --> 02:56:50.895]  And then explain to everybody that, I mean, yeah, that's why they're so scared is we've got their game plan.
[02:56:52.423 --> 02:56:56.066]  Because they're going to try something and they're going to try to blame it on you, just like you said.
[02:56:56.066 --> 02:56:58.868]  So we need to get out in front of this as your listeners.
[02:56:58.868 --> 02:56:59.888]  You know, we support you.
[02:56:59.888 --> 02:57:00.649]  I'm praying for you.
[02:57:00.649 --> 02:57:02.570]  Listen, I support you.
[02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:03.511]  John, I'm not saying this.
[02:57:03.511 --> 02:57:06.053]  You are the info war brother.
[02:57:06.053 --> 02:57:07.073]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[02:57:07.073 --> 02:57:07.914]  We're in this together.
[02:57:08.662 --> 02:57:11.963]  Um, you know, I just got a new shipment of, you know, your deodorant.
[02:57:11.963 --> 02:57:13.503]  My wife won't use anything else.
[02:57:13.503 --> 02:57:16.583]  Floralite, you know, uh, deep wells.
[02:57:16.583 --> 02:57:20.904]  I got t-shirts, everything, because I really, you know, want to be a part of this fight.
[02:57:20.904 --> 02:57:21.924]  And I love you, man.
[02:57:21.924 --> 02:57:22.464]  I love you.
[02:57:22.464 --> 02:57:26.345]  Let me tell you, when I ask the listeners for support and I say, you're the info war, you are it.
[02:57:26.345 --> 02:57:27.325]  You don't understand.
[02:57:27.325 --> 02:57:28.866]  It's like, and I'm not just saying that.
[02:57:28.866 --> 02:57:30.486]  Without you, we're gone.
[02:57:30.486 --> 02:57:30.906]  We're gone.
[02:57:30.906 --> 02:57:32.146]  I don't even care about what happens to me now.
[02:57:32.146 --> 02:57:35.987]  I want to beat these globalists and Hillary and Soros, and we're going to do it.
[02:57:37.236 --> 02:57:39.517]  Even if I don't make it through this, we're going to make it through.
[02:57:39.517 --> 02:57:40.517]  Let's stay with us.
[02:57:40.517 --> 02:57:41.677]  We'll be back in the fourth hour.
[02:57:41.677 --> 02:57:42.678]  Paul Watson coming up.
[02:57:42.678 --> 02:57:45.178]  Spread the live links.
[02:57:45.178 --> 02:57:55.781]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.781 --> 02:57:57.842]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.842 --> 02:58:00.703]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.703 --> 02:58:02.203]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.203 --> 02:58:02.303]  It's
[02:58:02.483 --> 02:58:02.703]  I think?
[02:58:25.885 --> 02:58:37.620]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:40.924]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.924 --> 02:58:43.327]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[02:58:43.327 --> 02:58:44.509]  InfoWarsLive.com

[02:59:00.552 --> 02:59:05.333]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:59:48.744 --> 03:00:05.730]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:05.730 --> 03:00:12.273]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:17.648 --> 03:00:30.412]  I hate censorship.
[03:00:30.412 --> 03:00:32.553]  I love truth.
[03:00:32.553 --> 03:00:34.654]  We're able to divert to a server for now.
[03:00:35.937 --> 03:00:43.544]  That's a splash page that diverts folks to newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com has been attacked.
[03:00:43.544 --> 03:00:44.585]  People don't want to get into this.
[03:00:44.585 --> 03:00:48.588]  We have denial of service attacks, DDoS attacks, that's been going on for weeks.
[03:00:48.588 --> 03:00:56.015]  But this is people inside origin servers, we believe, that have flipped it off.
[03:00:56.015 --> 03:01:00.499]  So this is the rebellion level and a test case ahead of the midterms, I believe.
[03:01:01.638 --> 03:01:05.666]  Just like YouTube four or five months ago took us down and said, oh, there was a rebellion.
[03:01:05.666 --> 03:01:06.367]  They were wrong.
[03:01:06.367 --> 03:01:07.208]  They were untrained.
[03:01:07.208 --> 03:01:07.810]  They took you down.
[03:01:07.810 --> 03:01:12.759]  It wasn't true what you said, because we can put up the real video, what I said versus what they said.
[03:01:12.759 --> 03:01:14.041]  But they finally made the decision.
[03:01:15.259 --> 03:01:20.821]  Eight days ago, nine days ago, with the head of Apple and others to take us down, and then like dominoes it happened.
[03:01:20.821 --> 03:01:22.962]  Paul, gut level, what do you think's going on?
[03:01:22.962 --> 03:01:26.103]  Because we're important, but not that important.
[03:01:26.103 --> 03:01:27.144]  We're a test case.
[03:01:27.144 --> 03:01:31.005]  This is seeing if Congress and the President notice, oh, they're worried about Amorosa.
[03:01:31.005 --> 03:01:33.286]  This is never before happened.
[03:01:33.286 --> 03:01:44.671]  Deplatforming off 25 platforms, going after our credit card processors, going after our email systems, going after our servers that aren't even servers for web, servers for inventory.
[03:01:45.191 --> 03:01:48.053]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[03:01:48.053 --> 03:01:50.595]  Well, it's nothing more than a cyber attack, Alex, isn't it?
[03:01:50.595 --> 03:01:53.377]  It's full-on cyber warfare.
[03:01:53.377 --> 03:02:03.405]  And of course, we have to trace it back to the origins, which was a CNN campaign in association with BuzzFeed, I might add, to lobby these big tech firms to censor info wars.
[03:02:03.405 --> 03:02:05.026]  Then it snowballed from there.
[03:02:05.026 --> 03:02:06.948]  Now it's literally cyber attacking our website.
[03:02:07.284 --> 03:02:14.706]  You know they all said when this began over a week ago, oh Alex Jones isn't being censored, you know, private companies can do what they like.
[03:02:14.706 --> 03:02:21.509]  Alex Jones still has his own website and in fact even Joe Rogan, God bless him, but even Joe Rogan said that.
[03:02:21.509 --> 03:02:25.810]  Well now we don't even have our own website because of what is obviously a cyber attack.
[03:02:25.810 --> 03:02:27.350]  We didn't have email or comments!
[03:02:27.350 --> 03:02:28.531]  They're taking everything!
[03:02:30.222 --> 03:02:33.883]  Yeah, so it's not just private companies making decisions.
[03:02:33.883 --> 03:02:40.064]  This is for political persecution, cyber warfare, and the people behind it are going to be exposed.
[03:02:40.064 --> 03:02:44.005]  There's also this whole narrative that we hear from CNN every single day.
[03:02:44.005 --> 03:02:45.485]  There's a war on the press!
[03:02:45.485 --> 03:02:48.206]  Oh my God, there's a war on the press being led by Donald Trump.
[03:02:48.206 --> 03:02:49.726]  There's no war on the press.
[03:02:49.726 --> 03:02:50.926]  There's no war on the court.
[03:02:50.926 --> 03:02:53.847]  The universities and press are waging war on the First Amendment.
[03:02:54.645 --> 03:02:55.105]  Exactly.
[03:02:55.105 --> 03:02:58.168]  That's the real war on independent journalists.
[03:02:58.168 --> 03:03:00.890]  Because mainstream journalists don't do journalism anymore.
[03:03:00.890 --> 03:03:05.633]  They just lobby big corporations to shut down their competition and call it journalism.
[03:03:05.633 --> 03:03:07.875]  The war is on independent journalists.
[03:03:07.875 --> 03:03:12.098]  People like Laura Loomer, who was shut down the other day for doing independent journalism.
[03:03:12.658 --> 03:03:15.500]  O'Keefe, everyone else who actually get original stories.
[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:16.781]  The war is on them.
[03:03:16.781 --> 03:03:26.447]  The war is on non-corporate news outlets that don't take giant fat checks from George Soros or get paid for advertising by dictatorships in the Middle East like CNN does.
[03:03:27.270 --> 03:03:35.471]  The war is on the people who are being censored and banned every single day by these legacy media companies which were dying and losing their audience.
[03:03:35.471 --> 03:03:43.753]  So they concerted, they colluded, they conspired with big tech, with giant corporations in Silicon Valley to shut down their competition.
[03:03:43.753 --> 03:03:45.173]  Well let me ask you this.
[03:03:45.173 --> 03:03:48.834]  This is next level though.
[03:03:48.834 --> 03:03:52.014]  Doing denial of service but now people inside shutting this off somewhere.
[03:03:52.014 --> 03:03:53.715]  Because we're looking, this is like flipped off.
[03:03:53.715 --> 03:03:55.175]  This is like, it's just turned off.
[03:03:57.593 --> 03:04:00.155]  I think it's a precursor to what they're going to do to Trump.
[03:04:00.155 --> 03:04:02.658]  I think we're going to see industrial sabotage nationwide, Paul.
[03:04:04.215 --> 03:04:05.176]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:04:05.176 --> 03:04:05.856]  It's sabotage.
[03:04:05.856 --> 03:04:11.800]  And this is why the administration, people around the administration, need to speak out on this immediately.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:16.503]  I mean, there was one Trump tweet about Twitter shadow banning a couple of weeks ago.
[03:04:16.503 --> 03:04:18.324]  That actually had somewhat of an effect.
[03:04:18.324 --> 03:04:25.829]  Twitter's now come out, whether you believe them or not, at least we're still on Twitter, and said they're launching a charm offensive with conservatives to talk to them.
[03:04:25.829 --> 03:04:27.990]  So, you know, it had some impact there.
[03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:30.732]  Let's see what they're going to do next, because they need to do something.
[03:04:31.195 --> 03:04:34.617]  My God, this is so epic and so historical.
[03:04:34.617 --> 03:04:37.618]  It means we're doing our job, but I just can't believe they're trying.
[03:04:37.618 --> 03:04:44.061]  I mean, now InfoWars.com is down, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are still up.
[03:04:44.061 --> 03:04:45.562]  Europe Wars was down earlier.
[03:04:45.562 --> 03:04:46.842]  It's on a different server.
[03:04:46.842 --> 03:04:47.983]  Our sites don't go down, folks.
[03:04:47.983 --> 03:04:49.203]  We have the big fancy stuff.
[03:04:49.203 --> 03:04:51.124]  I mean, they are hitting us hard.
[03:04:51.124 --> 03:04:52.265]  Please, please spread the word.
[03:04:54.201 --> 03:04:58.324]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:04:58.324 --> 03:05:05.388]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:05:05.388 --> 03:05:10.211]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:05:10.211 --> 03:05:17.095]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[03:05:17.535 --> 03:05:23.537]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:05:23.537 --> 03:05:32.681]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:05:33.121 --> 03:05:40.584]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:05:40.584 --> 03:05:53.349]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today!
[03:06:05.151 --> 03:06:10.805]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:06:10.805 --> 03:06:13.191]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.473 --> 03:06:30.635]  Paul Watson is hosting this hour.
[03:06:30.635 --> 03:06:34.879]  He's going to take over as a special guest and take a few calls in the segment before I leave you.
[03:06:34.879 --> 03:06:38.603]  The war room is coming up in about 50 minutes.
[03:06:38.603 --> 03:06:42.466]  Paul, we were talking during the break about how desperate the deep state and the globalists are.
[03:06:42.466 --> 03:06:44.048]  This is a very bold move.
[03:06:45.034 --> 03:06:52.236]  To de-platform us, a bunch of other libertarians, conservatives, and then to internally take down our sites.
[03:06:52.236 --> 03:06:59.378]  And I know, I got a bunch of inside baseball, I'm not going to name companies yet, because I've had the companies admit, no, this is not an official decision and stop.
[03:06:59.378 --> 03:07:03.180]  Where it's not just de-platforming, it's saying software we pay for, we can't use.
[03:07:03.180 --> 03:07:07.801]  This is literally trying to put us into an electronic gulag that Drudge Report warned about.
[03:07:07.801 --> 03:07:10.862]  There's now a story up on newswars.com.
[03:07:10.862 --> 03:07:14.063]  Infowars.com site goes down amid big tech censorship.
[03:07:15.208 --> 03:07:17.511]  And so we got a splash page up on another server.
[03:07:17.511 --> 03:07:20.494]  I'm told it's having problems.
[03:07:20.494 --> 03:07:24.578]  This is like something out of a movie or you read about as a kid in a science fiction book.
[03:07:24.578 --> 03:07:26.060]  What do you think's going on, Watson?
[03:07:27.796 --> 03:07:35.601]  Well obviously you've got mob outrage witch hunts who have been called to the cause by basically big tech.
[03:07:35.601 --> 03:07:46.788]  You remember Zuckerberg said, oh first we need to establish whether this is just brigading, whether this is mobs of people politically demanding we take down Infowars for partisanship reasons.
[03:07:46.788 --> 03:07:50.151]  It obviously was from the very start but he said, oh no it's not that.
[03:07:50.151 --> 03:07:51.031]  Now this is that.
[03:07:51.031 --> 03:07:56.435]  This is witch hunt brigades radicalised by mainstream media propaganda.
[03:07:56.955 --> 03:07:59.096]  And now they're trying to take down the website.
[03:07:59.096 --> 03:08:07.938]  You know, they've had fundraisers for people like Tommy Robinson in the past, and the banks get pressured not to even open account so you can fundraise.
[03:08:07.938 --> 03:08:13.159]  So they literally target people to make them not allowed to have bank accounts.
[03:08:13.159 --> 03:08:16.980]  They delisted you from LinkedIn, which is a pure un-persona.
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:19.101]  You don't even upload any content to LinkedIn.
[03:08:19.101 --> 03:08:20.161]  It's impossible to do so.
[03:08:20.661 --> 03:08:22.062]  But this is all about power.
[03:08:22.062 --> 03:08:23.723]  This is all about sabotage.
[03:08:23.723 --> 03:08:26.245]  I mean, what don't they want people to see, Alex?
[03:08:26.245 --> 03:08:30.168]  What's happening in Sweden last night, which got banned on Facebook, by the way?
[03:08:30.168 --> 03:08:35.612]  Videos of these migrant mobs, these youth gangs, torching vehicles in numerous different cities.
[03:08:35.612 --> 03:08:35.912]  Okay?
[03:08:35.912 --> 03:08:44.478]  They don't want people to see that because then people will vote for the parties, the anti-globalist parties, that will see to that and, you know, offer actual solutions.
[03:08:45.487 --> 03:08:46.708]  It's not working.
[03:08:46.708 --> 03:08:50.512]  The Sweden Democrats and the elections next month are five points ahead.
[03:08:50.512 --> 03:08:52.974]  They're probably going to win if there's no election meddling.
[03:08:52.974 --> 03:08:56.417]  So whatever they do, they can't keep a lid on this stuff.
[03:08:56.417 --> 03:09:00.240]  And by censoring us and attacking us, it only draws more attention to it.
[03:09:00.240 --> 03:09:02.082]  But they are completely without morals.
[03:09:02.082 --> 03:09:05.685]  They moral grandstand all day and say, oh, we're just enforcing terms of service.
[03:09:06.005 --> 03:09:13.751]  There was a left-wing Latin American news website, which was basically Venezuelan socialist propaganda.
[03:09:13.751 --> 03:09:17.454]  They took that down on Facebook just last night.
[03:09:17.454 --> 03:09:19.836]  So, you know, they all cheered when they took down InfoWars.
[03:09:19.836 --> 03:09:24.119]  Are you going to celebrate and cheer when these left-wing websites start getting taken down?
[03:09:24.119 --> 03:09:26.982]  And the answer, from what I've seen, is yes, they will.
[03:09:26.982 --> 03:09:28.603]  Because they're complete hypocrites.
[03:09:28.603 --> 03:09:33.867]  Well, what it is is people groveling to the deep state big mega titan companies.
[03:09:33.867 --> 03:09:34.247]  Power.
[03:09:35.248 --> 03:09:37.251]  A bunch of powerless people seeking after power.
[03:09:37.251 --> 03:09:43.139]  But as you said, a truck attack running over more people at Parliament.
[03:09:43.139 --> 03:09:46.984]  They find a Muslim training camp and people call in saying there's a dead kid there.
[03:09:46.984 --> 03:09:47.825]  There is a dead kid.
[03:09:47.825 --> 03:09:49.608]  They go, but it's racist.
[03:09:49.608 --> 03:09:50.349]  So they let him go.
[03:09:50.349 --> 03:09:51.450]  There's a dead kid there.
[03:09:52.071 --> 03:09:53.292]  And, you know, all this is gone.
[03:09:53.292 --> 03:09:55.995]  They say, well, it's racist, your Muslims will let you go.
[03:09:55.995 --> 03:10:04.143]  CNN won't even say it's Islamic attacks happening in Sweden, even though, as you said, they're running around screaming Allah Akbar, burning now thousands of cars.
[03:10:04.143 --> 03:10:06.325]  And Sweden's answer is bring in more Muslims.
[03:10:06.325 --> 03:10:09.848]  Where does all this end, Paul?
[03:10:09.848 --> 03:10:14.593]  Well, it ends in the instability, the destabilization of society.
[03:10:14.593 --> 03:10:16.575]  If you try and drive these
[03:10:17.059 --> 03:10:20.561]  You know, fringe voices, which are not even fringe at this point, underground.
[03:10:20.561 --> 03:10:22.062]  You only make the situation worse.
[03:10:22.062 --> 03:10:23.864]  You only make people more resentful.
[03:10:23.864 --> 03:10:38.554]  This attack in London today, the first narrative they came out with was that this was Boris Johnson's fault because he had written an article saying, by the way, I don't think the burqa should be banned, but these people wearing it don't fit in with our culture.
[03:10:38.554 --> 03:10:40.215]  Basically, they look like letterboxes.
[03:10:40.655 --> 03:10:45.759]  Now they're tweeting today that it's his fault, because he whipped up hatred and division.
[03:10:45.759 --> 03:10:47.620]  Remember, this is why we got banned, apparently.
[03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:49.542]  He whipped up hatred and division.
[03:10:49.542 --> 03:10:58.889]  So they're literally siding with the ideology that justified the Charlie Hebdo attack by saying, oh, these Muslims were offended, so they have the right to violate the law.
[03:10:58.889 --> 03:10:59.829]  And it gets worse.
[03:10:59.829 --> 03:11:02.652]  Some tourists took a selfie of the police cars and stuff.
[03:11:02.652 --> 03:11:06.855]  That was the outrage that they did that, not another Islamist just running over people.
[03:11:07.415 --> 03:11:12.241]  I mean, this is, they're bending over backwards, but the Islamicists are getting more and more violent.
[03:11:12.241 --> 03:11:17.168]  Why do you think they burned down so much of Sweden last night?
[03:11:17.168 --> 03:11:19.731]  Well, Sweden's had these problems for years and years.
[03:11:19.731 --> 03:11:24.257]  I mean, the mail companies, some of them have refused to even deliver to certain areas now.
[03:11:24.873 --> 03:11:28.039]  So, I mean, it helps the Sweden Democrats, let's be honest.
[03:11:28.039 --> 03:11:29.541]  They'll probably start saying that they did it.
[03:11:29.541 --> 03:11:32.526]  I mean, they've tried... Mr. McClure, that's the pro-nationalist group, you know, obviously.
[03:11:32.526 --> 03:11:36.173]  But why... Why do the Islamists just not get jobs?
[03:11:36.173 --> 03:11:37.314]  Why do they not integrate?
[03:11:37.314 --> 03:11:38.517]  Why are they just so hateful?
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:45.141]  Well, in Sweden, I think it's the majority of people in Sweden on welfare are migrants.
[03:11:45.141 --> 03:11:52.183]  Most of those are Muslim migrants, but it's because they live in these closed communities and they're on welfare and they don't feel the need to learn English.
[03:11:52.183 --> 03:12:02.505]  I mean, they went round Bradford, which is a northern UK city, a couple of weeks ago with Sky News and they were asking Muslims wearing full burqas, what does it mean to you to be British?
[03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:03.881]  I don't understand English.
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:18.981]  Thank you very much.
[03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:40.901]  And we will defeat all this.
[03:12:40.901 --> 03:12:44.624]  I'm going to go on at the end no matter what happens, but I tell you, we need a lot of capital right now.
[03:12:44.624 --> 03:12:46.926]  Get a t-shirt, get some books, get some videos.
[03:12:46.926 --> 03:12:48.448]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:12:50.850 --> 03:12:52.151]  It's amazing.

[03:12:53.892 --> 03:12:57.796]  Get Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Alpha Power, Brain Force Plus.

[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:06.782]  We've got Aaron asking, what's the mechanics of the attack?
[03:13:06.782 --> 03:13:08.222]  Insiders shut us off.
[03:13:08.222 --> 03:13:10.784]  Fernando asks, the severity of censorship.
[03:13:10.784 --> 03:13:13.745]  Stefan in Pennsylvania, how the plan of combating censorship?
[03:13:13.745 --> 03:13:14.885]  I mean, how do we do it?
[03:13:14.885 --> 03:13:16.526]  Get Congress acting.
[03:13:16.526 --> 03:13:18.767]  A bigger plan besides censorship.
[03:13:18.767 --> 03:13:20.608]  Let's talk to Kevin in Virginia.
[03:13:20.608 --> 03:13:23.269]  Kevin, what's the bigger plan beyond censorship?
[03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:24.190]  You're on with Paul Watson.
[03:13:24.190 --> 03:13:24.450]  Go ahead.
[03:13:25.492 --> 03:13:31.256]  Well, I think this bigger plan of censorship ahead of the midterms has nothing to do with the midterms.
[03:13:31.256 --> 03:13:38.982]  I think it has to do with shutting down the opposition and the dissent of this event of whatever's about to happen.
[03:13:38.982 --> 03:13:39.782]  No, I agree.
[03:13:39.782 --> 03:13:50.390]  I think the big terror attack or false flag they're getting ready to stage, that they're pumping, that'll be against the media or the tech companies, they don't want us on air when they stage it to create their big sympathy thing.
[03:13:50.390 --> 03:13:50.670]  Go ahead.
[03:13:51.809 --> 03:13:53.289]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:53.289 --> 03:13:56.710]  You know, remember this, remember this.
[03:13:56.710 --> 03:14:01.472]  The people that did 9-11, these people don't have empathy.
[03:14:01.472 --> 03:14:04.533]  By the way, that's Brennan and all these guys were involved in 9-11.
[03:14:04.533 --> 03:14:06.773]  Mueller, all of them.
[03:14:06.773 --> 03:14:07.993]  Yeah, they don't have empathy.
[03:14:07.993 --> 03:14:18.176]  They're going to do whatever it is they can do because they have no, what's the word, they have no remorse and they have no, they don't know what consequences are.
[03:14:18.176 --> 03:14:20.397]  That's why these people do the things that they do.
[03:14:20.956 --> 03:14:22.297]  How do you fight that?
[03:14:22.297 --> 03:14:26.081]  Well, you gotta take them out.
[03:14:26.081 --> 03:14:26.941]  It's time.
[03:14:26.941 --> 03:14:29.103]  It is time for us to rise up.
[03:14:29.103 --> 03:14:29.584]  It is time.
[03:14:30.868 --> 03:14:35.711]  Well, I'm not going to call for offensive violence, but you know when they stage stuff, it'll be some innocent cops or whatever.
[03:14:35.711 --> 03:14:45.418]  I think Soros, these globalists, all these people are clear and present dangers, and I just pray that America and the world wake up to them, and I appreciate your call, Kevin, but they're coming for us.
[03:14:45.418 --> 03:14:47.820]  Antifa's calling for violence, the media's covering it up.
[03:14:47.820 --> 03:14:50.462]  Paul, gut level, do you think a big event's coming?
[03:14:50.462 --> 03:14:51.603]  I think they're clearly hyping one.
[03:14:53.860 --> 03:14:56.642]  I don't know if the big event is the midterm elections, Alex.
[03:14:56.642 --> 03:14:59.003]  That's the biggest event that's coming in the next few months.
[03:14:59.003 --> 03:15:01.725]  But just harken back to the arrogance of it all.
[03:15:01.725 --> 03:15:09.070]  Zuckerberg, you know, unclear whether it's him or one of his executives in Facebook, saying, we will help you revitalize journalism.
[03:15:09.070 --> 03:15:13.813]  In a few years, the reverse looks like, are they holding hands with your dying business like in a hospice?
[03:15:13.813 --> 03:15:21.558]  The sheer arrogance of these people, given that Facebook loses 3 million users in the US alone every year under the age of 25, OK?
[03:15:22.779 --> 03:15:25.560]  They're going to end up like the next MySpace anyway.
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:28.720]  So the solution is to continue to erode their reputation.
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:34.901]  And that's why they're making their move against Real Choice, because they're dying, they're a fraud, and Zuckerberg thinks you're a bunch of dumb effers.
[03:15:34.901 --> 03:15:35.701]  Great job.
[03:15:35.701 --> 03:15:38.922]  PrisonPlanet.com, NewsWars.com for Now's Up.
[03:15:38.922 --> 03:15:39.962]  They're going to test us now.
[03:15:39.962 --> 03:15:41.262]  They think, hey, check out his website.
[03:15:41.262 --> 03:15:42.622]  Will they get upset about that?
[03:15:42.622 --> 03:15:43.783]  Are you upset?
[03:15:43.783 --> 03:15:45.783]  Because let me tell you, this is a real canary in the coal mine.
[03:15:45.783 --> 03:15:51.424]  InfoWars, now taken down by some mole inside a server operation, we believe.
[03:15:53.376 --> 03:15:54.597]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.597 --> 03:15:58.498]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.498 --> 03:16:00.039]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.039 --> 03:16:03.001]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.001 --> 03:16:08.563]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.563 --> 03:16:09.764]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.764 --> 03:16:12.705]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.705 --> 03:16:14.926]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.926 --> 03:16:19.368]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.368 --> 03:16:21.649]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:23.850]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:16:23.850 --> 03:16:26.251]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:16:26.251 --> 03:16:34.373]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[03:16:34.373 --> 03:16:36.314]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:16:36.314 --> 03:16:40.015]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[03:16:40.015 --> 03:16:44.737]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[03:16:44.737 --> 03:16:49.198]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:16:49.198 --> 03:16:49.838]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:16:52.879 --> 03:16:56.341]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:16:56.341 --> 03:16:59.163]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:16:59.163 --> 03:17:01.065]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:17:01.065 --> 03:17:06.128]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:17:06.128 --> 03:17:09.410]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:15.695]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:17:15.695 --> 03:17:20.438]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work,
[03:17:20.638 --> 03:17:25.223]  And have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:17:25.223 --> 03:17:26.645]  Why take another pill?
[03:17:26.645 --> 03:17:30.890]  Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:17:30.890 --> 03:17:35.295]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[03:17:35.635 --> 03:17:38.857]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:17:38.857 --> 03:17:44.080]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:47.062]  You can easily find Sunny Bay Heating Pads on Amazon.
[03:17:47.062 --> 03:17:50.644]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:54.107 --> 03:17:55.468]  We knew it was coming.
[03:17:55.468 --> 03:17:56.908]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:17:56.908 --> 03:18:10.173]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:18:10.173 --> 03:18:21.217]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:18:21.217 --> 03:18:22.118]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:18:22.878 --> 03:18:23.318]  I think so.
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:47.227]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:18:47.227 --> 03:18:52.358]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:18:52.358 --> 03:18:53.621]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:18:59.025 --> 03:19:01.386]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:01.386 --> 03:19:04.808]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[03:19:04.808 --> 03:19:11.832]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan-favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:19:11.832 --> 03:19:16.695]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse Reglanone product.
[03:19:16.695 --> 03:19:24.379]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process, with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[03:19:24.819 --> 03:19:31.264]  A powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.
[03:19:31.264 --> 03:19:41.751]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside, including green tea extract, yerba mate, leaf extract, and more, you can get that extra pick-me-up while supporting your mind and body in a healthy way.
[03:19:41.751 --> 03:19:46.354]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.
[03:19:46.354 --> 03:19:49.876]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:19:57.685 --> 03:20:10.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:12.189]  You found it!
[03:20:12.189 --> 03:20:14.250]  The tip of the spear!
[03:20:14.250 --> 03:20:17.251]  It is The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:17.251 --> 03:20:21.192]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[03:20:23.146 --> 03:20:23.666]  We're live.
[03:20:23.666 --> 03:20:31.473]  It is the fourth hour of the most fan-censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere at this point, in full force.
[03:20:31.473 --> 03:20:38.338]  And we're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour by Bill Ottman, who is the head on show over at Minds.com, which as far as I know...
[03:20:39.221 --> 03:20:44.003]  It's the biggest old tech social media website in existence right now.
[03:20:44.003 --> 03:20:47.024]  Never has it been needed more than right now.
[03:20:47.024 --> 03:20:53.227]  So we're going to talk to him about big tech censorship, about ways we can fight back at the bottom of the hour.
[03:20:53.227 --> 03:20:57.069]  The other thing I wanted to mention is Alex talked about getting the products to support us.
[03:20:57.069 --> 03:20:58.550]  We're literally being shut down right now.
[03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:59.470]  People said from the start
[03:21:00.294 --> 03:21:03.197]  Oh, Alex Jones still has his free speech.
[03:21:03.197 --> 03:21:04.478]  He isn't being censored.
[03:21:04.478 --> 03:21:05.639]  He isn't being banned.
[03:21:05.639 --> 03:21:07.701]  He still has his own website.
[03:21:07.701 --> 03:21:11.665]  Well, now he doesn't because that's being shut down as well.
[03:21:11.665 --> 03:21:19.272]  Isn't it amazing how they can shift their justifications from minute to minute based on the fact that they've got mob outrage brigades and
[03:21:19.945 --> 03:21:28.394]  Basically, electronic witch hunt mobs attacking us at every level imaginable, but still we linger on and we will survive and thrive with your support.
[03:21:28.394 --> 03:21:38.745]  So please, get the products, but if you want to do something really quick, right now, you can go to the website when it comes back, or I think you can go to Prison Planet as well, you'll see the same thing.
[03:21:39.509 --> 03:21:41.391]  And press the donate button.
[03:21:41.391 --> 03:21:42.833]  Again, it's going to be on Prison Plan.
[03:21:42.833 --> 03:21:45.836]  It's going to be back on InfoWars whenever we get the website back up.
[03:21:45.836 --> 03:21:53.483]  But at the bottom of the articles, there's a section where you can donate directly via PayPal or Visa and you can do that and that helps us out too.
[03:21:53.483 --> 03:21:57.487]  So please do that as soon as possible when the website comes back.
[03:21:57.487 --> 03:22:02.152]  For the time being, I'm going to go through this article on Breitbart which is headlined
[03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:06.691]  Why tech giants aren't the same as Christian bakeries?
[03:22:06.691 --> 03:22:11.972]  Because this is the other non-excuse they try out every single time we're censored.
[03:22:11.972 --> 03:22:24.334]  Oh, if conservatives can refuse service for a gay couple to refuse to bake a gay wedding cake, then why can't Silicon Valley corporate giants de-platform you and silence you forever?
[03:22:24.334 --> 03:22:28.234]  Because the two are really comparable, aren't they?
[03:22:28.234 --> 03:22:31.355]  Now the sub-headline here is Christian bakeries can't kill your business.
[03:22:31.355 --> 03:22:32.115]  This is the key point.
[03:22:32.904 --> 03:22:41.652]  Financial institutions are heavily regulated, in part because failures on their part affect the livelihoods of so many other people.
[03:22:41.652 --> 03:22:45.735]  Now we get on to the point of import wars being financially attacked.
[03:22:45.735 --> 03:22:47.557]  This is the level it's reached.
[03:22:47.557 --> 03:22:52.040]  If a bank messes up, people can lose years, even decades of investment.
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:57.966]  Social media companies and online payment processors have grown to similar level of influence.
[03:22:57.966 --> 03:22:59.627]  When Facebook tweaked its algorithms,
[03:23:00.165 --> 03:23:03.027]  And this happened back in February, largely without warning.
[03:23:03.027 --> 03:23:10.353]  It cut traffic to even non-political viral website called Little Things by 75%.
[03:23:10.353 --> 03:23:11.494]  Guess what happened?
[03:23:11.494 --> 03:23:13.556]  They had to shut their business down.
[03:23:13.556 --> 03:23:17.439]  They had to lay off a 100 strong workforce.
[03:23:17.439 --> 03:23:24.044]  So when you get deplatformed on social media, if you're reliant on it to that extent, which this website was, thankfully we weren't,
[03:23:24.687 --> 03:23:34.177]  I think there was a study which found about 10% of traffic that came to InfoWars came from social media, so we had it direct mostly, which is how we'd been able to survive.
[03:23:34.969 --> 03:23:44.593]  But in this case, this website, which was non-political, was put out of business along with 100 employees because Facebook tweaked its algorithm, okay?
[03:23:44.593 --> 03:23:51.075]  That is very different from one single Christian bakery refusing to bake a gay wedding cake.
[03:23:51.075 --> 03:23:54.857]  They can go to virtually any other bakery in the town, in the city,
[03:23:55.379 --> 03:23:57.060]  And receive that service.
[03:23:57.060 --> 03:24:07.643]  Once you've banned off Facebook, and YouTube, and Google, and Apple, there are no equivalent services that the free market can provide where you can go, because this is not a free market.
[03:24:07.643 --> 03:24:10.064]  These companies are acting as monopolies.
[03:24:10.064 --> 03:24:18.006]  They're private companies, private giant corporations, that control the public discourse, and they need to be broken up.
[03:24:18.006 --> 03:24:19.827]  It's like saying, oh, you know,
[03:24:20.709 --> 03:24:23.830]  This other argument, which is, why don't you just build your own social network?
[03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:25.490]  Because that's so easy, isn't it?
[03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:36.032]  It's like saying if you get cut off from your power supply, if the electricity company cuts off your power supply, people coming to you and saying, why don't you just start your own electricity company?
[03:24:36.032 --> 03:24:37.872]  No, that's not an argument.
[03:24:37.872 --> 03:24:40.112]  You get cut off from your phone service.
[03:24:40.112 --> 03:24:41.913]  Oh, just start your own phone company.
[03:24:41.913 --> 03:24:44.233]  Just start erecting your own phone masts.
[03:24:44.233 --> 03:24:45.733]  That's a solution, isn't it?
[03:24:45.733 --> 03:24:47.134]  No, it isn't a solution.
[03:24:47.134 --> 03:24:48.274]  It's harebrained.
[03:24:48.274 --> 03:24:49.274]  It's pie in the sky.
[03:24:49.844 --> 03:24:54.188]  So these big websites, which were not even political, were put out of business.
[03:24:54.188 --> 03:25:03.115]  Not even through being censored directly by Facebook, but through the algorithm being tweaked, and then that negatively affected their output.
[03:25:03.115 --> 03:25:06.157]  They went out of business, a hundred people got laid off.
[03:25:06.157 --> 03:25:08.199]  According to a report by Digidate,
[03:25:08.957 --> 03:25:17.240]  Entire business models built around the distribution of viral content on Facebook were rendered unviable via the platform's rapid shift.
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:21.081]  And you barely even heard about this when it happened back in February.
[03:25:21.081 --> 03:25:22.042]  Here's another point.
[03:25:22.042 --> 03:25:25.063]  Christian bakeries can't swing an election.
[03:25:25.063 --> 03:25:32.025]  President Trump has begun to take notice of big tech's progressive bias, recently calling out Twitter for shadow banning prominent Republicans,
[03:25:32.734 --> 03:25:41.063]  And the President's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who managed Trump's social media operations to great success, obviously, in 2016, is also keenly aware of the problem.
[03:25:41.977 --> 03:25:43.478]  As well they should be.
[03:25:43.478 --> 03:25:49.423]  Annoying though biased legacy media like CNN may be, biased social media is a far greater threat.
[03:25:49.423 --> 03:25:57.210]  Facebook claims to have boosted voter turnout by 3% in 2016 by making small tweaks to their algorithm.
[03:25:57.210 --> 03:25:58.111]  Listen to this.
[03:25:58.111 --> 03:26:09.320]  Studies have shown that if search engines like Google manipulated their results to favour political candidates, which we already know, they've manipulated their search results to downrank conservative websites,
[03:26:10.103 --> 03:26:16.115]  They can shift between 2 and 3 million votes in a national election.
[03:26:16.115 --> 03:26:18.440]  In fact, they almost certainly already did in 2016.
[03:26:20.767 --> 03:26:22.228]  In favour of Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:22.228 --> 03:26:24.890]  So how much more could they shift in 2020?
[03:26:24.890 --> 03:26:27.832]  This is why this is so huge.
[03:26:27.832 --> 03:26:30.634]  This is why Trump needs to at least tweet about it.
[03:26:30.634 --> 03:26:32.955]  This is why we need some kind of action in Congress.
[03:26:32.955 --> 03:26:34.036]  We need hearings.
[03:26:34.036 --> 03:26:38.839]  We need lawmakers to sit up and pay attention in the Republican Party.
[03:26:38.839 --> 03:26:41.120]  Otherwise they can forget about the midterms.
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:43.182]  They can forget about 2020.
[03:26:43.182 --> 03:26:44.062]  Okay?
[03:26:44.062 --> 03:26:46.344]  When are you going to realise how important this is?
[03:26:47.478 --> 03:26:48.538]  Continues.
[03:26:48.538 --> 03:26:52.680]  Modern elections are won and lost on social media, not legacy media.
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:53.880]  Brad Poscale knows this.
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:58.341]  He led the digital operations team that outclassed Hillary Clinton in 2016.
[03:26:58.341 --> 03:27:06.844]  The Democrats know this too, which is why they're working so hard to turn social media platforms into little more than conduits for the legacy media.
[03:27:06.844 --> 03:27:08.845]  Which is the point I've made before.
[03:27:08.845 --> 03:27:15.867]  You go back before the beginning of this year and you look at CNN, you look at MSNBC and these other mainstream network channels on YouTube.
[03:27:16.267 --> 03:27:24.102]  They were getting their butts handed to them on a regular basis in terms of subscribers and views by independent content creators.
[03:27:24.102 --> 03:27:24.663]  What happened?
[03:27:24.663 --> 03:27:26.426]  YouTube flipped a switch.
[03:27:26.426 --> 03:27:28.751]  They admittedly, and they announced this, they were proud of it,
[03:27:29.525 --> 03:27:37.552]  Deliberately rigged their own algorithm to put mainstream legacy corporate media content above independent media content.
[03:27:37.552 --> 03:27:38.533]  What happened?
[03:27:38.533 --> 03:27:41.935]  CNN subscribers started climbing up rapidly.
[03:27:41.935 --> 03:27:48.061]  Their viewers started climbing up rapidly on YouTube because YouTube, Google, gained the system.
[03:27:48.061 --> 03:27:49.562]  This is why this is so important.
[03:27:49.562 --> 03:27:52.104]  We're all slaves to the algorithm and until these
[03:27:52.679 --> 03:27:58.902]  Fusty Republicans who, you know, have these hearings with Zuckerberg and they don't even know how Facebook makes money.
[03:27:58.902 --> 03:28:01.864]  They don't even know about advertising online.
[03:28:01.864 --> 03:28:11.009]  These people need, it needs to be explained to them how important this can be, given that this can and has shifted millions of votes.
[03:28:11.009 --> 03:28:17.573]  They had an example case, and this was Robert Epstein, we've talked about him before, who did a study and found that
[03:28:18.351 --> 03:28:29.001]  Google could shift millions of votes by ranking search results that are positive towards one candidate over another above the one they want to downgrade, the one they want to downvote in the algorithm.
[03:28:29.001 --> 03:28:37.029]  They found that that could shift votes to change the result of the largest democratic election in the world in India.
[03:28:37.589 --> 03:28:41.232]  This is the power that these big tech giants wield.
[03:28:41.232 --> 03:28:44.034]  This is why they need to be broken up right now.
[03:28:44.034 --> 03:28:45.736]  We need action now.
[03:28:45.736 --> 03:28:47.858]  This is completely out of control.
[03:28:47.858 --> 03:28:51.520]  We'll be back with Minds.com's Bill Ossman on the next side.
[03:28:51.520 --> 03:28:52.441]  Stay with us.
[03:28:52.441 --> 03:28:53.182]  InfoWars.com.
[03:28:53.462 --> 03:28:55.444]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.444 --> 03:29:00.749]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.749 --> 03:29:02.330]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:10.698]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.698 --> 03:29:16.384]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.544 --> 03:29:18.365]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:18.365 --> 03:29:20.546]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.546 --> 03:29:25.047]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:25.047 --> 03:29:27.228]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.228 --> 03:29:35.111]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:29:35.211 --> 03:29:40.914]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:29:40.914 --> 03:29:41.294]  It's you!
[03:30:03.337 --> 03:30:05.518]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:30:05.518 --> 03:30:14.223]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.223 --> 03:30:18.826]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.826 --> 03:30:20.287]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.287 --> 03:30:23.809]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.489 --> 03:30:25.970]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[03:30:54.185 --> 03:30:56.527]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:30:56.527 --> 03:30:58.689]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:30:58.689 --> 03:31:02.612]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:31:02.612 --> 03:31:14.121]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:31:14.121 --> 03:31:23.189]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:31:23.709 --> 03:31:29.492]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:31:29.492 --> 03:31:34.935]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:31:34.935 --> 03:31:37.197]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:31:37.197 --> 03:31:39.218]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:31:40.209 --> 03:31:43.492]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:31:43.492 --> 03:31:45.514]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:31:45.514 --> 03:31:48.837]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:31:48.837 --> 03:31:51.380]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:31:51.380 --> 03:31:53.622]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:31:54.096 --> 03:31:58.061]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.061 --> 03:32:01.344]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.344 --> 03:32:07.611]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.611 --> 03:32:10.394]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.115 --> 03:32:14.940]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.940 --> 03:32:21.429]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:26.396]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.136 --> 03:32:31.058]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.058 --> 03:32:38.241]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.241 --> 03:32:43.403]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.403 --> 03:32:49.165]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.165 --> 03:32:53.127]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:57.243 --> 03:33:10.511]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.511 --> 03:33:20.917]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.917 --> 03:33:24.699]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:26.457 --> 03:33:45.575]  We're live in the fourth hour of the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere at this point, and I'm delighted to be joined right now by Bill Ottman, who is founder of Minds.com, an alternative social media network that doesn't censor, that doesn't shadow ban, and that aligns itself with the First Amendment.
[03:33:45.575 --> 03:33:47.256]  Bill, welcome.
[03:33:47.256 --> 03:33:47.917]  Thanks for having me, Paul.
[03:33:49.278 --> 03:33:51.561]  Now first off, obviously, I want to get your take on this.
[03:33:51.561 --> 03:33:56.767]  As Infowars.com itself is under cyber attack, they said, oh, Alex Jones isn't being censored.
[03:33:56.767 --> 03:33:58.048]  He still has his own website.
[03:33:58.048 --> 03:33:59.310]  Now he doesn't have his own website.
[03:33:59.310 --> 03:33:59.931]  OK.
[03:33:59.931 --> 03:34:04.996]  But obviously, we've been digitally executed by the social media giants over the past week.
[03:34:04.996 --> 03:34:06.959]  You know, Gavin McInnes banned by Twitter.
[03:34:07.299 --> 03:34:09.241]  Laura Loomer banned by Facebook.
[03:34:09.241 --> 03:34:20.193]  Even today a left-wing Latin American news network, Telecern, which is basically Venezuelan socialist propaganda, even they got banned by Facebook.
[03:34:20.193 --> 03:34:26.279]  Do you think there's anything in the timing about how all this seems to have intensified over the last 10 days or so?
[03:34:27.685 --> 03:34:29.667]  Well, I think it's the key point that you just said.
[03:34:29.667 --> 03:34:32.589]  It's affecting both the left and the right.
[03:34:32.589 --> 03:34:36.872]  And the world needs to understand that censorship affects everyone.
[03:34:36.872 --> 03:34:40.435]  And just because it's not you right now, it doesn't mean it's not going to be you later.
[03:34:40.435 --> 03:34:49.983]  That's why you see, you know, you mentioned Noam Chomsky, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, real internet freedom advocates across the spectrum understand that censorship is not the answer.
[03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:52.090]  Exactly.
[03:34:52.090 --> 03:35:12.564]  We had Noam Chomsky, the preeminent icon basically on the subject of free speech in the West for decades and decades, he's like 89 years old now or something, come out in an email on the weekend and defend InfoWars basically saying that this arbitrary notion of hate speech is just going to end up deep-sixing everyone's right to free speech
[03:35:12.944 --> 03:35:17.625]  You've got CNN right now, if they want to flash up a headline, it's on information liberation.
[03:35:17.625 --> 03:35:21.086]  CNN, Alex Jones' hate speech is a form of terrorism.
[03:35:21.086 --> 03:35:30.248]  They've actually now got a CNN opinion contributor saying that our hate speech, which was nebulous and never defined by any of these companies, is now terrorism.
[03:35:30.248 --> 03:35:32.348]  So now they're going even further.
[03:35:32.348 --> 03:35:37.109]  We've got this whole argument, which we hear again and again Bill, which I covered in the previous segment,
[03:35:37.509 --> 03:35:39.370]  You know, giant corporations.
[03:35:39.370 --> 03:35:41.090]  They're just private companies.
[03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:43.251]  They can enforce their own terms of service.
[03:35:43.251 --> 03:35:44.212]  They can do what they like.
[03:35:44.212 --> 03:35:45.212]  They're private companies.
[03:35:45.212 --> 03:35:48.493]  Well, my argument has always been, no, they're giant corporations.
[03:35:48.493 --> 03:35:51.554]  They're all centered in the same area of San Francisco.
[03:35:51.554 --> 03:35:53.395]  They act like monopolies.
[03:35:53.395 --> 03:35:57.217]  They're private companies, but they control the public discourse.
[03:35:57.217 --> 03:36:00.118]  Studies show they can shift millions of views.
[03:36:00.118 --> 03:36:03.299]  And as we've seen over the past 10 years, they're obviously abusing their power
[03:36:03.763 --> 03:36:03.903]  Yes.
[03:36:03.903 --> 03:36:04.184]  Well...
[03:36:17.788 --> 03:36:23.370]  Yeah, the thing is that it amplifies the problems that they're trying to silence.
[03:36:23.370 --> 03:36:33.254]  You would think that with all of the access to analytics and data that they have, they would understand that there are also peer-reviewed studies that show that censorship amplifies whatever it's trying to censor.
[03:36:33.254 --> 03:36:36.896]  This is why, you know, your site is probably growing rapidly right now.
[03:36:36.896 --> 03:36:42.618]  And so what we're calling for at Minds.com is for tech sites across the world to adopt
[03:36:43.337 --> 03:36:51.560]  A free speech policy, because then you avoid all of this subjective decision-making and inconsistency which we're seeing on major social networks.
[03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:55.901]  And it's just, it's a losing battle for them.
[03:36:55.901 --> 03:37:09.726]  So you advocate some kind of digital Bill of Rights, which would obviously have to have some kind of state backing, I mean, some kind of Trump administration backing to at least give it symbolic teeth, to outline exactly what free speech rights
[03:37:10.202 --> 03:37:10.682]  That's correct.
[03:37:29.167 --> 03:37:31.229]  Yeah, and it makes it easier for tech companies.
[03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:38.575]  I think that they're feeling so much social pressure to censor because of X, Y, and Z reason.
[03:37:38.575 --> 03:37:43.159]  And, you know, Twitter started off as the free, quote-unquote, the free speech wing of the free speech party.
[03:37:43.159 --> 03:37:48.924]  And you know that all of the executives are having an existential crisis, which is probably why InfoWars is still on Twitter.
[03:37:48.924 --> 03:37:54.049]  Because they know if they ban you guys from there, it's just, they're going to lose a huge audience.
[03:37:54.749 --> 03:38:00.793]  And what they're forgetting is that open discourse doesn't mean that you endorse what the people are saying.
[03:38:00.793 --> 03:38:04.996]  Just because you're willing to have a conversation to someone doesn't mean you necessarily agree on all the issues.
[03:38:04.996 --> 03:38:09.179]  So, you know, these digital town halls are supposed to be open forums.
[03:38:09.179 --> 03:38:15.563]  And, you know, regardless of that, this is why we're moving towards more of a decentralized architecture.
[03:38:15.563 --> 03:38:19.705]  We've just integrated a cryptocurrency for our payment system.
[03:38:19.705 --> 03:38:21.987]  So if you check out Minds.com slash token,
[03:38:22.802 --> 03:38:27.686]  You know, we're we don't want to be censored by Stripe or PayPal or any of these other platforms.
[03:38:27.686 --> 03:38:29.147]  Crypto can't get censored.
[03:38:29.147 --> 03:38:34.772]  Granted, you know, it's a new technology, but it's decentralized and it can't get taken down.
[03:38:34.772 --> 03:38:36.754]  So so we're moving more towards that direction.
[03:38:38.504 --> 03:38:45.189]  Now, you mentioned these brigades of mobs that pressure companies into banning people, into banning content.
[03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:46.350]  That's exactly what's happened.
[03:38:46.350 --> 03:38:56.057]  It was ironic, because in the comments that were reported by the New York Times, where they admit Zuckerberg made the decision to pull the plug on InfoWars, he personally made the decision.
[03:38:56.057 --> 03:39:01.861]  So you've literally got billionaires running giant corporations that get to decide what we can see and hear on the internet.
[03:39:01.861 --> 03:39:04.983]  And much of the left applauds and claps and celebrates it.
[03:39:04.983 --> 03:39:05.964]  But you also have him
[03:39:06.385 --> 03:39:16.767]  Apparently, reportedly expressing concern that this whole move to censor info wars could have started by a brigading operation, which we see routinely with groups like Sleeping Giant.
[03:39:16.767 --> 03:39:19.408]  They pressure advertisers to pull out of Breitbart.
[03:39:19.408 --> 03:39:23.869]  And he acknowledged that that was probably what was happening, but then he went ahead and did it anyway.
[03:39:23.869 --> 03:39:28.250]  Now that's happening even to the extent where our website is under cyber attack.
[03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:36.152]  Because of these witch hunt mob brigades, who by the way have basically ruined Twitter, and that's why that went down the plug hole.
[03:39:36.152 --> 03:39:41.714]  But going back to Minds.com, you know, how do you distinguish yourself from these other old tech networks?
[03:39:41.714 --> 03:39:43.534]  Because there's been a lot that's sprung up.
[03:39:43.534 --> 03:39:46.695]  You've had BitTube, for example, which is trying to rival YouTube.
[03:39:46.695 --> 03:39:50.056]  Obviously they don't have anywhere near the funding, the resources.
[03:39:50.056 --> 03:39:56.558]  How do you differentiate, how do you distinguish Minds from networks like Gab and others that have also sprung up at the same time?
[03:39:56.558 --> 03:39:57.698]  What makes Minds different?
[03:39:58.926 --> 03:40:07.728]  One of the key differentiators is that all of our software is fully free and open source, which means that anyone can inspect it, modify it, see what it's doing, make sure it's not spying on you.
[03:40:07.728 --> 03:40:12.129]  You can actually clone our entire site if you want to, make your own app.
[03:40:12.129 --> 03:40:15.169]  I think that BitChute is actually going to open source.
[03:40:15.169 --> 03:40:17.910]  I consider this essential.
[03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:23.771]  If there's no transparency, then I'm sorry, you're just following all the proprietary juggernauts.
[03:40:24.231 --> 03:40:28.233]  There has to be a new paradigm of transparency in the software.
[03:40:28.233 --> 03:40:32.555]  Additionally, what you were saying with advertising networks starting to censor, you know, it doesn't make sense.
[03:40:32.555 --> 03:40:36.236]  If you're selling computers, you want to sell computers.
[03:40:36.236 --> 03:40:41.498]  The beliefs of your viewers or whoever you're serving ads on, the viewers need to purchase things.
[03:40:41.498 --> 03:40:45.460]  So this is dangerous precedent in the advertising world.
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:48.781]  So we created actually our own ad network that's fully peer-to-peer.
[03:40:48.781 --> 03:40:49.842]  Paul, people can go to your
[03:40:50.602 --> 03:40:53.525]  Mine's channel and send you tokens directly.
[03:40:53.525 --> 03:40:58.409]  They can send you offers of tokens so that you'll advertise their content on your channel.
[03:40:58.409 --> 03:41:08.017]  We're actually trying to take ourselves out of the equation so that creators and users can directly interface with each other and send each other offers for exchange of distribution.
[03:41:09.542 --> 03:41:16.347]  Now, I think I've got about 80,000 followers right now on Mines, which all I use it for is basically to send out my own articles.
[03:41:16.347 --> 03:41:18.069]  I don't use it anywhere near as much as Twitter.
[03:41:18.069 --> 03:41:21.591]  Probably will be using it more in the future, given the way that things are going.
[03:41:21.591 --> 03:41:25.254]  But am I correct in saying that you can now host video on there as well?
[03:41:25.254 --> 03:41:26.015]  That's correct, right?
[03:41:26.846 --> 03:41:28.127]  Yeah, we host video.
[03:41:28.127 --> 03:41:30.948]  I mean, look, look at what's happening to all of the networks.
[03:41:30.948 --> 03:41:35.510]  They're sort of becoming the same thing, coalescing into the very similar app.
[03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:37.511]  Every site is becoming a social network.
[03:41:37.511 --> 03:41:39.111]  So, you know, we have groups.
[03:41:39.111 --> 03:41:40.652]  We have a whole blogging platform.
[03:41:40.652 --> 03:41:41.592]  We host videos.
[03:41:41.592 --> 03:41:43.133]  We have news feeds.
[03:41:43.133 --> 03:41:46.975]  We have mobile apps on Android and iOS, which you should definitely check out.
[03:41:46.975 --> 03:41:50.876]  And, you know, it's just it's a race and we're trying to keep up.
[03:41:50.876 --> 03:41:54.558]  And the fact that we're open source allows developers all over the world to help us
[03:41:55.118 --> 03:42:01.240]  By the way, just in 20 seconds, how many new users have you got over the past month since this big tech censorship purge has intensified?
[03:42:23.908 --> 03:42:31.872]  We've seen hundreds of thousands of new users over the last month, even from Vietnam, where there's censorship legislation going through.
[03:42:31.872 --> 03:42:34.473]  Well, people say, oh, just start your own social media network.
[03:42:34.473 --> 03:42:36.594]  It's very impossible, very hard to do so.
[03:42:36.594 --> 03:42:38.955]  Bill Oppmann has done it at Minds.com.
[03:42:38.955 --> 03:42:40.436]  Go there and sign up right now.
[03:42:40.436 --> 03:42:44.858]  We'll be back in the next segment to finish up with Bill and cover the rest of the news.
[03:42:44.858 --> 03:42:48.559]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, fourth hour, InfoWars.com.
[03:42:48.559 --> 03:42:51.601]  While it's still up on the internet, we'll be back.
[03:42:51.601 --> 03:42:52.081]  Now go away.
[03:42:53.186 --> 03:42:54.547]  We knew it was coming.
[03:42:54.547 --> 03:42:55.988]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:42:55.988 --> 03:43:08.858]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:43:09.238 --> 03:43:20.286]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:43:20.286 --> 03:43:29.173]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:43:29.833 --> 03:43:39.300]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:51.430]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:43:51.430 --> 03:43:52.711]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:43:53.371 --> 03:44:02.873]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[03:44:02.873 --> 03:44:07.553]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[03:44:07.553 --> 03:44:12.334]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[03:44:12.334 --> 03:44:15.395]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[03:44:15.395 --> 03:44:17.815]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[03:44:17.815 --> 03:44:21.356]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[03:44:21.356 --> 03:44:22.636]  Winter Sun is the result
[03:44:22.776 --> 03:44:23.196]  We're good to go.
[03:44:52.756 --> 03:44:52.841]  Yeah.
[03:44:55.208 --> 03:45:03.752]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.

[03:46:57.190 --> 03:46:59.833]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.100 --> 03:47:14.105]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.105 --> 03:47:17.927]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:17.927 --> 03:47:24.011]  We're back with BillOxmanFinds.com.
[03:47:24.011 --> 03:47:34.578]  We're going to go back to him here in a second, but CNN has literally published an article, and the headline on CNN is, and this is from August the 10th, so it's four days ago now.
[03:47:34.578 --> 03:47:35.779]  Let me find the headline here.
[03:47:36.308 --> 03:47:38.250]  from one of their contributors.
[03:47:38.250 --> 03:47:45.155]  Rafia Zakaria, it's an important step in recognizing hate speech as a form of terrorism, she says.
[03:47:45.155 --> 03:47:52.761]  Let me find the exact quote where she says, and I quote, Infowars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:47:52.761 --> 03:48:02.789]  CNN has literally published an article claiming that Infowars is complicit in domestic terrorism with no evidence whatsoever to back up that claim.
[03:48:02.789 --> 03:48:05.391]  They published an article, somehow it got by their lawyers,
[03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:10.697]  And that is up on CNN.com right now.
[03:48:10.697 --> 03:48:13.360]  We need to talk about Alex Jones as the main headline.
[03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:18.687]  They've got a series of contributors, of commentators, speaking to that issue.
[03:48:18.687 --> 03:48:21.131]  And one of them, Rafia Zakaria,
[03:48:21.724 --> 03:48:30.494]  Sadly, Domestic Terrorism or Jones's Dangerous Speech, in which he claims that he is in a holy war against Islam, is not prosecuted under that statute.
[03:48:30.494 --> 03:48:36.661]  She goes on to say, let me find the exact quote, Infowars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:48:36.661 --> 03:48:39.544]  That is on CNN right now.
[03:48:39.544 --> 03:48:43.008]  She says the new decision, she's talking about big tech banning Infowars,
[03:48:43.715 --> 03:49:02.102]  is a step forward in recognising that hate outlets such as Infowars, remember the left-wing Telly Sir was also called a hate outlet by Facebook, they were banned, hate outlets such as Infowars are complicit in domestic terror and a relief to Muslim Americans like myself who have been the target of online assaults and threats.
[03:49:02.102 --> 03:49:12.527]  Now the SPLC, back last year I think it was or the year before, called Majid Nawaz a Muslim reformist, called him an anti-Muslim extremist.
[03:49:12.527 --> 03:49:13.307]  They had to pay out
[03:49:14.063 --> 03:49:17.886]  $3 million in court for libeling him.
[03:49:17.886 --> 03:49:23.429]  Now, CNN has literally claimed that InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror via one of their contributors.
[03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:30.074]  That is up right now live on CNN's website, so I'll be interested to see the fallout from that as we go forward.
[03:49:30.074 --> 03:49:38.219]  But going back to Bill Ottman of Minds.com, a social network that doesn't ban people, that doesn't shadow ban people, that doesn't censor people,
[03:49:39.033 --> 03:49:48.455]  Bill, Facebook, they're losing nearly 3 million users under the age of 25 in the US alone every single year.
[03:49:48.455 --> 03:49:51.355]  We see Twitter, their growth has stalled.
[03:49:51.355 --> 03:49:58.817]  We see Zuckerberg or one of his executives in a private meeting reportedly saying they quote, they quote, don't care about publishers.
[03:49:58.817 --> 03:50:05.758]  And they warned that if publishers didn't work with them, quote, I'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice.
[03:50:06.398 --> 03:50:09.221]  Is Zuckerberg's arrogance going to come back to haunt him?
[03:50:09.221 --> 03:50:15.466]  How many more years before these platforms are in terminal decline, if they're not already?
[03:50:16.536 --> 03:50:17.457]  They are already.
[03:50:17.457 --> 03:50:20.520]  I mean, these algorithms have gotten so out of control.
[03:50:20.520 --> 03:50:24.163]  You used to be able to actually reach your followers or friends on Facebook.
[03:50:24.163 --> 03:50:29.528]  Now you're only reaching about 5% of your own followers organically.
[03:50:29.528 --> 03:50:33.512]  And because their algorithms are deciding to show you what they want you to see.
[03:50:33.512 --> 03:50:35.113]  It's not a pure chronological feed.
[03:50:35.113 --> 03:50:38.616]  So on mines, everything is 100% chronological and raw.
[03:50:38.616 --> 03:50:40.518]  We're never going to interfere with that.
[03:50:40.518 --> 03:50:42.180]  And additionally, you earn
[03:50:43.075 --> 03:50:46.336]  tokens for your contributions to the network every day.
[03:50:46.336 --> 03:50:53.538]  So whoever creates the most engaging content gets tokens and then you can use those tokens to boost your post for more views.
[03:50:53.538 --> 03:51:04.501]  So not only are we not filtering, we're giving people more of a voice because that's actually what the purpose of social media is supposed to be, is to share your voice.
[03:51:06.655 --> 03:51:09.699]  It's a concept that they seem to have forgotten about, isn't it?
[03:51:09.699 --> 03:51:11.561]  Now, I read your interview with the Daily Caller.
[03:51:11.561 --> 03:51:16.108]  You talked about a healthy society hinging on the free exchange of ideas.
[03:51:16.108 --> 03:51:22.076]  Tell us about Darrell Davis and how his story speaks to what's happening now with big tech censorship.
[03:51:23.126 --> 03:51:42.817]  Yeah, Daryl Davis is an incredible story of an African American man who befriended hundreds of members of the KKK and through open dialogue got them all to hand over their robes because they saw the humanity in each other and understood that obviously it doesn't make sense to be a part of the KKK and this is
[03:51:43.477 --> 03:51:51.650]  How communication and social evolution works is that through open discourse, the best ideas will rise to the top.
[03:51:51.650 --> 03:51:59.141]  Look, we're all getting things wrong sometimes, but through education and clear debate, the best ideas are going to win.
[03:52:00.879 --> 03:52:01.340]  Exactly.
[03:52:01.340 --> 03:52:07.064]  Again, as he said, Twitter started as the free speech wing of the Free Speech Party.
[03:52:07.064 --> 03:52:09.827]  Quite ironic now that Twitter is the last remaining holdout.
[03:52:09.827 --> 03:52:17.894]  I mean, we have heard whispers behind the scenes that Jack Dorsey, at least to some extent, does support free speech, that he has had meetings with people.
[03:52:17.894 --> 03:52:23.619]  We had the announcement yesterday, Twitter is reaching out to Conservatives on a charm offensive.
[03:52:24.419 --> 03:52:37.928]  To try and get them on board and to try and reassure their concern, whether anything comes of that, given that there are literally giant mobs of outraged, permanently offended idiots on there, campaigning every day to shut us down, remains to be seen.
[03:52:37.928 --> 03:52:45.933]  But here in the last couple of minutes, Bill, just tell us how easy it is to sign up for Minds.com and why people should do so right now.
[03:52:45.933 --> 03:52:48.675]  Yeah, just various ways to sign up, Blake.
[03:52:48.675 --> 03:52:49.655]  Other social networks.
[03:52:49.655 --> 03:52:52.297]  The key thing that I would have you take away is that
[03:52:52.995 --> 03:52:58.420]  Where we spend our time online is how the power structure of the Internet is distributed.
[03:52:58.420 --> 03:53:09.709]  So when you even just create an account on an open source, peer-to-peer alternative like mine, you are helping empower us and other alternatives to grow.
[03:53:09.709 --> 03:53:14.533]  Where we sit, the browsers that we use, you know, use the Brave browser, use Firefox,
[03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:18.451]  Don't use proprietary surveillance systems.
[03:53:18.451 --> 03:53:20.812]  It is possible to shift away.
[03:53:20.812 --> 03:53:28.134]  And, you know, we're sitting on these devices all day and that is building the metrics of all these different corporations.
[03:53:28.134 --> 03:53:32.576]  So, you know, finally, the alternatives are catching up in terms of the functionality.
[03:53:32.576 --> 03:53:35.357]  And I would just say at the minimum, supplement your experience.
[03:53:35.357 --> 03:53:38.558]  If you're not ready to fully jump ship.
[03:53:38.558 --> 03:53:39.718]  You know, just get started.
[03:53:41.548 --> 03:53:46.152]  Exactly, and I'll start doing that right now with this interview, because it ain't going up on YouTube.
[03:53:46.152 --> 03:53:46.953]  Forget about that.
[03:53:46.953 --> 03:53:52.578]  If you want to watch this interview, it will go up on Minds.com, and it will go up on Bitshoot, and we'll promote that.
[03:53:52.578 --> 03:53:56.882]  If we get access to our website back, it will obviously go up on Infowars.com as well.
[03:53:56.882 --> 03:53:58.363]  But we're going to leave it there for now.
[03:53:58.363 --> 03:54:00.245]  Bill Oppmann, Minds.com.
[03:54:00.245 --> 03:54:02.186]  Thanks for joining us today.
[03:54:02.186 --> 03:54:02.627]  Thanks very much, Mark.
[03:54:03.789 --> 03:54:04.230]  Thanks Bill.
[03:54:04.230 --> 03:54:05.051]  There goes Bill Oppmann.
[03:54:05.051 --> 03:54:08.555]  Please go and sign up at Minds.com today.
[03:54:08.555 --> 03:54:08.956]  I'm there.
[03:54:08.956 --> 03:54:11.679]  I've got about 80,000 followers at this point.
[03:54:11.679 --> 03:54:15.083]  You know you're not going to get banned there for exercising free speech.
[03:54:15.083 --> 03:54:19.229]  The only reason you get banned is for endorsing, advocating legal activity.
[03:54:19.229 --> 03:54:20.110]  And obviously
[03:54:20.791 --> 03:54:25.834]  Twitter, Facebook and the rest of them have terms of service which are slightly more restrictive than that.
[03:54:25.834 --> 03:54:32.439]  Minds.com aligns itself with the First Amendment so you know you're not going to get banned and it's growing rapidly.
[03:54:32.439 --> 03:54:37.022]  It's not really a right-wing echo chamber as some people claim these other websites are.
[03:54:37.022 --> 03:54:46.148]  It's people from actual real liberals who support free speech, Conservatives and whoever, having an actual conversation, God forbid, without being censored.
[03:54:46.148 --> 03:54:47.149]  So please go and sign up.
[03:54:47.549 --> 03:54:50.970]  For Minds.com fight back against big tech censorship.
[03:54:50.970 --> 03:55:03.655]  Also support InfoWars.com by going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting the specials right now to help us against this, what is now a purge, what is now basically a cyber attack on our website.
[03:55:03.655 --> 03:55:07.476]  To the point where CNN has published an article, as I just mentioned,
[03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:17.228]  Bearing in mind that CNN was the network that launched this purge, they launched this lobbying campaign back in February of this year.
[03:55:17.228 --> 03:55:19.950]  Their first target was the Alex Jones Channel.
[03:55:19.950 --> 03:55:26.276]  They tried to create a controversy over the Parkland shootings to get that shut down with community guideline strikes.
[03:55:26.952 --> 03:55:29.894]  Then they lobbied Facebook to shut us down.
[03:55:29.894 --> 03:55:33.375]  After Facebook shut us down, they lobbied Twitter to shut us down.
[03:55:33.375 --> 03:55:40.259]  They haven't been successful with Twitter yet, but they were the genesis of this campaign to purge InfoWars from the internet.
[03:55:40.259 --> 03:55:49.444]  Now they've published an article which literally accuses and says InfoWars is, quote, these are the words of Rafia Zakaria, a CNN contributor.
[03:55:49.444 --> 03:55:53.606]  She says, InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:55:54.477 --> 03:55:59.760]  Okay, this is going to have some interesting repercussions but we'll leave that article there for now.
[03:55:59.760 --> 03:56:00.780]  There you see it.
[03:56:00.780 --> 03:56:03.401]  InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:56:03.401 --> 03:56:09.104]  They were right to ban us because apparently we're like ISIS, we're like Al-Qaeda, we encourage terror attacks.
[03:56:09.104 --> 03:56:11.686]  We've never encouraged any violence whatsoever.
[03:56:11.686 --> 03:56:14.467]  We assure we disavow all violence and anyone who
[03:56:14.947 --> 03:56:16.809]  endorses it or suggests it.
[03:56:16.809 --> 03:56:18.430]  It's complete BS.
[03:56:18.430 --> 03:56:21.852]  This is why CNN is fake news.
[03:56:21.852 --> 03:56:26.276]  Let's hit another couple of headlines here in the final minute of the show.
[03:56:26.276 --> 03:56:32.461]  Sweden is burning migrant gangs unleashed coordinated firebomb rampage across multiple cities.
[03:56:32.461 --> 03:56:37.084]  So the Swedish national election is next month in just a few weeks time.
[03:56:37.084 --> 03:56:43.429]  The Sweden Democrats, which is the anti-mass migration party, the populist party, the anti-globalist party,
[03:56:44.079 --> 03:56:47.602]  is, according to the recent polls, five points ahead.
[03:56:47.602 --> 03:57:08.222]  I'm guessing when they run those polls again tomorrow or in a couple of days' time, they're going to be even further ahead because they're the only party that has promised to take steps, to take measures, to do something about Sweden's soaring violent crime problem and its complete lack of integration of migrants that have come predominantly from the Middle East over the past few years.
[03:57:08.222 --> 03:57:09.063]  So they had numerous
[03:57:10.077 --> 03:57:11.179]  Cars set on fire.
[03:57:11.179 --> 03:57:19.251]  Of course, this is a regular occurrence in Sweden, but they're saying it's never been this coordinated and it's never been this intense.
[03:57:19.251 --> 03:57:23.318]  Now the police are saying they want to talk to the parents of the guilty minors.
[03:57:23.806 --> 03:57:27.890]  Sounds like they're really going to do a lot to prevent that from happening in future, isn't it?
[03:57:27.890 --> 03:57:29.491]  But Sweden's got an election.
[03:57:29.491 --> 03:57:32.754]  The party that's promised to deal with this is ahead in the polls.
[03:57:32.754 --> 03:57:34.495]  This is going to backfire on them.
[03:57:34.495 --> 03:57:35.556]  Trump was right.
[03:57:35.556 --> 03:57:40.261]  He said his big last night in Sweden speech he was ridiculed, but he was proven right once again.
[03:57:40.261 --> 03:57:40.881]  That's it for the show.
[03:57:40.881 --> 03:57:41.982]  I'm Warren with Owen Troyer.
[03:57:41.982 --> 03:57:42.462]  He's coming up.
[03:57:42.462 --> 03:57:42.903]  Info Wars.
[03:57:43.143 --> 03:57:49.446]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[03:57:49.446 --> 03:57:52.648]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:57:52.648 --> 03:57:56.370]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:57:56.370 --> 03:58:01.052]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:58:01.052 --> 03:58:04.334]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:58:05.214 --> 03:58:16.217]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:58:16.217 --> 03:58:24.740]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[03:58:26.380 --> 03:58:35.423]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
