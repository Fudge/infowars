[00:00.000 --> 00:27.480]  Only 84 days left, the most important election in U.S. history.
[00:27.480 --> 00:30.400]  The balance not just of this country but the world is in the balance.
[00:30.400 --> 00:41.040]  The Chai Cops are now openly involved in the manipulation of our internal elections in
[00:41.040 --> 00:42.040]  a big way.
[00:42.040 --> 00:49.840]  I'm going to go to a special report and come back, I'm going to re-kick off the transmission
[00:49.840 --> 00:56.160]  because we could not have more mentis things to deal with, more momentis issues to cover.
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.560]  And I'm just telling every listener and viewer, if you just tuned in for the first time, find
[01:00.560 --> 01:04.600]  out who we really are, not what the corporate media has to say about us and realize whether
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.600]  you're listening.
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.080]  On local radio stations or TV stations or whether you are listening to us online, however
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.080]  you're listening or watching, spread the word because they're attempting to snuff out not
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.040]  just our First Amendment but your First Amendment right now and even the Washington Times has
[01:20.040 --> 01:23.680]  one of their military correspondents and Fox News contributors saying they believe the
[01:23.680 --> 01:26.240]  Chai Cops are behind my de-platforming.
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.960]  But first I'm going to go to this short report, H3 Podcast Stream is terminated for talking
[01:32.960 --> 01:33.960]  about Alex Jones.
[01:33.960 --> 01:37.680]  We reported this over the weekend but there's many examples of this but now we actually have
[01:37.680 --> 01:38.680]  the video.
[01:38.680 --> 01:39.680]  Here it is.
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.120]  Alex Jones, you all know him, the notorious conspiracy theorist, right wing.
[01:46.120 --> 01:48.760]  I want to say a lot of people consider him right, right wing.
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.120]  I don't consider him right wing, I consider him an alien.
[01:53.120 --> 02:00.200]  I feel like making him affiliated with a political party is like trying to pin down what country
[02:00.200 --> 02:01.760]  you exist to on Mars.
[02:01.760 --> 02:08.600]  He was recently banned by YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Facebook, banned.
[02:08.600 --> 02:10.920]  All the channels removed.
[02:10.920 --> 02:17.200]  Just days after banning Alex Jones from their platform, YouTube cut off the popular H3
[02:17.200 --> 02:24.680]  Stream just minutes after they began discussing Alex Jones and for what it's worth, they
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.040]  were defending YouTube.
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.080]  I don't think he really believes what he said, like about all the crazy stuff that he
[02:32.080 --> 02:33.080]  did.
[02:33.080 --> 02:36.080]  Well, that's definitely debatable.
[02:36.080 --> 02:45.600]  Hey guys, let me cut in real quick, yeah, wow, we just got taken down by YouTube, they
[02:45.600 --> 02:47.600]  just killed our stream.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.600]  Really?
[02:48.600 --> 02:49.600]  Yep.
[02:49.600 --> 02:50.600]  Why?
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.600]  Community guidelines.
[02:51.600 --> 02:52.600]  Wow.
[02:52.600 --> 02:54.600]  We can't even show his footage.
[02:54.600 --> 02:55.600]  What?
[02:55.600 --> 02:56.600]  What?
[02:56.600 --> 02:57.600]  Are you fucking stupid?
[02:57.600 --> 02:58.600]  I'm not.
[02:58.600 --> 02:59.600]  Because it's been removed?
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.200]  We were live streaming and right as we were getting into it, you guys saw, if you're watching
[03:03.200 --> 03:10.480]  the VOD, YouTube and they're infinite with them, removed our live stream and gave us
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.040]  a strike, which basically when you get a strike, you can't live stream anymore.
[03:15.040 --> 03:25.880]  So some genius over at LiveTube, I'm having a fucking, you see what's doing to me?
[03:25.880 --> 03:33.500]  My whole rant as I was just getting into was very, I'm taking YouTube side, that Alex
[03:33.500 --> 03:40.360]  Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist who violated the terms of service, was doing all this shit
[03:40.360 --> 03:47.880]  that by YouTube's terms of service shouldn't be allowed and what the fuck does YouTube
[03:47.880 --> 03:48.880]  do?
[03:48.880 --> 03:56.280]  They're like, you know what we need to do, Ethan is defending us, Ethan is defending
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.160]  us against Alex Jones right now.
[03:59.160 --> 04:07.320]  Do you know what we can do in one fell swoop to legitimize Alex Jones and to piss Ethan
[04:07.320 --> 04:15.360]  off and turn him against us, let's shut his channel down and give him a strike mid-lifestream.
[04:15.360 --> 04:16.360]  It's brilliant.
[04:16.360 --> 04:17.360]  Let's do that.
[04:17.360 --> 04:18.360]  Shut it down.
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.360]  I'll fade this down.
[04:19.360 --> 04:20.360]  What the fuck?
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.360]  Full reports on infowars.com.
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.600]  This is being done to a lot of people.
[04:23.600 --> 04:24.840]  It's called deplatforming.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.280]  It's like China.
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.400]  If you talk about the dictator looking like Winnie the Pooh, you get banned from the internet.
[04:30.400 --> 04:36.000]  It's a global social score and you guys complying with it, all you podcasters going along with
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.040]  it are going to bring it into America.
[04:38.040 --> 04:40.200]  This is the admitted global plan.
[04:40.200 --> 04:48.080]  Now, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, the big news is straight ahead.
[04:48.080 --> 04:50.000]  They are preparing the fake inward tape.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.320]  We've been warning of this for years and of course YouTube deleted our video about it detailing
[04:54.320 --> 04:56.000]  how they can do it.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  They already had it.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.800]  They would have already used it.
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.480]  Cleaning your body is hard work, that's why we've introduced the infowars life daily digestive

[06:11.880 --> 06:18.840]  There's a big event coming, a group of big events, a firestorm, we're now only 84 days
[06:18.840 --> 06:25.360]  out from the most important election in U.S. history, November 8, 2016 only established
[06:25.360 --> 06:27.800]  the beach had to return to the Republic.
[06:27.800 --> 06:31.520]  Prosperity began to come almost instantly as the globalist boot was lessened on our
[06:31.520 --> 06:32.520]  neck.
[06:32.520 --> 06:36.640]  But now they're striking back with every form of propaganda and disinformation they've
[06:36.640 --> 06:40.920]  got and they're deplatforming and banning conservatives, nationalists and patriots
[06:40.920 --> 06:45.280]  across the board as communist China spreads its wicked winge.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.040]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the tip of the spear.
[06:48.040 --> 06:49.760]  This is the info war.
[06:49.760 --> 06:53.680]  Why is Amarosa out there floating this fake inward tape that she's never heard or never
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.320]  seen but some aides told her they might have heard.
[06:57.320 --> 07:00.360]  It's all been cooked up from the beginning according to our inside sources that warned
[07:00.360 --> 07:05.360]  of Amarosa when he first hired her that she was a Trojan horse set up to make sure the
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.440]  black vote doesn't go to Trump.
[07:07.440 --> 07:08.920]  Why are they panicking?
[07:08.920 --> 07:12.480]  With African Americans and Hispanics, Trump's numbers have doubled the last year.
[07:12.480 --> 07:14.360]  No Republicans ever had such support.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.640]  The landslides accelerating.
[07:16.640 --> 07:22.640]  The Democratic Party wants to keep folks on the plantation and to stop things like this.
[07:22.640 --> 07:24.760]  We are drugged out.
[07:24.760 --> 07:28.160]  We are following other people's opinions.
[07:28.160 --> 07:30.360]  We are controlled by the media.
[07:30.360 --> 07:32.880]  Today it all changes.
[07:32.880 --> 07:35.560]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[07:35.560 --> 07:38.520]  It is a choice just like what I said slavery is a choice.
[07:38.520 --> 07:43.360]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[07:43.360 --> 07:44.360]  So we keep on saying I hate you.
[07:44.360 --> 07:45.360]  I hate you.
[07:45.360 --> 07:46.360]  You f**k you.
[07:46.360 --> 07:47.360]  I hate you.
[07:47.360 --> 07:48.360]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[07:48.360 --> 07:49.360]  Why don't we just try love?
[07:49.360 --> 07:50.360]  Why don't we just try love?
[07:50.360 --> 07:53.360]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[07:53.360 --> 07:58.360]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother***** to change something.
[07:58.360 --> 07:59.360]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[07:59.360 --> 08:00.360]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[08:00.360 --> 08:01.360]  They say Trump's crazy.
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.360]  They say I'm crazy.
[08:02.360 --> 08:03.360]  But I'm here to show love.
[08:03.360 --> 08:14.360]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.000]  Thanks to Tyrants is obedience to God.
[08:18.000 --> 08:28.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.160 --> 08:33.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[08:33.280 --> 08:39.800]  Hard to believe it's already the 14th day of August 2018.
[08:39.800 --> 08:44.840]  We have a lot of news obviously to break down and a lot of news to cover here.
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.320]  They are cracking down not just on my shelf, but thousands of other prominent nationalists
[08:49.320 --> 08:53.280]  and conservatives in organized crime.
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.280]  They have CNN and the mainstream corporate media lying about what we've said and done
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.400]  to build the straw man and then have us de-platformed to set the precedent for everyone else to
[09:03.400 --> 09:06.360]  be de-platformed.
[09:06.360 --> 09:08.800]  And it's all moving into high gear.
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.360]  Now coming up in the next segment, I'm going to lay out the scientific facts, the evidence
[09:14.360 --> 09:21.720]  what we covered a year and a half ago about Photoshop for voice faces backlash two years
[09:21.720 --> 09:22.720]  ago.
[09:22.720 --> 09:26.800]  They released it to a limited group, had to pull it back because it can break voice print
[09:26.800 --> 09:27.800]  codes.
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.680]  It is indistinguishable from the real person's voice.
[09:33.680 --> 09:40.000]  Because they can get a recording of you for even 30 seconds, they can perfectly fake it.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.880]  And now you know they would have used an N-word tape if they had it back during the election
[09:46.880 --> 09:48.880]  or after, but they haven't.
[09:48.880 --> 09:54.440]  So now it's, oh, AIDS talking about, yeah, we hear there's one, he feels real bad about
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.760]  it as if you can't get operatives inside the White House, which we know happened.
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.120]  We know Amarosa, we warned about Trump Iron to begin with.
[10:01.120 --> 10:05.400]  Roderstone's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[10:05.400 --> 10:10.360]  We know that it's very easy for people to then sit there and basically repeat rumors
[10:10.360 --> 10:11.360]  or say whatever they want.
[10:11.360 --> 10:16.400]  And then that becomes the thing that counters double the number of black Americans, Hispanic
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.920]  Americans supporting Trump as they see the economy coming back, optimism, you know, the
[10:20.920 --> 10:24.360]  lie about saying he hates all Mexicans and says they're all rapists and criminals.
[10:24.360 --> 10:25.360]  Never was said.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.520]  He said a lot of great people coming across, he's one of the better they are.
[10:27.520 --> 10:32.520]  She's also got a lot of rapists and murderers coming across, which is totally true.
[10:32.520 --> 10:38.840]  And the left is so behind covering the stuff that when the guy shoots Kate Steinland in
[10:38.840 --> 10:45.200]  the back and she dies, the government and the system says she's wonderful out in San
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.040]  Francisco and they let her go.
[10:47.040 --> 10:48.280]  They let the killer go.
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.120]  You know, he admits he shot her in the back.
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.880]  And there's other examples of that coming up today with all these Islamic terror attacks
[10:55.880 --> 10:59.480]  that we've been seeing with Westminster.
[10:59.480 --> 11:01.320]  That's it's been attacked several times by cars.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.320]  Four people run over.
[11:02.320 --> 11:03.820]  Thank God none of them are dead.
[11:03.820 --> 11:06.960]  We've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cars all over Sweden with a Stockholm
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.440]  syndrome burned by Islamic gangs.
[11:10.440 --> 11:14.200]  You've got the media for a week with the report and the police saying they found a dead body
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.160]  of a child who'd been tortured and some type of ritual reportedly, according to the police
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.360]  allegedly, but they have now met there's a dead body and underground tunnels and all
[11:22.360 --> 11:23.360]  these weapons.
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.000]  But they had witnesses that talked to the kids and others that gave them tips.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.280]  They were starving to death and didn't have water or being trained for this.
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.040]  And the liberal judge because they got up and said, oh, you're racist.
[11:33.040 --> 11:34.200]  Oh, you're bad.
[11:34.200 --> 11:38.160]  Oh, you're evil.
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.240]  The lawyer got up and said that for the five Muslim men who were connected to the famous
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.120]  mosque and all the rest of it in the world, trade center bombing and the early 1990s.
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.960]  She releases them on $20,000 bond.
[11:52.960 --> 11:58.600]  That's $2,000 you have to pay and waves that fee all together and says she feels sorry
[11:58.600 --> 12:01.680]  for them.
[12:01.680 --> 12:03.480]  So that's the level of censorship.
[12:03.480 --> 12:11.000]  That's the level of virtue signaling that's going on that the lawyer, I have the transcript
[12:11.000 --> 12:25.720]  here for the Islamist said that if they were white or Christian, they wouldn't be here.
[12:25.720 --> 12:28.920]  We have that video and audio coming up as well.
[12:28.920 --> 12:34.920]  And it's just crazy if you are Christian and a compound rubber tires around it and underground
[12:34.920 --> 12:40.000]  tunnels with starving people and they found the body of a dead kid who got reported missing
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.480]  from another state and the families are calling the police saying, please do something.
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.840]  And they just released people who had the body admittedly of a dead child who died in
[12:51.840 --> 12:55.560]  a ritual.
[12:55.560 --> 13:00.920]  According to witnesses know if you were a group of white people or black people or Hispanics
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.840]  or anybody else and you were out in a compound with tunnels in the ground and there's a dead
[13:06.840 --> 13:12.080]  body and the witnesses that called about it said they're training to go do school shootings
[13:12.080 --> 13:20.480]  and attack police, you would not be released from jail five days after you got arrested.
[13:20.480 --> 13:27.840]  But that's what I mean you can't even hardly find in the news that these are Islamic attacks
[13:27.840 --> 13:34.240]  in Sweden or Islamic attacks in England or Islamic attacks going on constantly.
[13:34.240 --> 13:35.840]  That's coming up as well.
[13:35.840 --> 13:44.640]  And then obviously the big story, all the censorship is going on and how it's expanding
[13:44.640 --> 13:45.960]  and how people have got to counter it.
[13:45.960 --> 13:55.600]  But first the whole Amarosa situation when we come back
[13:55.600 --> 14:02.000]  from the break on the other side, it's just this is the coordinated attempt by the globalist
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  to bring this country down.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.080]  Let me stop right there.
[14:05.080 --> 14:12.000]  Because everyone knows we have had unmitigated attacks, they're trying to take our servers
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.080]  down right now.
[14:13.080 --> 14:20.120]  They are filing false reports, criminal false reports, corporations, individuals, boards
[14:20.120 --> 14:24.280]  of governors and privately traded companies are defaming us with the claims they put out
[14:24.280 --> 14:31.640]  in the news for PR and a curry favor with big tech.
[14:31.640 --> 14:32.640]  It's all happening.
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.080]  This is how they shut down America.
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.880]  This is how they bring the Chinese style credit score to America.
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.280]  This is how they bring you can neither buy nor sell to America if you're not a good globalist.
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.120]  They've taken us off 26 platforms.
[14:45.120 --> 14:47.800]  They're trying to get our credit card processing right now.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.200]  They kicked us off.
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.920]  Freddie O after we were kicked off Adrol last year saying that we're promoting hatred
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.680]  when all we were selling was water filters, air filters and high quality supplements.
[14:58.680 --> 15:05.440]  We are being put into a electronic gulag, we're being removed from the electronic ghetto,
[15:05.440 --> 15:06.440]  the electronic gulag.
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.240]  We're moving from being shadow banned to totally banned and it's an incredibly dangerous time.
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.120]  And I want to thank you all for your support and thank you all for spreading the word.
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.840]  But the globalists are better.
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.600]  You're going to forget about what they've done to us and everybody else and just move
[15:20.600 --> 15:21.600]  on.
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.920]  No, this is the big issue for Congress, for the president, I had a stack in there from
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.480]  last night when I went live until 10 and I really needed bad.
[15:29.480 --> 15:34.840]  It had the new senator Warner stuff where he wants EU style censorship and to shut down
[15:34.840 --> 15:35.840]  quote fake news.
[15:35.840 --> 15:40.080]  And then I had the Chris Murphy news and all the rest of it saying shut us down.
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.720]  So they're all official now saying they're coming for all of you.
[15:43.720 --> 15:49.800]  Now we have the only news app that has a 5.0 rating, a perfect rating and is number one.
[15:49.800 --> 15:52.320]  And so that they obviously want to shut that down too.
[15:52.320 --> 15:54.040]  That's how un-American these people are.
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.360]  They want to control what you here and see and they're allied with the greatest mass
[15:57.360 --> 15:59.760]  murders in history, the chicoms.
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.760]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.560]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[18:18.840 --> 18:24.160]  Researches in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal
[18:24.160 --> 18:26.800]  immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.800 --> 18:37.800]  symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[20:03.520 --> 20:25.400]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show coming to you from the former United States of America
[20:25.400 --> 20:27.880]  from deep in the heart of Texas.
[20:27.880 --> 20:36.800]  Alex Jones, okay, I'm going to get into this operation inward that the Democrats in the
[20:36.800 --> 20:41.640]  deep state have launched to try to keep black Americans and others on the Democratic Party
[20:41.640 --> 20:50.040]  Plantation because they are absolutely waking up and coming over to the side of Trump and
[20:50.040 --> 20:54.120]  I'm seeing it on the ground with everybody I know as very, very exciting.
[20:54.120 --> 21:01.880]  So right on time, this whole thing comes in here to derail that if they had a tape of
[21:01.880 --> 21:07.440]  Trump doing this, if NBC had a tape or anybody else had a tape, they would have already played
[21:07.440 --> 21:13.480]  that tape back in the election and they would already be trying to leverage that on Trump.
[21:13.480 --> 21:14.720]  Trump has denied it.
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.320]  He says it's not true and he says they also heavily edited the famous thing from him,
[21:19.320 --> 21:24.320]  you know, 14 years ago or whatever, 13 years ago on the Bush where they're out there recording
[21:24.320 --> 21:27.640]  him knowing he's miked up about to come out.
[21:27.640 --> 21:31.360]  Imagine being the president now surrounded everybody with phones.
[21:31.360 --> 21:32.360]  They're trying to edit it.
[21:32.360 --> 21:33.400]  They're trying to take it out of context.
[21:33.400 --> 21:38.680]  It's incredible and I've experienced this with Megan Kelly.
[21:38.680 --> 21:42.100]  YouTube has now deleted the video that had millions of views where I showed what I did
[21:42.100 --> 21:47.440]  live on air, unedited, where I said, I don't know if Hillary's running child sex rings,
[21:47.440 --> 21:51.880]  but I know she represented child molesters in court, made jokes about it, said she didn't
[21:51.880 --> 21:52.880]  care.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.880]  Her husband settled a bunch of rape cases.
[21:53.880 --> 21:57.440]  They're in bed with Epstein politically, fly her on on his airplane.
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.120]  He's a known child sex trafficker.
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.240]  But her funding the Middle East and her funding the Arab Spring has killed hundreds of thousands
[22:04.240 --> 22:08.320]  of innocent people, tens of thousands of women and children, sold into sex slavery.
[22:08.320 --> 22:15.040]  And then I showed news articles, so I said, so she is guilty of raping and murdering children
[22:15.040 --> 22:20.120]  because in the, under federal law and common law, if you're the mafia boss and you order
[22:20.120 --> 22:22.680]  a murder, you're just as guilty as the person that does the murder.
[22:22.680 --> 22:25.040]  In fact, more, it's capital murder.
[22:25.040 --> 22:26.040]  It's premeditated.
[22:26.040 --> 22:29.480]  So I said, so she is guilty.
[22:29.480 --> 22:33.400]  That was video sitting here in this chair with an American flag behind me, whole nine
[22:33.400 --> 22:34.400]  yards.
[22:34.400 --> 22:38.720]  They took it, edited it, played audio on Fox News, Megan Kelly saying I said there were
[22:38.720 --> 22:41.920]  kids in a basement and that she murdered him.
[22:41.920 --> 22:44.080]  They edited two different shows together.
[22:44.080 --> 22:46.360]  That is criminal.
[22:46.360 --> 22:50.280]  That is pure evil.
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.640]  So I've experienced this and I've seen him say that Trump took Martin Luther King's bust
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.640]  out.
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.000]  It was right there in the video or they didn't even visit Congressman's police or he fed
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.760]  the fish wrong or blah, blah, blah.
[23:02.760 --> 23:05.440]  And by the way, we have some cards in the deck.
[23:05.440 --> 23:09.640]  We haven't played dealing with what Trump thinks about black people and I've been asked
[23:09.640 --> 23:10.640]  not to play those cards.
[23:10.640 --> 23:13.160]  So I'm not going to play those cards.
[23:13.160 --> 23:14.160]  Will ask me not to.
[23:14.160 --> 23:15.160]  I won't, but it's the truth.
[23:15.160 --> 23:16.720]  Robert Stone is joining us for the next segment.
[23:16.720 --> 23:22.040]  I want to play little snippets of the edited audio that CBS is playing and then I want
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.600]  to show you what the real issue here is because this is mainstream news right here.
[23:26.600 --> 23:30.640]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the internet.
[23:30.640 --> 23:31.760]  That's reason.com.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.520]  They're already doing it.
[23:34.520 --> 23:36.840]  They're already doing it.
[23:36.840 --> 23:40.120]  You don't announce an operation when you're doing it.
[23:40.120 --> 23:42.280]  We're in the middle of it.
[23:42.280 --> 23:43.560]  Zero heads.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.560]  The revenge of Hillary.
[23:44.560 --> 23:50.080]  Senator Mark Warner proposes the end of free speech a week after this came out in reason
[23:50.080 --> 23:55.760]  he now goes public and says, yeah, we're going to adopt EU rules that totally shut down free
[23:55.760 --> 23:56.760]  speech.
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.440]  I told you, Google and Facebook are going under EU fines.
[23:59.440 --> 24:02.040]  That's why this is coming here and the Chinese are involved.
[24:02.040 --> 24:05.040]  This is foreign powers meddling in the internet.
[24:05.040 --> 24:09.720]  Trump's leaving the web alone as Mr. Capitalist, but that's the same as giving it to China
[24:09.720 --> 24:13.240]  and the EU, Mr. President.
[24:13.240 --> 24:17.360]  Senator Murphy, info wars the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like
[24:17.360 --> 24:21.000]  Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.960]  These companies must do more than take down a website.
[24:23.960 --> 24:25.600]  The survival of democracy depends on it.
[24:25.600 --> 24:28.400]  They mean their corrupt globalist system.
[24:28.400 --> 24:31.040]  And then Num Chomsky for four days warns this is pure evil.
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.880]  No one covers it but drudge.
[24:35.880 --> 24:37.320]  They're making their move.
[24:37.320 --> 24:43.240]  Now, before I go to this tape, let's look at these articles right here.
[24:43.240 --> 24:46.920]  This is from years ago and you can go to info wars.com and read our articles about it.
[24:46.920 --> 24:49.320]  But our videos demonstrating it are gone.
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.480]  We'll have to redo the videos demonstrating how we can record my voice and have me just
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.160]  read out the newspaper for 30 seconds and then you can type in what you want it to say.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.640]  And in a minute, it translates it and is my voice.
[25:03.640 --> 25:08.320]  And you could have me never saying the n-word and you could have me saying whatever you
[25:08.320 --> 25:09.320]  want it.
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.760]  You could have me saying the most outlandish things adobe creates voice photoshop.
[25:14.760 --> 25:20.640]  The technology allows users to alter speakers words 2016.
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.640]  But the censors say, nope, we can't see that now.
[25:24.640 --> 25:29.320]  All destroyed photoshop for voices faces backlash.
[25:29.320 --> 25:30.320]  They put it on the market.
[25:30.320 --> 25:34.800]  The ABC reported pulled it off because it allows people to take public recordings and
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.040]  then get voice prints, whatever you want and frame people.
[25:39.040 --> 25:40.800]  So that's the report.
[25:40.800 --> 25:43.560]  Read about adobe voco and there's many other programs that do it.
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.360]  You've all seen, you know, 20 years ago, forest gump shaking hands with JFK.
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.560]  It never happened.
[25:49.560 --> 25:50.560]  This is how they fake it.
[25:50.560 --> 25:51.560]  This is how they do it.
[25:51.560 --> 25:53.680]  So if they had this type, they would have released it.
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.760]  But now they get people talking about rumors, people who denied it, people that said that
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.040]  you know that it hadn't been said with this Frank Luntz.
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.400]  And then now again, it's back to it.
[26:05.400 --> 26:08.480]  And then obviously if they're hypothetically talking about what if this comes out, then
[26:08.480 --> 26:10.520]  they're going to discuss how to spin it.
[26:10.520 --> 26:12.360]  So these are all highly edited tapes.
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.120]  Someone illegally recorded a lot of this in the situation room.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.120]  This is just amazing.
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.200]  Let's go ahead and go to that tape.
[26:20.200 --> 26:34.840]  In her new book, Unhinged, Omarosa claims the Trump campaign was aware of the existence
[26:34.840 --> 26:36.040]  of the tape.
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.560]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynn Patton, then assistant to Eric
[26:41.560 --> 26:47.760]  Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pearson and campaign communications director Jason Miller, in which
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.920]  they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.200]  I'm trying to find out at least the context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.240]  out a way to spin it.
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.880]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then candidate Trump about making the
[27:05.880 --> 27:06.880]  slur.
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.440]  I said, well, can you think of any time that this might have happened and he said no.
[27:12.440 --> 27:13.440]  Well, that's not true.
[27:13.440 --> 27:19.160]  So how do you think I should handle it, and I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa,
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.640]  which is, well, if he comes on what scenario you're talking about, and he said, well, why
[27:24.640 --> 27:27.040]  don't you just go ahead and put it to bed?
[27:27.040 --> 27:29.240]  I don't know what the scandal is.
[27:29.240 --> 27:30.240]  He said it.
[27:30.240 --> 27:31.240]  He's a man.
[27:31.240 --> 27:33.400]  Pearson denied the call, ever took place.
[27:33.400 --> 27:34.400]  It wasn't in.
[27:34.400 --> 27:35.900]  Back to soap.
[27:35.900 --> 27:37.720]  Notice they're saying Trump said he didn't do it.
[27:37.720 --> 27:39.640]  So they're just wargaming.
[27:39.640 --> 27:40.640]  What if this is real?
[27:40.640 --> 27:41.640]  And he goes, no, it's not real.
[27:41.640 --> 27:44.400]  And Omarosa goes, no, that's not true.
[27:44.400 --> 27:50.440]  She's in there recording this, setting everybody up, and they can't even get what they want.
[27:50.440 --> 27:53.680]  And so now they're trying to pick this all apart because people sat there and wargamed
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.680]  it.
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.680]  Let's continue.
[27:55.680 --> 28:01.760]  Pearson denied the call, ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.960]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it.
[28:04.960 --> 28:05.960]  Did that happen?
[28:05.960 --> 28:08.800]  No, Ed, that did not happen.
[28:08.800 --> 28:11.800]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[28:11.800 --> 28:13.120]  By the way, hit pause again.
[28:13.120 --> 28:14.120]  CBS thinks you're stupid.
[28:14.120 --> 28:16.720]  We're going to go over this some more today.
[28:16.720 --> 28:19.400]  She said he denied it.
[28:19.400 --> 28:22.840]  Omarosa goes, that's not true until she's recording a phone call.
[28:22.840 --> 28:27.720]  So what she's saying is it isn't true that he did say he said it, not that she didn't
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.120]  have the phone call.
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.920]  And imagine trying to remember all this while Omarosa, who begged for the job, is running
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.600]  around this reality TV star with the recording wanting to be somebody big in mainstream media.
[28:38.600 --> 28:39.600]  Unbelievable.
[28:39.600 --> 28:41.600]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[28:41.600 --> 28:44.600]  Please remember, without you, you are who finances InfoWars.
[28:44.600 --> 28:45.600]  We won't be here.
[28:45.600 --> 28:46.600]  Go get some.
[28:46.600 --> 28:47.600]  Meena's a Wolverine.

[30:00.440 --> 30:04.320]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[30:04.320 --> 30:07.160]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[30:07.160 --> 30:12.000]  That's why InfoWarsLife has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line, Super

[30:57.560 --> 30:59.560]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:59.560 --> 31:04.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[31:04.520 --> 31:09.220]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.220 --> 31:10.720]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.720 --> 31:15.600]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.600 --> 31:17.120]  It's made in the USA.
[31:17.120 --> 31:22.040]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[31:22.040 --> 31:23.880]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[31:23.880 --> 31:26.120]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.120 --> 31:30.640]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.640 --> 31:35.280]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.280 --> 31:36.280]  get.
[31:36.280 --> 31:39.520]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[31:39.520 --> 31:44.560]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[31:44.560 --> 31:49.800]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[31:49.800 --> 31:52.480]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.480 --> 31:55.800]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:55.800 --> 31:59.880]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield, InfoWarsLife.com.
[31:59.880 --> 32:00.880]  We knew it was coming.
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.880]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[32:02.880 --> 32:08.160]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[32:08.160 --> 32:13.480]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[32:13.480 --> 32:15.960]  children and Islamophobia.
[32:15.960 --> 32:16.960]  And then wallah.
[32:16.960 --> 32:23.080]  Two weeks later ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were
[32:23.080 --> 32:26.600]  all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[32:26.600 --> 32:32.960]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link,
[32:32.960 --> 32:36.560]  whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.720]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[32:40.720 --> 32:44.960]  emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[32:44.960 --> 32:45.960]  own platform.
[32:45.960 --> 32:50.960]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[32:50.960 --> 32:53.000]  the free Android and iPhone apps.
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.560]  How they can then reach out to others with the information, point out, this is the verboten
[32:57.560 --> 32:58.560]  info.
[32:58.560 --> 33:03.080]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[33:03.080 --> 33:22.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.960 --> 33:27.160]  Raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.160 --> 33:32.120]  I wanted to get Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign on because when Trump was
[33:32.120 --> 33:39.200]  getting ready to hire Amarosa, he flipped out on air and I know begged the White House
[33:39.200 --> 33:41.880]  not to do it, warned them.
[33:41.880 --> 33:45.640]  Here's Morgan has come out and said that she tried to get him to have sex with her to win
[33:45.640 --> 33:48.920]  celebrity apprentice.
[33:48.920 --> 33:52.120]  You can hear these tapes, you don't know if they're talking about the grabber by the
[33:52.120 --> 33:53.120]  way.
[33:53.120 --> 33:57.440]  You know what tape, this tape, did Trump say the N word, no, he says he didn't.
[33:57.440 --> 33:59.040]  No one's saying they heard a tape of this.
[33:59.040 --> 34:06.240]  This is all just rumors and innuendo of a lady running around with a phone for almost
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.120]  a year inside the White House and before that working with the campaign.
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.200]  But she's got a history and Haiti too, so we're talking to Roger about this, but this
[34:15.200 --> 34:16.760]  is how they try to derail things.
[34:16.760 --> 34:22.640]  Meanwhile, even mainstream news is having to admit that the Chai comms are more and more
[34:22.640 --> 34:31.480]  taking control of this country and that they are the ones financing and pushing the takedown
[34:31.480 --> 34:34.120]  of yours truly off of the Internet.
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.120]  Alex Jones is right.
[34:35.120 --> 34:38.840]  China is the threat and it may be too late.
[34:38.840 --> 34:47.360]  The Washington Times, L Todd Wood, who's a national security advisor to Fox News contributor,
[34:47.360 --> 34:50.320]  military veteran from special operations, I'm not going to get into all the things he's
[34:50.320 --> 34:57.360]  done from the U.S. Air Force Academy, but he lays it out right here, some other scholarly
[34:57.360 --> 35:03.040]  work that everything is Chai comm run except the military and a few branches of the government.
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.720]  They totally took us over with the help of the Democrats and the globalists.
[35:06.720 --> 35:11.880]  Remember, when somebody's trying to get us back under the control of the people and bring
[35:11.880 --> 35:20.480]  back prosperity that the Chai comms are literally manipulating and controlling Hollywood and
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.000]  Netflix and all of it.
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.680]  All this anti-American stuff, all this race war stuff, all the sexualization of children,
[35:26.680 --> 35:29.960]  that's all illegal in China, but they're doing it here.
[35:29.960 --> 35:31.240]  We'll be getting into that.
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.440]  That report is on infowars.com, but you guys tweet this out on Watson's Twitter and on
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.680]  my place, please tweet it from the Washington Times, not from the infowars.
[35:39.680 --> 35:40.920]  I did post it in full.
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.680]  I don't normally do that, but it's all about me and it's very, very accurate.
[35:43.680 --> 35:46.720]  So I posted the whole thing at infowars.com, but I'm going to tweet the Washington Times
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.880]  version to the world because it's so important.
[35:51.880 --> 35:53.760]  So understanding the threat, there it is.
[35:53.760 --> 35:57.720]  We'll get more into that coming up and the censorship that's happening.
[35:57.720 --> 36:00.040]  But right now, let me lay this out.
[36:00.040 --> 36:02.600]  They are suing us and trying to shut us down.
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.800]  Those suits aren't going well, but it's costing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[36:06.800 --> 36:09.200]  for the big suits to defeat them.
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.600]  And they've got three Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[36:12.600 --> 36:15.240]  They've got a bunch of others that are very, very serious.
[36:15.240 --> 36:20.000]  If they can shut us down, it will be a big victory for the globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.400]  And they admit a overturning of the New York Times versus Sullivan and basically the First
[36:25.400 --> 36:26.400]  Amendment.
[36:26.400 --> 36:29.600]  So we can defeat this and we can be strong.
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.080]  They're trying to take our payment processors, they've taken our credio, third party advertising
[36:34.080 --> 36:41.720]  so we can't advertise on platforms, just supplements and air filtration, water filtration.
[36:41.720 --> 36:45.720]  We're not just here on air trying to get you to finance this operation.
[36:45.720 --> 36:52.520]  I reach out to other audiences and advertise, spend a lot of money to bring in the money
[36:52.520 --> 36:55.760]  we need to fund this operation.
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.760]  I love capitalism and I love businessmen and women.
[36:58.760 --> 37:06.320]  This is a Patriot military operation, a organic resistance to the globalist.
[37:06.320 --> 37:09.680]  And so that's how I see it, is I'm an independent Texan, I'm an American.
[37:09.680 --> 37:11.600]  I knew the globalists were trying to take over.
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.200]  I built a system to fight them.
[37:13.200 --> 37:14.200]  We've been successful.
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.200]  We've helped reboot the resistance worldwide, not just here.
[37:18.200 --> 37:19.280]  And the enemy knows that.
[37:19.280 --> 37:21.120]  So do you know how important Info Wars is?
[37:21.120 --> 37:22.120]  I know a lot of you do.
[37:22.120 --> 37:25.080]  Pray for us, support us, spread the articles, the videos.
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.000]  Help people by hand with little cards, find out about verboten Info Wars.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  You've done it.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.360]  We have the 5.0 app.
[37:33.360 --> 37:37.720]  The only app in the app store that's news, we're number one in both formats of Android
[37:37.720 --> 37:38.720]  and Apple.
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.160]  I tweeted this out at Real Alex Jones and put it on screen place.
[37:43.160 --> 37:50.040]  It is number one and it is a 5.0.
[37:50.040 --> 37:52.680]  Just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, like I said during the break.
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.120]  Got a setup for that, just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter and it's one of the tweets
[37:58.120 --> 38:06.400]  from today that it's a 5.0 in the Apple store.
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.160]  And so that's why they're trying to get rid of it.
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.760]  That's why they're trying to remove it is because we launched it a month ago and it
[38:17.760 --> 38:20.920]  went into the top 40, unheard of.
[38:20.920 --> 38:27.600]  Then it shot past the New York Times, CNN, Fox News, everything to the top.
[38:27.600 --> 38:29.080]  They don't know what to do.
[38:29.080 --> 38:33.200]  It's going to go to number one period very, very soon, not just in news.
[38:33.200 --> 38:35.120]  So what happens when you're number one?
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.320]  CNN lobbies to have it removed.
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.480]  That is Chinese Communist type behavior and they have military officers in high level
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.120]  Pentagon positions saying, no, it's the chai comms.
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.400]  Well, I was told it was.
[38:47.400 --> 38:50.880]  I was talking about Apple officially moving to China, Google helping sensor over there
[38:50.880 --> 38:54.960]  and here, and we're helping put oxygen into that fire that'll save the country.
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.640]  And I'm a patriot and I love all of you and I know you appreciate me, but I'm just telling
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.600]  you need to go to info or store.com and you need to get products that are game changing

[40:32.560 --> 40:36.320]  But whatever you do understand this is a war and if they can shut us down, we have the
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.200]  Democrats officially saying they're going after everybody and I want to spend a few
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.160]  minutes on that with Roger Stone who's being sued by Obama and the globalists and everybody
[40:44.160 --> 40:45.160]  else.
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.440]  They're trying to set him up as well.
[40:46.440 --> 40:48.360]  We'll get into Amoroso when we come back.
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.840]  But the few minutes we have here, I just read earlier when we started this segment.
[40:53.840 --> 40:56.280]  The Democrats are it was secret documents a month ago.
[40:56.280 --> 41:00.200]  Now they're officially saying we're going to go with the EU model and the Chinese model
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.240]  and we're going to have credit scores and if you criticize the government or anybody,
[41:03.240 --> 41:05.960]  you're not going to be able to buy or sell and we're going to find everybody and we're
[41:05.960 --> 41:07.880]  going to end freedom for our democracy.
[41:07.880 --> 41:08.880]  Those are quotes.
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.320]  This is there should be millions in the streets calling for the resignations.
[41:12.320 --> 41:16.600]  They have gone pure authoritarian Roger and they're planning something big in the next
[41:16.600 --> 41:19.880]  84 days before the election, I believe.
[41:19.880 --> 41:26.880]  It's been amazing is the way you called this from the very beginning.
[41:26.880 --> 41:33.200]  The phony harassment lawsuits distorting what you said about Sandy Hall distorting what
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.920]  you said about other important matters in the media.
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.120]  The false accusations against you that you were grooming someone who worked at info wars
[41:45.120 --> 41:46.520]  for gay sex.
[41:46.520 --> 41:49.040]  The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.680]  These were all laid out there to generate distorted negative headlines.
[41:54.680 --> 42:01.120]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to bump info wars and
[42:01.120 --> 42:07.320]  everything we do here off of all of these important social media platforms.
[42:07.320 --> 42:08.820]  It's insidious.
[42:08.820 --> 42:10.120]  It was a plan.
[42:10.120 --> 42:13.800]  It was formulaic and you called it from the very beginning.
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.400]  Well, I've seen what they've done in other countries, what they've done where they're
[42:16.400 --> 42:18.280]  banning speech in France and in Brazil.
[42:18.280 --> 42:20.680]  We're going to talk about this more a little bit in the next hour.
[42:20.680 --> 42:24.280]  I'm going to come back into Amorosa and their big play, obviously, to get minorities not
[42:24.280 --> 42:27.880]  to vote for Republicans in the midterms and not to vote for their American birthright and
[42:27.880 --> 42:28.880]  freedom.
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.040]  They've been doing the similar things to you, Roger, and the reason they had to panic and
[42:33.040 --> 42:35.360]  fully deplatform us is it wasn't working.
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.960]  But think about how bold that is, listeners and viewers, to literally begin unpersoning
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.400]  someone off of every platform and then targeting those that even talk about you or show you.
[42:45.400 --> 42:51.440]  This is the total end of free speech using the big Google, Facebook system to censor
[42:51.440 --> 42:57.720]  everybody with the head of Apple orchestrating the whole thing from his slave factories
[42:57.720 --> 42:59.280]  in China.
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.320]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[46:05.680 --> 46:06.680]  Thanks for holding.
[46:06.680 --> 46:07.680]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[46:07.680 --> 46:11.200]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[46:11.200 --> 46:16.320]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen,
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.720]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up into there, and I thought it was pretty cool.
[46:20.720 --> 46:24.840]  I've read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests, and I've
[46:24.840 --> 46:29.320]  been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then, I'm on
[46:29.320 --> 46:35.880]  the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body, it's all
[46:35.880 --> 46:36.880]  amazing.
[46:36.880 --> 46:37.880]  Thank you, brother.
[46:37.880 --> 46:41.920]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[46:41.920 --> 46:46.320]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more
[46:46.320 --> 46:51.440]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God, and I wanted to say that
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.640]  it's an honor to stand side-by-side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776
[46:56.640 --> 46:57.640]  worldwide.
[46:57.640 --> 47:14.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:14.640 --> 47:20.120]  Alex Jones is on fire after organized car fire-bombing blitz.
[47:20.120 --> 47:25.480]  Another car rammed into four pedestrians at Parliament in England, defending the Republic
[47:25.480 --> 47:28.960]  from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[47:28.960 --> 47:37.040]  It's Alex Jones, a liberal judge from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com
[47:37.040 --> 47:39.680]  studios.
[47:39.680 --> 47:46.080]  A liberal judge just released five people living in an armed compound with tunnels of starving
[47:46.080 --> 47:53.440]  children and the dead body of a young teenage boy because their lawyer said it was racist
[47:53.440 --> 47:56.320]  to hold them.
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.960]  Even though witnesses and people that conduct the police said that they were allegedly training
[48:00.960 --> 48:06.440]  for mass shootings and an uprising to kill police, Vimeo said that when I reported that
[48:06.440 --> 48:14.320]  it was fake news and banned me two days ago, I am sworn to defend this Republic.
[48:14.320 --> 48:17.800]  And I got to tell you, Roger Stones here with us for this segment and the next, I want to
[48:17.800 --> 48:22.360]  get into the whole Amorosa thing, but Roger, they are working around the clock to take
[48:22.360 --> 48:24.080]  our servers down right now.
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.160]  I've got to have people up here at like midnight just to keep InfoWars.com up.
[48:29.160 --> 48:30.640]  NewsWars.com is up.
[48:30.640 --> 48:32.600]  PrisonPlanet.com is up.
[48:32.600 --> 48:35.680]  Europe Wars was down earlier today with stuff going on.
[48:35.680 --> 48:39.680]  I mean, we are under DDoS attacks, everything, and it just becomes the normal background
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.720]  that everyone's recording the president and editing it.
[48:42.720 --> 48:45.320]  Amorosa was the African-American liaison first.
[48:45.320 --> 48:48.840]  Sounds like they're talking about how to spin what's reportedly, so remember they leaked
[48:48.840 --> 48:49.840]  it.
[48:49.840 --> 48:53.280]  Oh, also on the NBC tape, you can see what's happening now.
[48:53.280 --> 48:57.520]  Our best dead reckoning on this is that he'd always said that was edited.
[48:57.520 --> 48:59.360]  They're discussing, grabbing by this.
[48:59.360 --> 49:00.600]  They say, did he say the N word?
[49:00.600 --> 49:01.600]  No, he didn't.
[49:01.600 --> 49:04.560]  Amorosa goes, that's a lie.
[49:04.560 --> 49:05.560]  Trump's in.
[49:05.560 --> 49:06.560]  It's clearly all edited.
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.640]  Trump's denying it, but the media's spinning it like the aides are saying it was true.
[49:10.640 --> 49:13.400]  But when we played the audio earlier, we'll play it again in a moment.
[49:13.400 --> 49:14.840]  That's not what you hear, Roger.
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.680]  But let's get into Amorosa herself and her character first.
[49:18.680 --> 49:21.160]  Absolutely, Alex.
[49:21.160 --> 49:29.200]  As you know, we broke the story here at InfoWars that early in the Trump administration that
[49:29.200 --> 49:37.840]  Amorosa had persuaded the president to send a delegation from the White House to Haiti
[49:37.840 --> 49:46.480]  for the inauguration of the new regime, which is really the old corrupt regime with some
[49:46.480 --> 49:53.600]  new frontmen that has robbed the Haitian people blind, which stole all of the earthquake
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.000]  relief money after that horrific natural disaster.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.160]  And I think she should have been fired right then and there.
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.680]  The common denominator was a Democratic political consultant named Ron Daniels, who is a friend
[50:08.680 --> 50:09.680]  of Amorosa's.
[50:09.680 --> 50:12.840]  Amorosa traveled to Haiti with Haiti.
[50:12.840 --> 50:15.640]  Let's go back because I want to give me those exact headlines.
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.760]  I remember I was like, get off this Amorosa thing.
[50:18.760 --> 50:23.280]  You were coming on, you know, back then, like almost every day, and it was Amorosa, Amorosa,
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.480]  Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa, and you said, listen, she's a Democratic operative.
[50:27.480 --> 50:30.080]  She's going to set things up and she's tied to corruption to Haiti.
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.800]  So what were the headlines back then because I want to pull those up for viewers.
[50:33.800 --> 50:38.600]  The actual headline, I think, is why is Amorosa helping the Clinton rate, the Clinton's rate
[50:38.600 --> 50:39.600]  of Haiti?
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.280]  And I think you, I think it's up on the Infowars site.
[50:43.280 --> 50:46.760]  I believe it's also up at the Stone Cold Truth site at the site.
[50:46.760 --> 50:49.080]  I think we cross posted it at the time.
[50:49.080 --> 50:56.960]  I interviewed Azilio Donso right here on, on Infowars about this at least twice.
[50:56.960 --> 50:58.520]  So this woman is evil.
[50:58.520 --> 50:59.920]  She is not one of us.
[50:59.920 --> 51:06.640]  Now I recognize why during the campaign, having a person of color willing to campaign for
[51:06.640 --> 51:13.120]  the president to someone who knew him personally, someone who could attest that he is not a racist,
[51:13.120 --> 51:16.480]  he's not, was valuable.
[51:16.480 --> 51:22.000]  And she was loyal to Trump and Trump was loyal to her during the campaign.
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.160]  I think she did an extraordinary disservice to the Trump administration and to the country
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.520]  trunting for these criminals in Haiti.
[51:31.520 --> 51:38.920]  But now, hell hath no scorn, hell hath no fury, like a woman scorned.
[51:38.920 --> 51:41.320]  She was soaking up a huge paycheck.
[51:41.320 --> 51:43.440]  She was doing nothing.
[51:43.440 --> 51:47.520]  She was abusive to other members of the staff.
[51:47.520 --> 51:52.320]  She seemed to think because she had a prior personal relationship with the president that
[51:52.320 --> 51:54.960]  the rules did not apply to her.
[51:54.960 --> 51:57.280]  Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[51:57.280 --> 52:00.400]  Trump does it just like black people or black women.
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.120]  And we need to win this midterm.
[52:04.120 --> 52:08.560]  So I just, I have to know there's some real ace cards floating right out there.
[52:08.560 --> 52:12.800]  And I just wonder Roger will ever, that'll ever come out.
[52:12.800 --> 52:15.720]  Well, I look about Trump and Amorosa.
[52:15.720 --> 52:21.440]  I don't think Donald Trump ever had a romantic relationship with Amorosa.
[52:21.440 --> 52:26.440]  I do know that he did once date an African-American supermodel.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.480]  Oh wait, so you're going to go ahead and put this out now.
[52:29.480 --> 52:30.480]  Go ahead.
[52:30.480 --> 52:36.000]  At a time that he was single, a woman who appeared multiple times on the cover of Bogue,
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.400]  a stunningly beautiful woman who happened to be African-American.
[52:40.400 --> 52:41.400]  He was single.
[52:41.400 --> 52:42.560]  She was single.
[52:42.560 --> 52:44.560]  So much for the idea that he is a racist.
[52:44.560 --> 52:47.000]  He doesn't have a racist bone in his body.
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.440]  And Roger, there's even more to the story, but we're just going to leave it at that.
[52:50.440 --> 52:51.680]  Because this has not been reported.
[52:51.680 --> 52:56.320]  And I really think regardless of what the president wants, at a certain point we have
[52:56.320 --> 52:57.560]  to do what's best for him.
[52:57.560 --> 53:01.320]  Well, I'm going to be in Dallas, probably I'm going to be in Austin for the next two
[53:01.320 --> 53:02.320]  days.
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.040]  And I think perhaps we can lay this whole story out.
[53:06.040 --> 53:08.920]  Because I know Donald Trump, 40 years.
[53:08.920 --> 53:09.920]  He is not a racist.
[53:09.920 --> 53:16.400]  Well, let's just say that you were his wingman and you, I mean, you, you, you know, abso
[53:16.400 --> 53:19.520]  100% Lutely, he's not a racist.
[53:19.520 --> 53:26.520]  I know that for a fact, look at some of his friends, Mike Tyson, Don King, look at his
[53:26.520 --> 53:33.520]  courtship of this absolutely stunning black model who was really on the cover of Bogue,
[53:33.520 --> 53:37.400]  I believe three or four times, which is a record.
[53:37.400 --> 53:42.520]  Perhaps Amarosa may have aspired to have a romantic relationship with him when he was
[53:42.520 --> 53:45.240]  single, but I doubt he was interested.
[53:45.240 --> 53:48.720]  And now she turns out to be a lying viper.
[53:48.720 --> 53:54.000]  Let's take, for example, the claim in her book that the Republican pollster Frank Luntz
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.280]  heard Trump use the n-word.
[53:56.280 --> 53:57.280]  Not true.
[53:57.280 --> 54:00.520]  Well, I know Luntz, I've known him since he was 13 years old.
[54:00.520 --> 54:01.520]  He denies it.
[54:01.520 --> 54:06.080]  He said he never heard anything whatsoever, and that she never confirmed the same with
[54:06.080 --> 54:07.080]  him.
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.800]  So, uh, look, her, her book is a piece of garbage.
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.800]  This is-
[54:10.800 --> 54:13.080]  Well, I was about to say though, I'm going to play this tape when we come back, but,
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.040]  but if you listen to it, the, the women are like, no, he said he didn't say it, but then
[54:17.040 --> 54:18.040]  they move on.
[54:18.040 --> 54:19.040]  Well, what about the other stuff?
[54:19.040 --> 54:20.040]  Well, he's embarrassed about it.
[54:20.040 --> 54:23.040]  They're talking at the time during the campaign about the famous grabber by the, you know
[54:23.040 --> 54:24.040]  what tape.
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.640]  So you can tell it's all edited and then the women are saying, no, he didn't say it.
[54:27.640 --> 54:29.280]  She's like, no, no, that's a lie.
[54:29.280 --> 54:32.360]  You can see her trying to set him up back then.
[54:32.360 --> 54:34.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[54:34.160 --> 54:35.360]  This is all about her.
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.800]  It's all about her being fired in the blow to her ego.
[54:39.800 --> 54:41.720]  She was trying to acquire power.
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.560]  She was trying to acquire a turf inside the White House, but essentially she's incompetent
[54:47.560 --> 54:53.560]  and she was not even effective in her outreach to the black community on behalf of this administration.
[54:53.560 --> 54:59.960]  My questions and I have each one, Alex, what's going to matter more to African American voters?
[54:59.960 --> 55:07.080]  The lowest unemployment rate among black Americans in US history or the fact that Amarosa is
[55:07.080 --> 55:09.120]  but her about being fired?
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.960]  I think the answer is pretty clear.
[55:10.960 --> 55:14.840]  Well, even the Democrats at first said illegally recording people in the situation room saying
[55:14.840 --> 55:15.840]  Kelly threatened her.
[55:15.840 --> 55:16.840]  That's the standard deal.
[55:16.840 --> 55:18.120]  Hey, you ought to resign.
[55:18.120 --> 55:19.120]  This will be a lot easier.
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.160]  I would, you know, I wouldn't tar your name.
[55:21.160 --> 55:22.160]  I wouldn't look disgruntled.
[55:22.160 --> 55:23.600]  You know, we'll try to help you out.
[55:23.600 --> 55:25.680]  We'll give you a good recommendation.
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.920]  That's the standard deal when you work in a media or governmental type deal is, hey,
[55:30.920 --> 55:32.800]  you know, you've been doing some stuff you're not supposed to.
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.280]  We now know what that was running around grandstanding, violating security, recording people, which
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.280]  is all confirmed.
[55:38.280 --> 55:39.280]  He's saying, be nice.
[55:39.280 --> 55:40.280]  We'll play nice.
[55:40.280 --> 55:41.280]  And she calls that a threat.
[55:41.280 --> 55:44.360]  I call that somebody, you know, trying to give you a chance.
[55:44.360 --> 55:45.600]  I couldn't agree more.
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.200]  Look, we know that she asked to hold her wedding in the Rose Garden.
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.520]  No staff member has ever held a wedding in the Rose Garden.
[55:55.520 --> 55:59.880]  Members of the first family, Trisha Nixon, for example, was married there.
[55:59.880 --> 56:04.120]  One of President Johnson's daughters was married there.
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.120]  That's appropriate.
[56:05.120 --> 56:06.800]  Staff members, not appropriate.
[56:06.800 --> 56:13.120]  So when that request is rejected by General Kelly, Amarosa just barges into the place
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.040]  and does what she wants anyway.
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.720]  There's grounds for firing right there.
[56:17.720 --> 56:20.000]  So this is all about her.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.520]  What's amazing to me is the way the mainstream media, particularly CNN, has whipped this
[56:24.520 --> 56:25.520]  into a story.
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.080]  This is tabloid crap.
[56:27.080 --> 56:32.680]  We've got the Chinese communists on the verge of taking over this country by the hijacking
[56:32.680 --> 56:33.680]  order.
[56:33.680 --> 56:34.680]  It's even worse.
[56:34.680 --> 56:39.080]  The sales of all our technology and all they want to talk about is Amarosa.
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.080]  Tired of it.
[56:40.080 --> 56:41.080]  We'll be right back.
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.400]  We're going to air this tape and then talk about the censorship, Roger Stonestone, coldtruth.com,
[56:45.400 --> 56:46.560]  infowars.com.
[56:46.560 --> 56:49.800]  And please don't forget, we'll tell you about the Stone Legal Defense Fund.
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.800]  We come back.
[56:50.800 --> 56:52.160]  And without you, we're not going to be here.

[57:28.200 --> 57:30.680]  And then the head of Apple, quarterbacking and had a meeting and said he's getting too
[57:30.680 --> 57:31.680]  much attention.
[57:31.680 --> 57:32.680]  No more coverage.

[59:40.760 --> 59:47.040]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:47.040 --> 59:53.480]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.480 --> 01:00:12.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:18.280]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.560]  and do nothing.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:36.240]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.520]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called infowars and in the
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:48.000]  decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.280]  tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24 seven live news TV channel
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.080]  broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas, infowars has become the
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.560]  most trusted independent news source in the country dedicated to delivering breaking news,
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.560]  live coverage of special events and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.520]  But then the record skips, you hear the car crash sound and all of it's gone, five billion
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.560]  views, all of it destroyed because they don't want people to go back and see how right we've
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.740]  been, they're desperate, but I am unfortunately having to prepare legal action to defend the
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.320]  First Amendment and I've got letters going on to Google right now because they worked
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.920]  with a cartel to ban us, they made a big mistake, they're in antitrust violation right now,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.920]  caught dead to rights.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.480]  Going back to Roger Stone, Roger let's play some of this CBS piece, again I can go over
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.300]  this for an hour, I can teach a college course on this, but just like Megan Kelly edited
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.200]  tape of me talking about Hillary having people killed in Iraq, then they edited it to say
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.600]  kids in a pizza place on Fox News before she left.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.360]  You can hear the women saying no, he didn't say the n-word and this is the famous debate
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.760]  when they were saying there was a rumored n-word on the grabber by the you know what
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]  tape.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.960]  So they're then wargaming that and Amarosa day one is like jumping in on the phone trying
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.040]  to say it's a lie when she's acting like she's Trump's friend before she even gets hired
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.240]  once he gets elected, this whole thing like you said she's been brought in by one of these
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.880]  top Democrats, I mean my God, I wish Trump would have listened to you because I know
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.640]  before he even hired her at the White House you told him don't do it.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.360]  That is correct, I think she's been a-quizzling from the beginning, it's all about her, the
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.520]  aggrandizement of her, the accumulation of power by her, she's never shared the president's
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.680]  agenda, what she did in Haiti is disgraceful during the campaign, the president pledged
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.000]  to be a friend to the Haitian people, the Bushes and the Clintons ripped off millions
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.720]  of dollars of the Haitian earthquake money as we now know, Amarosa essentially helped
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.320]  perpetuate that.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.240]  So she did no favors for this country or this administration and frankly I was delighted
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.040]  to see General Kelly tan her, it was about time.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.360]  Let's go ahead and roll the heavily edited tape and even the edited tape you can hear
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.480]  them stretching, here it is.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.000]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynn Patton then assistant to Eric Trump,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.880]  Fox person Katrina Pearson and campaign communications director Jason Miller in which they discuss
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.320]  how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.640]  I'm trying to find out at least the context he was using to help us maybe try to figure
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.720]  out the latest in it.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.280]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then candidate Trump about making the
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  slur.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.880]  I said well can you think of any time that this might have happened and he said no.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.880]  Well that's not true.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.320]  So how do you think I should handle it?
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.520]  And I told him exactly what you just said Amarosa which is well if you kind of fun what
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.400]  scenario you're talking about and he said well why don't you just go ahead and put
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.400]  it to bed.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  I don't know what to handle it.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.400]  He said it.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]  He's American.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:03.880]  Pearson denied the call ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.640]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it, did that happen?
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.920]  No and that did not happen.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.440]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.920]  The White House and Trump campaign have not provided a response to this new development
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.920]  and neither have Pearson or Patton who-
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]  Stay right there.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.760]  We're going to come back to you five more minutes with Roger Stone and Joel Scalzen joins
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.400]  us on the big geopolitical front and look at the big surprise coming up the midterms
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.880]  B but you hear that hammered edited tape.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.440]  You hear the woman say no he didn't say it.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.560]  Somebody jumps in and says he does and it's October 2016 they admit they're discussing
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.360]  what could be on the NBC grabbing by the you know what tape and it was all rumored at the
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.080]  time that was in there so they're wargaming all angles and arguing about this hysterical
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.240]  clucking around and that becomes the proof of this unbelievable.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.160]  We'll put bookends on this straight ahead with Roger Stone then Joel Scalzen stay with
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160]  us.

[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:24.200]  the info war.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200]  I'm Alex Jones your host and let me tell you people ask me how are you doing being demonized
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.720]  in thousands of articles every new channel being lined about well this is a war to take
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.360]  back the country and this is what I expected would happen to the people at the turning
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.680]  point but I didn't know I'd be right at the tip of the spear here so we're gonna be war
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:47.720]  gaming all this geopolitical and more with Joel Scousen World Affairs brief come up here
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.520]  in about five minutes but I wanted to finish up with Roger Stone former head of the campaign
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:58.600]  you're gonna be coming to Austin tomorrow and we're gonna spend a few days and I know
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.960]  you have not wanted to ever break any confidence with the president you've known for 40 plus
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:08.200]  years and who you were even the New York Times admitted 20 years ago or his wingman for decades
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:16.640]  when he was not married he you guys would go out and date ladies together and you and
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.040]  I didn't just get a lot of this from you I read about it the New York Times back when
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.520]  we were more accurate years ago because I was trying to figure out who Trump really was
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.800]  about four or five years ago and all the started or four years ago and how you know he is his
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.520]  lawyer was the head of the House un-American Senate un-American committee for you know
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:41.240]  obviously the fellow that led the fight against that famously and who's now been proven a completely
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.560]  correct and of course that's Joseph McCarthy and all the rest of it really trying to find
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.000]  out who Trump really is not who they say he is and so I know you've got some bombshells
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.080]  that I think we're gonna go ahead and have to figure out what we're gonna release or
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.120]  what we're gonna say what we're gonna do that are really devastate a lot of the things
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.880]  they're pushing and saying but just in closing with Amarosa and where all this is going so
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.720]  you agree this is their attempt but double the number of black Americans and Hispanics
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.160]  saying they're gonna vote for Republicans in the midterm turning around really liking
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.720]  Trump getting it's all a big lie this is the counter this is their play amongst others
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.200]  to try to make sure that the Republicans lose this critical midterm election there's no
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.040]  question look at the declarations by Kanye West have had a devastating effect on them
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:34.440]  so this is in the pop culture this is an attempt to undo that record number of African Americans
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.560]  now moving towards the Trump position moving towards the Republican Party which of course
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:45.840]  is logical because we are the party of emancipation we are the party of civil rights we are the
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:52.480]  party of Lincoln and therefore they're hysterical about it because a small shift in that vote
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.960]  can make the difference let's look at the 2016 elections a shift of 10,000 votes in the
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:04.960]  city of Detroit gives Donald Trump Michigan a shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Milwaukee
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:12.480]  gives Trump Wisconsin a shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Philadelphia gives Trump Pennsylvania
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:20.760]  places where Mitt Romney and George and John McCain fell short so they are petrified that
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:28.960]  Trump is changing the political zeitgeist he's changing and forging a new coalition hopefully
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.360]  a permanent coalition so what do we do we tried out Amarosa and her pack of lies and
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.760]  her pack of fabrications where she consistently contradicts everything she said previously
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.280]  this is so transparent Alex it's almost nauseating I don't think the American people will buy
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:54.040]  it I'll tell you why jobs in our inner cities jobs in our black community opportunities
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:59.560]  are far more important than anything Amarosa has to say and especially black Americans
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.240]  know they were totally abandoned by Obama their unemployment almost doubled under Obama
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.360]  it was just hellish he just thought he had him so he threw him to the curb Trump has
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.160]  really been focusing on this really trying to get factories in and folks know that so
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.120]  it's very exciting let me just add this point they're really trying to take us down we've
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.600]  had news wars.com prisonplanet.com and Europe wars all targeted because they're not on the
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:26.720]  biggest servers they're on huge ones info wars is on really you know fancy high tech
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.840]  systems with systems in front of it you name it but it's been going down since this weekend
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:39.520]  intermittently info wars.com is now down and under attack and we've had people inside companies
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.880]  you tell us oh your software you can't use it now and then we contact the head of the
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.800]  companies I'm not gonna say names it's it's not cloudflare that's doing this and they
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.960]  say no that's a mutiny inside our operation they say well basically someone did that who's
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:58.320]  unauthorized show and I want to be clear that's not cloudflare it's a software company one
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.320]  of the top ones everybody knows the name of that had that happened over the weekend and
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.400]  they didn't ask me not to say their name I'm just I'm just trying to trying to you know
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.000]  have some privacy here but they are they're not trying to take us off our payment systems
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.760]  they've actually taken one down and once chopping cart down they are taking our comment section
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.720]  away we had to put a new one in that isn't as popular yet a discuss us got rid of us
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.280]  mail chimps we couldn't send emails to you now we're on a new system they're attacking
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.480]  that it is total they've got three New York Times reporters down here basically full time
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.440]  following me around on others Washington Post writers Buzzfeed people I mean it is I'm following

[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:54.640]  that but it is going on this is malicious you have news wars.com prisonplanet.com but
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.000]  this is our total de-platforming this is China involved the Washington Times is reporting
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.760]  with one of the national security consultants to Fox News contributors saying that they concur
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.600]  that the Chinese are involved with Tim Cook who's officially moved there and that they're
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.720]  making their move right now in Hollywood everywhere so we'll be discussing that with Joel Scousen

[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.200]  dollars bond that's two thousand dollars and the judge says she's going to waive that even
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.960]  because they said it's racist because they're black and that they were Christians in a compound
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:20.440]  like that they would never have had their children taken they got emergency calls people starving

[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.400]  barons were funding communism helping put communist china in place all of it was john
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.120]  birch who got tortured to death at the end of world war two and when malice taking power
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.480]  in the late 40s because he knew that our government was aiding it and so it's it's it's folks
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:00.880]  like joel scousen bestselling author former marine corps naval aviator in the vietnam
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:06.600]  era patriot editor in chief of world affairs brief dot com can really speak to this but
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.760]  the washington times has a big article and by the way i've been told leave the islamist
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.680]  alone leave china alone you're gonna be taking off these platforms and tim cooks officially
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:20.040]  moved to china google has been caught building secret censorship systems that they're already
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:25.160]  testing here it's here and here's the article alex jones is right china is the threat and
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:30.800]  it may be too late that's l todd wood and here's a national security advisor and expert
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:35.560]  contributor to fox news and a bunch of other grips and he breaks it all down there as well
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:46.160]  must read china literally owns most of hollywood now two years ago three years ago michael sabbage
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:51.040]  they printed a couple like 50 000 of his book he said and then they wouldn't put it in stores
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.280]  because the chinese said no so this is the big enchilada and i'm not saying china totally
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.840]  runs the u.s. but the globalist have been merging with it and still plan to fight with
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.400]  it i agree with what scousen says but it seems to me though that that that the chinese are
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.960]  going into overdrive right now i i'm gonna get his expert take on this and what he thinks
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.680]  about info wars dot com being down right now and the total deplatforming we're facing what
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.560]  does that signify because they're already going after everybody else right now ahead
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.240]  of the midterms i think they wouldn't be doing something this illegal we've talked to top
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.600]  lawyers and draconian if they weren't planning to go for broke joel scousen thanks for joining
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:35.640]  us well the issue is conspiracy alex you mentioned there are other people of info wars
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:41.800]  goes down there's breitbart there's drudgen but they don't cover conspiracy in the degree
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.720]  and with argumentation and evidence that you do now i do i've got a much smaller audience
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.880]  than i did but you are the kingpin and of the conspiracy movement like it or not and
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.040]  that's why you're the target alex and it's a tear it's a chance one thing you know which
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:03.680]  i don't think they will be this is that to be you know very disconcerting it's got to
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.560]  be a problem you know financially as they continue to harass you with these lawsuits
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:14.520]  but can tell you that people on the outside say hey something wrong with this picture
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:20.960]  uh... there is a bendetta against this guy and i better find out what's going on here
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.520]  and so i think people are showing interest in finding out a little bit about you and
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.440]  they find out you know that you have made corrections to the things which they always
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.440]  promote in a false way that you've said about sandy hook or other things or the pizza gate
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:39.960]  thing they never talk about your corrections they never talk about your improved position
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:46.600]  on these things so this is a very strange piece of bias it's not going to end this is
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.280]  a powerful system one of my major complaints is the conservative movement keeps saying
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:58.040]  enough a lot of this is due to fox news who talks about the deep state but in their opinion
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.400]  the deep state is simply obama administration democrat holdovers in the bureaucracies which
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:09.400]  are out to get trump that's not the deep state at all the deep state is a long centuries
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:16.240]  old conspiracy of power which is satanic base revelatory base that's why it keeps going
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:22.080]  generation after generation it isn't one person that runs it when brzezinski dies there's
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:27.320]  kissinger and when kissinger dies there's going to be somebody else it's a spirit it's empowered
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.360]  by a spirit of wanting to hurt people and as you've said this for years you're absolutely
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.920]  right look at how the coat brothers are now against trump and again trump's not perfect
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:43.960]  but why do they hate him so much well it's hard to say you know I I was very cautiously
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.120]  optimistic when trump was was elected because of his powerful campaign positions I thought
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  boy if even half of those come through it's going to be a real win for us and unfortunately
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:01.400]  less than 10 percent have come true and the major compromises he made especially in foreign
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.440]  policy has been a real disaster the attacks on Syria the coming attack on Iran which is
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.760]  fully behind the complete compromising of the north korean vow to take care of this
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:20.920]  militarily or diplomatically that's just a major compromise so I'm really worried about
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:27.160]  donald trump his ability to follow through on things certainly that's the case but then
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:32.320]  why is he so in battle why are they so frothing and and and demonically energized to take
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.520]  him out because it has slowed down their agenda you know donald trump they convince him of
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.120]  one thing and the next day he turns around and they have to reconvince him in other words
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:47.920]  they never make they never get ahead with donald trump it's the same thing they can stop him
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.280]  from pursuing his agenda in favor of liberty and they do so but he keeps coming back around
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.720]  and tries again and they have to stop him again I mean this guy is not an insider he
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.720]  is a very much a flawed person he's got good instincts but his weaknesses can and his lack
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.960]  of a background his lack of understanding of the facts on how the deep state operates
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.040]  who's in the deep state what are the deep state operations like the supporting and the
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.000]  creation of isis and al-qaeda he knows nothing about those so when they give him these false
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.840]  excuses explaining away his instincts he doesn't have the wherewithal to counter those very
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.480]  sophisticated arguments let me ask you this I mean to distract off into trump with the
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.880]  and I know in force is important but they're using the crackdown on me as a precedent they're
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.640]  cracking down on so many people now ahead of the midterms what is congress going to
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.280]  do about this when you have top democrats murphy and others saying we're going to end
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.520]  the first amendment in official announcements I mean this is this is just crazy these statements
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:56.840]  senate democrats circulating plans for government take over the internet senator mark warner
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.560]  proposes into free speech I mean they're really doing this well they are and that's why it's
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.440]  important to really address the arguments that they're using I do so in this week's world
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.720]  affairs brief which people can get a free copy of by simply emailing me at editor at
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:18.440]  world affairs brief dot com my top story this week is about the vendetta against alex jones
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.520]  and why it's unjust first of all they're basing this on hate speech hate speech can never
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:30.760]  be a legal basis for anything because it's undefinable now you can get to a definable
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:35.840]  level when you talk about incitement to violence and we do that in our courts of law you can't
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  sit there and rally people to kill someone and get away with like the democrats do everywhere
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.040]  well that's right and they even talk about killing trump but the point is the normal person
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.340]  can't get away with that incitement of violence but you can't take hate hate speech is nothing
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:57.840]  more than strong criticism of another person now I know you have been critical of muslims
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:04.040]  I have been critical muslims you've been critical of I have been about blacks in the worth that
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:10.680]  work ethic or the unwed mother problem within that category we're doing that trying to help
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:15.400]  people not because we hate them well that's right and we're also doing it to be able
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:21.760]  to stop or counter the left or the mainstream media attempt to cover up the problems within
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:27.360]  the community I mean you played a I heard in fox news talking about the problem with
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.760]  black unemployment as if this is something that's systemic to the capitalist system
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:37.840]  but when you look at the problems within the black homes within the nation and the lack
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.160]  of work ethic and things and the unwed mother problem and the gang and the other things
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.760]  that hits the latinos well that's the basis which is a product of the great society which
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.320]  was a plan we'll be back with Joel scowls and about what could the big events be ahead

[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:40.480]  names for it but take the invasion of panama right after george herbert walker bush got
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.520]  into office and i'm not saying panaman dictator was a good guy but he wasn't paying his drug
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:52.000]  money into the cia anymore that's all come out in court now for six months before they
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.320]  invaded they dropped flashbangs they shot blank soft helicopters did landings until when
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:04.520]  they finally hit people just thought oh it's just more of the attack that's a tactic where
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.280]  you build up the attack until finally the real attack comes and you don't stand up against
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:14.000]  it there's different names for that they're trying to take our credit card processors
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.560]  they just took one they just took down one of our shopping carts they took us off credio
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:23.520]  after taking us off ad roll that advertises with google where we just sold water filters
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.080]  and air filters and supplements outside to fund this place that was four million dollars
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.680]  gross like two and a half million dollars money takes a lot of money to run this that
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:36.400]  was like all our extra money i had to really work hard to get that back to even keep going
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.160]  they just blew away credio it was at three million dollars already this year it was
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.520]  doing better than the last thing gone blown away they sought us out they said our general
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:53.160]  counsel says we can't work with you for hate as jose calzen just said that's a soviet globalist
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:00.320]  leftist think tank university term where they just say oh it's hate we just say that's hate
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.680]  they banned us all vimeo for saying that a islamic training camp got busted that reportedly
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.160]  allegedly was planning mass shootings at schools that was mainstream news they said you're
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.760]  gone for that they arrest you in europe if you talk about islamic terror so it's here
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.440]  folks and it's all being segwayed over and now u.s senators democrats are saying we're
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.640]  gonna follow e you rules and chinese systems and the chinese dictators when the wall street
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:31.200]  journal praising america going after fake news so we're here so this is the big attack
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:38.000]  in full wars we've confirmed has been artificially hit it is down right now even though we had
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.160]  systems in front of it that couldn't even do it it has to be internal this is what they
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:46.720]  said four months ago in bloomberg after i was already told this people internally at youtube
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.240]  put fake strikes on us and took us down they reversed it but they're so sick of rebellions
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:58.760]  inside google and apple google this year refused their their their people walked off a us engineering
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.440]  project refusing to work for the pentagon that's how activists they are google's taken
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:10.080]  christmas off their calendars along with apple so you have to understand that there are even
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.120]  so much chinese operatives as they just hate the country so we'll get jose calzans take
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:20.320]  on that but right now info wars dot com has been taken down oh it's a private company
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.640]  they can take you down no this is just so so they are exponentially i believe beta testing
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:30.440]  ahead of a big event civil unrest assassination of trump who knows what the false flag is
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.000]  a group of false flags attacks on the media attacks on apple google saying we sponsored
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.520]  it or something and i see that the crystal ball the kind of thing they would do politically
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:44.120]  and they don't want us there to counter it when they make that move show they they they
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:49.240]  were hitting us thousands of articles a day until we were number one on the app number
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:54.440]  one on everything it panicked them they kind of went quiet in the last few days and then
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:59.000]  now behind the scenes they're going after stuff it's clearly torches interference so
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.560]  so joe i got you on about china and you know about the midterms and what you think they
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.600]  may pull but i'm just kind of on us right now because i never really make a big deal
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:10.360]  about it now we're under attack and i've almost gotten kind of calm to it now like oh somebody's
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.560]  following me again oh the new york times is following me oh i'm being harassed oh you
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.680]  know they're threatening me again and i i'm kind of getting into this punch drunk situation
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.960]  and i know you're you know a veteran who dealt with stuff a lot more stressful you know the
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.760]  one i'm dealing with landing on aircraft carriers and rough seas but isn't there almost a problem
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.040]  where it's not like you're have courage it's that you've been doing it so long you're not
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.600]  even worried anymore and you lose that frostiness i mean you do you get what i'm trying to get
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:43.680]  out here well yes the good danger alex is that in the tension of the moment in the you're
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.560]  under attack there's no question about it on all sides the best strategy that you can
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:55.680]  react to is to come through with more calmness than you've ever had before so that when people
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.640]  come to you when a lot of people coming to see what's this alex jones all about you know
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:07.000]  they show the wild man video clips on on cnn but when people come to your show if you'll
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.760]  show increased calmness they'll say okay this is a false you know attack there's nothing
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.200]  about alex jones that i find objectionable and i realize it's hard during the heat of
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:23.200]  the attack to be calm but that's what i recommend in terms of a strategy to do more good than
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.640]  almost any other thing other than fighting back no i totally agree and the lord works
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.480]  in a serious way so my clowning sometimes out of context brought part of the audience
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.760]  and broke through but i think it's time to fully be serious and not joke around anymore
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.800]  i think that's good advice describe your calmness when the jet aircraft or the private plane
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:47.720]  you were flying failed and you survived that miracle crash landing well yeah when my engines
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.080]  you know didn't respond to the throttle i'll tell you the adrenaline starts going and you
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.600]  realized all right we got a problem because that back of that carrier deck is coming up
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:02.320]  in your face you know i was really shocked alex because it wasn't so much the technique
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.400]  of what to do with the airplane i could always pull the handle and eject at some point but
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.920]  my major concern on the aircraft carrier was where do i put this thing there are people
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.080]  on the deck that are scrambling and i'm gonna you know hit somebody now when my personal
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.760]  airplane crashed of course i thought that i made the landing i was avoiding the populated
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.080]  air i was heading for a field that just happened to be a fence post there that caught my landing
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:33.960]  gear and made the aircraft tumble and you know it was a severe crash it broke my two
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.640]  thousand pound test seat belt and i didn't go anywhere you think about that how do you
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:43.480]  break your seat belt and not go flying out so i think there was a little bit of miraculous
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:50.960]  help there but you know you you train you train so that you are calm relatively calm
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.000]  in the situation you know your procedures you watch your airspeed you make sure you
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.600]  don't stall and spin that's how most people die in an airplane crash they keep trying
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.640]  to extend the glide until they stall and spin and they fall out of the air and kill themselves
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.320]  if you come in under control still flying unless you're heading for a pack of trees
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.160]  you're gonna generally survive you may have some injuries but you're gonna survive well
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.080]  they said that was amazing that you lived through that you said that powerful seat belt
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:25.240]  broke but you had a little scratch on your head mike walked off from it yeah i had the
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.920]  whole airplane cracked open i was sitting on the wing i just stepped off onto the grass
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:35.480]  and i was fine it was truly miraculous and and like what did you just zin out at that
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.640]  moment i mean i mean go back describing it just suddenly there was no power and what
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:45.520]  happened well it turned out that the the fuel line had become clogged there was no way that
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:49.200]  i could get any power from the airplane and i was only a quarter mile from the runway
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:53.240]  and i realized i was not going to be able to glide to the runway and so i had to turn
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.560]  onto the non-populated area to avoid crashing into buildings this was very near a very populated
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.960]  area so well Nigel Farage that even the french police and others confirmed they were sabotaging
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.280]  his cars cutting brake lines unbolting the bolts on it happened at least three times
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.480]  he didn't want to get into it but i thought people that know him well and they said that
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.520]  they think there was some sabotage with with with the aircraft that they ended up later
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.440]  from the injuries killing the pilot took him a few years to die Farage walked off his face
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.440]  all smashed but do you ever wonder if they somebody put something in your fuel well we
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:28.880]  were able to pull the fuel filter apart afterwards and found fiberglass particles in it which
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.160]  in a in an experimental aircraft when they build a tank out of fiberglass some of that
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.480]  fiberglass over time is going to slough off and that did apparently there's no way that
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:44.080]  that would be an appropriate way to to sabotage because the it's a natural occurring thing
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.640]  that actually pertain to the airplane so i think it was a fault of whoever built the
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:55.520]  airplane i agree so they should go to metal aluminum gas tanks right well not necessarily
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.080]  i mean there's something to be said for composite construction you just have to flush the things
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.920]  out really good to make sure that all that excess fiberglass gets out before you start
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:10.680]  flying what are you flying now well i'm flying a certified aircraft of mooney turbocharged
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:17.400]  mooney aircraft and they're not without their problems too but so you really have to be
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:22.520]  careful i do a very thorough check of the airplane but that's my dad's favorite small plane he's
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:28.200]  a pilot is the mooney yeah it's a very very good cross country airplane but you know getting
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.640]  back to the world situation now we'll come back to the world situation we'll do it right

[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:14.480]  american revolution you're listening to the alex jones show live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:21.880]  worldwide it's alex jones okay so info wars dot com has been attacked it's been turned
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.680]  off it looks like there's d-dots attacks going on but we have stuff that blocks that it's
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.440]  some type of internal sabotage somewhere not here but within the different systems out
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.600]  there and that's this new trend of the people in the technology companies are mainly left
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.760]  us now and they just like reality winner they just do whatever they want joel scalzen editor
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:44.600]  in chief at worldoffirstbrief.com is our guest talk about bizarre breaking news they spent
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:53.960]  ten plus days in the prosecution against manifold the defense spent less than one day today
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:58.480]  this is just insane and we've got all this other stuff happening joel just quantifying
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.520]  all of this your smart guy where do you think we are currently ahead of the midterms the
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.360]  big ramp up of calls for violence crazies by the left at a gut level of geopolitical level
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:15.840]  what do you expect to happen frankly alex almost nothing before the midterms the democrats
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:23.480]  have a real problem if they unleash antifa in a series of riots and really social unrest
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:29.280]  as people have been predicting it's going to accrue to republicans favor and you know
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:35.200]  there is this radical portion of the democrats the democrats in the middle really are at
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:39.560]  a loss because you know hillary clinton is the one they're secretly planning on trying
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:45.680]  to run again and if the radical left portion that has ruined that for it could be a real
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.880]  problem i do think before the next election for donald trump directly there's going to
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:54.640]  be a they'll pull the plug a little bit on the stock market so you get a 20 or 30 percent
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:49:00.400]  reduction it'll cause pension companies to go out of business donald trump will get the
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:06.080]  blame for that they're going to try to deny him the success of the economy issue in this
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:12.760]  next election but in the midterms almost nothing that they can do is going to favor
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.360]  the democrats it's a good any crisis at all is going to make it is going to be easily
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:23.400]  blamed on the democrats i think this campaign frankly against you alex is backfiring on
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.560]  them i think people can see the unjust they can see it's one sided even people on the
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.000]  left are coming to your defense on the issue of free speech and so no i agree but here's
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.480]  the problem instead of just the platforming off all the big places where i can reach
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:41.440]  people which is what they wanted now they're going after the payment processors are shutting
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.200]  the website down and i agree it's it's it's crazy and not within why are they doing it
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:54.080]  because they're only they're only moving forward well you know these are control freaks a lot
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.720]  of people and some of these people only know how to attack in in a frontal way and until
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.920]  it backfires on them now to be frank they've tried more subtle ways before you know as
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:09.920]  they started to censor youtube they started to catch your advertisers on youtube but that
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.000]  didn't work and so they're having to take strong strong action now you know this whole
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.920]  issue about we're a private company so we can do anything you know that's a hypocritical
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.880]  legal position how many times has the left told us after civil rights legislation that
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.880]  if you are a company open to the public you can no longer discriminate you are not private
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:36.000]  anymore you are a public company and yet they're hiding behind the privacy issue or the public
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.680]  the private company issue and that's why they're not saying we're discriminating against
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.960]  all that show and we're discriminating against because they're calling it racist they're calling
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:50.440]  it hatred and these things are untrue they're unprovable legally and that's why we have
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:57.000]  to fight against those I think that the if Trump as a president were on the ball he would
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  go to his FCC and other people and say all right we need a rule that basically prohibits
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  people from using you know non-judicial legal terms like hate speech in order to ban things
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.480]  we've got to protect free speech by making sure they cannot use these I am most disappointed
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:20.240]  by what Trump and his Justice Department under Jeff Sessions has not done to protect us has
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.960]  not done to uncover and and root out the deep state I think they've probably got something
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:32.000]  on Jeff Sessions and that's why he's acting as a feckless attorney generally simply is
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:41.240]  not going to bat for Donald Trump or Liberty or anything else my horse my horse my kingdom
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:45.120]  for a horse we got one tweet out that info wars is down but had a link in it go to info
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:54.800]  wars.com no go to news wars.com go to prisonplanet.com you can't go to info wars.com I meant to go
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:59.760]  off air and just deal with this actually because it's a big deal but there's this psychology
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.440]  that we're not a big deal which is fine but you know it's it's it's it's just that the
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.960]  boldness and the craziness and the things they're doing it is true we're exposing their
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.560]  agenda and and I know you say there's three major power predatory centers and I agree
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.400]  there's rips competing but more and more our elite have sold out to China they base things
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:24.760]  in China China's double crossing the globalist more and more but the word is what we see
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:30.600]  is my criticism of Apple and Google living to China helping them censor is that China's
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:35.840]  really exerting through Hollywood and everything it's it's it's powers I see the Pentagon and
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:40.320]  others pushing back against that but it looks to me like right now that with everything
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:45.280]  China has been given the rare earth minerals the Panama Canal shooting at US ships this
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.760]  week it just seems like China is the big issue and I certainly know that that's one reason
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:55.760]  they're mad at me Joel Scousen is that I keep pointing out Russia Russia I'm not saying
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.520]  Russia is our buddy or anything but China it is really what in my own life I've experienced
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:07.760]  that is in my business but China is the biggest threat to world peace ever and and will continue
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:13.120]  to be so as I've said before I think Russia is a predator state and they're intending
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.240]  to join with China in attacking the Western I think Russia is going down in the next war
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:21.920]  and China is going to be the new enemy completely but you've got to remember there's a difference
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:27.480]  between assisting and building an enemy and actually getting in bed with them or letting
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:33.960]  China control a lot of people have falsely hypothesized that for example Israel and Assad
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:39.360]  controls the new world order and I don't think so I think they're part of the new world order
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.760]  but they're not the controllers the new world order the globalist are bigger than Israel
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:50.280]  but the new world order has been continually building and protecting China this is part
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:56.600]  of the strategy of building an enemy to facilitate a future war which will allow a sufficient
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:01.000]  amount of destruction of our military forces for the US government to talk us into joining
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.480]  a militarized global government that's where we're headed now that's why I mean for example
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.560]  if they really wanted to stop China and its influence in the United States it passes simple
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:16.040]  law you have to be an American city to own property or invest in a company in the United
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:21.920]  States of America you have to be a citizen that would prohibit all of this Chinese influence
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:26.280]  but they want the influence not because the Chinese control the globalist they are two
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:32.320]  separate powers but they're continuing to build the best enemy that money can buy and
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.360]  China is a real growing threat militarily I'm doing an article for next week's World
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:44.760]  Affairs Briefs on the China finely reaching and international naval status and Russian
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.160]  and Chinese ships are plying the Atlantic they used to stay clear of the Atlantic they
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.920]  had only enough ships to handle the Pacific and now they're in the Atlantic Russian submarines
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:59.720]  are spending an inordinate amount of time tracking over US internet cables attached
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.320]  the United States to Europe and Asia and I know they're tracking those because they
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.160]  plan on in addicting those cables you're going to lose the internet someday during when
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:14.880]  this war comes I think they're trying to take us down to set the
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.760]  precedent take others down and also the EU is finding Google and others for not being
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.160]  under their hate speech laws and as you said that's all just made up communist garbage
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:27.320]  America and the Congress everybody has to stand up to this and Trump's biggest failing
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.680]  right now I think he's not doing something about this and not taking action.
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:37.840]  That's right Alex where is the leadership in Congress in the presidency in the Department
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.400]  of Justice I mean there's very clear ways that you can attack these problems you can
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:49.040]  defend free speech you can make sure that these companies are declared a public companies
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:53.960]  and I'm not against private property in this regard I'm just quoting the left who says
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:59.280]  once you're in the public domain and you're open to the public you cannot discriminate
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.680]  and I think we need an anti-discrimination law in terms of political free speech that
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.800]  you cannot discriminate and unless it reaches the level of incitement to violence and that
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:11.480]  can be very specifically defined in law.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:16.240]  A quick law on that would stop Google it would stop any of these companies from banning
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.000]  you immediately over this and you could take them to court based upon the law but there
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.080]  is no one in our movement there's no one in Congress no one in the presidency who is
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:33.800]  even hypothesizing about it we're simply reacting to the left's use of their tyrannical powers
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.320]  with the media and the courts to do this and the courts would be in a tough situation if
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:45.160]  we had such a law that protected directly free speech against these terms like hate speech.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.680]  So most of the public's in a trance they've literally been mesmerized by television and
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.280]  the culture it's gotten really sick we're going to do five more minutes with Joe Scalzen

[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:51.920]  six worldwide
[01:59:51.920 --> 02:00:02.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:27.120]  you know Joel Scousen says I should be calm and I'm not even mad they're trying to shut
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:32.080]  us down I expected all this it's that I get frustrated that I can't fight them harder
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.360]  and I'm like a race car engine kind of blowing up so I appreciate the great crew the listeners
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.640]  and all the support and you guys are great I'm here talking to some of the crew all right
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:46.720]  we're back live here Joel Scousen and the five minutes we have left just other points
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:51.960]  you want to add I'm just trying to probe because I know info wars is important and we have
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:55.240]  a lot of great guests and a lot of great info we reach five plus billion people on YouTube
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:58.480]  at the time they shut us down everywhere else and we're on a lot of radio stations and TV
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.040]  stations but like you said the vendetta the foaming at the mouth the obsession when I
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:08.000]  was in court last week when they were trying to take my kids away from me again using lies
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.560]  in the media they marched in journalism classes New York Times reporters others and they all
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:20.200]  looked at me like I was worse than Charlie Manson but it was beyond a look of hate it
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:26.600]  was like a look of lust I couldn't he was like and I had John Ronson here last year
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.360]  who I'd done for like 20 years and I've turned around he was looking at me going and it's
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.880]  like it's this Trump derangement syndrome like where the darker demons released by the
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:42.840]  media saying it's okay to hate because because these people have gone into like this totally
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:49.760]  crazed mode and I don't understand where the hate comes from well oftentimes like suicide
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:55.120]  hate comes from people getting infected with letting Satan into their brain and you know
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:59.520]  a lot of people don't understand that it comes in your own grammar it sounds like you talking
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:05.240]  to yourself but those deep hateful angry voices really are the dark side of the spiritual
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:09.040]  spectrum trying to influence people and they don't realize that they're being influenced
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:14.280]  they think that they're legitimately angry and of course they lead themselves over time
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:20.920]  up to receiving those type of feeling comfortable with them but Satan is a very real part of
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:26.120]  our society here and I think it's important that people realize that that this is not
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:33.720]  just you know normal behavior we've got three minutes left other key points go scousin about
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.120]  things happening in the country in the world but I agree with you whenever I may have anxiety
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.480]  or I'm angry at somebody but just think about Christ my children being good and just think
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.480]  about being peaceful which I am when I'm not on air that other than I just have great peace
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:53.000]  and can go back to sleep you know like late at night so the things that I'm really concerned
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.680]  about is one not the midterm election so much I don't think the Democrats are going to take
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.600]  the majorities in the house they may well take the Senate that's a fairly easy one to
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.680]  do with the small margin that we have there but I don't think they're going to take the
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:12.920]  house so it's going to be a split you know Congress usually really won't change the dynamics
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:19.760]  anymore of Trump's difficulty in passing anything he can't pass anything past the liberal Republicans
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:23.680]  which block his every move anyway and vote for the Democrats so we really don't have
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:28.160]  a majority of Republicans that are backing the president in Congress I don't think that's
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:33.040]  going to change significantly what's really going to change those we're going to see
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:39.120]  this attack on Iran happen we're going to see North Korea get away with continuing to develop
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:46.040]  nuclear weapons because Donald Trump has completely defaulted on his pledge not to let this happen
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:50.400]  and I'm very very disturbed about Donald Trump for doing this I'd like to be in the White
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.240]  House to hear what they're telling him to keep him from going back to the military option
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.600]  it may be that he has been succumbed to the promise of a Nobel Peace Prize which they're
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.880]  never going to give him but you know they certainly laid that out there to get him
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.640]  onto the peace bandwagon completely but why he doesn't get upset and say all right you
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.440]  played me for a fool long enough I mean look at Pompeo this week going to North Korea and
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:21.000]  say just give us 60% of your nuclear weapons well you don't even know what 100% is so how
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.240]  can you talk about 60 70% you haven't even got an inventory for North Korea about what
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.760]  kind of nuclear weapons and you couldn't believe it even if they gave it to you have to have
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:34.920]  international inspectors on the ground as I've said in the world affairs brief many

[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.120]  DDoS attacks but I didn't take it down that's been going on for a week and a half since
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:31.360]  Tim Cook announced according to the New York Times that they were taking us off and then
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:35.040]  they talked to Zuckerberg as the Sunday night meetings with all the other big tech heads
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:41.120]  they admit the collusion and then 20 plus groups do it and then we got a top fortune
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:45.600]  20 company I'm not gonna name the does software and infrastructure says you're kicked off
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:51.040]  our platform and then we send emails to top going my god that's torches interference we
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.960]  have a contract they're like we've been using it for years they go actually that's incorrect
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:59.960]  someone else was mistaken you're still with us so we're dealing with just insane levels
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:04.880]  of just mutinous crazed behavior and Joe Scalzen was getting into that I want him to finish
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:10.080]  up with North Korea and what he thinks Trump should do in an encapsulated piece about how
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.800]  he thinks he's been shut up and I agree as much we want peace and things this is starting
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:20.600]  to go sideways and the left's gonna love that obviously China's weighed in and put their
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.840]  pressure on I want to finish up with China as well but but Joe just briefly on this info
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:34.160]  wars.com being being banned and this sabotage and the craziness I agree it's backfiring
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:39.360]  on him but as you said earlier they're not stopping it's just power madness that they
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:44.360]  think they're in control but why would Tim Cook brag through his surrogate you know official
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.240]  Apple news that he made the decision to take me down and then I went and looked it up he
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:51.840]  was on a year and a half ago Matt Hillary lost saying oh don't worry we'll deal with
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:56.640]  fake news he came up with the idea everybody put these notices up over news first that
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:00.960]  it wasn't real run by Snopes and the Southern primary law center and now he's appearing
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:05.480]  to be a prime mover I find it very interesting when he's moved Apple to China it's become
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:10.160]  tax exempt he put the iCloud codes with the government and said oh in China when you move
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:13.640]  here the government's part of your company that I mean they're hiding that in plain view
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:17.120]  I think it's I mean I think it's outrageous to have a guy that runs some of the worst
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:22.000]  factories in the world with suicide nets and everything moralizing how I need to be banned
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.920]  and then everyone else just like Domino's goes yes sir Mr. Cook and falls into line it
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:33.040]  shows the monopoly power of Google Apple and of course Facebook working in unison it's
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:38.760]  it's classic trust behavior classic monopoly isn't it well the thing you have to ask yourself
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:45.880]  is how do these people get from normal liberal techie type people to globalists there was
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.720]  a process that happened over the past decade and I can tell you if you knew what went on
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.360]  in the belly you'd find there were some very private phone calls remember every one of
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:01.200]  these tech companies had some government seed money from CIA and other dark places to help
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.600]  them out at the beginning and at some point etc. I think they've got threatened they basically
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:11.800]  said now look you know we can take you down just like they're doing to you now Alex we
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:17.080]  can take you down anytime we want so if you want to progress whether it's Amazon whether
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:22.920]  it's Google whether it's Facebook or Twitter etc. you've got to you know come on to the
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.600]  control system to the system which is you know going towards this new glorious new world
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.920]  order they got converted at some point to globalism it isn't that Tim Cook is pro-Chinese
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:38.320]  and he's a globalist Eric no I agree well I mean we're marrying into this global thing
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.160]  it doesn't mean we're Chinese run it means we're merging and their values of oppression
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:46.920]  are now coming here so let me ask you this last question we'll get into North Korea.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.200]  Why would Jack Dorsey you know I know people with that dinner with him multiple folks they're
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:54.760]  like no no Dorsey's scared he doesn't like it he's a liberal but he thinks once this
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:58.640]  starts it will shut everything down but he's been banning some conservatives but then when
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.640]  they all did this Jack Dorsey came out and said no we're not then CNN said well look
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:07.520]  at these tweets we think are wrong which really we're out of context they just Twitter just
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.600]  told us please delete these we did it just to see what would happen but but then I know
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.400]  for a fact I'm going to leave it this Twitter then opened up some channels with messages
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:19.920]  to me I don't know if I'm being suckered or what but why do you think Jack Dorsey's
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:26.480]  doing that I don't know you know it appeared when he put your tweets under review the
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:30.800]  very next day after he made that strong stand in support that I'm not going to ban it indicate
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:34.320]  that he was under tremendous pressure and he said all right we're going to put them
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.760]  through a review process and that's why you got the messages of those to delete he had
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:43.840]  to give them something but apparently he isn't a globalist I mean if he were globalist he'd
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:51.600]  be you know saying yes to them so they haven't got him converted yet in my opinion but I almost
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.280]  don't even want to tell the truth about that though we always tell the truth it's like
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.680]  we have this almost like a problem being honest about everything we say these we probably
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.600]  shouldn't say it's not lying to not say something you know but I just still have to almost
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:05.040]  board everything out unless it's in total confidence but but but yeah that's basically
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:08.880]  what I've heard and I almost don't want to say that Jack Dorsey might be a good guy
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:15.720]  because now they'll pile on him even more Joe yeah they will you know this isn't over
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:21.560]  I mean look what happened to the Verizon chief when he bucked government spying wasn't going
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:27.280]  to do it they literally took this guy down so his name his days are numbered these guys
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:31.720]  are very very powerful anyway you know this is one of the things I've covered in this week's
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.640]  World Affairs brief that people really need to get read is this whole thing about taking
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:40.840]  down the deep state in the swamp they are so much more powerful than we think than Donald
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:45.400]  Trump thinks anybody thinks they're going to take down the deep state which runs every
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.680]  single federal law enforcement at least the dark side of those law enforcement agencies
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:55.440]  the judicial department the 75 percent of Congress they are just kidding themselves
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.440]  that they're believing this guy called Q who I'm convinced is on this deep state he's
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:07.400]  a guy that says trust Miller trust trust this trust the attorney general what a joke Q's
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:13.080]  been absolutely wrong no that's absolutely right but it's amazing the following he's
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.080]  got I mean they got t-shirt factories pumping out that means there's big money they got
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:23.000]  a Hollywood producer to put out a video anonymously on Q and how wonderful this was that he's
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:28.680]  going to take down the deep swan look why don't they put their name to it what's illegal
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.600]  what's dangerous about this video nothing you don't put your name to it because this
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.840]  is deep state and I agree we're almost out of time finish up with North Korea just just
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:41.920]  recap because we all want to deal to happen but then Trump brought him to the verge but
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.680]  then I saw North Korea run up there meet with China I thought oh boy that's right they got
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:51.360]  there marching as Donald Trump could be played and they did play him I mean Donald Trump got
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:54.960]  on an ego trip after that Singapore meeting and said he's promised me everything in the
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.360]  world and the nuclear threat is over and now it clearly isn't he's still building Donald
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:05.600]  Trump needs to do this you got two weeks Kim to let international and US inspector
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  and take possession of all your nuclear facilities and weapons or we go back to the military
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:16.560]  option and that doesn't mean an immediate attack it just means we're going to take care
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:19.800]  of this militarily it doesn't mean we're going to attack him he's tighten the nose again
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:25.000]  start the drills again and move the forces into place yeah but you really do need to
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.120]  take out his military so he's no longer a threat to North Korea and that would take
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:32.560]  out the trigger event for World War three North Korea has been preserved for decades
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:39.160]  as the trigger event and by allowing Kim to get away with postponing any disarmament indefinitely
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:44.080]  which is basically what is doing Trump is allowing Trump is allowing that trigger event
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:48.520]  to be going into the next decade when the Russian Center will be ready no I agree that's
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.040]  why it's critical to fix this but if you look at Kim he looked totally freaked out out of
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.640]  his mind the meetings the word is it some of those generals really run things but he's
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.760]  got some control I mean isn't it that those generals are really chai-kong officers anyways
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.280]  absolutely they're working for China and Kim really does not run the country they want
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.280]  the appearance of a crazy man so that when the war starts Russian China can have plausible
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:15.000]  deniabilities that crazy man who started the war wasn't us but they are going to be ready
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.360]  to back it up so Kim probably does want peace when Trump hears that from Dennis Rodman the
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.800]  problem is he's not running the show that's exactly right he doesn't know what the long
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.360]  term game plan notice Kim writes nice letters is a good cop bad cop but the generals say
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:38.840]  another thing yeah and so this is I'm just afraid this is not gonna go well Donald Trump
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:44.120]  has completely given up the military option I don't think he will go back to it and so
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:49.160]  I think Kim is building nuclear weapons as we speak and developing more rocket technology
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:53.440]  as is indicated by the US government satellite photos about exactly but Trump went with the
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.160]  angle that he thought no one really tried to do they taunt and try a peace deal he did
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:00.840]  offer him everything and if they reject it that's their problem now at least we've taken
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:05.000]  the high road though but so now we have to I agree come in with strength now that they're
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.280]  starting to back off yeah and Tom shows no indication of going back to strength all right

[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:49.240]  of the moral vision and he says ban info wars a week and a half ago and then like dominoes
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:52.680]  it happens and now they're doing to all these other conservatives and all these other christians
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:22:01.280]  and all these other nationalists and there's congress is asleep at the switch where one
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:06.440]  of those little clown hats with a propeller on the top just having no idea what planet
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:12.720]  they're on prompts distracted with a moroso and all her edited audio and all that crap
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:20.640]  that this is how the country dies in the deep state globalist multinationals eugenicist
[02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:27.080]  control freaks their ally with china they're screwing the country over and they think it's
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:32.120]  funny they think you're stupid and they do everything they can to make you stupid so
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:35.560]  they can be a self-fulfilling prophecy and then you look at these globalists all almost
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:39.520]  none of them have children they're all very unhappy themselves it's just like but they
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:46.960]  wanted power so they're in charge and they're just this is totally unamerican to have cnn
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:52.280]  all over the news saying he's got the number one apps info wars official take it down people
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:23:00.520]  aren't like whoa you people are scum I mean folks are but it's just the outrageousness
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:05.480]  of how they like an abused woman the guys abuse them so long they're just used to it it's
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:09.560]  like you know he's got a tire now now beating her in the head it's like they let and if
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:14.760]  a beat up whoever they want even beat up NBC and CNN reporters and yet people like Cuomo
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:19.600]  saying it's okay it's good or ignoring it I mean these people are a bunch of yes man
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:24.360]  and so now the big tech companies that were born in this country are in China because that's
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:29.320]  the globalist model of authoritarianism and it's coming here and we're the one ringing
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:35.120]  the alarm bells so we've got to be shut down because we would dare to talk about it there's
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:41.240]  a must-see article at info wars dot com that I'm going to read and then I'm going to go
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:45.760]  to your calls Paul Watson's coming up he's got his guest on you know most people on their
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:49.600]  websites taken down they're being shut down would cancel the guest but the guest you know
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:52.760]  is in the social media and stuff and that's great so maybe we'll spend a little bit of
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:59.080]  time on info wars being shut down but my whole deal is would people notice if we completely
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:04.920]  shut down because you know once we go down everything goes down and they've said that
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.040]  and they're the globalists and the chai comms and Soros admit they're making their move
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:11.600]  in Hillary you wanted somebody to fight him you wanted somebody to stand up to him you
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:15.320]  wanted somebody to take action you want us and then we started having victory everybody's
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:24.240]  kind of like it's a video game or a TV show it's not and I look at the satanic hatred
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:32.080]  that mainstream media has for me and they're all pathetic losers and they just want slavery
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:40.200]  so there's info wars dot com before I hit refresh on it earlier I wonder why this doesn't work
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:50.280]  not it matter I was anything to work here I'll just do this that'll fix that mouse thing
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:55.080]  hardly works at the time anyways so that's where we are as a country it's where we are
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:00.880]  as a nation where we are as a world and I guess they've got a splash page up that looks
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:05.480]  pretty cool come for that quick info wars is under attack please visit our other channels
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:12.400]  now news wars dot com info or store present planet dot com and twitter and of course they're
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:20.200]  hitting and all of those you know they see it as our extermination our annihilation
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:27.440]  is the answer to everything and they'll be this beautiful wonderful world once you shut
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.800]  it down we might want to get somebody to write an article for info wars dot com about for
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:38.280]  about an hour and 30 minutes we've been down there's a prison planet dot com we just might
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:43.880]  I run a news organization everybody's great we just might want to get a video out that
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:50.960]  we're down just just made something like that but you know they had the big giant ongoing
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:58.600]  attack last week and now they're doing it everybody else and now they want the site
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.280]  shut down themselves because congress and the president didn't respond to the payment
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:10.000]  processors and the emails and the facebook and the google and the youtube and the apple
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:17.240]  and the stitcher and the spotify and the everything else so why not america is asleep america
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:22.760]  wants to get gang raped america wants to get pushed over america wants to get dominated
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.320]  that's the big green light the deep state then the eugenicists that funded hitler and
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:38.640]  then created china that's where they are that's what they want that's what they're doing because
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.760]  we've been raised to be set in front of a television we've been raised to be spectators
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:49.360]  so those people people are not wimps somebody walks over and watches them in the face they
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:55.600]  just sit there because they think this is a video game they think it's funny tim cook
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.480]  plants us around and you know says i'm a gay rights guy and then you know loves china you
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:03.760]  know killing gays and said damn worried about it that's the worst horrible demonic factories
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.440]  even the chai com say pay us two dollars more a day and they could have houses and he goes
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:13.480]  fm but he's tim cook because the media said he was this big liberal he was this big god
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:24.880]  like zuckerberg an internal email saying f everybody f u f my users that trust me it's
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:31.320]  unconsciousness it's the culture of tv heads it's the culture of video game heads it's
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:39.040]  the culture everybody's like the chinese aren't like that islamists aren't like that they're

[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:28.960]  and google and facebook have been an internet monopoly and we're all close to imploding
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:33.040]  you know show we have to grovel to the system this is basically what's going on hoping they
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:39.280]  buy us up and just watching a nation of cowards and scum in corporate america who don't care
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:46.720]  about their birthright the first amendment nothing and the chinese communists all over
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:52.480]  the news controlling hollywood controlling what's happening there is a article that is
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:57.120]  in the washington times today by a national security expert that works for fox news and
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:04.840]  he's a special operations veteran and graduate of the air force academy i want to get him
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:11.520]  on the show l todd wood and he talks about how china is the threat and how hollywood's
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:16.840]  run by it and the telecoms and the media and how google this year walked off a defense department
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:24.320]  project because their engineers said we will not work for america we hate you and so many
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.000]  of their operatives are either chinese communists or they're in league with it the globalists

[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:06.440]  to run back end stuff for inventory that's the espionage level we're at and it shows
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:11.160]  the democrats will go to any lengths because they've been trained to hate america in college
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.720]  and they've been trained to hate america by hollywood and china owns it now and every
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.240]  netflix show that's political is pro-communist china anti america it's just everywhere and

[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:35.760]  week and send a strong message that you know what's going on and you know what's unfolding
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:40.720]  and you're upset and you're going to take action and call congress and call the white
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:47.040]  house and call talk radio and say we're losing our first amendment now info wars is the first
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:52.680]  domino they're already banning everybody from laura loomer to gabham againis and everybody
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:57.800]  else that stand up for this country and against the antifa thugs that are attacking men women
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:02.960]  and children and against the globalist and against abc got caught doing fake stuff with
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:07.800]  actors where a guy in a maga hat goes over and is mean to other people and tries to throw
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:16.440]  him out of a restaurant when it's the democrats acting like that these people are out of control
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.200]  they're willing to do anything and they've taken our acquiescence and they've taken our
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:25.160]  kindnesses weakness and now they're going for broke and i'll add this again while it's
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:34.080]  still up infowarstore.com while they haven't taken all our payment processes away people
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:39.440]  need to vote with their dollars and let me know the a you want great products but b you're
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.000]  going to support the info war into the future because this is when we need your support
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.440]  this is when we need to help the other times i'm up here like i expect to be attacked we're
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:51.360]  moving forward blah blah this is the main test right now and i expected to get even
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.480]  worse in the next few weeks they want to break our will i've got to cool off and be calm
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:59.280]  like jill scousers said earlier and not get too angry about what they're doing and trying
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:04.040]  to fight them because i'm not depressed it's the opposite i am on fire wanting to fight
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:10.120]  going to be politically active and involved and win but as sure as the sun came up they're
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:13.160]  calling for violence and they're getting ready to stage violence against themselves to blame
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:17.760]  info wars and trump and i believe that's what this is is preparation for a false fly against
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:25.240]  a big tech giant or cnn that they will stage or their surrogates will stage then be blamed
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:28.840]  on us and that's why this is so critical in such an emergency because they wouldn't be
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:32.840]  doing this if they weren't planning something big going to the midterm so now is the time
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:37.880]  of maximum vigilance on the streets calling to talk radio speaking at city council about
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:42.080]  this where there's a buzz so big that we let the democrats know you're carrying out a criminal
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:45.760]  deal with the chai comms you think you're gonna be there's an american awakening you're
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:50.160]  gonna snuff it out and bring in civil war and civil unrest and shut us all down it ain't
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:56.040]  happening in every city council in every globalist organization in every newspaper politely and
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.360]  nicely needs to be let known we know you guys are having your antifa meetings we know you're
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:06.040]  organizing this crap and we see through you so we've got why should i even free shipping
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:10.200]  the best products everything right now we barely make money on a lot of these products we sell
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:14.200]  them so low so we can be competitive in the market but i need people to understand fund
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:20.000]  us to fight the bullies to save the internet to save info wars it's still standing right
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.920]  now even though they're all over it filing fake complaints on us saying we've held child

[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.400]  we're dealing with we don't know how to respond to this this is violating campaign finance

[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:47.880]  we don't wake up and take action i'm alex jones and i won't back down i won't get into these
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:52.600]  dirents and i'm counting on you to do the same but now is the time to raise the alarm
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:59.960]  against this takeover all right julie michael duke mark erin fernando stefan kevin carter
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:07.240]  john lily matthew we'll start taking your phone calls here this is up first let's go
[02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:12.040]  to julie and canada julie thanks for holding her on the air go ahead alex thanks for taking
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:17.360]  our call my husband and i watch your show every day we love it and i just wanted to say that
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:23.880]  your super blue toothpaste is a fantastic product i recommended highly to everybody and i just
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:30.400]  wanted to mention that what happens in the states happens in canada and we're very very
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:36.520]  concerned that trump's they might not get elected if he doesn't deal with this issue
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:41.000]  this is affecting a lot of people i don't know what you think about i totally agree this
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.520]  is the issue this is the end of the first amendment it's more important than the second
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:49.160]  because it's absolutely critical and we can't speak out for the second amendment or the
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:53.240]  fourth and then it's all gone julie and you're absolutely right and trump is dropping the
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:50:01.640]  ball because he's always distracted with amaroza and you know all this other crud but somebody's
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:06.380]  got to be able to get a hold of him and talk to him i don't know i got him info three
[02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:10.120]  weeks ago and then all hell broke loose that's another reason they're after me they know
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:15.280]  we're getting stuck to trump and i'm trying in between trying to keep us on air to get
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:19.320]  a report up of the examples and what should be done and some of my connections the white
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:24.240]  house just went cold i mean it's it's this is some they're making their move god bless
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:29.080]  you julie we love you yeah canada is under a lot of draconian censorship now where we
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:32.120]  read bible verses you get arrested i mean they're taking mother and father out of the
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:39.160]  national anthem it's incredible let's take a call from michael in the netherlands over

[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:02.920]  on for about a year and a half because i'm pro trump he won't come on uh and then wiki leaks
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:06.600]  has their own thing they've defended us but they're mainly mainline leftist but but they're
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:10.360]  actually real liberals so they're good people it's just that they're scared of the propaganda
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:14.680]  about me the straw men's they don't come on and then mark dies does come on he's a one man show
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:19.400]  and he needs a lot more help he's very talented and i've tried to hire mark dies but he's kind
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:25.240]  of you know likes where he is in san diego so there's your answer okay but but it's about it's
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:32.680]  about the the mainstream media who is attacking now info wars so i thought when you're both together
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:37.960]  fight do it no i totally agree and we need all these other hosts who i have on the naked sensor
[02:51:37.960 --> 02:51:41.400]  when they took mark dies's youtube channel away years ago i rallied for him and helped him get
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:45.640]  it back and mark's been helping us but just yes if they can get me they can get everybody god bless

[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:21.000]  uh webcast feed the media could not be loaded either because the server or network failed
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:25.320]  or because the format is not supported wait a minute so what i've been told by it is even though
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:29.400]  info wars is down our streams are still going out you're telling me you want an apple platform

[02:52:54.440 --> 02:53:01.080]  they're hitting us in the servers themselves well the store may also be compromised i just placed
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:07.640]  in order today uh because one of the only things i knew to do was to to fight even harder was to
[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:14.360]  contribute to info wars dot com i pledged an auto shipment every 30 days in the amount of
[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:20.520]  101 dollars in honor of the 101st airborne division that i served with in combat twice
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:26.520]  in afghanistan and iraq and i wanted to let everybody know out there now is the time we
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:33.400]  need to stand up we need to speak out we need to get the word out alex jones info wars the first
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:41.400]  domino in this war the fire is burning and i've got a message for the globalist we'll never give up
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:47.560]  we'll stay till the fight's won gi joe is there because alex jones is a real american hero the
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:55.640]  cobra believes i will beat you will be defeated china and kim cook and zuckerberg will defeat you
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:54:02.520]  god bless having some fun there seriously the store is all secured super high quality and has
[02:54:02.520 --> 02:54:07.160]  all this all this all the certificates and things it's they're trying to take the payment processors
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:11.640]  where the companies won't then process your order so get your orders in while you can i mean
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:16.840]  they did this the nra a year ago and then six months ago and an nra had to sue and file injunctions
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:22.360]  for a couple days you know nra could not take your orders for a t-shirt or a membership remember that
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:27.640]  and they were doing it to like cabela's and stuff so i mean they're moving against everybody
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:32.680]  folks this is them telling you you can't commerce you can't talk to who you want so
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:38.280]  i'll tell you bottom line i just want to win this war and i want to see big dollar signs in
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:43.480]  four store because you know we've been kind of in the red the last six months with all the censorship
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:48.280]  and stuff but i'd i'd save money to pay for things so but now it's like the lawsuits and all of it
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:53.240]  we need to make a lot of money now we need to bring it in to fund things so i can just fire hose the
[02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:57.560]  enemy and get injunctions against him and get top lawyers we're getting it all set up and we'll have
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:01.160]  some big w's that's why they're doing all this he planned for me now i've been beating their fake
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:07.560]  lawsuits and i don't want to get into the details of that but they haven't filed any new ones in
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:11.880]  months and months because i sue the people that sue me except for sandy hook i waived that
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:16.360]  when you counter sue and they lied and said i did sue so it's total deception the media thinks
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:22.120]  they'll defeat you they're not going to defeat you okay mark erin franando got a whole bunch of
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:27.640]  colors here stefan um this is how do you beat censorship they're asking you just spread the
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:33.560]  word by word of mouth nothing can stop you they can shut me down you can go tell the truth nothing's
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:37.000]  going to stop you go to city council meetings calling to talk radio nothing can stop you just
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:43.880]  make it part of your daily life let's talk to john and boston john in boston massachusetts thanks for
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:49.080]  calling you're on the air alex it is so good to be with you the last time i spoke to you was the
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:54.120]  day of the state of the union when i said that trump should declassify the nunas memo and go out there
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:56:00.360]  and read it um you know last season a homeland they really tried to drive the point home of the
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:05.480]  character that's supposed to be like you be in a nut and really use a coward and it was fake news so
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:10.680]  they've been trying to set this up for everybody so exactly they have like 10 tv shows where they
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:18.280]  admit it's supposedly me and i'm a bad guy and then exactly what we really need to do for you alex
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:23.880]  is your listeners and supporters and info warriors is we need to start a hashtag something like who
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:29.880]  is alex jones where we can count of the narrative of the straw man and go out there and support you
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:34.200]  and show who you really are i agree because it's bigger than me i mean i'm already signed on to this
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.040]  whatever i don't care what they say or do about me but it's reflected on everybody now if people
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:41.800]  could say alex predicted this was right he was predicted that was right and just say here's the
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:48.200]  real alex jones maybe a hashtag real alex jones and then explain to everybody that i mean yeah
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:53.800]  that's why they're so scared is we've got their game plan because they're going to try something
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:57.240]  and they're going to try to blame it on you just like you said so we need to get out in front of
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:02.840]  this is your listeners you know we support you i'm praying so you well i support you john i'm

[03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:30.840]  i hate censorship i love truth
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:34.600]  all right we're able to divert to a server for now
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:40.840]  that has a splash page that diverts folks to news wars dot com prison planet dot com
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:44.600]  info wars dot com has been attacked i don't people don't want to get into this we have
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:51.720]  denial of service attacks d dos attacks that's been going on for weeks but this is people inside
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:58.760]  origin servers we believe that have flipped it off so this is the rebellion level and a test case
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:04.120]  ahead of the midterms i believe just like youtube four or five months ago took us down and said oh
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:08.280]  there was a rebellion they were wrong they were untrained they took you down it wasn't true what
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:13.160]  you said because we could put up the real video what i said versus what they said but they finally
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:19.080]  made the decision eight days ago nine days ago with the head of apple and others to take us down
[03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:24.120]  and then like dominos it happened paul gut level what do you think's going on because we're important
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:29.480]  but not that important we're a test case this is seeing if congress and the president noticed
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:34.200]  oh they're worried about amorosa this is this is never before it happened the de-platforming
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:40.200]  off 25 platforms going after our credit card processors going after our email systems going
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:46.520]  after our servers that aren't even servers for web servers for inventory i mean this is unprecedented
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:53.720]  well it's nothing more than a cyber attack alex isn't it it's full on cyber warfare and of course
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:59.640]  we have to trace it back to the origins which was a cnn campaign in association with buzzfeed i might add
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:05.240]  to lobby these big tech firms to censor info wars then it snowballed from there now it's
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:09.880]  literally cyber attacking our website you know they all said when this began over a week ago
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:14.920]  oh alex jones isn't being censored you know private companies can do what they like alex
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:21.400]  jones still has his own website and in fact even joe rogan got blessing but even joe rogan said that
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:25.960]  well now we don't even have our own website because of what is obviously a cyber we didn't
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:33.240]  have email or comments they're taking everything yeah so it's not just private companies making
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:39.160]  decisions this is for political persecution cyber warfare and the people behind it are going to be
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:44.760]  exposed there's also this whole narrative that we hear from cnn every single day there's a war on
[03:02:44.760 --> 03:02:49.160]  the press oh my god there's a war on the press being led by donald trump there's no war on the
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:53.880]  press there's no war on the course the universities and press are waging war on the first amendment
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:59.480]  exactly that's the real war on independent journalists because mainstream journalists
[03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:03.960]  don't do journalism anymore they just lobby big corporations to shut down the competition
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:09.640]  and call it journalism the war is on independent journalists people like laura luma who was shut
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:14.920]  down the other day for doing independent journalism oh keith everyone else who actually get original
[03:03:14.920 --> 03:03:21.560]  stories the war is on them the war is on non-corporate news outlets that don't take giant fat checks from
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.440]  george sorrell so get paid for advertising by dictates ships in the middle east like cnn does
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:32.280]  the war is on the people who are being censored and banned every single day by these legacy
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:37.160]  media companies which were dying and losing their audience so they concerted they colluded they
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:43.640]  conspired with big tech with giant corporations in silicon valley to shut down their competition
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:50.360]  well let me ask you this this is next level though doing denial of service but now people
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:54.200]  inside shutting this off somewhere because we're looking this is like flipped off this is like
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:59.480]  it's just turned off i mean i think it's a precursor to to what they're going to do to
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:05.160]  trump i think we're going to see industrial sabotage nation-wide ball that's exactly what it is it's
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:10.680]  sabotage and this is why the administration people around the administration need to speak out on
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:16.360]  this immediately i mean there was one trump tweet about twitter shadow banning a couple of weeks ago
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.360]  that actually had somewhat of an effect twitter's now come out whether you believe them or not at
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:24.760]  least we're still on twitter and said they're launching a charm offensive with conservatives to
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:29.320]  talk to me so you know it had some impact there let's see what they're going to do next because
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:35.160]  they need to do something my god this is so epic and so historical and i it means we're doing our
[03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:42.280]  job but i just can't believe they're trying i mean now info wars dot com is down news wars dot com
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:46.600]  and prison planet dot com are still up europe wars was down earlier it's on a different server

[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  he aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:18.600]  is hanging around
[03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:32.600]  all watching is hosting this hour he's about to take over as a special guest take a few calls
[03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:36.920]  in the segment before i leave you the war is coming up in about 15 minutes
[03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:42.360]  paul we were talking during the break about how desperate the deep state and the global star
[03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:49.160]  this is a very bold move to deplatform us a bunch of other libertarian conservatives and then to
[03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:54.360]  internally take down our sites and i know i got a bunch of inside baseball i'm not going to name
[03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:58.680]  companies yet because i've had the companies admit no this is not an official decision and stop
[03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:04.200]  where it's it's not just deplatforming it's saying software we pay for we can't use this is literally
[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:09.240]  trying to put us into an electronic gulag that drudge report warned about there's now a story
[03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:15.560]  up on news wars dot com info wars dot com site goes down amid big tech censorship and so we
[03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:21.160]  got a splash page apple another server i'm told it's having problems this is like something out
[03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:26.040]  of a movie or you read about as a kid in a science fiction book what do you think's going on watching
[03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:34.280]  well obviously you've got mob out outrage witch hunts who have been called to the to the cause
[03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:39.560]  by basically big tech you remember zuckerberg said oh first we need to establish whether this is
[03:07:39.560 --> 03:07:45.000]  just brigading whether this is mobs of people politically demanding we take down info wars
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.960]  for partisanship reasons it obviously was from the very start but he said oh no it's not that
[03:07:49.960 --> 03:07:56.760]  now this is that this is what this is witch hunt brigades radicalized by mainstream media propaganda
[03:07:56.760 --> 03:08:01.480]  and now they're trying to take down the website you know they've had fundraisers for people like
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:07.080]  tomy robinson in the past and the banks get pressured not to even open account so you can
[03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:13.000]  fundraise so they literally target people to make them not allowed to have bank accounts
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:18.440]  they delisted you from linkedin which is a pure unpersoning you don't even upload any content
[03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:23.560]  to linkedin it's impossible to do so but this is all about power this is all about sabotage
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:28.360]  i mean what don't they want people to see alex what's happening in sweden last night which got
[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:34.040]  banned on facebook by the way videos of these migrant mobs these youth gangs torching vehicles in
[03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:38.920]  numerous different cities okay they don't want people to see that because then people will vote
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:44.440]  for the parties the anti-globalist parties that will see to that and you know offer actual solution
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:50.360]  so it's not working the sweden democrats and the elections next month are five points ahead
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:54.760]  they're probably going to win if there's no election meddling so whatever they do they can't
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:09:00.040]  keep a lid on this stuff and by censoring us and attacking us it only draws more attention to it
[03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:03.880]  but they are they are completely without morals they moral grandstand all day and say
[03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:09.640]  oh we're just enforcing terms of service there was a left-wing latin american news website which
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:17.320]  was basically venezuelan socialist propaganda they took that down on facebook just last night
[03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:21.400]  so you know they all cheered when they took down info was are you going to celebrate and cheer
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:26.040]  when these left-wing websites start getting taken down and the answer from what i've seen is
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:31.000]  yes they will because they're complete hypocrites well what it is is people groveling to the deep
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:37.640]  state big mega titan companies power bunch of powerless people seeking after power but as you
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:44.920]  said a truck attack running over more people at parliament they find a muslim training camp and
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:49.400]  people call in saying there's a dead kid there and there is a dead kid and they go but it's racist
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:53.560]  so they let him go and there's a dead kid there and and you know all this is gone they say well
[03:09:53.560 --> 03:09:58.040]  it's racist your muslims will let you go seeing anyone even say it's islamic attacks happening
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:02.680]  in sweden even though as you said they're running around screaming a lot bar burning now thousands
[03:10:02.680 --> 03:10:10.280]  of cars uh and sweden's answer is bring in more muslims where does all this end paul well it ends
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:18.200]  in the instability the destabilization of society if you try and drive these you know fringe voices
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:22.440]  which are not even fringe at this point underground you only make the situation worse you only make
[03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:27.880]  people more resentful this attack in london today the first narrative they came out with
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:33.560]  was that this was borris johnson's fault because he had written an article saying by the way i
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:38.440]  don't think the burka should be banned but these people wearing it don't fit in with our culture
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:43.640]  basically they look like letterboxes now they're tweeting today that it's his fault because he
[03:10:43.640 --> 03:10:48.520]  whipped up hatred and division remember this is why we got banned apparently he whipped up hatred
[03:10:48.520 --> 03:10:53.880]  and division so they're literally siding with the ideology that the that justified the charlie
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:59.640]  hebdo attack by saying oh these muslims were offended so they have the right to buy it gets worse
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:04.360]  some tourists took a selfie of the police cars and stuff that was the outrage that they did that
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:09.880]  not another islamicist running over people i mean this is they're bending over backwards but the
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:14.680]  islamicists are getting more and more violent why do you think they burned down so much of sweden
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:21.000]  last night well swedans had these problems for years and years i mean that the male companies
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:26.760]  some of them have refused to even deliver to certain areas now so i mean it helps the sweden
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:30.120]  democrats let's be honest they'll probably start saying that they did it i mean they've tried to
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:35.240]  declare that's the pro nationalist group up you know obviously but but why why do the islamicists
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:41.320]  not get jobs why do they not integrate why are they just so hateful well in sweden i think it's
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:46.920]  the majority of people in sweden on welfare are migrants most of those are muslim migrants but it's
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:51.320]  because they live in these closed communities and they're on welfare and they don't feel the need
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:56.040]  to learn english i mean they went around bradford which is a northern uk city a couple weeks ago
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:12:01.640]  with sky news and they were asking muslims wearing full burkas what does it mean to you
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:07.400]  to be british and they they answered i don't understand english so they cannot even respond
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:11.480]  to the question of what does it mean to be british but they know how to have chips on their

[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:13.560]  fernando asks the severity of censorship stefan in pennsylvania how the plan of combating censorship
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:19.160]  i mean how do we do it get congress acting the bigger uh plan besides censorship let's talk to
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:24.360]  kevin in virginia kevin what's the bigger plan beyond censorship you're with paul watson go ahead
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:30.280]  well i think this bigger plan of censorship ahead of the midterms has nothing to do with
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:37.000]  the midterms i think it has to do with shutting down the opposition and the dissent of this event
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:42.040]  of whatever's about to happen now i agree i think the big terror attack or false flags are getting
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:46.200]  ready to stage that they're pumping that'll be against the media or the tech companies
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:50.600]  they don't want us on air when they stage it to create their big sympathy thing go ahead
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:58.280]  yeah absolutely um you know it's remember this remember this the people that did 9 11
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:03.640]  these people don't have empathy these by the way that's that's brennan and all these guys
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:09.960]  were involved in 9 11 a muller all yeah they don't have empathy they're going to do whatever it is
[03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:15.560]  they can do because they have no uh what's the word they have no uh remorse and they have no
[03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:21.080]  no they don't know what consequences are that's why these people do the things that they do how do
[03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:29.240]  you fight that well you got to take them out we it's it's time it is time for us to rise up it is

[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:38.200]  it'll be some innocent cops or whatever i think soros these globalists all these people are clear
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:41.960]  and present dangers and i just pray that the america and the world wake up to and i appreciate

[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:51.560]  covering it up paul gut level do you think a big event's coming i think they're clearly hyping one
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:57.480]  i don't know if the big event is the midterm elections alex that's the biggest event that's
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:02.600]  coming in the next few months but just harking back to the arrogance of it all zuckerberg you know
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:07.480]  it's unclear whether it's him or one of his executives in facebook saying we will help you
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:11.800]  revitalize journalism in a few years the reverse looks like how they're holding hands with your
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:17.640]  dying business like in a hospice the sheer arrogance of these people given that facebook loses
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:23.400]  three million users in the us alone every year under the age of 25 okay they're going to end up
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:29.160]  like the next myspace anyway so the solution is to continue to erode their reputation and that's
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:32.680]  why they're making their move against real choice because they're dying they're a fraud
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:37.640]  and zuckerberg thinks you're a bunch of dumb aphors great job prisonplanet.com news wars.com

[03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:57.400]  thing i wanted to mention is alex talked about getting the products to support as we're literally
[03:20:57.400 --> 03:21:03.000]  being shut down right now people said from the start oh alex jones still has his free speech
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:08.600]  he isn't being censored he isn't being banned he still has his own website well now he doesn't
[03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:14.280]  because that's being shut down as well isn't it amazing how they can shift their justifications
[03:21:14.280 --> 03:21:20.360]  from minute to minute based on the fact that they've got mob outrage brigades of basically
[03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:26.520]  electronic witch hunt mobs attacking as at every level imaginable but still we linger on and we
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:30.600]  will survive and thrive with your support so please get the products but if you want to do
[03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:36.680]  something really quick right now you can go to the website when it comes back or i think you can
[03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:41.800]  go to prison planet as well you'll see the same thing and press the donate button again it's
[03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:45.720]  going to be on prison plan it's going to be back on info wars whenever we get the website back up
[03:21:45.720 --> 03:21:51.400]  but at the bottom of the articles there's a section where you can donate directly via paypal or visa
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:55.480]  and you can do that and that helps us out too so please do that as soon as possible when the
[03:21:55.480 --> 03:22:01.560]  website comes back for the time being i'm going to go through this article on bri bar which is
[03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:08.120]  headlined why tech giants aren't the same as christian bakeries because this is the other
[03:22:08.120 --> 03:22:13.960]  non excuse they try out every single time we're censored oh if conservatives can refuse service
[03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:20.280]  for for a gay couple to refuse to bake a gay wedding cake then why can't silicon valley
[03:22:20.280 --> 03:22:26.280]  corporate giants be platform you and silence you forever because the two are really comparable aren't
[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:32.120]  they now the subheadline here is christian bakeries can't kill your business this is the key point
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:38.280]  financial institutions are heavily regulated in part because failures on their part affect the
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:45.080]  livelihoods of so many other people now we go on to the point of info wars being financially
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:50.920]  attacked this is the level it's reached if a bank messes up people can lose years even decades of
[03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:56.760]  investment social media companies and online payment processors have grown to similar level of
[03:22:56.760 --> 03:23:02.200]  influence when facebook tweaked its algorithm and this happened back in february largely without
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:09.560]  warning it cut traffic to even non-political viral website called little things by 75 percent
[03:23:09.560 --> 03:23:16.360]  then guess what happened they had to shut their business down they had to lay off a 100 strong
[03:23:16.360 --> 03:23:21.720]  workforce so when you get de-platformed on social media if you're reliant on it to that extent
[03:23:21.720 --> 03:23:26.440]  which this website was thankfully we weren't i think there was a study which found about
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:31.720]  10 percent of traffic that came to info wars came from social media so we had it direct
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:37.880]  mostly which is how we've been able to survive but in this case this website which was non-political
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:44.680]  was put out of business along with 100 employees because facebook tweaked its algorithm okay that
[03:23:44.680 --> 03:23:51.800]  is very different from one single christian bakery refusing to bake a gay wedding cake they can go to
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:57.480]  virtually any other bakery in the town in the city and receive that service once you banned
[03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:02.760]  off facebook and youtube and google and apple there are no equivalent services that the free
[03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:08.760]  market can provide where you can go because this is not a free market these companies are acting
[03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:15.560]  as monopolies they're private companies private giant corporations that control the public discourse
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:22.040]  and they need to be broken up it's like saying oh you know this other argument which is why don't
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:26.360]  you just build your own social network because that's so easy isn't it it's like saying if you get
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:32.040]  cut off from your power supply if the electricity company cuts off your power supply people coming
[03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:37.640]  to you and saying why don't you just start your own electricity company no that's not an argument
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:42.600]  you get cut off from your phone service oh just start your own phone company just start erecting
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:48.680]  your own phone masks that's a solution isn't it no it isn't a solution it's hair brained it's pie in
[03:24:48.680 --> 03:24:54.680]  the sky so these big websites which were not even political were put out of business not even through
[03:24:54.680 --> 03:25:00.120]  being censored directly by facebook but through being but through the algorithm being tweaked and
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:04.760]  then that negative negatively affected their output they went out of business 100 people got
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:11.640]  laid off according to a report by digi-date entire business models built around the distribution
[03:25:11.640 --> 03:25:17.960]  of viral content on facebook were rendered unviable via the platform's rapid shift and you barely even
[03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:23.480]  heard about this when it happened back in february here's another point christian bakeries can't
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:28.760]  swing an election president trump has begun to take notice of big tech's progressive bias
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:33.320]  recently calling out twitter for shadow grand funding prominent republicans and the president's
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:38.280]  campaign manager brad pascale who managed trump social media operations to great success obviously
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:44.440]  in 2016 is also keenly aware of the problem as well they should be annoying though biased
[03:25:44.440 --> 03:25:50.920]  legacy media like cnn may be biased social media is a far greater threat facebook claims to have
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:57.000]  boosted votes vote to turn out by three percent in 2016 by making small tweaks to their algorithm
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:01.560]  listen to this studies have shown that if search engines like google manipulated their results to
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:07.560]  favor political candidates which we already know they've manipulated their search results to down
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:15.960]  rank conservative websites they can shift between two and three million votes in a national election
[03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:22.760]  in fact they almost certainly already did in 2016 in favor of hillary clinton so how much
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:29.480]  more could they shift in 2020 this is why this is so huge this is why trump needs to at least
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:35.080]  tweet about it this is why we need some kind of action in congress we need hearings we need lawmakers
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:40.920]  to sit up and pay attention in the republican party otherwise they can forget about the midterms
[03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:48.360]  they can forget about 2020 okay when are you going to realize how important this is continues
[03:26:48.360 --> 03:26:53.960]  modern modern elections are won and lost on social media not legacy media brad pascal knows this he
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:27:00.280]  led the digital operations team the outclassed hillary clinton in 2016 the democrats know this too
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:04.680]  which is why they're working so hard to turn social media platforms into little more than
[03:27:04.680 --> 03:27:10.360]  conduits for the legacy media which is the point i've made before you go back before the beginning
[03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:14.920]  of this year and you look at cnn you look at ms mbc and these are the network mainstream network
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:19.560]  channels on youtube they were getting their butts handed to them on a regular basis in
[03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:25.400]  terms of subscribers and views by independent content creators what happened youtube flipped
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:30.760]  a switch they admittedly and they announced this they were proud of it deliberately rigged their
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:37.400]  own algorithm to put mainstream legacy corporate media content above independent media content
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:43.320]  what happened cnn subscribers started climbing up rapidly their viewers started climbing up
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:49.400]  rapidly on youtube because youtube google gained the system this is why this is so important
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:55.400]  we're all slaves to the algorithm and until these fusty republicans who who you know have these
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:27:59.720]  hearings with zuckerberg and they don't even know how facebook makes money they don't even know about
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:06.360]  advertising online these people needs it needs to be explained to them how important this can be
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:13.640]  given that this can and has shifted millions of votes they had an example case and this was robert
[03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:19.560]  epstein we've talked about him before who did a study and found that google could shift millions
[03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:24.600]  of votes by ranking search results that are positive towards one candidate over another
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:28.840]  above the one they want to downgrade the one they want to downvote in the algorithm
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:35.080]  they found that that could shift votes to change the result of the largest democratic election
[03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:41.720]  in the world in india this is the power that these big chet tech giants wield this is why
[03:28:41.720 --> 03:28:47.640]  they need to be broken up right now we need action now this is completely out of control
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:53.320]  we'll be back with minds dot com's bill osmond on the next side stay with us info wars dot com

[03:31:54.280 --> 03:32:00.280]  in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani
[03:32:00.280 --> 03:32:06.120]  estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash
[03:32:06.120 --> 03:32:12.440]  and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[03:32:12.440 --> 03:32:19.000]  ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:25.000]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:31.320]  acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not
[03:32:31.320 --> 03:32:37.160]  only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal
[03:32:37.160 --> 03:32:43.880]  levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've
[03:32:43.880 --> 03:32:50.360]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply but more importantly
[03:32:50.360 --> 03:33:10.360]  a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:10.360 --> 03:33:21.960]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show and now your
[03:33:21.960 --> 03:33:30.840]  host paul joseph watson the live is fourth hour of the most censored broadcast in the western
[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:36.200]  hemisphere at this point and i'm delighted to be joined right now by bill othman who is founder of
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.600]  minds dot com an alternative social media network that doesn't censor that doesn't shadow van and
[03:33:42.600 --> 03:33:50.200]  that aligns itself with the first amendment bill welcome next round me paul now first off obviously
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:55.560]  i want to get your take on this as info wars dot com itself is under cyber attack they said oh alex
[03:33:55.560 --> 03:33:59.720]  jones isn't being censored he still has his own website now he doesn't have his own website okay
[03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:04.840]  but obviously we've been digitally executed by the social media giants over the past week
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:10.600]  you know gabin mckinnis banned by twitter laura luma banned by facebook even today a left wing
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:17.800]  latin american news network telecern which is basically fennel's whale and socialist propaganda
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:22.520]  even they got banned by facebook do you think there's anything in the timing about how all this
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:29.320]  seems to um intensified over the last 10 days or so well i think it's the key point that you just
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:35.560]  said it's affecting both the left and the right and the world needs to understand that censorship
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:39.720]  affects everyone and just because it's not you right now doesn't mean it's not going to be you
[03:34:39.720 --> 03:34:44.600]  later that's why you see you know you mentioned gnome chomsky the electronic frontier foundation
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:49.960]  real internet freedom advocates across the spectrum understand that censorship is not the answer
[03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:57.480]  exactly we had gnome chomsky the uh preeminent icon basically on the subject of free speech in
[03:34:57.480 --> 03:35:03.000]  the west for decades and decades he's like 89 years old now or something come out in an email on the
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  weekend and defend info was basically saying that this arbitrary notion of hate speech is just going
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:14.680]  to end up deep-sixing everyone's right to free speech you've got cnn right now if they want to
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:20.920]  flash up a headline it's on information liberation cnn alex jones's hate speech is a form of terrorism
[03:35:20.920 --> 03:35:26.760]  they've actually now got a cnn opinion contributor saying that our hate speech which was nebulous
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:32.200]  and never defined by any of these companies is now terrorism so now they're going even further
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:36.600]  we've got this whole argument which we hear again and again bill which i covered in the previous
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:42.040]  segment you know giant corporations they're just private companies they can enforce their own
[03:35:42.040 --> 03:35:46.680]  terms of service they can do what they like their private companies well my argument has always been
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:52.280]  no their giant corporations are all centered in the same area of san francisco they act like
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:35:57.960]  monopolies they're they're private companies but they control the public discourse studies show they
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:02.920]  can shift millions of views and as we've seen over the past 10 years they're obviously abusing their
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:08.040]  power to meddle in elections and silence their political opposition which as he said is just
[03:36:08.040 --> 03:36:13.320]  going to end up affecting everyone left or right how do you respond to this tiresome argument that
[03:36:13.320 --> 03:36:20.760]  they're just private companies they can just do as they wish well yeah the thing is that it amplifies
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:25.560]  the problems that they're trying to silence you would think that with all of the access to analytics
[03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:30.280]  and data that they have they would understand that they're also peer reviewed studies that show that
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:35.960]  censorship amplifies whatever it's trying to censor this is why you know your site is probably growing
[03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:42.120]  rapidly right now and so what we're calling for at minds.com is for tech sites across the world to
[03:36:42.120 --> 03:36:48.440]  adopt a free speech policy because then you avoid all of this subjective decision making
[03:36:48.440 --> 03:36:54.120]  and inconsistency which we're seeing on major social networks and it's just it's a it's a losing battle
[03:36:54.120 --> 03:37:00.680]  for them so you advocate some kind of digital bill of rights which was obviously have to have some
[03:37:00.680 --> 03:37:06.360]  kind of state backing I mean some kind of Trump administration backing to at least give it symbolic
[03:37:06.360 --> 03:37:12.680]  teeth to outline exactly what free speech rights people should have on the internet and with minds.com
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:17.080]  as far as I understand you basically align it with the first amendment right you say anything
[03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:23.960]  that's not illegal is fair game that's correct right that's correct so you're advocating a kind
[03:37:23.960 --> 03:37:29.480]  of digital bill of rights where it would apply to everyone across the political spectrum yeah and it
[03:37:29.480 --> 03:37:35.400]  makes it easier for tech companies I think that they're feeling so much social pressure to censor
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:41.160]  because of x y and z reason and you know Twitter started off as the free quote unquote the free
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:46.280]  speech wing of the free speech party and you know that all the executives are having an existential
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:51.240]  crisis which is probably why in force is still on Twitter because they know if they ban you guys
[03:37:51.240 --> 03:37:56.920]  from there it's just they're going to lose a huge audience and what they're forgetting is that open
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:01.560]  discourse doesn't mean that you endorse what the people are saying just because you're willing to
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:05.800]  have a conversation to someone doesn't mean you necessarily agree on all the issues so you know
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:11.080]  these digital town halls are supposed to be open forums and you know but regardless of that this
[03:38:11.080 --> 03:38:16.520]  is why we're moving toward more towards more of a decentralized architecture we've just integrated
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:23.560]  a cryptocurrency for our payment system so if you check out minds.com slash token you know we're
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:28.600]  we don't want to be censored by Stripe or PayPal or any of these other platforms crypto can't get
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:34.600]  censored granted you know it's a new technology but it's decentralized and it can't get taken down
[03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:41.080]  so so we're moving more towards that direction now you mentioned um you know these these brigades
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:45.960]  of mobs that the pressure companies into banning people into banning content that's exactly what's
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:50.600]  happened it was ironic because in the comments that were reported by the New York Times where they
[03:38:50.600 --> 03:38:55.880]  admit Zuckerberg made the decision to pull the plug on info wars he personally made the decision
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:39:00.520]  so he literally got billionaires running giant corporations that get to decide what we can see
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:05.480]  and hear on the internet and much of the left applaud and clap and celebrate it but you also
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:10.680]  have him apparently reportedly expressing concern that this whole move to censor info wars could
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:16.600]  have started by a brigading operation which we see routinely with groups like sleeping giant
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:21.080]  they pressure advertisers to pull out of bright bar and he acknowledged that that was probably
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:25.480]  what was happening but then he went ahead and did it anyway now that's happening even to the extent
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:31.800]  where our website is under cyber attack because of these witch hunt mob brigades who by the way
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:36.600]  have basically ruined twitter and that's why that went down the down the plug hole but going back
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:41.560]  to mines.com you know how do you distinguish yourself from these other old tech networks
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:45.800]  because there's been a lot that sprung up you've had bitch you for example which is trying to
[03:39:45.800 --> 03:39:51.000]  rival youtube obviously they don't have anywhere near the funding the resources how do you differentiate
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:55.960]  how do you distinguish mines from networks like gab and others that have also sprung up at the
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:40:01.080]  same time what makes mines different. One of the key differentiators that all of our software is
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:06.440]  fully free and open source which means that anyone can inspect it modify it see what it's doing make
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:10.760]  sure it's not spying on you you can actually clone our entire site if you want to make your own app
[03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:18.040]  I think that bitch you is actually going to open source I don't I consider this essential if there's
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:25.000]  no transparency then I'm sorry you're just following all the proprietary juggernauts there has to be a
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:29.800]  new paradigm of transparency in the software additionally what you were saying with advertising
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:34.680]  networks starting to censor you know it doesn't make sense if you're selling computers you want
[03:40:34.680 --> 03:40:40.520]  to sell computers the beliefs of your viewers or whoever you're serving ads on the viewers need
[03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:46.440]  to purchase things so this is dangerous precedent in the advertising world so we created actually
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:52.600]  our own ad network that's fully peer-to-peer Paul people can go to your mines channel and send you
[03:40:52.600 --> 03:40:57.720]  tokens directly they can send you offers of tokens so that you'll advertise their content on your
[03:40:57.720 --> 03:41:02.840]  channel we're actually trying to take ourselves out of the equation so that creators and users
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:07.960]  can directly interface with each other and send each other offers for exchange of distribution
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:14.440]  all right I think I've got about 80 000 followers right now on mines which all I use it for is
[03:41:14.440 --> 03:41:18.280]  basically to send out my own articles I don't use it anywhere near as much as Twitter probably we'll
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:23.160]  be using it more in the future given the way that things are going but I'm not correct in saying that
[03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:29.160]  you can now hold video on there as well that's correct right yeah we host video I mean look look
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:33.080]  at what's happening to all of the networks they're sort of becoming the same thing coalescing into
[03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:38.520]  the very similar app social now every site is becoming a social network so you know we have
[03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:43.960]  groups we have a whole blogging platform we host videos we have news feeds we have mobile apps on
[03:41:43.960 --> 03:41:49.560]  Android and iOS which you should definitely check out and you know it's just it's a race and we're
[03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:54.040]  trying to keep up and the fact that we're open source allows developers all over the world to
[03:41:54.040 --> 03:42:00.440]  help us build the product and make it better and you know we're just seeing growth just like you
[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:07.320]  guys are because these issues and scandals whether it's Cambridge Analytica it's one after the other
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:11.800]  it just every day there's a new one and it's unbelievable that they're not smart enough to
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:18.520]  change their behavior I don't it doesn't make sense by the way just in 20 seconds how many new
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:23.000]  users have you got over the past month since this big tech censorship purge has intensified
[03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:28.120]  we've seen hundreds of thousands of new users over the last month even from Vietnam where
[03:42:28.120 --> 03:42:33.880]  there's censorship legislation going through what people say I'll just start your own social media
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:39.240]  network it's very impossible very hard to do so Bill Ockman has done it at minds.com go there
[03:42:39.240 --> 03:42:44.280]  and sign up right now we'll be back in the next segment to finish up with Bill and cover the rest

[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:22.600]  listening to the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph what's in the back with phil
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:27.800]  hotman of find dot com we're going to go back to him here in a second but cnn has literally
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:33.320]  published an article and the headline on cnn is this is from august the 10th so it's four days
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:40.920]  ago now let me find the headline here from one of their contributors raffia's a car as a carrier
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:45.320]  it's an important step in recognizing hate speech as a form of terrorism she says let me
[03:47:45.320 --> 03:47:53.400]  find the exact quote where she says and i quote info wars is complicit in domestic terror cnn has
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:59.480]  literally published an article claiming that info wars is complicit in domestic terrorism
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:04.680]  with no evidence whatsoever to black back up that claim they published an article somehow it got by
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:12.520]  their lawyers and that is up on cnn dot com right now it's uh we need to talk about alex jones is
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:17.720]  the main headline they've got a series of uh contributors of commentators speaking to that
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:25.240]  issue and one of them raffia's a carrier says sadly domestic terrorism or jones is dangerous
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:30.280]  speech in which he claims that he is in a holy war against islam he's not prosecuted in that statue
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:37.400]  she goes on to say let me find the exact quote info wars is complicit in domestic terror that is on
[03:48:37.400 --> 03:48:44.200]  cnn right now she says the new decision she's talking about big tech banning info wars is a step
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:49.800]  forward in recognizing that hate outlets such as info wars remember the left wing telly sir was
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:55.320]  also called a hate outlet by facebook they were banned hate outlets such as info wars are complicit
[03:48:55.320 --> 03:49:00.920]  in domestic terror and a relief to muslim americans like myself who have been the target of online
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:07.160]  assaults and threats now the splc um back you last year i think it was a little year before
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:13.640]  called uh majeed duaz a muslim reformist called him an anti muslim extremist they had to pay out
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:20.280]  three million dollars in court um for libeling him now cnn has literally claimed that info wars is
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:26.280]  complicit in domestic terror via one of their contributors that is up right now live on cnn's
[03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:30.520]  website so i'll be interested in seeing the fallout from that as we go forward but going back
[03:49:30.520 --> 03:49:36.360]  to bill othman of minds dot com a social network that doesn't ban people that doesn't shadow ban
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:42.920]  people that doesn't censor people bill facebook they're they're losing nearly three million
[03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:50.440]  users under the age of 25 in the us alone every single year we see twitter their growth have stalled
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:55.400]  has stalled we see zuckerberg or one of his executives in a private meeting reportedly
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:50:00.120]  saying they quote they quote don't care about publishers and they warned that if publishers
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:05.640]  didn't work with them quote i'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:11.640]  is zuckerberg's arrogance going to come back to haunt him how many years before how many more years
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:17.880]  before these platforms are in terminal decline if they're not already they are already i mean
[03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:22.760]  these algorithms have gotten so out of control you used to be able to actually reach your followers
[03:50:22.760 --> 03:50:29.240]  of friends on facebook now you're only reaching about five percent of your own followers organically
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:33.720]  and their because their algorithms are deciding to show you what they want you to see it's not a
[03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:38.920]  pure chronological feat so on minds everything is 100 chronological and raw we're never going
[03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:45.880]  to interfere with that and additionally you earn tokens for your contributions to the network
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:50.520]  every day so whoever creates the most engaging content gets tokens and then you can use those
[03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:58.040]  tokens to boost your post for more views so not only are we not filtering we're giving people more
[03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:04.120]  of a voice because that's actually what the purpose of social media supposed to be is to share your
[03:51:04.120 --> 03:51:10.520]  voice it's a concept that they seem to have forgotten about isn't it now i read your interview
[03:51:10.520 --> 03:51:15.960]  with the daily caller you talked about healthy society hinging on the free exchange of ideas
[03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:22.040]  tell us about darryl davis and how his story speaks to what's happening now with big tech censorship
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  yeah darryl davis is an incredible story of an african-american man who befriended hundreds of
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:36.200]  members of the kkk and through open dialogue got them all to hand over their ropes because they
[03:51:36.200 --> 03:51:41.400]  saw the humanity in each other and understood that obviously doesn't make sense to be a part of the
[03:51:41.400 --> 03:51:49.240]  kkk and this is how communication and social evolution works is that through open discourse
[03:51:49.240 --> 03:51:53.880]  the best ideas will rise to the top look we're all getting things wrong sometimes but through
[03:51:53.880 --> 03:52:02.760]  education and clear debate the best ideas are going to win exactly again as he said twitter
[03:52:02.760 --> 03:52:08.440]  started started as the free speech wing of the free speech party quite ironic now that twitter is
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:13.880]  the last remaining holdout i mean we have heard whispers behind the scenes that jack dorsi at least
[03:52:13.880 --> 03:52:18.840]  to some extent does support free speech that he has had meetings with people we had the announcement
[03:52:18.840 --> 03:52:25.400]  yesterday twitter is reaching out to conservatives on a charm offensive to try and get them on board
[03:52:25.400 --> 03:52:29.720]  and to try and reassure their concern whether anything comes of that given that there are
[03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:35.560]  literally giant mobs of outrage permanently offended idiots on their campaigning every day to
[03:52:35.560 --> 03:52:40.440]  shut us down remains to be seen but here in the pet in the last couple of minutes bill just tell us
[03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:47.160]  how easy it is to sign up for minds dot com and why people should do so right now yeah just varies
[03:52:47.160 --> 03:52:52.200]  and sign up like other social networks the key thing that i would have you take away is that
[03:52:52.840 --> 03:52:58.760]  where we spend our time online is how the power structure of the internet is distributed so when
[03:52:58.760 --> 03:53:06.920]  you even just create an account on an open source peer-to-peer alternative like minds you are helping
[03:53:06.920 --> 03:53:12.680]  empower us and other alternatives to grow where we sit the browsers that we use you know use the
[03:53:12.680 --> 03:53:19.800]  brave browser use firefox don't use proprietary surveillance systems it is possible to shift
[03:53:19.800 --> 03:53:26.200]  away and you know we're sitting on these devices all day and that is building the metrics of all
[03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:31.240]  these different corporations so you know finally the alternatives are catching up in terms of the
[03:53:31.240 --> 03:53:36.120]  functionality and i would just say at the minimum supplement your experience if you're not ready to

[03:54:14.360 --> 03:54:20.040]  free speech the only reason you get banned is for endorsing advocating legal activity and obviously
[03:54:20.680 --> 03:54:25.400]  twitter facebook and the rest of them have terms of service which are slightly more restricted than
[03:54:25.400 --> 03:54:30.040]  that minds dot com aligns itself with the first amendment so you know you're not going to get
[03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:35.400]  banned and it's growing rapidly it's not really a right wing echo chamber as some people claim
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:40.600]  these other websites are as people from actual real liberals who support free speech conservatives
[03:54:40.600 --> 03:54:47.400]  and whoever having an actual conversation god forbid without being censored so please go and sign up

[03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:05.640]  is now a purge what is now basically a cyber attack on our website to the point where cnn has
[03:55:05.640 --> 03:55:11.080]  published an article as i just mentioned bearing in mind that cnn was the network that launched this
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:18.040]  purge they launched this lobbying campaign back in february of that of this year their first target
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:23.160]  was the alex germans channel they tried to create a controversy over the parkland shootings to get
[03:55:23.160 --> 03:55:30.120]  that shut down with community guidelines strikes then they lobbied facebook to shut us down after
[03:55:30.120 --> 03:55:34.840]  facebook shut us down they lobbied twitter to shut us down they haven't been successful with twitter
[03:55:34.840 --> 03:55:40.600]  yet but they were the genesis of this campaign to purge info wars from the internet now they've
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:46.680]  published an article which literally accuses and says info wars is quote these these these the words
[03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:55.400]  of rafia zakaria a cnn contributor she says info wars is complicit in domestic terror okay this is
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:00.200]  going to have some interesting repercussions but we'll leave that article there for now there you
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:05.480]  see it info wars is complicit in domestic terror they were right to banners because apparently
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:10.680]  we're like isis we're like al-qaeda we encourage terror attacks we've never encouraged any violence
[03:56:10.680 --> 03:56:16.840]  whatsoever we assume we did about all violence and anyone who endorses it or suggests it it's
[03:56:16.840 --> 03:56:23.720]  complete bs this is why cnn is fake news let's see another couple of headlines here in a final
[03:56:23.720 --> 03:56:30.600]  minute of the show sweden is burning migrant gangs and leach coordinated firebomb rampage across
[03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:37.640]  multiple cities so the swedish national election is next month in just a few weeks time the sweden
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:44.120]  democrats which is the anti mass migration party the populist party the anti-globalist party is
[03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:49.480]  according to the recent polls five points ahead i'm guessing when they've run those polls again
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:53.480]  tomorrow or in a couple of days time they're even going to be even further ahead because they're the
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:58.760]  only party that has promised to take steps to take measures to do something about sweden's
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:05.320]  soaring violent crime problem and its complete lack of integration of migrants that have come
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:11.080]  predominantly from the middle east over the past few years so they had numerous cars set on fire
[03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:15.400]  of course this is a regular occurrence occurrence in sweden but they're saying it's never been this
[03:57:15.400 --> 03:57:21.400]  coordinated and it's never been this intense now the police are saying they want to talk to the
[03:57:21.400 --> 03:57:26.840]  parents of the guilty minors sounds like they're really gonna do a lot to prevent that from happening
[03:57:26.840 --> 03:57:31.320]  in future isn't it but sweden's got an election the party that's promised to deal with this is
[03:57:31.320 --> 03:57:36.760]  ahead in the polls this is gonna backfire on them trump was right he said his big last night in
[03:57:36.760 --> 03:57:41.160]  sweden speech he was ridiculed but he was proven right once again that's it for the show warring
