[00:00.000 --> 00:16.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:16.400 --> 00:22.920]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[00:22.920 --> 00:32.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:32.360 --> 00:34.560]  Well I'm not up here tootin' my horn when I say this.
[00:34.560 --> 00:36.560]  I'm just laying out the fact that we know what we're talking about.
[00:36.560 --> 00:45.360]  We have been predicting that you will start seeing massively increased attacks on police
[00:45.360 --> 00:48.840]  officers around the United States but also in Europe and other areas.
[00:48.840 --> 00:55.560]  This is part of the globalist multinational program to undermine stability, national security,
[00:55.560 --> 01:03.960]  local security as a pretext to force the political capitulation of the local constabulary to
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.800]  the globalist program.
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.160]  And Loretta Lynch at the Justice Department is pushing the Strong Cities Initiative in
[01:10.160 --> 01:15.040]  the last six, seven months that federalizes and globalizes local police.
[01:15.040 --> 01:20.280]  When they call off the dogs of Black Lives Matter and other groups, I think the best
[01:20.280 --> 01:22.640]  way to break down what's currently happening is this way.
[01:22.640 --> 01:24.760]  I'm going to do it when we come back after the break and detail.
[01:24.760 --> 01:31.120]  But my personal journey dealing with the police, my personal journey trying to understand what's
[01:31.120 --> 01:34.800]  happening in the last 21 years on air and of course before that.
[01:34.800 --> 01:39.660]  But it's this issue, statistically police killing people is one of the rarest forms
[01:39.660 --> 01:42.040]  of death.
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.320]  We see a lot of TV shows, a lot of movies that basically exacerbate and hype this up.
[01:46.320 --> 01:51.620]  I'm not defending police when they do bad things, that certainly goes on.
[01:51.620 --> 01:55.440]  But it is a manufactured red herring.
[01:55.440 --> 01:59.480]  When you see the number one issue in this country for like four or five years, Trayvon
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.960]  Martin and then Black Lives Matter, you would think that the world was ending when 258 Black
[02:04.960 --> 02:10.880]  Americans get killed by police every year, most of them justifiable shootings.
[02:10.880 --> 02:14.080]  There was a case in Houston last night where a man who was a felon and part of gangs and
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.040]  other things pulled a gun on police in front of witnesses and the guy's wife talked to
[02:18.040 --> 02:21.720]  the news and said, yeah, he was just waving a gun around pointing at him and they shot
[02:21.720 --> 02:24.160]  him.
[02:24.160 --> 02:30.000]  So 258 people that happened to be African descent are killed by the police.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.520]  Okay, I'm sure some of the time it's wrong.
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.160]  If a cop's found to do it wrong, put them in prison.
[02:36.160 --> 02:38.240]  This isn't about an agenda of defending the police.
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.760]  I saw some comment on Info Wars because I put a video out that's gone viral titled,
[02:42.760 --> 02:45.960]  This Video Will Bring Down Black Lives Matter.
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.880]  And I saw a couple commenters going, okay, what he says is a lot of good points, but
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.600]  you know, he's got an agenda.
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.240]  Before I get into all this news today, we have a special guest joining us in the studio
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.240]  as well.
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.000]  Let me just say right now, I do have an agenda and that's telling the truth and that's having
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.920]  integrity and that's actually trying to learn how this world works and trying to empower
[03:05.920 --> 03:12.840]  myself and others because I believe in humanity and I believe in you.
[03:12.840 --> 03:21.920]  And I am too, I guess you could say prideful, to sit here and pick sides in something just
[03:21.920 --> 03:26.920]  because I think it'll further my own personal gain.
[03:26.920 --> 03:31.080]  Because when you have that attitude, you lose the whole storyline of life.
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.720]  I'm trying to empower everybody as long as it's not at my expense and by my expense,
[03:36.720 --> 03:41.600]  as long as they're not trying to bring me down because when you empower others, it basically
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.360]  energizes the whole of the society as John F Kennedy said, a rising tide raises all ships.
[03:47.360 --> 03:53.160]  So separating Alex Jones from this narrative, Info Wars is getting six times the traffic
[03:53.160 --> 03:55.000]  Thursday night through right now.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.160]  We have ever had previous spikes for three to four times.
[03:59.160 --> 04:06.320]  We're seeing six times the traffic, 10,500 people a second are entering the site.
[04:06.320 --> 04:09.120]  That's how many new IP addresses are coming in a second.
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.520]  Millions of visitors an hour.
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.620]  Very, very exciting things are happening because people understand we've been predicting this,
[04:16.620 --> 04:19.880]  we understand what's going on and I have a guest coming in that's really concerned with
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.320]  his sources and his research that they're going to try to kill Donald Trump as a false
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.760]  flag to cause a civil war.
[04:26.760 --> 04:33.160]  Let's get the leftists all hyped up, hype up a bunch of cops killing people, get the
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.440]  media all pushing it and then right as the summer goes towards its head, its climax
[04:38.440 --> 04:41.040]  into September on assassination of Donald Trump.
[04:41.040 --> 04:44.720]  We're going to talk about that with George Humphrey coming up today as well and a lot
[04:44.720 --> 04:50.880]  more but when we return, police are getting shot in Georgia, in Tennessee, in Florida,
[04:50.880 --> 04:56.080]  in Missouri, in New York, in San Antonio, the police department got shot up.
[04:56.080 --> 04:59.040]  I mean this is serious.
[04:59.040 --> 05:03.600]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones but recent studies link
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.600]  cell phone use to major health issues including brain cancer.
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.320]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.680]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable so keep
[05:15.680 --> 05:19.720]  the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[05:19.720 --> 05:24.320]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your
[05:24.320 --> 05:29.920]  sperm, lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[05:29.920 --> 05:32.560]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.040]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.000]  actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.560]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[05:40.560 --> 05:41.840]  Hello, weight gain.
[05:41.840 --> 05:46.120]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency
[05:46.120 --> 05:49.360]  radiation so keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[05:49.360 --> 05:51.920]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[05:51.920 --> 05:52.920]  Use headphones.
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.920]  When you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[05:55.920 --> 06:24.720]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo with your info wars tip of the week.
[06:24.720 --> 06:29.200]  My friends, it is Sunday, the 10th day of July, 2016.
[06:29.200 --> 06:34.840]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, longtime patriot, good friend of mine, former Austin City Council
[06:34.840 --> 06:37.040]  member, a fellow that was involved fighting the New World Order.
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.920]  When I got involved in Pat Buchanan's campaign, when I was still in high school, George Humphrey
[06:41.920 --> 06:44.680]  is going to be in studio with us coming up later in the hour.
[06:44.680 --> 06:46.200]  He's got a new book out.
[06:46.200 --> 06:48.920]  He, of course, is also a best-selling author.
[06:48.920 --> 06:52.440]  The book is Life, Love, Joy.
[06:52.440 --> 06:57.120]  Now before we go any further, George is a high-powered businessman, real estate guy,
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.600]  has a lot of big connections to a lot of some of the older families in the United States.
[07:01.600 --> 07:08.920]  I was just talking to him during the pre-show preparation about what insiders are telling
[07:08.920 --> 07:15.600]  him and he says that they really are concerned about Donald Trump's life and that they're
[07:15.600 --> 07:20.840]  concerned that the establishment, that is criminal elements of it, want to start a civil
[07:20.840 --> 07:27.120]  war in this country and that that would be triggered by the assassination of Donald J.
[07:27.120 --> 07:28.120]  Trump.
[07:28.120 --> 07:34.520]  So we'll be talking about that with him and more coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[07:34.520 --> 07:37.280]  Where to start?
[07:37.280 --> 07:43.440]  I shot a lot of special reports Friday, Saturday and today and they're all viral.
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.560]  Some of them have millions of views and then, of course, the radio show has had six times
[07:48.560 --> 07:52.640]  the traffic to infowars.com.
[07:52.640 --> 07:54.840]  That is the biggest spike in traffic we've ever seen.
[07:54.840 --> 07:58.080]  It's been sustained since Friday right through today.
[07:58.080 --> 08:03.760]  We're getting millions of visitors, new visitors, by the way, most of them, every hour.
[08:03.760 --> 08:04.760]  It's epic.
[08:04.760 --> 08:09.200]  I know Drudge Report was crashing on Friday that gets billions of visitors a month, much
[08:09.200 --> 08:15.600]  larger than InfoWars and, you know, we saw it crash, InfoWars has also crashed some.
[08:15.600 --> 08:22.120]  We also have the backup site, prisonplanet.com and it's because folks know that we have been
[08:22.120 --> 08:25.120]  documenting the war on police.
[08:25.120 --> 08:31.640]  We have been documenting the mainstream media, Hollywood, broadcast TV, but also fiction media
[08:31.640 --> 08:43.640]  in almost every venue, pushing and making very sexy and very risque and very avant-garde
[08:43.640 --> 08:46.920]  that police are criminals and police are the worst people in the world and police need
[08:46.920 --> 08:47.920]  to die.
[08:47.920 --> 08:53.000]  Now, before I get into all the latest developments and cops getting shot all over the country
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.920]  since Friday and attacked, including just south of us in San Antonio a few hours ago,
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.760]  the police department being shot up, I want to explain something.
[09:02.760 --> 09:08.560]  I am uniquely qualified to speak to what's happening because I saw the threat to our
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.720]  republic by globalization, militarization of our police, I made films about it 20 years
[09:13.720 --> 09:19.760]  ago, I wrote books about it 10 years ago, but I was never anti-cop.
[09:19.760 --> 09:24.840]  I was anti-federal globalist training to turn them into political officers that would
[09:24.840 --> 09:31.400]  oppress speech, to turn them into anti-gun forces to teach them instinctive shooting
[09:31.400 --> 09:37.560]  training that might save their lives sometimes but kills a lot of innocent people.
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.800]  I was against the type of stuff that's how the feds do it, Ruby, Ridge, and Waco.
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.960]  But even then, I wasn't against the feds, I was against globalist crime groups, infiltration
[09:47.960 --> 09:51.840]  cells that had taken over areas of the federal government.
[09:51.840 --> 09:53.640]  I want to take our country back.
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.560]  So because our police are being more and more federalized and our military is being globalized
[09:58.560 --> 10:03.760]  and we're going under international control and a lot of un-American anti-free speech
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.920]  anti-liberty things are happening, I've been trying to raise the alarm and then the media
[10:07.920 --> 10:11.120]  would say, well, you're just against the military, you're just against the police.
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.520]  But then I found the last decade, the police and military on average were more sophisticated
[10:17.520 --> 10:25.040]  than I was because they were on the inside that they were being taken over and basically
[10:25.040 --> 10:27.120]  scapegoated.
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.720]  And I found that for groups that are awake, the military is the most awake to the globalist
[10:32.720 --> 10:37.000]  New World Order program, the police are about the second most awake group out there, doesn't
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.320]  mean they're perfect, doesn't mean they have big problems, doesn't mean some departments
[10:40.320 --> 10:45.040]  are totally criminal, that's human nature, absolutely, isn't just some bad apples, sometimes
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.840]  you've got whole barrels that are bad and sometimes whole barrels that are good.
[10:49.840 --> 10:53.440]  I've almost found in my research, it's like there's no bad apples or they're all bad
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.320]  apples, it kind of works like that in life and in history.
[10:56.320 --> 10:59.760]  Most people probably recognize that a restaurant's either totally horrible and out of control
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.480]  and you get sick when you eat there or everything's good on the menu.
[11:04.480 --> 11:11.120]  But separate from that, our country is being taken over by multinational systems that are
[11:11.120 --> 11:15.800]  establishing a form of planetary government called globalism.
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.440]  And I've been fighting for 20 plus years just to expose the fact that that was happening.
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.760]  Now, most Americans know the Federal Reserve is far and owned and private and part of globalism.
[11:25.760 --> 11:28.120]  Most Americans wanted audited or abolished.
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.920]  Most Americans know that the British exit, the Brexit was about getting out of the unelected
[11:31.920 --> 11:35.440]  EU.
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.880]  The Liberty Movement worldwide, the nationalist movement, the movement for prosperity and
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.720]  common sense led by people like Ron Paul and Matt Drudge and Nigel Farage and people
[11:45.720 --> 11:48.400]  like you.
[11:48.400 --> 11:53.360]  And Joseph Farah, and it's not about giving credit here, folks, it's just we understand
[11:53.360 --> 11:58.040]  the people that were their first fighting hardest to show their success to say, look
[11:58.040 --> 12:05.800]  what you can do when you get involved and fight back as well in the information war.
[12:05.800 --> 12:10.400]  And my job has been to just galvanize as many people as I can pointing out what was coming
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.120]  so that as the wages of world government came home to roost, people would be ready to stand
[12:16.120 --> 12:19.880]  up and say no to the next phase.
[12:19.880 --> 12:26.240]  Because if you think stuff's bad right now, none of us have seen anything yet.
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.360]  But I read countless university published books about policing and I studied militarization
[12:31.360 --> 12:37.560]  and I studied pedig on programs, shipping weapons in and I studied the curriculum and
[12:37.560 --> 12:41.760]  what was going on and I got secret documents that we broke nationally over and over again
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.880]  where the police were training to take on gun owners and veterans and confiscate firearms.
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.360]  But the police themselves were being given this curricula, they didn't want to follow
[12:52.360 --> 12:54.360]  it, they were leaking it to us.
[12:54.360 --> 12:59.320]  What I'm saying is, if you don't like the TSA groping your genitals and putting you
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.120]  through a naked body scanner or the border is wide open, I totally agree with you, it's
[13:03.120 --> 13:11.000]  a fraud to train us to be slaves, but let's not blame the TSA person themselves.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.920]  Let's blame ourselves for letting it happen and Congress that did it and then after we've
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.280]  gotten our house in order, then we can talk about the TSA people and Lord knows there's
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.880]  some pedophiles want that job, there's some criminals that rob your bags, there's some
[13:22.880 --> 13:26.000]  bad people in there.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.760]  But the essence of free will and the essence of a free society and the essence of a good
[13:29.760 --> 13:36.640]  society is we go after people for what they individually did, not what happens in groups.
[13:36.640 --> 13:45.360]  Of cops in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week, questionably shoot armed
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.840]  black males during wrestling matches.
[13:49.840 --> 13:52.400]  I don't know if the cops are guilty or not.
[13:52.400 --> 13:53.400]  It's not clear.
[13:53.400 --> 13:57.760]  Let's say they are.
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.040]  Do you then go shoot 15 cops and kill five of them in Dallas?
[14:02.040 --> 14:08.480]  Do you go shoot people on the highway in Georgia and Tennessee and kill a cop and shoot up
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.560]  some cars and shoot up some cars in Florida and shoot up the police station in San Antonio?
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.160]  There's so many of these coming in right now, I can't even keep track of them.
[14:15.160 --> 14:22.960]  There's just cops getting shot all over the place right now.
[14:22.960 --> 14:26.480]  And as I studied this more and more years ago, I realized, oh my gosh, I've been trying
[14:26.480 --> 14:33.360]  to reform the police and when I've done partially, it's helped wake them up faster to the larger
[14:33.360 --> 14:34.360]  globalist program.
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.600]  So I wasn't a complete failure and of course they weren't waking up just because of me.
[14:38.600 --> 14:41.400]  But because of what they were being taught, the founding fathers are bad, Christians
[14:41.400 --> 14:44.960]  are your enemy, veterans are all going to start attacking you, there's going to be
[14:44.960 --> 14:48.760]  a civil war and we're like, yeah, because the globalists are setting one up.
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.480]  That's how they're going to conquer America.
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.480]  Then it all clicked.
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.800]  Oh, government that has a 9% approval rating in Gallup and a 6% approval rating for the
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.280]  media in Gallup and AP, they want to basically scapegoat the police and have a civil war
[15:05.280 --> 15:12.080]  that is only about trying to overthrow the police when they're the lowest level of government
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.000]  so that none of the real revolution ever goes against the globalists that have actually
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.560]  come in and hijacked the country because it's not a revolution, it's a restoration.
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.240]  And so we have a false revolution just based on killing cops that discredits any legitimate
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.920]  resistance of the future.
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.040]  And then you understand the larger plan and exactly what we're facing and what we're dealing
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.040]  with.
[15:36.040 --> 15:40.600]  Folks, when you've got Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter all saying Black Lives
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.360]  Matter and censoring folks that exposed it and Hillary Clinton saying, well, it's white
[15:44.360 --> 15:50.920]  people's fault this happened and all the Dallas mayors saying that and acting like,
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.760]  well, police must reform like Obama said, like, that is an attempt to make this 10
[15:55.760 --> 15:56.760]  times worse.
[15:56.760 --> 15:57.760]  This is an attempt over the country.
[15:57.760 --> 16:02.120]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an
[16:02.120 --> 16:06.240]  outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.240]  Here's why.
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.080]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[16:11.080 --> 16:12.160]  So please listen.
[16:12.160 --> 16:17.360]  Solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators,
[16:17.360 --> 16:21.560]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the
[16:21.560 --> 16:22.560]  sun.
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.040]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.440]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[16:29.440 --> 16:32.120]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[16:32.120 --> 16:36.720]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.240]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low
[16:41.240 --> 16:45.080]  price for M4Wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[16:45.080 --> 16:48.520]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.360]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[16:52.360 --> 16:55.360]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[16:55.360 --> 17:01.760]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[17:01.760 --> 17:02.760]  nutraceuticals.

[17:48.520 --> 17:52.160]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Young Jevity and the products
[17:52.160 --> 17:54.880]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.800]  Check it out for yourself today.
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.200]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.920]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.280]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.520]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[18:14.520 --> 18:18.240]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[18:18.240 --> 18:21.960]  They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in.
[18:21.960 --> 18:26.480]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[18:26.480 --> 18:28.920]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[18:28.920 --> 18:34.360]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[18:34.360 --> 18:40.160]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[18:40.160 --> 18:41.760]  ever concerning iodine.
[18:41.760 --> 18:43.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.960]  any optimum health regimen.

[18:59.200 --> 19:03.280]  Last week, we pointed out that globalists have declared open season on three individuals
[19:03.280 --> 19:05.360]  and nations worldwide.
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.240]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.200]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.400]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.000]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  It wants to make us dependent.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.840]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.320]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages
[19:25.320 --> 19:28.400]  that are already happening in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.200]  our knees and where we can pitch like to their demands.
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.400]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week because it's all
[19:35.400 --> 19:38.840]  about declaring your independence from the globalist.
[19:38.840 --> 19:42.480]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storeable foods or water
[19:42.480 --> 19:45.480]  filters or shortwave radios at InfowarsStore.com.
[19:45.480 --> 19:50.080]  You declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from
[19:50.080 --> 19:52.280]  the broadcast because there's a warrant for your mind.
[19:52.280 --> 20:02.680]  It's a total 360 win at InfowarsStore.com.
[20:02.680 --> 20:13.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.120 --> 20:16.160]  We are on the march.
[20:16.160 --> 20:18.000]  The Empire is on the run.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:21.920 --> 20:26.360]  All right, so there's a million different angles to this, but I want to go into some
[20:26.360 --> 20:29.400]  clips here and break down what's currently happening and get into all the other attacks
[20:29.400 --> 20:34.800]  of police that are currently taking place.
[20:34.800 --> 20:39.480]  Multinational corporations to a great extent have already captured this country.
[20:39.480 --> 20:44.360]  They want to have Americans at each other's throats, so they have weaponized media, CNN,
[20:44.360 --> 20:50.120]  MSNBC, you name it, local TV stations across the country come out and say, oh my gosh, it
[20:50.120 --> 20:51.960]  is the number one issue in America.
[20:51.960 --> 20:57.840]  The police are hunting down and just executing black men everywhere.
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.880]  This year so far, 2,000-plus people have been shot in Chicago, 90-plus percent black on
[21:03.880 --> 21:05.080]  black.
[21:05.080 --> 21:10.800]  500-plus blacks die a year in Chicago at the hands of other blacks with guns.
[21:10.800 --> 21:12.800]  You can look it up for yourself.
[21:12.800 --> 21:17.640]  I did whole reports on Friday, they're on Infowars.com showing the FBI's own numbers.
[21:17.640 --> 21:23.600]  You tell a black lives matter person that or some other social justice warrior, and they
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.760]  look at you and say, shut up, racist, why do you care about people's lives?
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.000]  And we're just like, look, the truth is, police shootings overall are down.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.880]  The truth is that this is a political diversion from black unemployment being doubled.
[21:40.880 --> 21:48.120]  But if you segue out of that, if Donald Trump gets killed or more Trump supporters get
[21:48.120 --> 21:52.600]  attacked, and then they've set the battle lines with Democrats and the, quote, minorities
[21:52.600 --> 21:58.120]  and Trump and the white people, even if Trump didn't brand it like that, the media has.
[21:58.120 --> 22:04.560]  This is the recipe we've got for major, major civil unrest and so many leftists and so many
[22:04.560 --> 22:09.280]  black lives matter, people on Infowars and on YouTube put comments going, oh, try not
[22:09.280 --> 22:13.720]  to have a civil war, you're scared.
[22:13.720 --> 22:16.760]  The majority of people are white still in this country, even though they're old and
[22:16.760 --> 22:20.680]  mentally ill, and they've got guns and you're not going to win against the military and
[22:20.680 --> 22:22.200]  the police and all this.
[22:22.200 --> 22:26.040]  I'm not trying to stop a civil war because I think I'm going to lose it.
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.560]  I'm trying to stop a civil war because we all lose it, except for the technocrats, they're
[22:30.560 --> 22:31.880]  playing us off against each other.
[22:31.880 --> 22:35.200]  This is so stupid.
[22:35.200 --> 22:41.080]  I go into stores, I work with, quote, African people, great folks, I don't want to fight
[22:41.080 --> 22:42.080]  with anybody.
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.680]  I'm not out to get you.
[22:44.680 --> 22:51.840]  And the media and all these white pimps that I see pushing and George Soros and Hillary
[22:51.840 --> 22:59.640]  and the Dallas mayor and Obama and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, Google, Google, all of them, after
[22:59.640 --> 23:03.040]  the cops got shot, they were putting up big signs saying black lives matter.
[23:03.040 --> 23:06.600]  There were demonstrations all over the country Friday, Saturday and today, and cops being
[23:06.600 --> 23:09.600]  beat up and shot all over the place.
[23:09.600 --> 23:12.560]  And then Loretta Lynch comes out and says, we need to reform the police.
[23:12.560 --> 23:16.040]  That'll fix this, like it's legitimate.
[23:16.040 --> 23:20.320]  Obama, Friday morning came out, we played the clip Friday and said, we need to reform
[23:20.320 --> 23:28.280]  the police, giving credence to the cops that got killed, as if they were connected to
[23:28.280 --> 23:32.840]  something some other cop did, some other place.
[23:32.840 --> 23:35.920]  That's like Hitler saying, oh, some Jew might have done something wrong, so I'm going to
[23:35.920 --> 23:39.440]  arrest all the Jews and I'm going to kill them.
[23:39.440 --> 23:44.120]  And all the black lives matter and Ford Foundation, the big leftist groups, oink, oink, bang, bang,
[23:44.120 --> 23:45.120]  you're dead.
[23:45.120 --> 23:46.120]  We played all the clips Friday.
[23:46.120 --> 23:47.120]  I'm not playing them again today.
[23:47.120 --> 23:48.120]  I mean, I've been to demonstrations myself.
[23:48.120 --> 23:49.120]  My crew has.
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.120]  I've been to demonstrations.
[23:50.120 --> 23:52.560]  You've got mainly white college students.
[23:52.560 --> 23:56.280]  They're leading the chance about deck the halls with dead cops and all this stuff.
[23:56.280 --> 23:58.200]  And the police are told to stand out and do nothing.
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.720]  And the grand juries do nothing because the system wants to build this to a head.
[24:02.720 --> 24:04.040]  Let me explain something.
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.040]  You've got free speech.
[24:05.040 --> 24:12.000]  I'm the number one backer of it, but when you start as a media person with major groups
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.480]  of people that are listening to you, organizing, going out and killing people randomly because
[24:16.480 --> 24:21.040]  of what color they are or because they're wearing a uniform, you're engaged in organizing
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.360]  terrorist attacks.
[24:25.360 --> 24:30.760]  You're involved in racketeering and I've already decided if I'm out in public and I hear somebody
[24:30.760 --> 24:33.200]  saying kill police, I'm going to break their jaw.
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.200]  I'm done.
[24:34.200 --> 24:35.200]  And that's not talk.
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.400]  I'm doing it.
[24:36.400 --> 24:37.560]  You go chanting around me.
[24:37.560 --> 24:41.880]  Hey, let's go kill some fricking cops because they're in a uniform and of course you're
[24:41.880 --> 24:42.880]  too cowardly to do it.
[24:42.880 --> 24:43.880]  You want somebody else to do it?
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.880]  I'm going to punch you right in the face.
[24:45.880 --> 24:48.480]  I don't usually talk like that in 20 years on air.
[24:48.480 --> 24:54.000]  It's not that I'm kissing the cops ass either, but I'm going to explain something to everybody.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.720]  This attack is by multinational corporations trying to bring down America.
[24:59.720 --> 25:05.720]  So as many problems as the police have, they're the face of local government and our due process
[25:05.720 --> 25:07.240]  and what's left of it.
[25:07.240 --> 25:12.320]  And when they bring that down, the whole country's going down in a globalist takeover and then
[25:12.320 --> 25:14.400]  your checks aren't going to cash anymore.
[25:14.400 --> 25:16.280]  There's not going to be any good electricity.
[25:16.280 --> 25:20.640]  This damn society's going to break down like Cuba or Venezuela or Eastern Europe and this
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.600]  country's going to fall apart because it's a design to bring this country down.
[25:25.600 --> 25:32.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch a bunch of stupid high school and college punks
[25:32.000 --> 25:42.400]  fueled by propaganda on MTV and CNN out there stomping around acting like a bunch of jackasses.
[25:42.400 --> 25:43.400]  Excuse me.
[25:43.400 --> 25:44.400]  I apologize.
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.200]  I want to play some clips right now, but I'm telling you, this is an attempt to bring
[25:48.200 --> 25:50.120]  in a civil war in this country.
[25:50.120 --> 25:51.120]  We told you it was coming.
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.480]  It's clearer than day.
[25:52.480 --> 25:54.160]  They're looking at suspending this election.
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.160]  We need to do everything we can to expose this behind this and say no to it.
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.440]  So it backfires and we need to have all the police departments and citizens and everybody
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.640]  of a race, color and greed come together and realize this is an attempt to get us all
[26:05.640 --> 26:10.400]  each other's throats and say no to this because this is 21st century warfare.
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.720]  This is being run by the mainstream media.
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.560]  We know is our enemy by the globalists that run the federal government that we know of
[26:16.560 --> 26:17.560]  hijacked it.
[26:17.560 --> 26:29.080]  I mean, this is a no brainer that the mayor is saying it's white people's fault in Dallas.
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.920]  These old big fat white guy.
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.240]  These people are pimping everyone.
[26:32.240 --> 26:33.240]  I'm done with it.
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.040]  Let's play a clip here.
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.120]  This is a black El Paso police chief.
[26:38.120 --> 26:43.120]  It's record one of the best the country Greg Allen, this is what he had to say to reporters
[26:43.120 --> 26:44.120]  about black lives matter.
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.120]  What do you have to say to people who will be protesting out there on Sunday black lives
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.120]  matters?
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.480]  Black lives matter as far as I'm concerned is a radical hate group and for that purpose
[26:53.480 --> 26:57.160]  alone, I think the leadership of this country needs to look a little bit harder at that
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.160]  particular group.
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.120]  The consequences of what we saw in Dallas is due to their efforts.
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.120]  Any other question?
[27:04.120 --> 27:05.120]  All right.
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.360]  Let's go ahead now and let's go to Obama defending black lives matter while he's over
[27:10.360 --> 27:15.880]  in Europe trying to merge the EU with Eastern Europe after another night of horrific violence
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.320]  which I haven't gotten to yet.
[27:17.320 --> 27:18.320]  Let's go to that.
[27:18.320 --> 27:23.880]  Now, in a movement like black lives matter, there's always going to be some folks who
[27:23.880 --> 27:38.520]  say things that are stupid or imprudent or overgeneralized or are harsh.
[27:38.520 --> 27:45.480]  And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and
[27:45.480 --> 27:53.000]  peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.600]  And there's another clip of him going after guns, but let's blame all gun owners.
[27:56.600 --> 27:59.040]  We're going to go out to break here.
[27:59.040 --> 28:02.680]  We have George Humphrey coming in, studio to talk about all this and a lot more.
[28:02.680 --> 28:05.280]  But when we return, I'll hold George a little bit with us the next hour.
[28:05.280 --> 28:06.760]  Roger Chagall is playing these clips.
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.720]  I have Rudolph Filiani, who I don't agree with a lot of issues.
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.360]  What he said about black lives matter is absolutely on target.
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.600]  We're going to play that.
[28:13.600 --> 28:21.120]  We have Sharpton saying off the pigs, just thought, and again, he's an FBI informant.
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.000]  And the whole FBI is not involved either, but criminal elements in the federal government
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.640]  can only conquer America if we're at each other's throats.
[28:28.640 --> 28:29.640]  This is a no-brainer.
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.640]  This is not my opinion.
[28:30.640 --> 28:31.640]  This is a fact.
[28:31.640 --> 28:57.440]  In FullWars.com, forward slash show, I know most of you are listening on AM and FM stations.
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.720]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you
[29:01.720 --> 29:04.880]  know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[29:04.880 --> 29:06.960]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.680]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.080]  in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.080]  rampant.
[29:17.080 --> 29:20.520]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[29:20.520 --> 29:23.640]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.480]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.760]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional

[30:58.760 --> 31:02.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.720]  Why is this so good?
[31:03.720 --> 31:08.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.040]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.040]  my system.
[31:14.040 --> 31:20.040]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[31:20.040 --> 31:22.080]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[31:22.080 --> 31:27.160]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[31:27.160 --> 31:28.440]  going on everywhere.
[31:28.440 --> 31:29.440]  These are all parasites.
[31:29.440 --> 31:32.160]  Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it.
[31:32.160 --> 31:36.480]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[31:36.480 --> 31:39.760]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:39.760 --> 31:42.800]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in, because I'm going back on it today.
[31:42.800 --> 31:46.880]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[31:46.880 --> 31:53.040]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[31:53.040 --> 31:55.240]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[31:55.240 --> 31:58.960]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[31:58.960 --> 32:02.880]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[32:02.880 --> 32:08.200]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[32:08.200 --> 32:09.200]  by the body.
[32:09.200 --> 32:13.880]  That's why, for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[32:13.880 --> 32:16.720]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[32:16.720 --> 32:21.440]  InfoWarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[32:21.440 --> 32:25.600]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[32:25.600 --> 32:32.320]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[32:32.320 --> 32:36.560]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[32:36.560 --> 32:39.960]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[32:39.960 --> 32:42.040]  No needles, no injections.
[32:42.040 --> 32:43.600]  Don't take my word for it.
[32:43.600 --> 32:45.040]  Try it for yourself.
[32:45.040 --> 32:46.200]  Discover the secret.

[32:55.240 --> 33:02.160]  InfoWars Life Secret 12.
[33:02.160 --> 33:12.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:12.040 --> 33:20.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:20.840 --> 33:24.040]  We've got gunfire hitting the police station in San Antonio.
[33:24.040 --> 33:25.760]  We've got cops shot in Georgia.
[33:25.760 --> 33:31.960]  We've got white drivers shot in Georgia, shot in Tennessee, white cops shot in Tennessee.
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.040]  Cops shot in Florida, cops shot in all over the news.
[33:36.040 --> 33:41.240]  We have video coming up of Al Sharpton saying off the pigs.
[33:41.240 --> 33:44.640]  We've got Obama saying gun control is necessary if you care about the safety of our police
[33:44.640 --> 33:45.640]  officers.
[33:45.640 --> 33:51.120]  As the media just winds up mentally ill people and all these government-funded groups say
[33:51.120 --> 33:55.120]  kill the cops, deck the halls with dead cops, none of them are to blame, though, Obama said.
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.120]  We just played that.
[33:56.120 --> 33:58.360]  No, no, it's gun owners are to blame.
[33:58.360 --> 34:03.480]  Hillary says it is whites and racist cops are to blame, and even though an Asian guy
[34:03.480 --> 34:07.480]  shot this black man that was a felon aiming a gun at him in Houston, even the guy's wife
[34:07.480 --> 34:09.200]  said he aimed a gun at him, the cop shot him.
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.120]  My God, believe these cops, is Asian cop, you aimed a gun at him, he shoots you?
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.840]  I saw comments on Twitter, they're on InfoWars, by Black Lives Matter groups saying, well,
[34:17.840 --> 34:21.720]  white supremacy can operate through minorities.
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.240]  You're an Asian cop, somebody points a gun at you and you defend yourself.
[34:25.240 --> 34:27.520]  Again, and I'm not anti-black people.
[34:27.520 --> 34:33.320]  I want black people to succeed and be successful and they're just amazing, great people.
[34:33.320 --> 34:36.520]  But this is social engineering.
[34:36.520 --> 34:40.840]  This is the media taking an issue that is tiny compared to everything else, like flesh
[34:40.840 --> 34:44.520]  eating bacteria or diabetes or blacks killing blacks or whatever.
[34:44.520 --> 34:47.280]  I mean, you're talking a problem a hundred times better.
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.360]  And just making this the end of the world and mainstream media pushing it and in Google
[34:52.360 --> 34:57.360]  and Facebook pushing it and Facebook lighting up its whole offices Friday saying black
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.240]  lives matter and in Zuckerberg saying don't criticize anybody, you know, that's for black
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.960]  lives matter because his own employees are criticizing it because it's a program to cause
[35:06.960 --> 35:07.960]  infighting.
[35:07.960 --> 35:11.440]  Now let's play Giuliani that I'm going to our guest who's in studio with us.
[35:11.440 --> 35:16.320]  The reality in the black community is there's too much violence in the black community.
[35:16.320 --> 35:23.600]  So a black will die one percent or less at the hands of the police and 99 percent at
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.320]  the hands of a civilian, most often another black.
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.960]  So if you want to protect black lives, then you've got to protect black lives, not just
[35:31.960 --> 35:38.480]  against police, which happens rarely, although with tremendous attention and which happens
[35:38.480 --> 35:44.760]  every 14 hours in Chicago, every 14 hours.
[35:44.760 --> 35:47.840]  And we never hear from black lives matter.
[35:47.840 --> 35:54.320]  So if you want to deal with this on the black side, you've got to teach your children to
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.200]  be respectful to the police and you've got to teach your children that the real danger
[36:00.200 --> 36:06.840]  to them is not the police, the real danger to them 99 out of 100 times, 9,900 out of
[36:06.840 --> 36:10.200]  a thousand times or other black kids who are going to kill them.
[36:10.200 --> 36:11.320]  That's the way they're going to die.
[36:11.320 --> 36:19.400]  So when you say black lives matter, I've got issues with Giuliani on some issues, but
[36:19.400 --> 36:21.520]  I mean there, that is absolute truth.
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.040]  And this is my problem.
[36:23.040 --> 36:31.120]  I have a Justice Department O numbers last year, 258 black Americans were killed by police.
[36:31.120 --> 36:34.120]  Let's just say all of those were illegitimate, even though most of it was probably legitimate.
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.800]  Let's just say all of it's bad.
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's over 500 blacks killed by blacks in Chicago last year.
[36:42.520 --> 36:46.160]  It's 2000 plus shot so far this year in Chicago.
[36:46.160 --> 36:47.160]  It's not the cops.
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.360]  So all I'm saying is I don't like warrantless checkpoints.
[36:50.360 --> 36:51.840]  I don't like DWI blood draws.
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.560]  I don't like a lot of unconstitutional stuff going on the police, but that's our governments
[36:55.560 --> 36:56.560]  that are doing that.
[36:56.560 --> 36:58.400]  That's where we should change it.
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.120]  But it's so clear it's an attempt at causing a civil war and I've been using that term
[37:02.120 --> 37:03.120]  for a long time.
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.200]  Now that's being picked up and you see folks actually calling for a civil war.
[37:08.200 --> 37:14.160]  Now George Humphrey is a very successful businessman, author, researcher, major exporter, importer.
[37:14.160 --> 37:15.160]  You name it.
[37:15.160 --> 37:16.160]  Good friend of mine.
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.080]  Twenty-five years ago when I was working for Pat Buchanan's campaign as I was a high school
[37:22.080 --> 37:24.800]  senior, going to his house to pick up hundreds of signs to go put up around town.
[37:24.800 --> 37:27.040]  And then as soon as I got on access to television, we'll talk radio.
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.040]  He was a talk show host.
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.000]  So I've been friends with this guy really 21 years, but knew him 25 years ago.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.520]  And he was a Democrat in the city council, but he's a patriot and he's somebody that
[37:37.520 --> 37:40.680]  has been warning of this and warning of a destabilization program.
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.040]  He's with us to the bottom of the hour next hour and I have a very special report dealing
[37:44.040 --> 37:47.840]  with NATO talking about trying to move missiles up against the Russian border.
[37:47.840 --> 37:51.560]  They'd be like, if Russia moved missiles into Cuba, this is a big deal.
[37:51.560 --> 37:55.640]  Putin said they're looking at actually bombing those missiles.
[37:55.640 --> 37:58.920]  And so their Ministry of Defense has said that their foreign ministers said that.
[37:58.920 --> 38:00.040]  So this is really escalating.
[38:00.040 --> 38:02.480]  We've got that special report coming up.
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.840]  I tend to take a few calls next hour, but we've got Hillary Clinton blames whites and
[38:06.840 --> 38:08.680]  cops for deaths of young black men.
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.840]  The video articles up on info wars.com from Breitbart.
[38:12.840 --> 38:16.560]  We just have all this craziness and it's just so sad.
[38:16.560 --> 38:20.840]  Don't people know the establishment that's screwing us all over and robbing us all of
[38:20.840 --> 38:23.240]  our freedoms and our future is pushing this.
[38:23.240 --> 38:26.080]  So the question is, why are they pushing it?
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.040]  And then of course, George has some info on Trump and his big concerns.
[38:30.040 --> 38:31.520]  George, great to have you here with us.
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.760]  Alex is always great to be here and I love seeing you.
[38:35.760 --> 38:39.680]  And for those who are listening, I've known Alex for a long time and I'll tell you what,
[38:39.680 --> 38:47.200]  he is a dear friend of mine and what he's saying today is so right on.
[38:47.200 --> 38:51.680]  It's so right on in the period of time that we're in right now.
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.000]  It's chaos and it's fixing to get a lot, lot, lot worse in the near future.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.980]  And so that's why it's up to us who are sitting in the studio, but more as importantly or
[39:02.980 --> 39:10.000]  more importantly to the people who are listening, our country, our republic, our culture, our
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.680]  world is worth preserving.
[39:14.680 --> 39:17.640]  The good things of this nation are so overwhelming.
[39:17.640 --> 39:19.640]  I travel all over the world.
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.640]  I travel through China, through Southeast Asia, through Europe, through South America.
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.880]  And I'll tell you what, the republic, the constitutional republic of this country where
[39:29.880 --> 39:32.760]  there is supposedly a nation of laws.
[39:32.760 --> 39:37.320]  This is something a very, very positive thing and quite clearly the things that Alex and
[39:37.320 --> 39:43.520]  I have been talking about on air for the last 25 years is that there is a concentrated,
[39:43.520 --> 39:49.680]  very focused movement by the Illuminati to destroy the middle class, to destroy the good
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.680]  things of this country.
[39:50.680 --> 39:52.680]  And it's anti-human.
[39:52.680 --> 39:53.680]  Absolutely.
[39:53.680 --> 39:54.680]  It's anti.
[39:54.680 --> 39:56.640]  Listen to what Alex has said.
[39:56.640 --> 39:58.800]  It's anti-human.
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.440]  Human beings don't go in and kill 55 people in a club.
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.680]  They don't do these things unless they're Manchurian candidates.
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.840]  One issue after another issue after another issue, just in the last two or three weeks,
[40:13.840 --> 40:17.480]  it is so absolutely clear and powerful.
[40:17.480 --> 40:19.440]  We're facing an evil intellect.
[40:19.440 --> 40:23.200]  That the Manchurian candidate vibration is out there.
[40:23.200 --> 40:28.120]  And then the question is, first of all, we have to be aware that the predominant media
[40:28.120 --> 40:29.960]  is completely manipulated.
[40:29.960 --> 40:33.560]  I can't believe the cops weren't even cold and they were blaming the cops.
[40:33.560 --> 40:34.560]  Absolutely.
[40:34.560 --> 40:36.080]  I mean, the president was on Friday.
[40:36.080 --> 40:37.080]  This is incredible.
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.560]  You know, Alex, when I was on the city council, you know, I've been kind of a hippie all my
[40:41.560 --> 40:42.560]  life.
[40:42.560 --> 40:47.160]  And you know, I remember being pulled over many times in Houston when I had long hair
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.480]  and being pushed around.
[40:48.480 --> 40:49.800]  And I didn't like it.
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.080]  But I was also a city councilman and I helped run the police department in the city.
[40:54.080 --> 40:57.200]  And we had a heck of a good police department.
[40:57.200 --> 40:58.200]  Very fadwards.
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.920]  He was a peace officer.
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.600]  And during the 70s and the 80s, the city of Austin had one of the finest police departments
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.600]  in the country because the police cared about the people.
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.760]  We still have a lot of good police here in Austin, Texas right now.
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.120]  And just like you're saying, we are not defending the police 100% because if there's a clear
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.200]  plan to just overthrow everything, absolutely, this is a hack on America.
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.480]  And if a policeman breaks the law, he should be tried and convicted.
[41:29.480 --> 41:35.200]  But what is going on right now, as you're saying so eloquently, it's unbelievable that
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.880]  these people believe it.
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.480]  And they're like, oh, yeah, we got the president and the attorney general, we got to reform
[41:41.480 --> 41:44.160]  the cops in response to cops being dead.
[41:44.160 --> 41:45.360]  It's their fault they're dead.
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.440]  It's their fault they got shot.
[41:47.440 --> 41:48.440]  What the hell?
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.960]  And you know where this is coming from.
[41:49.960 --> 41:56.800]  This is not coming from somebody like Malcolm X or somebody like this, George Soros, a Nazi
[41:56.800 --> 41:59.520]  collaborator, Hillary Clinton, all these globalists.
[41:59.520 --> 42:08.760]  He is a Hungarian communist billionaire who, his track record, it is white communist Illuminati
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.680]  Stooges who are funding this, who are paying these black lives matter.
[42:13.680 --> 42:14.680]  They admit that.
[42:14.680 --> 42:17.920]  $16 an hour to go out and do this stuff.
[42:17.920 --> 42:18.920]  Friends, please.
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.600]  Why is George Soros not arrested?
[42:20.600 --> 42:22.560]  He is involved in sedition.
[42:22.560 --> 42:29.120]  Of course he is, because we are, we are, the situation in this country is past the rule.
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.680]  The truth is, you can look at Soros, he's tied into the dark side.
[42:31.680 --> 42:32.680]  Of course, of course.
[42:32.680 --> 42:35.840]  He has orders directly from the fricking.
[42:35.840 --> 42:37.600]  And he wants to be part of the Illuminati.
[42:37.600 --> 42:39.320]  He's still a small time guy.
[42:39.320 --> 42:41.120]  He's getting direct orders from hell, folks.
[42:41.120 --> 42:43.960]  Look, I'll just say it, your new book's out, it's about where they're getting the orders
[42:43.960 --> 42:44.960]  from.
[42:44.960 --> 42:45.960]  It's satanic, folks.
[42:45.960 --> 42:46.960]  Life, love and joy.
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.360]  George Humphrey, my good friend.
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.360]  These people are out to get the whole planet.
[42:49.360 --> 42:52.360]  I don't care what color you are, you got to unite against them.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.040]  There's her to be shot in the back.
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.480]  You're due to five cops in Dallas.
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.560]  Last week, we pointed out that globalists have declared open season on free individuals
[43:02.560 --> 43:04.640]  and nations worldwide.
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.520]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.480]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[43:12.480 --> 43:14.680]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[43:14.680 --> 43:17.280]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.560]  It wants to make us dependent, it wants to cut off our economies, it wants to be able
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.120]  to set up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages that are already
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.840]  happening in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to our knees and where
[43:28.840 --> 43:30.520]  we can pitch like to their demands.
[43:30.520 --> 43:34.720]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week because it's all
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.160]  about declaring your independence from the globalist.
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.800]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality storeable foods or water
[43:41.800 --> 43:44.840]  filters or shortwave radios at m4store.com.
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.400]  We declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from
[43:49.400 --> 43:51.600]  the broadcast because there's a warrant for your mind.
[43:51.600 --> 44:21.560]  That's a total 360 win at m4store.com.

[44:34.760 --> 44:39.560]  That's why I'm a member of the young Jebedy team at m4store.com and you can be too.

[45:06.880 --> 45:08.440]  A 360 win.
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.400]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[45:13.400 --> 45:15.000]  at m4store.com.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.840]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.920]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[45:22.920 --> 45:28.160]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.400]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the
[45:32.400 --> 45:34.040]  products that you need each month.
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.640]  Just go to m4store.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto-ship and
[45:38.640 --> 45:41.760]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[45:41.760 --> 45:47.080]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto-ship feature at m4store.com,
[45:47.080 --> 45:48.480]  this is a sure win.
[45:48.480 --> 45:50.040]  10% off on auto-ship.
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.440]  Win, win, win at m4store.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.760]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.880]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from m4store.com.
[46:02.880 --> 46:06.880]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[46:06.880 --> 46:10.320]  and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.160]  The all-new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at m4store.com is loaded with a full month
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.760]  supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[46:21.760 --> 46:26.200]  In the history of m4store.com, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[46:26.200 --> 46:29.640]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[46:29.640 --> 46:34.520]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[46:34.520 --> 46:39.320]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.680]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[46:43.680 --> 46:49.080]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[46:49.080 --> 46:50.840]  quality lab standard.
[46:50.840 --> 46:52.280]  That means it's clean.
[46:52.280 --> 46:53.280]  That means it's pure.
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.360]  That's m4store.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[46:56.360 --> 47:02.520]  Take action now before we sell out.
[47:02.520 --> 47:11.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.680 --> 47:13.480]  We are on the march.
[47:13.480 --> 47:16.520]  The empire is on the run.
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[47:20.520 --> 47:22.520]  We're living on the edge.
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.200]  Folks, we're going to give this some really heavy stuff because I'm noticing that people
[47:27.200 --> 47:29.200]  are more awake or they're like zombies now.
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.080]  People I've known for 20, 30 years suddenly just hardly talk and just watch TV all day.
[47:34.080 --> 47:35.760]  They're in a mesmerized state.
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.440]  Even mainstream media admits most kids have lower language skills, are in a dream state,
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.440]  are brain damage.
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.720]  They have this new Pokemon system where it projects false reality into the real world
[47:45.720 --> 47:49.760]  and you wear these goggles and use your phone and play Pokemon on the real world and kids
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.560]  are like collapsing and stuff and having convulsions that's happened before.
[47:53.560 --> 47:57.600]  The point is there's a lot of weird stuff going on, a lot of really advanced things
[47:57.600 --> 47:58.600]  going on.
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.240]  And so when you see this whole Black Lives Matter thing, I told the story Friday, Thursday,
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.720]  the day this happened, I was supposed to go meet with a supplement maker who had come
[48:09.720 --> 48:13.320]  up with a supplement over a decade ago that was put in Whole Foods that's really high
[48:13.320 --> 48:18.600]  quality but never took off nationally that I was looking at trying to have an acquisition
[48:18.600 --> 48:19.600]  of.
[48:19.600 --> 48:20.600]  That's what we do.
[48:20.600 --> 48:21.600]  We fund ourselves with products.
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.960]  Got a big sale going right now that is tomorrow, 24% off and for store.com, but I digress.
[48:27.960 --> 48:29.080]  She couldn't go to the meeting.
[48:29.080 --> 48:35.880]  She said, I am the guy I had a baby with, he's moved back to India, but he's Indian.
[48:35.880 --> 48:36.880]  My son's five years old.
[48:36.880 --> 48:37.880]  He's half Indian.
[48:37.880 --> 48:38.880]  He's brown.
[48:38.880 --> 48:39.880]  The police are going to kill him.
[48:39.880 --> 48:40.880]  I'm scared to go out.
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.040]  I had to sit there to a person who's successful in business and go, Indians don't even show
[48:45.040 --> 48:47.040]  up on the police shooting rate.
[48:47.040 --> 48:52.320]  Indians probably have some white collar crime, but there's no known Indians being shot and
[48:52.320 --> 48:53.320]  didn't matter to her.
[48:53.320 --> 48:54.320]  She's brown.
[48:54.320 --> 48:55.320]  He's brown.
[48:55.320 --> 48:56.320]  He's brown.
[48:56.320 --> 48:59.760]  He's in control where people really believe this is an epidemic.
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.200]  This was an example of someone completely living in fear.
[49:03.200 --> 49:04.960]  Forget if the police are good or bad.
[49:04.960 --> 49:09.880]  This woman is literally sitting there in her nice house, their nice car, a successful
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.000]  business person, shaking in fear that cops are going to kill her son because he's brown.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.960]  It's total BS, George.
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.840]  Well, first of all, what we need to remember, what I need to keep remembering is that white,
[49:21.840 --> 49:26.560]  black, Hispanic, Asian, we're all human beings.
[49:26.560 --> 49:28.680]  Cops have not shot any Indians that I know of.
[49:28.680 --> 49:30.680]  We're all part of God's creation.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.680]  Exactly.
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.680]  But it's not...
[49:32.680 --> 49:33.680]  You know what?
[49:33.680 --> 49:41.440]  I have a lot of friends who are of color, and my friends of color are more aware of
[49:41.440 --> 49:45.480]  the New World Order relatively than most of the white people.
[49:45.480 --> 49:46.480]  That's what I found.
[49:46.480 --> 49:47.480]  And...
[49:47.480 --> 49:48.480]  Is that why they're being targeted?
[49:48.480 --> 49:55.680]  Absolutely, because they separate and control, separate and control, separate and control.
[49:55.680 --> 50:04.520]  By and large, most black people, most African-Americans are aware of the New World Order.
[50:04.520 --> 50:05.920]  They want freedom.
[50:05.920 --> 50:10.600]  They've known direct slavery, and they're aware of the insanity.
[50:10.600 --> 50:12.160]  This is an absolute...
[50:12.160 --> 50:14.160]  So they're users of the detonator, though.
[50:14.160 --> 50:15.360]  Of course they are.
[50:15.360 --> 50:22.200]  And the thing about it is, remember that all of black lives matter is being funded by Eastern
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.160]  European, Hungarian communists through this.
[50:27.160 --> 50:30.840]  And most of the people saying the most outrageous things are white punks.
[50:30.840 --> 50:31.840]  They're the leaders.
[50:31.840 --> 50:32.840]  They're white punks.
[50:32.840 --> 50:39.320]  I've dealt with two or three of these kids in the last couple of weeks, and it's like,
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.640]  you are unbelievable.
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.200]  And most of the black people that I've talked to in the last two or three weeks, they're
[50:45.200 --> 50:48.000]  just rolling their eyes.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  No, I agree.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  I agree.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  But the media...
[50:51.000 --> 50:52.000]  The blacks aren't buying anything.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  No, I agree.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  But the media takes it and makes it look like that.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Of course it is.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.600]  George, I mean, let's talk about, you're a smart guy, business, politics, you name it.
[50:57.600 --> 50:58.680]  What is the point of this?
[50:58.680 --> 51:02.480]  Because to me, it's so ridiculous to have Hillary and the mayor of Dallas and Obama
[51:02.480 --> 51:04.800]  blaming the cops and white people and all this.
[51:04.800 --> 51:06.640]  Obviously, this is their own doing.
[51:06.640 --> 51:08.240]  They've set this up.
[51:08.240 --> 51:09.240]  What is the point of all this?
[51:09.240 --> 51:10.240]  Okay.
[51:10.240 --> 51:15.920]  Well, you and I both know that a magician waves his hand up here with the wand, and it
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.760]  gets everybody looking up here.
[51:17.760 --> 51:18.760]  But he's picking you up.
[51:18.760 --> 51:21.680]  So what are they doing while we're doing this, while we're watching this?
[51:21.680 --> 51:29.880]  They're creating a civil war and destroying us, because America is the last bastion of
[51:29.880 --> 51:30.880]  freedom.
[51:30.880 --> 51:36.400]  As Thomas Paine used to say, America can be the beacon of freedom for the rest of the
[51:36.400 --> 51:37.400]  world.
[51:37.400 --> 51:38.400]  That's it.
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.400]  That's it.
[51:39.400 --> 51:45.200]  And not only our country, but all of the good things that all human beings desire.
[51:45.200 --> 51:47.560]  That's how they tried to take over our institutions.
[51:47.560 --> 51:50.400]  They haven't been fully successful, so now they're going to take a wreck and ball to
[51:50.400 --> 51:51.400]  it.
[51:51.400 --> 51:52.400]  Yes.
[51:52.400 --> 51:59.440]  And the point is, is that if we human beings, if we use our common sense and we have a little
[51:59.440 --> 52:04.080]  bit of love in our hearts and a little bit of courage in our spines, we can easily see
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.240]  through this.
[52:05.240 --> 52:08.720]  And we have, I'm a relative optimist.
[52:08.720 --> 52:16.280]  I know, I know that we as human beings, black, white, all of us together, we can stop this
[52:16.280 --> 52:17.280]  stuff.
[52:17.280 --> 52:18.280]  We do.
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.280]  That's it.
[52:19.280 --> 52:20.280]  I don't want us to be conned and be failures.
[52:20.280 --> 52:24.520]  Because I love everybody, and I have to sit here and just watch this government funded
[52:24.520 --> 52:25.520]  crap.
[52:25.520 --> 52:26.520]  It's so ridiculous.
[52:26.520 --> 52:30.160]  You know, I've known Alex for a long, long time.
[52:30.160 --> 52:32.280]  And you know what?
[52:32.280 --> 52:38.320]  There is not a person in this country who's talking about equal rights any more than you
[52:38.320 --> 52:39.560]  are.
[52:39.560 --> 52:44.920]  Because it takes, it's going to take all of us fighting this insanity.
[52:44.920 --> 52:46.520]  It's going to take all of us.
[52:46.520 --> 52:52.760]  And so for the listeners out there who are not white middle class people who are supposedly
[52:52.760 --> 52:56.600]  the rednecks, we're all in this together, slavery.
[52:56.600 --> 52:59.280]  It used to be the blacks were the slaves we saw.
[52:59.280 --> 53:00.960]  Now everyone is a slave.
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.960]  It's psychological slavery.
[53:02.960 --> 53:05.960]  The only way the slave master can win is playing this off against each other.
[53:05.960 --> 53:06.960]  Yes.
[53:06.960 --> 53:09.000]  I see desperation in Hillary and the globalist.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  Of course.
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  Let's get to the big point.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.320]  You came in with some very chilling statements, because I respect you.
[53:14.320 --> 53:16.440]  Stuff you've warned me about has always come true.
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.440]  You warned me about derivatives.
[53:17.440 --> 53:23.880]  Ten years before I knew what they were, George Humphrey, bestselling author, researcher, businessman.
[53:23.880 --> 53:26.120]  What is going on with Donald Trump?
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.960]  You were telling me earlier, yes, he's for real, but they're going to kill him.
[53:28.960 --> 53:31.840]  Well, I didn't say they're going to kill him.
[53:31.840 --> 53:33.160]  That's a possibility.
[53:33.160 --> 53:38.680]  Now all we have to, history repeats itself, in 1980 Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan,
[53:38.680 --> 53:49.280]  they had a Rangate, 1991 we had Waco in Oklahoma City when Bill Clinton came in, 2001 we had
[53:49.280 --> 53:59.120]  9-11, these are all false flag, 2008 we had the controlled breakdown of the economy.
[53:59.120 --> 54:05.080]  There's a very high possibility that there's going to be a major, and if you look at this,
[54:05.080 --> 54:10.200]  all these false flags have progressed in magnitude.
[54:10.200 --> 54:11.600]  And so what we're looking at-
[54:11.600 --> 54:13.320]  God, the next one's going to be huge.
[54:13.320 --> 54:14.600]  It could be.
[54:14.600 --> 54:21.000]  And the only way we stop it is to be aware of it right now, to do everything we can to
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.960]  diffuse that and to put it out.
[54:22.960 --> 54:25.800]  That's right, because the enemy knows we're aware they're going to back off.
[54:25.800 --> 54:30.440]  Clearly, clearly, Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[54:30.440 --> 54:35.240]  You know, back in the 90s, I wrote a couple books, one called Common Sense and another
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.640]  called Uncommon Sense, I went up to Arkansas and I met with a bunch of researchers up there.
[54:40.640 --> 54:45.160]  I went to me in Arkansas, I did the whole thing, and there's a whole list of the 82
[54:45.160 --> 54:53.080]  different people between 1979 and 1992, between the ages of 12 and 57, who all died violent
[54:53.080 --> 54:54.080]  deaths.
[54:54.080 --> 54:57.680]  But their only common denominator was their connection with the Clintons.
[54:57.680 --> 55:02.000]  I'm not the one who came up with this, it's all over the Internet, and anybody listening
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  to this can check it out.
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.120]  It's called Arkansas.
[55:04.120 --> 55:09.960]  It's called Arkansas, just like Bill Clinton's father was not Clinton.
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.800]  You know who Bill Clinton's real father was.
[55:11.800 --> 55:12.800]  Rockefeller.
[55:12.800 --> 55:15.000]  Yeah, Bill Clinton is a Rockefeller.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.080]  That's the reason he got to go to Georgetown, that's the reason he got a Rhodes Scholarship.
[55:19.080 --> 55:23.880]  That's the way he got to Russia without a visa, that's the way he got to Yale Law School,
[55:23.880 --> 55:29.640]  that's the way he got elected, the Attorney General of Arkansas at age 26, come on, folks,
[55:29.640 --> 55:30.640]  let's wake up.
[55:30.640 --> 55:37.200]  Now, I think that about 85 to 95% of the people who are listening to this probably know this,
[55:37.200 --> 55:40.640]  but the point is, is that it is up to us, the people who are-
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.560]  We'll finish your earpiece here on the break, you don't need it.
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.720]  Listen to this show, is that it is up to us to build our base.
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.480]  We have to get, we need to reach a critical mass.
[55:50.480 --> 55:56.000]  When each of you who are listening understand you are powerful, you have the ability to
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.640]  make a change, and as Mahatma Gandhi used to say, in the heart of each man and woman
[56:00.640 --> 56:02.120]  is the seed of the universe.
[56:02.120 --> 56:07.600]  No matter what color you are, how much money you've got, da-da-da-da-da-da, realize that
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.200]  what we're saying and what you're hearing and what you know to be true is that love
[56:13.200 --> 56:16.640]  and justice and right action is important.
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.760]  We do not need to go down this road toward chaos, and that's exactly what is being planned
[56:21.760 --> 56:22.760]  for us.
[56:22.760 --> 56:25.240]  It's so naked, though, George, when you're awake.
[56:25.240 --> 56:29.960]  I mean, I look at Hillary saying it's white people's fault, and I look at Obama saying
[56:29.960 --> 56:32.640]  that it's just legitimizing this.
[56:32.640 --> 56:33.880]  They want this to get worse.
[56:33.880 --> 56:35.360]  Of course.
[56:35.360 --> 56:36.360]  Of course.
[56:36.360 --> 56:37.880]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.520]  You and I did too.
[56:39.520 --> 56:40.520]  You were the lead guy.
[56:40.520 --> 56:46.000]  We did fall, fall the republic and the Obama deception, and we said Obama would do this
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  in this.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.840]  In fact, he did about three times more.
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.560]  Nobody but nobody except you is talking about the TPP.
[56:55.560 --> 56:59.440]  It makes NAFTA and GATT seem like child's play.
[56:59.440 --> 57:06.040]  The TPP sells the sovereignty of this country, and nobody's talking about it.
[57:06.040 --> 57:10.200]  World government's coming in, taking full control of our lives, and we're sitting here
[57:10.200 --> 57:15.560]  seeing civil war be started in America and police attacks across the country as if police
[57:15.560 --> 57:20.520]  that are run by our governments that we elect and control are the problem.
[57:20.520 --> 57:23.600]  We need to look ourselves in the mirror, and we need to look government in the mirror and
[57:23.600 --> 57:25.040]  take it back.
[57:25.040 --> 57:27.240]  This is out of control.
[57:27.240 --> 57:30.760]  Second hour with George Humphrey, my friend, straight ahead, we'll talk about his book
[57:30.760 --> 57:36.040]  that gets into who are the Illuminati, who pulls their strings, why are they so unified?
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.880]  Life, Love, Joy, George Humphrey, the new book, we'll tell you how to get it straight
[57:40.880 --> 57:41.880]  ahead.
[57:41.880 --> 57:48.880]  I hope you guys have a huge special going in InfowarsStore.com.

[58:18.040 --> 58:21.400]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[58:21.400 --> 58:26.600]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[58:26.600 --> 58:29.760]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[58:29.760 --> 58:35.040]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.560]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[58:48.840 --> 58:50.840]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[58:50.840 --> 58:52.120]  It took you over a year to do it.
[58:52.120 --> 58:53.320]  Why is this so good?
[58:53.320 --> 58:56.200]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[58:56.200 --> 58:58.640]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[58:58.640 --> 59:01.680]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.880]  from food and water and beverages in my system,
[59:03.880 --> 59:07.800]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[59:07.800 --> 59:10.400]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[59:10.400 --> 59:12.160]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:12.160 --> 59:15.960]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[59:15.960 --> 59:18.520]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[59:18.520 --> 59:19.840]  These are all parasites.
[59:19.840 --> 59:20.960]  Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[59:20.960 --> 59:22.280]  There's so many things that are in it.
[59:22.280 --> 59:23.520]  You have the neem in there.
[59:23.520 --> 59:26.720]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:26.720 --> 59:28.880]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[59:28.880 --> 59:30.040]  at least twice a year.
[59:30.040 --> 59:31.720]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.120]  because I'm going back on it today.
[59:33.120 --> 59:34.120]  It just came back in yesterday.
[59:34.120 --> 59:36.080]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.880]  And folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff
[59:37.880 --> 59:39.680]  that's great for your body, period.
[59:39.680 --> 59:43.040]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:43.040 --> 59:45.320]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:45.320 --> 59:46.520]  Thank you so much for all your work,
[59:46.520 --> 59:47.880]  sir, on this great product.
[59:52.360 --> 59:55.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.920]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.320]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.880]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.480]  By the way, it's not about credit.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.160]  My crew doesn't want credit neither do I.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.520]  But George, I'm pretty trying to give me credit.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.360]  This guy is amazing.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.760]  I learned so much from him 25 years ago,
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.440]  20 years ago, 10 years ago, a year ago, five minutes ago.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.120]  But also, Nico and Daria and Wes
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.800]  and just all the rest of the crew,
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.960]  everybody there amazing, making this all possible.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.840]  You, the listeners, the affiliates,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.480]  I am very honored to be here,
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.360]  trying to just have prosperity, common sense,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.320]  peace among men and women, and just brotherly love.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.640]  The problem is, throughout history,
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.120]  there's an unseen force.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.920]  Christians call it the devil.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.400]  That is manipulating human society.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.160]  We're gonna talk about that more in the next segment.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.840]  I wanna take a few calls as well before George leaves us
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.840]  at about 45 after when I air this special report
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.000]  on Putin warning of nuclear war that's so important.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.240]  It's gotten no attention, so we're gonna air it.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.200]  But the toll-free number to join us, different number
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.680]  than the weekday number, 877-789-ALUX,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.880]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.120]  I'm not gonna say first-time callers,
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.080]  I'm just saying have a good phone,
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.160]  have your point, your question,
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.720]  we really wanna talk to you.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.160]  877-789-ALUX.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.960]  All right, George, we got three minutes, four minutes to break.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.040]  Look, I don't know how the whole universe works.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.800]  We're born on this planet in the middle of space,
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.680]  we're on a sun.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.360]  What is this, it's all crazy.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.520]  But I've studied history,
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.360]  every ancient society said there's a dark evil force
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.360]  manipulating through the ether, from the sky,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.360]  from another dimension, to try to destroy humanity.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.480]  And then I see our own elite.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.240]  There's no doubt they're trying to destroy the creation,
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.440]  the genetics, the planet, us.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.920]  Well, always posing that they're our saviors.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.480]  Now, I haven't read your book yet, just got it today,
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.040]  I know you're a really smart guy.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.180]  But basically, you get into the unseen hand.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.760]  What's behind the Illuminati?
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.960]  Well, I know whether it's Bohemian Grove
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.360]  or Skellenbos or any group,
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.120]  they believe they're praying to entities
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.080]  in another dimension that are giving them knowledge.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.100]  And then I look at Darwin and Huxley
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.960]  and all these people, they envisioned biometrics, DNA,
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.080]  atomic weapons, 100 years before they were being used.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.080]  So, whatever it is, humans who believe they're interfacing
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.040]  was something on the other side, aren't getting something.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.400]  I mean, there's something to this.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.400]  There's no question in, and the one called Jesus,
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.840]  his real name was Yeshua Ben Joseph.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.320]  He put an amazing soul on this planet.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.440]  Now, his family, they were from an Asin family,
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.800]  but they were also Nazarene.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.680]  The Nazarenes were kind of like the hippies
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.520]  of the Mediterranean.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.880]  They were very, very cool,
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.520]  and they knew the prophecies and everything.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.080]  In the mid 1940s, the Nag Hammadi,
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.700]  these texts were found in Egypt,
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.680]  and they were very well done.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.040]  And they were the writings of the Asins and the Nazarenes
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.680]  about what they saw as the world, as what was going on.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.720]  40% of what they talked about was called
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.440]  the Arcanic Energy, and the Nazarenes,
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.920]  who were part of the tradition of the one called Jesus,
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.280]  wrote that there was a dark force, an energy,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.200]  called the Arcanes, that were not biological,
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.280]  but it was sentient energy that comes down to-
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.600]  The Arabs call them genies.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.840]  Of course, of course, I won't go into that
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.300]  because I have some pretty dark opinions
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.040]  about some of the people who are doing this,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.240]  but why are human beings acting so crazy?
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.200]  Why are we doing this?
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.360]  If you talk to 99 out of 100 people,
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.960]  we can figure out how to make this world better,
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.800]  just like this.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.280]  I'm not racist, I don't wanna screw people over.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.200]  No, we want them to be.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.880]  I don't have bad will.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.200]  As you said before, a rising tide lifts all ships.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.400]  We want there to be prosperity for everybody,
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.560]  but there is a force in this universe.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.560]  There is a force in this galaxy,
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.680]  there is a force in this solar system,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.000]  and there's a force on this planet
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  that is intentionally creating chaos
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.760]  and eating off of that energy.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.800]  It's called the Arcanic Force.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.560]  And you know about this, I know about this, it's all over.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.920]  And the point is, is that we as human beings
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.840]  represent the highest vibration,
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.160]  a potential vibration of universal consciousness.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.880]  Now our DNA is still relatively simple,
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.880]  but it has the potential to grow.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.440]  We'll talk about it more.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.520]  We're gonna talk about that more on Tuesday,
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.680]  you're coming back in Tuesday,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.160]  and look, whether people believe this or not,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.000]  I've studied the elites, they believe this,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.040]  but they are like tuned into the evil thinking,
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.480]  it's gonna give them some power,
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.440]  and they're gonna build a machine
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.640]  and merge with it and be gone.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.480]  Absolutely.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.920]  They're throwing out everything we've already got
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.440]  to this promise of something they're getting.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.360]  It's just incredible, say with us.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.560]  Last week, we pointed out
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.680]  the globalists have declared open season
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.600]  on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.440]  When the British left the Euro,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.560]  the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.680]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.480]  no matter how many crimes she commits.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.720]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.320]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.720]  It wants to make us dependent.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.160]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.560]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.840]  where there are food shortages
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.560]  that are already happening in most parts of the world
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.680]  where they basically bring us to our knees
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.400]  and where we can pitch like their demands.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.800]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.240]  right through next week,
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.040]  because it's all about declaring your independence
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.160]  from the globalist.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.840]  You don't just declare independence
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.600]  when you buy high quality, durable foods
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.840]  or water filters or shortwave radios at m4store.com.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.960]  You declare independence when you share links
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.120]  of articles and videos and information from the broadcast
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.480]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.040]  It's a total 360 win at m4store.com.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:17.360]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time,
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.160]  run on for a long time.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.200]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down,
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.720]  sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:31.600]  I was during that 62nd break, ran in to get a glass of iced tea.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.400]  And there was Obama on Fox News at NATO,
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.640]  ready to play the clip last hour, but it was a new clip.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.720]  It said live, this is going on like 10 o'clock at night
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.960]  over there or something, blaming tension and racism
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.240]  in communities for the cops getting shot in Dallas
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.480]  and saying gun controls the answer.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.560]  The media hyped all this.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.720]  There isn't an epidemic of blacks being shot by police.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.600]  There's an epidemic of drug laws putting nonviolent people
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.880]  in jail, including blacks and Hillary and Clinton
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.000]  got that through.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.720]  And again, it's not about even being a Republican
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.600]  and blaming Democrats.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.960]  I'm not a Republican.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.720]  It's just logic and facts.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.360]  It's not true, but it's the victory of perception
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.440]  over reality, delusion, delusion, lies.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.760]  And who's the father of lies?
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.520]  George Humphrey, my friend, has written the new book
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.000]  that just came out, available at amazon.com,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.720]  Life, Love, Joy, A Story of Humans Origins,
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.040]  the polarity of present choices and our unrealized potential.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.560]  And everything the globalists do
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.280]  is about suppressing our potential.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.360]  And George, such a sweetheart,
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.160]  he's selling this book at cost,
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.760]  but it's a powerful book I just started reading it.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.640]  He'll be back on Tuesdays talking about the book itself.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.640]  But look, George, all I know is everything
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.400]  that social engineers do is about suppressing human potential.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.520]  Everything they do is about cutting off resources.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.680]  Everything they do is about telling us we're ugly,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.440]  we're bad, we're no good.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.960]  When we're not, it's, again, we're falling
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.520]  because we are bought into this system.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.000]  And this system is doing everything it can
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.240]  from keeping us from ascending.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.080]  Absolutely.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.200]  And one of the things that we need to remember
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.560]  is that everything is quantum, everything is light,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.240]  everything is vibration, everything is consciousness.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.480]  That's why in Newtonian physics,
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.080]  every action is an opposite in the order of action.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:21.920]  Absolutely.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.160]  And right now,
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.240]  Every time the enemy hits you.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.320]  In the first five or six dimensions, there's polarity.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.480]  And because there is more energy
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.120]  coming into our solar system,
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.440]  this is not some new age theory, it's just a fact.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.120]  Is that the different polarities,
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.600]  what we call the dark and the light,
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.120]  the yin and yang are getting more powerful.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.520]  The dark is getting darker and the light's getting brighter.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.480]  And the point is, is that each and every one of us,
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.720]  as human beings, have a choice.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.880]  We can continue to be controlled
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.520]  by the cultural zeitgeist, which is like the Hunger Games,
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:59.520]  and being controlled by the synthetic manipulation
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.280]  of victim consciousness.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280]  And that's exactly what they do.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.600]  Explain that, everything they do.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.760]  Instead, when I get attacked, I feel more powerful
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.080]  and up to defeat it.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.440]  But in victim consciousness, you grovel and submit.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.280]  Absolutely.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.120]  Explain the difference.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.480]  And for whatever reason, you, perhaps myself,
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.880]  many of the people listening,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.960]  we've broken out of what's called
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.760]  the cultural zeitgeist, the synthetic matrix,
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.760]  and we are more connected with our morphogenic field
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.040]  and connect it with the universal,
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.120]  which is universal law, natural law,
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.440]  and what we're really looking at.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.840]  We've broken out of the control paradigm.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.120]  Yes, and we are able, if we continue to keep going,
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.880]  to activate, I don't wanna get too esoteric here,
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.040]  but to activate the energy systems within our body,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.280]  which are called chakras, and to become clear
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.400]  and more aware and more full of light
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.480]  and more self-powerful.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.320]  We human beings-
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.160]  We'll take the Pentagon.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.520]  The separate point you just said.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.280]  The Pentagon in Jade Helm,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.960]  which we never said was martial law,
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.640]  it was a training for martial law,
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.760]  the Pentagon says we must stop
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.160]  independent self-empowered individuals.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.280]  The threat they said was independently conscious individuals
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.760]  outside of the controlled grid.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.720]  Of course it is, isn't it?
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.680]  They actually admit they're scared of that.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.480]  Of course it is because it's all about power.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.080]  And clearly, when we look-
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.040]  They want us to tune into their controlled grid.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.240]  I'm not blaming the Pentagon folks, this is their orders.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.280]  They want us to tune into their wavelength,
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.040]  global government, political correctness,
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.080]  and then just give our will over to that.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.400]  And clearly, as Alex said,
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.720]  we are not blaming most of the military,
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.160]  we're not blaming the Pentagon per se,
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.480]  but we are blaming-
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.320]  Those in control.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.520]  The tip of the pyramid,
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.760]  the people behind the beings behind the Illuminati.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.520]  And because this game, and we're in a game,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.040]  life is a dream, realize it.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040]  Life is a challenge, meet it.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.360]  Life is a game, play it.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.640]  And life is love, accept it.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.040]  But we're in the challenge part.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.440]  And we've got to accept the challenge
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.640]  and realize that most of what we're seeing
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.080]  is a dream or false or it's a zeitgeist,
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.040]  that's not true.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.880]  It's synthetic in nature.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.720]  It's a matrix.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.760]  You and I, and most of the people, we are trinary.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.120]  We've got body, mind, and spirit.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.840]  And we're carbon and we're sentient.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  We have the DNA to become just incredible beings
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.680]  of multidimensional consciousness
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.960]  to bring love and consciousness and do the right thing.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.600]  It's so cool.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.080]  I am such an optimist, but at the same time-
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:36.920]  Exactly.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.520]  All we want to do is build and bring
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.000]  all this goodness of the world.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.280]  And then once you do that,
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.960]  there's the enemy right there trying to block you.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.480]  They're trying to block all this coming in
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.440]  and then they're sitting there demonizing
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.240]  and just attacking local government.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.680]  Just go kill some cop.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.840]  That's how you fix the world.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.640]  No, it's how you bring anarchy and death into the world.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.360]  And just like in the 1500s, the 1600s, 1700s,
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.040]  England, France, Spain, Portugal,
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.520]  they went out and imperialized the whole world.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.440]  They went to Africa.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.160]  They went to South America.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.400]  They went to Asia.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.120]  And the imperialism was spread
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.520]  and they did everything they could
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.120]  to make the people weaker,
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.160]  like bringing in heroin into China.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.280]  The same thing has happened-
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.120]  God, war.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:21.960]  Absolutely.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.600]  The same thing is happening with right now.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  And we need to see through this mirage,
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.520]  see through the illusion,
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.320]  and realize that we do not have to be victims.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.760]  Let me ask you this question then.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.920]  I don't have a desire to have power.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.240]  I don't have a desire to tell people what to,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.520]  in fact, I hate it.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.560]  But at the same time, then,
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.960]  people that want liberty don't want to be in charge.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.760]  So we sit back on evil, run it.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.480]  We have to just go ahead and get in charge
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.920]  to basically destroy their systems
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.080]  and then turn open free systems wide open
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.520]  and then take free sentient beings
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.280]  that want to be awake into that system
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.720]  to try to shift the paradigm.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.480]  But then I don't have the will or desire
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.680]  to even control anything.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.000]  So how do I ever shift that?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.680]  Well, first of all,
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.160]  I'm sure you're aware of the four universal laws.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.640]  The law of attraction,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.600]  the law of conscious manifestation,
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.360]  the law of allowance, and the law of balance and harmony.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.320]  For me, the hardest one is the law of allowance,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.360]  letting other people do their thing.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.000]  But we have to have barriers
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.240]  because being in body, in the spirit-
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.920]  Well, exactly, I'm allowed to have my freedom.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.760]  Right.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.600]  So that doesn't mean you get to run me over.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.560]  Yeah, but if somebody comes in
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.680]  and is gonna mess with us and destroy our families,
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.920]  destroy our culture,
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.120]  it is our right, it is our responsibility
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.920]  to stand up and say, no, this is not gonna happen.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.600]  Isn't that the problem is the good?
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.720]  People have not taken action.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.800]  Absolutely, and even Mahatma Gandhi,
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.800]  I lived five years in India,
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.120]  and I am a Gandhi,
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.000]  Gandhi was incredible,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.120]  but he wasn't totally non-violence.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.560]  He would talk about what is called a hymsa,
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.680]  which most people say is non-violence.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.040]  No, what he said,
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.000]  it is better for a man to go to war and kill
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.800]  than be a coward and say that he is non-violent.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.520]  It takes courage to stand up
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.320]  for what is right and for what is free
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.840]  and what is natural law.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.560]  And that's what we have to do as human beings
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.640]  if we're gonna get through this,
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.640]  because folks, we are in the sixth
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.160]  mass extinction period of time.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.320]  That's right, let's expand on this.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.080]  And the elite are trying to gear us up.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.800]  They're trying to get us ready consciously
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.000]  for human extinction, like it's sexy and cool.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.120]  They're already poisoning your food and your water.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.320]  They're already coming after you.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.560]  They're already destroying every institution.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.520]  Not that it's perfect, but they won't collapse.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.040]  And you have to understand
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.920]  that this is the animating contest of liberty.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.640]  This fight is meant to grow your muscles,
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.080]  culturally, spiritually, intellectually,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.360]  to be even stronger,
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.800]  to be able to deal with the incredible developments
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.160]  that humans are about to have.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.960]  This is the ascension of humanity that's happening right now
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.680]  and the globalists are trying to suppress it.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.960]  Absolutely, and this deal, this game,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.160]  whatever you wanna call this thing,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.880]  it's, you know, I've been doing this for years.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.120]  And this last year and a half,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.400]  my eyes have just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.520]  because there's facade after facade after facade.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.800]  And I know that I don't have all the answers,
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.120]  but I'll tell you what folks, the game is on.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.320]  There's no timeouts right now.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.520]  Every single one of you watching and listening to this,
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.520]  it is essential that we come together.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.560]  First of all, with love in our hearts.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.400]  And we're gonna break.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.880]  Exactly, listen, listen, listen, folks.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.760]  If you wanted to have some violent revolution,
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.600]  I'm not calling for that
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.480]  because information is the way to go.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.200]  If it gets to the corner, we physically fight
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.040]  and then we'll win, don't worry, we're 10 times stronger.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.520]  But if you wanna have revolution against government,
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.080]  it's not some cop at a gas station,
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.720]  pumping gas, you shoot in the back
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.480]  so as kids don't see him at night.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.800]  If you were gonna go after somebody,
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.320]  it'd be George Soros, that's all I'm saying.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.800]  You're a loser when you sit there and attack nameless people.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.080]  A clean toxic free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.160]  zeolites and others.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.120]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.600]  Instead of buying five, six,
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.640]  or even seven different cleansing products,
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.920]  we use decades old scientific research

[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.920]  Brainforce, it's completely different, try a bottle of it.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.520]  Rob Doe designs us.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.680]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.720]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.720]  I've been working all day.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.160]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.160]  I get in here at 8.30.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.840]  I was kind of run down, you know,
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.440]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.720]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.200]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.600]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later,
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.560]  it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.960]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.880]  People really love it, read about it,
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.520]  find out why third-party nutraceutical sites
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.240]  give it such high praise because it really does have
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.200]  the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.720]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.240]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.640]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.320]  took three hours of sleep, got up,
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.400]  took two more Brainforce and came in.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.960]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.960]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.520]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here,
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.560]  host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know,
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.520]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.600]  You've all heard the shocking statistics,
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.560]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.280]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.560]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.760]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.080]  One out of three or four people
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.640]  is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.600]  and everyone knows at least one person
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.320]  with a degenerative disease.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.880]  If you are dealing with a health challenge
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.520]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.800]  and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient,
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.400]  easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials

[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.640]  and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,

[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.720]  But where do you get it?
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.920]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new,

[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.040]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.840]  from virtually any fresh source
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.680]  into clean, healthy drinking water,
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.400]  pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.200]  of an all-new gravity block core
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.920]  with a hybrochromatic shell.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.160]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities,
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.960]  including bacteria, viruses, fluoride,
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.920]  disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:14.880]  You're listening to an infowarst.com frontline report.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:36.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.880]  George Humphrey has the new book out,
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880]  Life's Love, Joy.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.880]  George, you say you get this at Amazon.com?
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.880]  Where else?
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.880]  Amazon.com, Kindle, and maybe another place.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.880]  I don't want to carry it in for hours.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.880]  We'll get it down.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.880]  You know what, Alex, in the past,
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880]  I think that you have sold,
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.880]  I know, don't think you have sold
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.880]  thousands of my other books
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.880]  called Common Sense, Uncommon Sense,
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.880]  9-Eleven, The Great Illusion,
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.880]  and you know what,
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.880]  buy your stuff through, Alex.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.880]  Come on, we've got to support each other.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.880]  No, no, nothing about me.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.880]  No, no, no, no.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.880]  Speaking of plugs, speaking of plugs.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880]  I'm going to plug you because I love you
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.880]  and because you're doing this 24-7, 365,
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.880]  and I'll tell you what,
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.880]  this guy is, you know, he gets mad,
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.880]  he yells, sometimes he exaggerates,
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.880]  but I'll tell you what, he is our guy
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.880]  and we need to support him 100%
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.880]  because what he's saying right now,
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.880]  everybody's got to chill
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.880]  and we've got to get objective
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.880]  and realize that we're being lied to.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.880]  Blacks, white, Hispanics, Asians,
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880]  we've got to stick together.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  Plus, I mean, it's all about, you're right,
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880]  sometimes I exaggerate,
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]  most of the time, I underestimate.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:47.880]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.880]  I mean, all I do is try to tell the truth.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.880]  Just like when we did those movies
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880]  called The Obamity Deception
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.880]  and The Fall of the Rebellion.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.880]  Free time's worse.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.880]  It was much, much worse than what we said.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.880]  Much worse.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]  We did like predict a lot of stuff.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880]  Absolutely.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880]  Those films are free online.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880]  Speaking of plugging, as you mentioned,
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880]  we're running a food special
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880]  with all these civilizations going on,
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.880]  the best quality non-GMO produced right here in the U.S.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  with the top folks up in Utah, the Mormons.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880]  They're the best folks to get swirable foods from.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]  My Patriots apply.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.880]  We sell their whole spectrum of foods.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880]  We have InfoWare Select,
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.880]  which is their whole group of foods,
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.880]  discounted where nobody else can do it.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]  20 to 40% off.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.880]  X2 is about to sell out.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]  That's 20% off.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.880]  All the non-GMO heirloom open pollinated seeds,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.880]  20% off with the Alexa Pure and Pro Pure water filters.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.880]  All of it.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.880]  Optics, shortwave radios, everything.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880]  That ends tomorrow.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.880]  We're call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.880]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.880]  Our crew will answer, take your calls.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:46.880]  And that's how we fund ourselves.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.880]  Free association, high quality products.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880]  These are the very best pharmaceuticals
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880]  you're going to find anywhere.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.880]  The very best non-GMO seeds,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.880]  the very best books, films, materials,
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.880]  just whatever we think is the very best
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.880]  that we get in the lowest prices.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.880]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]  So thank you for the support.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880]  And look, I've sat there, George.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  I've thought a lot about who runs this,
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.880]  who does this, why do these elites want to do this?
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.880]  The globalists will do things that hurt themselves
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.880]  for their larger program.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  And I don't know who runs it.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.880]  So I go with the Isle of Patmos and John the Revelator
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.880]  and Margaret the Beast and World Government and all of that,
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.880]  which says there's this evil outside group
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  coming into control of humanity.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.880]  That fits in with what you're saying in your new book.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.880]  But all I know is whether it's skull and bones,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]  but he didn't grow the elites.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.880]  They believe they're getting information from outside entities.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.880]  And all I know is it's giving them power.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.880]  But separate from that, maybe it's just mental.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  Maybe it's some weird twisted gene,
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  regardless what the globalist you're building
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.880]  is a very, very evil system, George.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.880]  There's no question about it.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.880]  And the fact is that both you and I have been at Bohemia Grove.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.880]  We both know that there are satanic rites going on.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.880]  We both know that there are ritual killings.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]  What is Satanism?
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880]  Let's pull that down.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.880]  It just means it's destructive.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880]  That's a big issue right there.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]  What is Satanism?
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:08.880]  It's hard to say, but it's service to self.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880]  It's service to self.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.880]  And there's a difference supposedly between the 31st,
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.880]  32nd, and 33rd degrees of free masonry.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  And there's a difference
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.880]  between supposedly Lucifer and Satan.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880]  And this is a show all in and of itself.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.880]  But the fact is, is that the one called Satan represents
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  the archonic energy.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.880]  He is here to control human beings, to create chaos,
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.880]  and not allow us our free will.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.880]  Now, everybody has different terms and words for it,
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.880]  but the one called Jesus, Yeshua, and other great teachers.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.880]  We have the ability as human beings right here,
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.880]  right now to transcend this.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.880]  I want to ask you a question then.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.880]  If they sit there and they talk about all of this,
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.880]  I mean, obviously free will is the way to go.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880]  And if we're looking at this,
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.880]  and the elites believe they're following Lucifer,
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.880]  getting powerful Lucifer, then I want to phone calls.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.880]  All I know is that free will is the way to go.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.880]  That's obviously the way to go.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  But so much about what this global system is about
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  is about ending free will.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880]  Absolutely.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  I've got ABC news pieces where they go,
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.880]  everyone will soon get a microchip.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.880]  They've gone from denying all this to admitting it.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  But meanwhile, the churches are totally dead,
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  not talking about it.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  The amazing thing is that the two vice presidents
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.880]  of Google Corporation, Ray Kurzweil and Regina Dugan.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.880]  Ray Kurzweil was called the smartest man in America
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880]  by Bill Gates.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.880]  His two best-selling books are
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.880]  Spiritual Machines and Transhumanism is Now.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.880]  He is actively advocating the creation
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  of binary synthetic, quote, human beings.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.880]  What?
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.880]  That's artificial intelligence.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880]  And then there's Regina Dugan,
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.880]  who is perhaps the most dangerous woman,
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.880]  even more dangerous than Hillary,
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.880]  who is head of DARPA for five years,
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.880]  who is actively advocating taking a pill,
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  a synthetic pill to become a part of the binary net.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.880]  We, as human beings, we're trinary.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  We have souls.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  We're not machines that are to be turned on.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]  And again, when you merge with this,
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.880]  you give your free will.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880]  Yes.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]  And we're carbon.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.880]  We're not synthetic.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  We are here to be free.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  And that's why there's a global carbon tax.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.880]  There's a war on carbon.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.880]  Of course there is.
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  You know, what's the main phone besides the Apple?
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880]  It's the Android.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  The Android phones.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.880]  They want slaves.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.880]  They want good little slaves.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  They want a good little...
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880]  And anybody ask, oh, who's Apple?
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.880]  They're liberal.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  They have the worst factories in China with suicide nets,
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.880]  forced abortion, forced drugging,
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  but it's okay because their CEOs have beards
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.880]  and have little different colored socks
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880]  and go, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.880]  And they wear blue jeans when they give conferences.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.880]  It's all camouflage.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  I was in China not too long ago,
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.880]  next to the new Apple headquarters.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.880]  And you know, what Alex is saying is right.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.880]  Apple was one of the, not the first,
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  but they are one of the five corporate,
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.880]  nine corporations to sell out to the NSA
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.880]  and to the prism computers and folks,
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.880]  the artificial intelligence,
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.880]  every telephone call,
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  every time...
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880]  It's already operating.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  It's already operating and they're creating artificial...
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.880]  They admit it.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.880]  They admit it, but I can intellectually see it
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  and spiritually feel it.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  We're already dealing not just with the beyond,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880]  but now it's got its AI against it.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.880]  It's already there.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  It's just activated.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880]  And for those of you who don't...
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.880]  I'm sure 95% of the people realize this.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  Hollywood, by and large, is a vehicle of the Illuminati.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  They put this information out.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880]  They say they're following free will,
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  but it's not informed consent.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.880]  Movies like X, Makina, an incredible movie,
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  but it's right there.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]  Let's get you ready.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.880]  The new Terminator movie, Genesis,
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.880]  it's all out there, friends.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.880]  I mean, without being paranoid,
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.880]  wake up, wake up, wake up,
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880]  because you know what?
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  Artificial intelligence is the greatest danger
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.880]  to human beings on this planet.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  All you have to do is go into any caution.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880]  I agree, but let's go beyond this.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.880]  Let me finish that point.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.880]  Okay.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  Let's go beyond this.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.880]  There are 7.5 billion of us.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880]  Yep.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  The enemy thinks they're going to win,
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.880]  but the men of humanity is aware of this.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.880]  Even if there's only a billion of us left,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.880]  when we're aware, game over,
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880]  because then humans are going next level.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  We're designed to defeat this,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880]  and this is all just a big test.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.880]  I got a feeling that the guy in the sky
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.880]  had this all figured out, George,
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:34.880]  in my gut.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]  We're going to win, my friend.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  Yeah, we can do it,
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880]  but the time to start is right now.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.880]  Not next week, not next month,
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.880]  but right now to make a decision.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  Do you believe that life is sacred?
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.880]  And I know that life is sacred
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.880]  because we're part of God's creation.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.880]  That's right.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880]  Stay there.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  You have to believe in life.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]  Whether it's a little lizard in your backyard
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.880]  or the food you're eating on your table,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:23.880]  we're waiting for an outrageously low price.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.880]  Blackouts, intensifying civil unrest.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.880]  You're not going to have to suffer through it
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.880]  like the rest of the sheep.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.880]  And here's the best news
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.880]  if you want to get one this week.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.880]  Solutions from Science has a big sale
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.880]  on their fast charge solar generators,
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.880]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.880]  of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.880]  for M4 Wars listeners.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.880]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.880]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.880]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.880]  It's a great opportunity to generate
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.880]  maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.880]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:22.880]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.880]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880]  Last week, we pointed out
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.880]  the globalists have declared open season
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.880]  on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880]  When the British left the Euro,
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.880]  the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880]  They've now announced that Hillary
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.880]  won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.880]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.880]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.880]  It wants to make us dependent.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.880]  It wants to be able to set up
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:26.360]  up a worldwide financial crisis where there are food shortages that are already happening
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.160]  in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to our knees and where we can pitch
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.480]  like to their demands.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.680]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week because it's all
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.120]  about declaring your independence from the globalist.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.760]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high quality storeable foods or water
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.760]  filters or shortwave radios at m4store.com.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:50.320]  You declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.520]  the broadcast because there's a warrant for your mind.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:32:20.200]  That's a total 360 win at m4store.com.

[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]  Another win-win.

[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.560]  the team.

[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.040]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how young Jebedy and the products
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.760]  at m4warsteam.com have changed their lives.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.560]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:20.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.560]  All right, I'm taking phone calls right now.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.000]  I have this incredibly important Vladimir Putin speech warning of nuclear war that no
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.800]  one is covering U.S. media coming up in the final segment.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.760]  I want to go to Bill and Wilde and Todd and Jeremy and Andrew and Anthony and Daniel.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.560]  He's come back for at least an hour on Tuesday, George Humphrey, my good friend of many years
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.520]  ago, a new book out, Life, Love and Joy.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.680]  The elites believe they're becoming gods.
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.320]  Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet, I'm an emerging machine, but first humanity
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.720]  must be basically destroyed.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:00.600]  So I never cover this type of stuff because I just cover facts and I kid people to agree
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.040]  the Federal Reserve was private, even though it was admitted.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.880]  But the elite believe the stuff that George is talking about, but not from his perspective,
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.320]  from an anti-human perspective.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.280]  That's why they think we're all bad and got to get rid of us.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.880]  I mean, it's really evil.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.960]  So we do, you know, get into the weird cosmology they're involved in.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:25.640]  Regardless, we're seeing aliens here on Earth, genetically engineered species are new.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.880]  Animals being spliced with other animals, that's new.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.000]  We're seeing a war on the Earth.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.960]  And the people that claim they're trying to save the Earth are the ones prosecuting the
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.960]  war.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:43.520]  It's so amazing, Al Gordon, these people in Rio, it is unbelievable that they get that
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.520]  you've been a big environment, you were a famous environmentalist before you got involved
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520]  in this.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.160]  Hey, I am a number one tree hugger and I still am.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.600]  I you know, you can't get.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.280]  But is it crazy to see the folks that are killing the Earth claiming they support it?
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.560]  It blows my mind.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.920]  They're talking about the carbons, the problem, not GMO.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.480]  And as they're talking, the chemtrails are right above them, and they're not even pointing
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]  that out.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.400]  The chemtrails are poisoning us all.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:14.280]  And even Chuck Norris talks about their declassified, they're spraying a little dioxide on us.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280]  Yeah, that's lying.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:19.320]  Dr. Reins boron many other things that is creating a synthetic reality.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.760]  Are you seeing how a lot of the public's like literally brain dead?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.760]  You know, once a week, I'll get people I'll say, what is that up there?
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:33.560]  And 90% of the people will look up and know, I don't know, it's just normal or a contrail.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.480]  It is self-evident.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.480]  It's eyes wide shut.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.480]  Let's declassify.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.480]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.480]  Let's talk to folks in Kansas.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.480]  Bill in Kansas, you're only here with George Humphrey.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.480]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.480]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.480]  This is Bill.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:51.920]  Hey, I have a question and then a quick statement.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.560]  The first question is that could this, the guy in Dallas, could it possibly be the very
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:03.680]  first time that a mass shooter in the United States, it wasn't on some sort of SSR inhibitors
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.960]  or do you think that the VA probably had him all doped up?
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:08.920]  You know, I quite love taking calls.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.080]  I should have been from the very first minute of the show.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.320]  The listeners always put the points, I've never seen a mass shooter, whether it was
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.760]  Kip Kankle or Harrison Clybal that wasn't on those drugs as they put you in a dream
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.760]  state.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.680]  They've got so many people that were, you know, disarmament discharged like this guy
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680]  on it.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.680]  Most of them are.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  I bet money.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.840]  You know, he's wound up by the media.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.320]  He's mind controlled.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  He's in a dream state.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.720]  I bet you.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720]  Where is that news?
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.880]  They're always on it.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.880]  That's a great question, George.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.160]  He's a Manchurian candidate.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.000]  I mean, it's just pure and simple.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  Human beings don't do that to other human beings unless they are, their neurological systems
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  are overridden.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.600]  Look, some cop kills one of my kids or somebody wrongfully and they don't get in trouble.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.760]  Then there might be an issue.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.280]  What is this new thing where a cop did something in Minnesota's, let's kill cops in Dallas.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.200]  It doesn't work that way unless there is outside interference and, and we just got to be aware
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.200]  of that.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200]  All of this is pre.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  It's so stupid.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200]  It's so stupid.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.960]  It'd be like if you're a black guy and some clan guy attacks you, you don't go attack
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960]  some random white guy.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.080]  You go find the clan guy.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080]  Yeah.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.400]  And the thing about it is we need to see through this.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.640]  We need to be objective.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640]  We need to make sure.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.360]  And the mainstream media is pushing it.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360]  That's the enemy.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.360]  We know it's bull.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.080]  I mean, the media is like, of course, it's white people's fault.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]  They did it.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.160]  Uh, uh, what was your comment, Bill?
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:29.800]  Well, all these people on both sides of the issue, the left and the right, they're being
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:37.720]  bombarded with all this bull and, uh, they don't realize that in the middle heat of conflict,
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:44.360]  if they got stuck, stood back and looked that they all have common issues with the current
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.560]  political system.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.640]  And the conflicts are based on our moving away from the constitutional Christian based
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:57.960]  law and moving to a law of man and mammon.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:05.480]  And if you step back out of the fog and look at it, the left and the black and the white
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.040]  and the red and the brown and the good, everybody's on the same page.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.040]  Great point.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:17.200]  We all have a central issue with the perversion in the center that is attempting to manipulate
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]  brainwashes.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200]  No, that's right.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  Good point.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200]  Let me, let me go to some more calls.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.440]  I just want to say this.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.360]  I want everybody to get ahead absolutely.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.440]  And it's just fundamentally crazy that I would think if blacks, most people are just
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440]  intermarrying anyway.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  What's the same thing happening?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.080]  A black person has a bad life.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.080]  I get ahead.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.080]  That's a load of horse crap.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:37.080]  That's not how it works.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080]  George and economics.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.680]  Everybody knows an area where everybody's doing better.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.680]  Everybody does better.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.680]  That's right.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:47.200]  I mean, again, united we stand, divided we fall.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.200]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  And they want to get us in the crisis.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.200]  United, I mean, all America.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.560]  United around the truth, though.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.160]  We can't unite around the globalists.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160]  Around the constitution.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.720]  Because they state these events to say you're not around them.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.800]  About truth and about love and about right action.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.800]  That's right.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.800]  Okay.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.800]  Great point.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.800]  Thank you, Bill.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.800]  Wild in Wisconsin.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.800]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800]  Go ahead.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.960]  Hi, two queries, one for Alex, one for George.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960]  Go ahead.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.000]  George, I know what I've seen, but what have you seen as rabbit hole bedrock?
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  Excuse me.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  I didn't hear that, sir.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  What have you seen as radical bedrock?
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.200]  Is that what you said?
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.280]  Rabbit hole bedrock.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.280]  Give me a little bit more information.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.480]  What is your radical bedrock?
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.480]  He says he knows what you've seen.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.480]  No, no, no.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.480]  No, like the bottom of the rabbit hole, rabbit hole, bedrock.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.160]  But as you said, what is the bottom of the rabbit hole, man, it goes way, way, way, way
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.160]  deep.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.360]  All we know is it's anti-human and it's old and it ain't nice.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.080]  And we just need to keep going deeper.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.080]  It's the devil.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.080]  It's the devil.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.400]  If you pick a flower off the plant, off the weed, the root will still, we have to pull
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.560]  it out by the roots and we need to find out who is behind the Illuminati.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.960]  That's what your book is about.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.960]  That's what it's about.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.720]  And it was behind it in the end of this world.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.160]  It's not, God of this world, end of this world.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:11.760]  It is other than sentient human beings, sentient, terrestrial human beings.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.760]  And we just...
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.200]  I'll say this, the elite believe they're getting off world knowledge.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]  Absolutely.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:22.960]  They believe that and thought, and conscious manifestation, whether it is actually true
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.960]  or not actually true.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.960]  And so what you're saying is we have to get from Christ divine technology to beat them.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:35.120]  Christ is the universal energy and we have to be who we are, but we also have to understand
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:40.360]  that there is an energy on this planet called the Archons, it's called the black goo, whatever
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.520]  you want to call it.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.520]  That one...
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.960]  Well, you talked about earlier, like the Muslims do counterclockwise around that meteorite.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.960]  It's faking it.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.960]  I mean...
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:54.000]  Well, you know, I have many friends who are Islamic or great people, but the fact is every
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.840]  day they walk counterclockwise around a black cube that some people call the cube of Saturn
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.520]  or Satanic.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.920]  And it is black goo, it is exactly what the Nag Hammadi talked about with the Essenes and
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.520]  the Nazarenes, and Jesus was a Nazarene, folks.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.480]  This is insanity.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.160]  And I'm not just going after Islamic people, all of the Occidental religions have their
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.160]  problems.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.160]  The point is they're worshipping a black meteorite.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.160]  Yep.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.160]  And...
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.360]  I mean, they're going counterclockwise, we've got a problem here.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360]  Ask yourself where...
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.680]  They're on the opposite direction of the planet.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.120]  Ask yourself, where did the company Google get its name from?
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.080]  Goo, black goo.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:44.400]  Look at the last Hunger Games, the black goo for 50 years in every one of the horror movies.
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.960]  There is this black goo that is there.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:52.200]  This stuff's been around that we've known about this for 4,000 years.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:57.400]  There is a reason there is so much insanity on this planet, but it is up to us to heal
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.400]  it.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.920]  And then poor Muslims are like sitting all around it.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920]  Yep.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.720]  Oh my God, we've gone to the next level here today.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:03.960]  I apologize to the callers.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  Thank you, Wilde.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.960]  I don't think we have time to go any more calls, so I've got to play this Putin clip.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.960]  We're going to break here.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.920]  We're going to break here in just a few minutes.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:18.080]  Look, all I know is I believe in Christ, and I'm exposing evil, and the Black Lives Matter
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.800]  is run by Obama and the globalists to create civil war in this country, and they're like,
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.960]  well, a cop got shot in Georgia, or a cop got shot in Tennessee.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.400]  Well, the cops need to reform themselves.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.960]  That's why the cop got shot in the back of the head.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.480]  It's like, what?
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.560]  That is the most, it's like if like, there was some black racist, let's just go kill
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.360]  some random black person.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.360]  What is that?
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  No, that's evil.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  That's evil.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.560]  And I stand against that.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.960]  We're going to come back with this incredibly important Vladimir Putin piece and I'll have
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.640]  some final words at the end of it, dealing with World War III.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.640]  I'm not saying Putin's perfect.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.640]  I'm just saying if Putin's talking about World War III, we should be discussing it.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.640]  It should be known.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.640]  So I'm going to air this right here.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.520]  George Humphrey, we'll see you Tuesday.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.520]  Thank you.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:03.960]  While preppers are getting ready for the apocalypse, socialists are preparing for the Trump apocalypse.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.360]  How desperate could they be to stop Trump?
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:12.160]  Well, the Democratic National Convention has been caught paying for leftist protesters
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.360]  to harass supporters attending the Republican National Convention.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:25.400]  Meanwhile, hacker Guccifer has released a 22-page document about the DNC spending $800,000
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.400]  to sabotage the RNC.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.360]  DNC operatives plan to stage a Trump apocalypse with shenanigans and tricks.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.400]  In addition, Black Lives Matter has planned mass protests.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.920]  Their leader is promising to release protesters in mass to sabotage the RNC.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:49.040]  So-called liberals are once again hell-bent on quelling free speech and thereby undermining
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.520]  our First Amendment.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.080]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.680]  Check out the full story as well as other special reports at infowars.com.
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:59.520]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.000]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.720]  Why is this so good?
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.480]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  my system.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.280]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:21.040]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:26.160]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.400]  going on everywhere.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.400]  These are all parasites.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.120]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.360]  You have the neem in there.
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.440]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.720]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720]  All right.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.920]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.080]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.080]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:48.760]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:52.040]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.240]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.

[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.760]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.280]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.680]  in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680]  rampant.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.120]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.680]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.080]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[01:46:51.440 --> 01:47:02.600]  I'm Alex Jones for Supermail Vitality and infowarslife.com and I salute you, our supporters.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:32.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:42.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.200]  the info war.
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.880]  I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:48:10.520]  Do you realize now what you've done?
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.320]  Speaking nearly a month ago, President Vladimir Putin at the International Economic Forum
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:22.040]  in St. Petersburg, Russia warned the group of international journalists there repeatedly
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:31.280]  that Europe, the United States and Russia were drifting towards full-scale war.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.120]  We know year by year what's going to happen and they know we know.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.800]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:42.440]  of your country.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.760]  Other people do not feel a sense of the impending danger.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.480]  This is what worries me.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.880]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.040]  That is the problem.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.880]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.600]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:05.960]  And the big news is, a month later, almost a month later, after we first reported on it,
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:14.080]  in mid-June, there has been almost no western coverage of it at all.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.200]  And that's exactly what Putin was getting at.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:24.960]  Whether you love Putin or hate Putin, if the leader of Russia, with thousands of intercontinental
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.480]  ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, is telling the West, I don't know how to get
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:35.600]  through to you, your media is controlled, you're being manipulated, NATO is putting
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.640]  missiles on our borders, we're having to move missiles in, you've overthrown Ukraine,
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:47.520]  you're on an offensive, you're funding and protecting radical Islam, do you know what
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.640]  you've done, do you know what you've done, as he said at the UN, destabilizing the Middle
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.880]  East, why are you doing this?
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:03.640]  Where are the sound minds across the political spectrum who should be stopping this?
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:11.680]  Russia has three overseas military bases, you have hundreds, you have your spies inside
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.200]  our country trying to overthrow it, you have your CIA people trying to get into our embassies,
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:21.880]  you are at war with us, and the average American, the average European, the average Brit is
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.120]  not aware of this.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:34.560]  The threat that President Obama mentioned was ISIS, well who on earth armed them, who
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:42.640]  helped to arm the Syrians that were fighting against Assad, who created the necessary political
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:49.880]  climate that facilitated the situation, who pushed for the delivery of arms to the area,
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:54.960]  do you really not understand as to who is fighting in Syria, but the issue of a major
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:02.400]  world leader saying that we're moving to the brink of war, and it's not in our news, that's
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:08.320]  the big story, it shows how incredibly controlled things are, Deutsche Bank, one of the biggest
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.480]  banks in the world is plunging right now, much bigger than Lehman Brothers, if it continues
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:19.840]  it'll make 2008 look tame in comparison, elites are building armored fortresses and redoubts
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:23.760]  all over the world admitting they believe collapse is coming, governments are digging
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:29.880]  in, Russia is digging in, our supposed government is collapsing our borders and bringing people
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:40.440]  in with diseases and ignoring the Supreme Court rulings, it seems an age of madness, or megalomania
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.240]  is now upon us.
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.520]  We've seen great evil out of Russia, we've seen great evil out of Germany, we've seen
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.960]  incredible evil out of communist China, but America has had its problems as well, and
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.040]  now we see Europe and the United States and the whole Anglo-American establishment filled
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:05.200]  with hubris and arrogance, just violating domestic laws, persecuting the press, leaking
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:12.160]  classified material and getting away with it, this is the stuff that collapses and major
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:18.680]  wars and calamities are made of, and most historians point out the parallels between
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:22.360]  the start of World War I and what we now see happening today, and the parallels with the
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:28.440]  start of World War II and the climate politically we see today, even the Pentagon admits that
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:33.200]  we're probably witnessing one of the most unstable periods in human history right now,
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.200]  but Obama says, we've got the best economy ever and the world's the most stable it's
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:42.520]  ever been, as they do everything they can to push us into crisis, and it's not just
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:47.880]  the Democrats, they have their establishment, republican cohorts that are working with them,
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.440]  I have never been more concerned about what's happening on the planet today, and if we're
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:58.880]  able to raise the alarm, you the freedom lovers out there, the people that want to have a
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.040]  civilization, the people that don't want to have war, if we're able to come together
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.760]  whether we be black, white, old, young, conservative, libertarian, Catholic, Muslim, whatever it
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:12.320]  is, we cannot continue to have these conflicts, we cannot continue to have this globalist
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.760]  crisis brand where they stir up the problems, exacerbate the crises, and then gain power
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.840]  out of it, because all the money in the world is going to be worthless if we have a major
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:27.440]  nuclear war, and that's what the Russian foreign minister and many others say we're
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:35.280]  going towards, and Putin is now begging with the press to trigger some type of debate and
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:41.640]  saying I can't believe how none of this gets through to the people of the West, please
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:47.160]  spread this video far and wide, and hopefully it will spur a debate that can cause some
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:52.400]  type of chain reaction that reverses our course, or at least changes our course from
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]  assured Armageddon.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:58.000]  I want to get, 20 years ago I would interview people like Nigel Farage, the head of UKIP,
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.400]  when they had a couple members of the British Parliament and a couple members of the EU
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.400]  Parliament, now it's the fastest growing party in Europe, they just had the British exit,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:11.440]  the Brexit successfully, nationalism and anti-globalism is rising, I have seen the power of the people
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:16.560]  when we take action, and sure, our elites are decadent, sure they're inbred, sure they're
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.560]  very, very narcissistic and disconnected, but they will pay attention when we the people
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:29.560]  force the issue, and we are forcing the issue on this, as well as many other issues going
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.880]  on here in the United States and around the world, I'm Alex Jones, signing off for infowars.com,
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.680]  if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the hope, you are the resistance.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:45.320]  Alright, we're almost out of time, we've got a three minutes left before the Sunday broadcast

[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.680]  the word about the transmission because you see the censorship, you see the attempts to
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:10.640]  bring in control, it's because the globalists can't deal with real renaissance, real liberalism,
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.480]  that's private property, keep more of your money, have more guns, have more free association,
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.520]  liberal beings more, not less, not controlling the language, I want to say bye to my friend
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:24.880]  George Humphrey, I'll be back with this video Tuesday, but finally, we're still funded,

[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.920]  and others, because we're all about win-win, I don't promote something unless I truly
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.520]  have used it and know it's great, since it's all about energy, it's all about I wouldn't
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:51.120]  do something to you, I wouldn't want it to happen to me, and that's why we have Providence

[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:10.000]  here, because talking about the truth, talking about human potential, talking about justice,
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.320]  and having somebody who has a spine and the courage to say it, I love you buddy.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.880]  Well I love you too man, I loved like 25 years ago, on the Pat Buchanan campaign, signs
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:20.880]  up around town.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.400]  I remember that like it was yesterday, I'll see you on Tuesday.
