[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:22.779]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.492]  Well, I'm not up here tootin' my horn when I say this.
[00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.553]  I'm just laying out the fact that we know what we're talking about.
[00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:48.761]  We have been predicting that you will start seeing massively increased attacks on police officers around the United States, but also in Europe and other areas.
[00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:51.002]  This is part of the globalist multinational program.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:05.745]  To undermine stability, national security, local security, as a pretext to force the political capitulation of the local constabulary to the globalist program.
[00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:14.929]  And Loretta Lynch at the Justice Department is pushing the Strong Cities Initiative in the last six, seven months that federalizes and globalizes local police.
[00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.990]  Then they call off the dogs of Black Lives Matter and other groups.
[00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:36.792]  I think the best way to break down what's currently happening is this way, and I'm going to do it when we come back after the break in detail, but my personal journey dealing with the police, my personal journey trying to understand what's happening in the last 21 years on air, and of course before that, but it's this issue.
[00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:40.056]  Statistically, police killing people is one of the rarest forms of death.
[00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:46.357]  We see a lot of TV shows, a lot of movies that basically exacerbate and hype this up.
[00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:48.778]  I'm not defending police when they do bad things.
[00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:51.479]  That certainly goes on.
[00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.322]  But it is a manufactured red herring.
[00:01:55.322 --> 00:02:09.430]  When you see the number one issue in this country for like four or five years, Trayvon Martin and then Black Lives Matter, you would think that the world was ending when 258 black Americans get killed by police every year, most of them justifiable shootings.
[00:02:10.794 --> 00:02:24.087]  There was a case in Houston last night where a man who was a felon and part of gangs and other things pulled a gun on police in front of witnesses and the guy's wife talked to the news and said, yeah, he was just waving a gun around pointing it at him and they shot him!
[00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:30.032]  So, 258 people that happen to be African descent are killed by the police.
[00:02:30.032 --> 00:02:31.834]  Okay, I'm sure some of the time it's wrong.
[00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:33.656]  If a cop's found to do it wrong, put him in prison!
[00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:38.754]  This isn't about an agenda of defending the police.
[00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:45.878]  I saw some comment on Infowars, because I put a video out that's gone viral, titled, this video will bring down Black Lives Matter.
[00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:51.402]  And I saw a couple commenters going, okay, what he says is a lot of good points, but you know, he's got an agenda.
[00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:54.624]  Before I get into all this news today, we have a special guest joining us in the studio as well.
[00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:58.627]  Let me just say right now, I do have an agenda.
[00:02:58.627 --> 00:03:01.589]  And that's telling the truth, and that's having integrity,
[00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:08.346]  And that's actually trying to learn how this world works and trying to empower myself and others.
[00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:12.767]  Because I believe in humanity and I believe in you.
[00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:26.653]  And I am too, I guess you could say prideful, to sit here and pick sides in something just because I think it'll further my own personal gain.
[00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:30.115]  Because when you have that attitude, you lose the whole storyline of life.
[00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:35.883]  I'm trying to empower everybody as long as it's not at my expense.
[00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:39.064]  And by my expense, as long as they're not trying to bring me down.
[00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:47.326]  Because when you empower others, it basically energizes the whole of the society, as John F. Kennedy said, a rising tide raises all ships.
[00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:55.849]  So separating Alex Jones from his narrative, InfoWars is getting six times the traffic Thursday night through right now we have ever had.
[00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.081]  Previous spikes were three to four times.
[00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.385]  We're seeing six times the traffic.
[00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:06.212]  10,500 people a second are entering the site.
[00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.716]  That's how many new IP addresses are coming in a second.
[00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.358]  Millions of visitors an hour.
[00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:12.021]  Very, very exciting things are happening.
[00:04:13.564 --> 00:04:26.552]  Because people understand we've been predicting this, we understand what's going on, and I have a guest coming in that's really concerned with his sources and his research that they're going to try to kill Donald Trump as a false flag to cause a civil war.
[00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:31.696]  First get the leftists all hyped up, hype up a bunch of cops killing people.
[00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:40.972]  Get the media all pushing it, and then right as the summer goes towards its head, its climax, into September, an assassination of Donald Trump.
[00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:44.996]  We're going to talk about that with George Humphrey coming up today as well, and a lot more.
[00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:54.505]  But when we return, police are getting shot in Georgia, in Tennessee, in Florida, in Missouri, in New York, in San Antonio.
[00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:56.147]  The police department got shot up.
[00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:57.248]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:04:58.908 --> 00:05:02.553]  Let's face it, most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones.
[00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:07.319]  But recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues, including brain cancer.
[00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.084]  Experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful.
[00:05:11.084 --> 00:05:15.210]  Doctors say the infant brain, even while in the womb, is especially vulnerable.
[00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.652]  So keep the phone away from your abdomen, especially toward the end of pregnancy.
[00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:25.175]  And for men, using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm.
[00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:29.797]  Lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult.
[00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:32.038]  This is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants.
[00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:37.900]  And for those of us who use our cell phones before bed, know that the screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.701]  This causes insomnia and slows the metabolism.
[00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:41.841]  Hello, weight gain!
[00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:46.923]  Generally speaking, when cell phones are on, they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation.
[00:05:46.923 --> 00:05:49.204]  So keep your phone in airplane mode when you can.
[00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:51.805]  Keep the phone at least two feet away from your body.
[00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:52.745]  Use headphones.
[00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:56.066]  And when you're not on your phone, keep it as far away from you as possible.
[00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:58.107]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with your InfoWars Tip of the Week.
[00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:13.779]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:24.686]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:27.788]  My friends, it is Sunday, the 10th day of July 2016.
[00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:28.749]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:41.288]  Longtime patriot, good friend of mine, former Austin City Council member, a fellow that was involved in fighting the New World Order when I got involved in Pat Buchanan's campaign when I was still in high school.
[00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:44.910]  George Humphrey is going to be in studio with us coming up later in the hour.
[00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.510]  He's got a new book out.
[00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.931]  He, of course, is also a best-selling author.
[00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:50.672]  The book is Life, Love, Joy.
[00:06:52.369 --> 00:07:02.077]  Now before we go any further, George is a high-powered businessman, real estate guy, has a lot of big connections to a lot of some of the older families in the United States.
[00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:09.202]  I was just talking to him during the pre-show preparation about what insiders are telling him.
[00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:30.139]  And he says that they really are concerned about Donald Trump's life and that they're concerned that the establishment, that is criminal elements of it, want to start a civil war in this country and that that would be triggered by the assassination of Donald J. Trump.
[00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.421]  So we'll be talking about that with him and more coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.121]  Where to start?
[00:07:37.446 --> 00:07:43.372]  I shot a lot of special reports Friday, Saturday, and today, and they're all viral.
[00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:45.915]  Some of them have millions of views.
[00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:49.098]  Then, of course, the radio show has had six times the traffic.
[00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:54.777]  InfoWars.com, that is the biggest spike in traffic we've ever seen.
[00:07:54.777 --> 00:07:57.980]  It's been sustained since Friday, right through today.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.264]  We're getting millions of visitors, new visitors by the way, most of them, every hour.
[00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:04.765]  It's epic.
[00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:11.331]  I know Drudge Report was crashing on Friday, that gets billions of visitors a month, much larger than InfoWars.
[00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:15.595]  And we saw it crash, InfoWars has also crashed some.
[00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.917]  We also have the backup site, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:25.078]  And it's because folks know that we have been documenting the war on police.
[00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:35.723]  We have been documenting the mainstream media, Hollywood, broadcast TV, but also fiction media, in almost every venue.
[00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:47.289]  Pushing and making it very sexy, and very risque, and very avant-garde, that police are criminals, and police are the worst people in the world, and police need to die.
[00:08:49.926 --> 00:09:02.956]  Now before I get into all the latest developments and cops getting shot all over the country since Friday and attacked, including just south of us in San Antonio a few hours ago, the police department being shot up, I want to explain something.
[00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:11.982]  I am uniquely qualified to speak to what's happening because I saw the threat to our republic by globalization, militarization of our police.
[00:09:11.982 --> 00:09:14.344]  I made films about it 20 years ago.
[00:09:14.344 --> 00:09:16.906]  I wrote books about it 10 years ago.
[00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:18.788]  But I was never anti-cop
[00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:37.602]  I was anti-federal globalist training to turn them into political officers that would oppress speech, to turn them into anti-gun forces, to teach them instinctive shooting training that might save their lives sometimes, but kills a lot of innocent people.
[00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:40.243]  I was against the type of stuff the feds do at Ruby Ridge and Waco.
[00:09:42.722 --> 00:09:51.946]  But even then I wasn't against the Feds, I was against globalist crime groups, infiltration cells that had taken over areas of the federal government.
[00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:53.587]  I want to take our country back.
[00:09:53.587 --> 00:10:07.473]  So because our police are being more and more federalized, and our military is being globalized, and we're going under international control, and a lot of un-American, anti-free speech, anti-liberty things are happening, I've been trying to raise the alarm.
[00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.994]  And then the media would say, well you're just against the military, you're just against the police.
[00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:27.063]  But then I found the last decade the police and military on average were more sophisticated than I was because they were on the inside that they were being taken over and basically scapegoated.
[00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:29.364]  And I found that for groups that are awake
[00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:34.104]  The military is the most awake to the globalist New World Order program.
[00:10:34.104 --> 00:10:36.706]  The police are about the second most awake group out there.
[00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:37.747]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:39.308]  Doesn't mean they have big problems.
[00:10:39.308 --> 00:10:41.310]  Doesn't mean some departments are totally criminal.
[00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.211]  That's human nature.
[00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:43.652]  Absolutely.
[00:10:43.652 --> 00:10:44.793]  It isn't just some bad apples.
[00:10:44.793 --> 00:10:49.117]  Sometimes you've got whole barrels that are bad, and sometimes whole barrels that are good.
[00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.753]  I've almost found in my research it's like there's no bad apples or they're all bad apples.
[00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.155]  It kind of works like that in life and in history.
[00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.436]  Most people probably recognize that.
[00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:04.401]  A restaurant's either totally horrible and out of control and you get sick when you eat there or everything's good on the menu.
[00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:15.750]  But separate from that, our country is being taken over by multinational systems that are establishing a form of planetary government called globalism.
[00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.373]  And I've been fighting for 20 plus years just to expose the fact that that was happening.
[00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:25.557]  Now, most Americans know the Federal Reserve is foreign owned and private and part of globalism.
[00:11:25.557 --> 00:11:27.897]  Most Americans wanted audited or abolished.
[00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:35.379]  Most Americans know that the British exit, the Brexit, was about getting out of the unelected EU.
[00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:46.181]  The Liberty Movement worldwide, the Nationalist Movement, the Movement for Prosperity and Common Sense, led by people like Ron Paul and Matt Drudge and Nigel Farage and people like you,
[00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:52.229]  And Joseph Farah, and it's not about giving credit here, folks.
[00:11:52.229 --> 00:12:02.253]  It's just we need to understand the people that were there first, fighting hardest, to show their success, to say, look what you can do when you get involved and fight back as well.
[00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:05.754]  In the information war.
[00:12:05.754 --> 00:12:17.558]  And my job has been to just galvanize as many people as I can, pointing out what was coming, so that as the wages of world government came home to roost, people would be ready to stand up and say no to the next phase.
[00:12:19.704 --> 00:12:26.169]  Because if you think stuff's bad right now, none of us have seen anything yet.
[00:12:26.169 --> 00:12:47.586]  But I read countless university published books about policing, and I studied militarization, and I studied Pentagon programs shipping weapons in, and I studied the curriculum and what was going on, and I got secret documents that we broke nationally over and over again where the police were training to take on gun owners and veterans and confiscate firearms.
[00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:51.554]  But the police themselves were being given this curricula.
[00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:52.695]  They didn't want to follow it.
[00:12:52.695 --> 00:12:55.779]  They were leaking it to us.
[00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:03.047]  What I'm saying is, if you don't like the TSA groping your genitals and putting you through a naked body scanner while the border is wide open, I totally agree with you.
[00:13:03.047 --> 00:13:04.689]  It's a fraud to train us to be slaves.
[00:13:04.689 --> 00:13:08.133]  But let's not blame the TSA person themselves.
[00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:18.569]  Let's blame ourselves for letting it happen, and Congress that did it, and then after we've gotten our house in order, then we can talk about the TSA people.
[00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:25.955]  And Lord knows there's some pedophiles that want that job, there's some criminals that rob your bags, there's some bad people in there.
[00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:35.103]  But the essence of free will, and the essence of a free society, and the essence of a good society is, we go after people for what they individually did, not what happens in groups.
[00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:52.136]  If cops in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week questionably shoot armed black males during wrestling matches, I don't know if the cops are guilty or not.
[00:13:52.136 --> 00:13:53.217]  It's not clear.
[00:13:53.217 --> 00:13:57.699]  Let's say they are.
[00:13:57.699 --> 00:14:00.741]  Do you then go shoot 15 cops and kill five of them in Dallas?
[00:14:03.646 --> 00:14:12.448]  Do you go shoot people on the highway in Georgia and Tennessee, and kill a cop, and shoot up some cars, and shoot up some cars in Florida, and shoot up the police station in San Antonio?
[00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:15.729]  There's so many of these coming in right now, I can't even keep track of them.
[00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:22.911]  There's just cops getting shot all over the place right now.
[00:14:22.911 --> 00:14:31.333]  And as I studied this more and more years ago, I realized, oh my gosh, I've been trying to reform the police, and what I've done partially has helped wake them up faster.
[00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:34.602]  To the larger globalist program.
[00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:36.103]  So it wasn't a complete failure.
[00:14:36.103 --> 00:14:38.545]  And of course they weren't waking up just because of me.
[00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:39.666]  But because of what they were being taught.
[00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:41.087]  You know, the Founding Fathers are bad.
[00:14:41.087 --> 00:14:42.288]  Christians are your enemy.
[00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:44.589]  Veterans are all going to start attacking you.
[00:14:44.589 --> 00:14:45.850]  There's going to be a civil war.
[00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.612]  And we're like, yeah, because the globalists are setting one up.
[00:14:48.612 --> 00:14:50.393]  That's how they're going to conquer America.
[00:14:50.393 --> 00:14:52.995]  Then it all clicked.
[00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:54.016]  Oh!
[00:14:54.016 --> 00:15:00.321]  Government that has a 9% approval rating in Gallup and a 6% approval rating for the media in Gallup and AP.
[00:15:01.678 --> 00:15:12.010]  They want to basically scapegoat the police and have a civil war that is only about trying to overthrow the police when they're the lowest level of government.
[00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.597]  So that none of the real revolution ever goes against the globalists that have actually come in and hijacked the country.
[00:15:17.597 --> 00:15:20.220]  Because it's not a revolution, it's a restoration!
[00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:29.834]  And so if we have a false revolution just based on killing cops, that discredits any legitimate resistance in the future.
[00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:35.739]  And then you understand the larger plan and exactly what we're facing and what we're dealing with.
[00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:49.249]  Folks, when you've got Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter all saying Black Lives Matter and censoring folks that expose it, and Hillary Clinton saying, well, it's white people's fault this happened, and the Dallas mayor saying that,
[00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:56.270]  And acting like, well, police must reform, like Obama said, like... That is an attempt to make this ten times worse.
[00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.931]  This is an attempt to overthrow the country.
[00:15:57.931 --> 00:16:06.093]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:06.913]  Here's why.
[00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:11.054]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:11.994]  So please listen.
[00:16:11.994 --> 00:16:15.415]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:16:15.695 --> 00:16:22.056]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:16:22.056 --> 00:16:29.357]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:16:29.357 --> 00:16:31.718]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:42.960]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.021]  So it's a good time to check it out.

[00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:05.195]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:18:05.195 --> 00:18:17.841]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:18:18.201 --> 00:18:21.843]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:28.826]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:41.692]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:18:41.692 --> 00:18:43.253]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:18:43.533 --> 00:18:49.916]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:54.858]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:05.235]  Last week we pointed out that globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:09.157]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[00:19:09.157 --> 00:19:13.119]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.340]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.962]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[00:19:17.962 --> 00:19:19.302]  It wants to make us dependent.
[00:19:19.302 --> 00:19:20.843]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:23.545]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:31.071]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world where they basically bring us to our knees and where we can pitch like their demands.
[00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:38.797]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:44.822]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality storable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at m4store.com.
[00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:52.185]  You declare independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:19:52.185 --> 00:20:02.450]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.071]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.032 --> 00:20:14.893]  We are on the march.
[00:20:14.893 --> 00:20:18.054]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:20:18.054 --> 00:20:23.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:23.277 --> 00:20:34.061]  All right, so there's a million different angles to this, but I want to go into some clips here and break down what's currently happening and get into all the other attacks on police that are currently taking place.
[00:20:34.061 --> 00:20:37.983]  Multinational corporations, to a great extent, have already captured this country.
[00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:46.460]  They want to have Americans at each other's throats, so they have weaponized media, CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.922]  Local TV stations across the country come out and say, oh my gosh, it is the number one issue in America.
[00:20:51.922 --> 00:20:57.725]  The police are hunting down and just executing black men everywhere.
[00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:01.607]  This year so far, 2,000 plus people have been shot in Chicago.
[00:21:01.607 --> 00:21:04.188]  90 plus percent by black on black.
[00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:11.756]  500 plus blacks die a year in Chicago at the hands of other blacks, with guns.
[00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:12.917]  You can look it up for yourself.
[00:21:12.917 --> 00:21:14.478]  I did whole reports on Friday.
[00:21:14.478 --> 00:21:17.559]  They're on InfoWars.com, showing the FBI's own numbers.
[00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:27.706]  You tell a Black Lives Matter person that, or some other social justice warrior, and they look at you and say, shut up, racist, why don't you care about people's lives?
[00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:32.989]  And we're just like, look, the truth is police shootings overall are down.
[00:21:32.989 --> 00:21:33.870]  The truth is that
[00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:40.797]  This is a political diversion from black unemployment being doubled.
[00:21:40.797 --> 00:21:56.506]  But if you segue out of that, if Donald Trump gets killed, or more Trump supporters get attacked, and then they've set the battle lines with Democrats and the quote minorities and Trump and the white people, even if Trump didn't brand it like that, the media has.
[00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.171]  This is the recipe we've got for major, major civil unrest.
[00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:13.655]  And so many leftists and so many Black Lives Matter people on Infowars and on YouTube put comments going, oh, trying not to have a civil war, you're scared.
[00:22:13.655 --> 00:22:22.218]  The majority of people are white still in this country, even though they're old and mentally ill, and they've got guns, and you're not going to win against the military and the police and all this.
[00:22:22.218 --> 00:22:24.919]  I'm not trying to stop a civil war because I think I'm going to lose it.
[00:22:26.058 --> 00:22:29.200]  I'm trying to stop a civil war because we all lose it.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.782]  Except for the technocrats, they're playing us off against each other.
[00:22:31.782 --> 00:22:35.485]  This is so stupid!
[00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:39.187]  I go into stores, I work with, quote, African people.
[00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:40.468]  I'm around great folks!
[00:22:40.468 --> 00:22:41.849]  I don't want to fight with anybody!
[00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:44.531]  I'm not out to get ya!
[00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.613]  And the media and all these white
[00:22:47.847 --> 00:22:59.394]  Pimps that I see pushing, and George Soros, and Hillary, and the Dallas Mayor, and Obama, and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, Google, all of them.
[00:22:59.394 --> 00:23:03.016]  After the cops got shot, they were putting up big signs saying Black Lives Matter.
[00:23:03.016 --> 00:23:06.017]  There were demonstrations all over the country Friday, Saturday, and today.
[00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:08.399]  And cops being beat up and shot all over the place!
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.422]  And then Loretta Lynch comes out and says, we need to reform the police!
[00:23:12.422 --> 00:23:14.144]  That'll fix this!
[00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.065]  Like it's legitimate!
[00:23:16.065 --> 00:23:23.591]  Obama, Friday morning, came out, we played the clip Friday, and said, we need to reform the police.
[00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:32.738]  Giving credence to the cops that got killed, as if they were connected to something some other cop did some other place!
[00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:37.442]  That's like Hitler saying, oh, some Jew might have done something wrong, so I'm gonna arrest all the Jews and I'm gonna kill them.
[00:23:39.512 --> 00:23:44.395]  And all the Black Lives Matter and Ford Foundation, the big leftist groups, oink, oink, bang, bang, you're dead.
[00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:45.315]  We played all the clips Friday.
[00:23:45.315 --> 00:23:46.256]  I'm not playing them again today.
[00:23:46.256 --> 00:23:48.077]  I mean, I've been to demonstrations myself.
[00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:49.818]  My crew has at every demonstration.
[00:23:49.818 --> 00:23:52.439]  You got mainly white college students.
[00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:56.181]  They're leading the chants about deck the halls with dead cops and all this stuff.
[00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:58.142]  And the police are told to stand down and do nothing.
[00:23:58.142 --> 00:24:02.605]  And the grand juries do nothing because the system wants to build this to a head.
[00:24:02.605 --> 00:24:03.946]  Let me explain something.
[00:24:03.946 --> 00:24:04.866]  You've got free speech.
[00:24:04.866 --> 00:24:06.047]  I'm the number one backer of it.
[00:24:06.587 --> 00:24:25.231]  But when you start as a media person with major groups of people that are listening to you, organizing, going out and killing people randomly because of what color they are or because they're wearing a uniform, you're engaged in organizing terrorist attacks.
[00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:28.112]  You're involved in racketeering.
[00:24:28.112 --> 00:24:33.213]  And I've already decided, if I'm out in public and I hear somebody saying kill police, I'm going to break their jaw.
[00:24:33.213 --> 00:24:34.094]  I'm done.
[00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:34.974]  And that's not talk.
[00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:35.734]  I'm doing it.
[00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:42.770]  You go chanting around me, hey, let's go kill some frickin' cops because they're in a uniform, and of course, you're too cowardly to do it.
[00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.570]  You want somebody else to do it?
[00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.951]  I'm gonna punch you right in the face.
[00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.071]  I don't usually talk like that in 20 years on air.
[00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:50.092]  And it's not that I'm kissing the cop's ass either.
[00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:53.853]  I'm gonna explain something to everybody.
[00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:57.814]  This attack is by multinational corporations trying to bring down America.
[00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:07.156]  So as many problems as the police have, they're the face of local government and our due process and what's left of it.
[00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:12.117]  And when they bring that down, the whole country's going down in a globalist takeover.
[00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:14.258]  And then your checks aren't going to cash anymore.
[00:25:14.258 --> 00:25:16.219]  There's not going to be any good electricity.
[00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:22.061]  This damn society's going to break down like Cuba or Venezuela or Eastern Europe, and this country's going to fall apart.
[00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:25.532]  Because it's a design to bring this country down.
[00:25:25.532 --> 00:25:42.343]  And I'm not gonna sit here and watch a bunch of stupid high school and college punks, fueled by propaganda on MTV and CNN, out there stomping around, acting like a bunch of jackasses!
[00:25:42.343 --> 00:25:43.984]  Excuse me, I didn't mean to go there, I apologize.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.085]  I want to play some clips right now, but I'm telling you, this is an attempt to bring in a civil war in this country.
[00:25:50.085 --> 00:25:51.106]  We told you it was coming.
[00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:52.367]  It's clearer than day.
[00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:54.089]  They're looking at suspending this election.
[00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:58.333]  We need to do everything we can to expose who's behind this and say no to it so it backfires.
[00:25:58.333 --> 00:26:03.739]  And we need to have all the police departments and citizens and everybody of a race, color, and greed come together.
[00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:10.202]  And realize this is an attempt to get us all in each other's throats and say no to this, because this is 21st century warfare.
[00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:17.525]  This is being run by the mainstream media we know is our enemy, by the globalists that run the federal government that we know have hijacked it.
[00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:20.166]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:28.969]  The mayor is saying it's white people's fault in Dallas!
[00:26:28.969 --> 00:26:30.810]  He's a big, fat, white guy.
[00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.791]  These people are pimping everyone, and I'm done with it.
[00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:34.920]  Let's play a clip here.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.804]  This is the Black El Paso Police Chief.
[00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:41.269]  His record's one of the best in the country.
[00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.870]  Greg Allen.
[00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.134]  This is what he had to say to reporters about Black Lives Matter.
[00:26:46.255 --> 00:26:52.739]  Black Lives Matter as far as I'm concerned is a radical hate group.
[00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:58.382]  And for that purpose alone, I think the leadership of this country needs to look a little bit harder at that particular group.
[00:26:58.382 --> 00:27:03.065]  The consequences of what we saw in Dallas is due to their efforts.
[00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:03.826]  Any other questions?
[00:27:05.265 --> 00:27:17.111]  Well, let's go ahead now and let's go to Obama defending Black Lives Matter while he's over in Europe trying to merge the EU with Eastern Europe after another night of horrific violence, which I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:27:17.111 --> 00:27:18.392]  Here, let's go to that.
[00:27:18.392 --> 00:27:34.800]  Now, in a movement like Black Lives Matter, there's always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent or overgeneralized or harsh.
[00:27:37.933 --> 00:27:52.909]  And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest.
[00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:54.891]  And there's another clip of him going after guns.
[00:27:54.891 --> 00:27:56.213]  But let's blame all gun owners!
[00:27:57.824 --> 00:27:59.004]  We're going to go out to break here.
[00:27:59.004 --> 00:28:02.606]  We have George Humphrey coming in the studio to talk about all this and a lot more.
[00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:06.827]  But when we return, I'll hold George a little bit with us in the next hour.
[00:28:06.827 --> 00:28:09.768]  I have Rudolf Giuliani, who I don't agree with on a lot of issues.
[00:28:09.768 --> 00:28:12.709]  What he said about Black Lives Matter is absolutely on target.
[00:28:12.709 --> 00:28:13.549]  We're going to play that.
[00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:17.430]  We have Sharpton saying, off the pigs.
[00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.731]  And again, he's an FBI informant.
[00:28:21.035 --> 00:28:28.588]  And the whole FBI is not involved either, but criminal elements in the federal government can only conquer America if we're at each other's throats.
[00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:30.070]  This is a no-brainer.
[00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.593]  This is not my opinion.
[00:28:31.593 --> 00:28:33.296]  This is a fact.
[00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:34.317]  InfoWars.com
[00:28:35.862 --> 00:28:36.502]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:37.323]  Stay with us.
[00:28:37.323 --> 00:28:39.284]  I'm Alex Jones and this is an attempt to bring down our Republic.
[00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.651]  Hey, everyone!
[00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:00.952]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:29:00.952 --> 00:29:04.795]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:29:04.795 --> 00:29:06.876]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:29:06.876 --> 00:29:17.143]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:29:17.143 --> 00:29:23.127]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:29:23.587 --> 00:29:38.524]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:38.944]  I think so.
[00:29:58.815 --> 00:30:00.457]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:30:00.457 --> 00:30:01.959]  You can't survive without it.
[00:30:01.959 --> 00:30:03.161]  But where do you get it?
[00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:09.149]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:14.877]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:30:15.057 --> 00:30:31.919]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:34.800]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.260]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.300]  Easy assembly.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.220]  Low maintenance.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.301]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:30:58.644 --> 00:30:59.144]  Not agree.
[00:30:59.144 --> 00:31:00.565]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:01.906]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:31:01.906 --> 00:31:03.127]  Why is this so good?
[00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:08.410]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:21.958]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:23.319]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:25.741]  Spreading disease around.
[00:31:25.741 --> 00:31:28.303]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.624]  These are all parasites.
[00:31:29.624 --> 00:31:30.725]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:32.067]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:31:32.067 --> 00:31:36.571]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:39.714]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:31:39.714 --> 00:31:42.917]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:31:42.917 --> 00:31:43.958]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:44.779]  Living Defense.
[00:31:44.779 --> 00:31:45.880]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.921]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:31:46.921 --> 00:31:48.943]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.507]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:31:51.507 --> 00:31:52.870]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.114]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:57.078]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:31:58.642 --> 00:32:02.624]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:08.927]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:16.211]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:32:16.211 --> 00:32:24.996]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:32:25.316 --> 00:32:31.481]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:36.324]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:32:36.324 --> 00:32:39.907]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:41.788]  No needles, no injections.
[00:32:41.788 --> 00:32:43.450]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.650]  Try it for yourself.
[00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.952]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[00:32:46.952 --> 00:32:52.136]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:54.998 --> 00:33:04.524]  InfoWarsLife Secret 12 You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:15.241]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:15.241 --> 00:33:20.724]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:20.724 --> 00:33:23.987]  We've got gunfire hitting the police station in San Antonio.
[00:33:23.987 --> 00:33:26.268]  We've got cops shot in Georgia.
[00:33:26.268 --> 00:33:28.830]  We've got white drivers shot in Georgia.
[00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.691]  Shot in Tennessee.
[00:33:29.691 --> 00:33:31.772]  White cops shot in Tennessee.
[00:33:31.772 --> 00:33:32.953]  Cops shot in Florida.
[00:33:32.953 --> 00:33:35.935]  Cops shot in all over the news.
[00:33:35.935 --> 00:33:39.818]  We have a video coming up of Al Sharpton saying, off the pigs.
[00:33:41.118 --> 00:33:45.740]  We've got Obama saying gun control is necessary if you care about the safety of our police officers.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:53.642]  As the media just winds up mentally ill people and all these government funded groups say kill the cops, deck the halls with dead cops.
[00:33:53.642 --> 00:33:56.423]  None of them are to blame though, Obama said, we just played that.
[00:33:56.423 --> 00:33:58.263]  No, no, it's gun owners are to blame.
[00:33:58.263 --> 00:34:01.204]  And Hillary says it is whites and racist cops.
[00:34:01.844 --> 00:34:09.155]  Hard to blame, and even though an Asian guy shot this black man that was a felon aiming a gun at him in Houston, even the guy's wife said he aimed a gun at him and the cop shot him.
[00:34:09.155 --> 00:34:10.177]  My God, believe these cops?
[00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:12.180]  This Asian cop, you aim a gun at him, he shoots you?
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:17.047]  And then it's... I saw comments on Twitter, they're on InfoWars, by Black Lives Matter groups saying, well...
[00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:21.390]  Well, white supremacy can operate through minorities.
[00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:25.173]  You know, you're an Asian cop, somebody points a gun at you and you defend yourself.
[00:34:25.173 --> 00:34:27.654]  Again, and I'm not anti-black people.
[00:34:27.654 --> 00:34:33.238]  I want black people to succeed and be successful and they're just amazing, great people.
[00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.079]  But this is social engineering.
[00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:44.553]  This is the media taking an issue that is tiny compared to everything else, like flesh-eating bacteria, or diabetes, or blacks killing blacks, or whatever.
[00:34:44.553 --> 00:34:47.193]  I mean, you're talking a problem a hundred times bigger.
[00:34:47.193 --> 00:34:57.936]  And just making this the end of the world, and mainstream media pushing it, and Google and Facebook pushing it, and Facebook lighting up its whole offices Friday saying, Black Lives Matter.
[00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:08.439]  And Zuckerberg saying don't criticize anybody that's from Black Lives Matter because his own employees are criticizing him because it's a program to cause infighting.
[00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.640]  Now let's play Giuliani, then I'm going to our guest who's in studio with us.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.282]  The reality in the black community is there's too much violence in the black community.
[00:35:16.282 --> 00:35:26.305]  So a black will die 1% or less at the hands of the police and 99% at the hands of a civilian, most often another black.
[00:35:27.305 --> 00:35:42.270]  So, if you want to protect black lives, then you've got to protect black lives not just against police, which happens rarely, although with tremendous attention, and which happens every 14 hours in Chicago.
[00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.730]  Every 14 hours.
[00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.811]  And we never hear from Black Lives Matter.
[00:35:47.811 --> 00:35:55.734]  So, if you want to deal with this on the black side, you've got to teach your children to be respectful to the police,
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:10.136]  And you've got to teach your children that the real danger to them is not the police, the real danger to them, 99 out of 100 times, 9,900 out of 1,000 times, are other black kids who are going to kill them.
[00:36:10.136 --> 00:36:11.478]  That's the way they're going to die.
[00:36:12.939 --> 00:36:16.401]  And when you say black lives matter, that's exactly racist.
[00:36:16.401 --> 00:36:21.143]  Folks, I've got issues with Giuliani on some issues, but I mean, that is absolute truth.
[00:36:21.143 --> 00:36:23.143]  And this is my problem.
[00:36:23.143 --> 00:36:26.585]  I have the Justice Department own numbers last year.
[00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:31.047]  258 black Americans were killed by police.
[00:36:31.047 --> 00:36:34.748]  Let's just say all of those were illegitimate, even though most of it was probably legitimate.
[00:36:34.748 --> 00:36:35.749]  Let's just say all of it's bad.
[00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:42.441]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's over 500 blacks killed by blacks in Chicago last year.
[00:36:42.441 --> 00:36:46.102]  It's 2,000 plus shots so far this year in Chicago.
[00:36:46.102 --> 00:36:46.943]  It's not the cops.
[00:36:46.943 --> 00:36:50.464]  All I'm saying is, I don't like warrantless checkpoints.
[00:36:50.464 --> 00:36:51.945]  I don't like DWI blood draws.
[00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:56.386]  I don't like a lot of unconstitutional stuff going on with the police, but that's our governments that are doing that.
[00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:57.407]  That's where we should change it.
[00:36:58.322 --> 00:37:01.425]  But it's so clear it's an attempt at causing a civil war.
[00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:02.786]  And I've been using that term for a long time.
[00:37:02.786 --> 00:37:08.190]  Now that's being picked up and you see folks actually calling for a civil war.
[00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:15.136]  Now, George Humphrey is a very successful businessman, author, researcher, major exporter, importer, you name it, good friend of mine.
[00:37:15.136 --> 00:37:15.536]  I remember
[00:37:16.505 --> 00:37:24.689]  Twenty-five years ago, when I was working for Pat Buchanan's campaign, as I was a high school senior, going to his house to pick up hundreds of signs he was going to put up around town.
[00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:27.870]  And then as soon as I got on Axios television, on local talk radio, he was a talk show host.
[00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.832]  So I've been friends with this guy, really 21 years, but knew him 25 years ago.
[00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:36.494]  And he has, was a Democrat on the city council, but he's a patriot.
[00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:40.557]  And he's somebody that has been warning of this and warning of a destabilization program.
[00:37:40.557 --> 00:37:48.283]  He's with us to the bottom of the hour next hour, and I have a very special report dealing with NATO talking about trying to move missiles up against the Russian border.
[00:37:48.283 --> 00:37:51.626]  They feel like if Russia moved missiles into Cuba, this is a big deal.
[00:37:51.626 --> 00:37:54.208]  Putin has said they're looking at actually bombing those missiles.
[00:37:55.568 --> 00:37:58.830]  And so the Ministry of Defense has said that, their foreign minister has said that.
[00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.990]  So this is really escalating.
[00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.631]  We've got that special report coming up.
[00:38:02.631 --> 00:38:04.672]  I intend to take a few calls next hour.
[00:38:04.672 --> 00:38:08.654]  But we've got Hillary Clinton blames whites and cops for deaths of young black men.
[00:38:08.654 --> 00:38:12.776]  The video article is up on Infowars.com from Breitbart.
[00:38:12.776 --> 00:38:16.357]  We just have all this craziness and it's just so sad.
[00:38:16.357 --> 00:38:17.158]  Don't people know?
[00:38:17.958 --> 00:38:23.203]  The establishment that's screwing us all over and robbing us all of our freedoms and our future is pushing this.
[00:38:23.203 --> 00:38:25.885]  So the question is, why are they pushing it?
[00:38:25.885 --> 00:38:30.029]  And then, of course, George has some info on Trump and his big concerns.
[00:38:30.029 --> 00:38:31.611]  George, great to have you here with us.
[00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:35.594]  Alex, it's always great to be here and I love seeing you.
[00:38:35.594 --> 00:38:40.038]  And for those who are listening, I've known Alex for a long time and I'll tell you what, he is a
[00:38:41.517 --> 00:38:47.082]  He's a dear friend of mine, and what he's saying today is so right on.
[00:38:47.082 --> 00:38:48.423]  It's so right on.
[00:38:48.423 --> 00:38:52.706]  In the period of time that we're in right now, it's chaos.
[00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:57.910]  And it's fixing to get a lot, lot, lot worse in the near future.
[00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:06.497]  And so that's why it's up to us, who are sitting in the studio, but more as importantly, or more importantly, to the people who are listening.
[00:39:06.497 --> 00:39:10.721]  Our country, our republic, our culture, our world,
[00:39:12.265 --> 00:39:14.607]  is worth preserving.
[00:39:14.607 --> 00:39:17.730]  The good things of this nation are so overwhelming.
[00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.792]  I travel all over the world.
[00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:25.277]  I travel through China, through Southeast Asia, through Europe, South America, and I'll tell you what.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:32.643]  The Republic, the Constitutional Republic of this country, where there is supposedly a nation of laws.
[00:39:32.643 --> 00:39:50.811]  This is something a very, very positive thing and quite clearly the things that Alex and I have been talking about on air for the last 25 years is that there is a concentrated, very focused movement by the Illuminati to destroy the middle class, to destroy the good things of this country.
[00:39:50.811 --> 00:39:52.411]  And it's anti-human!
[00:39:52.411 --> 00:39:53.652]  Absolutely, it's anti...
[00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:56.563]  Listen to what Alex has said.
[00:39:56.563 --> 00:39:58.384]  It's anti-human.
[00:39:58.384 --> 00:40:04.428]  Human beings don't go in and kill 55 people in a club.
[00:40:04.428 --> 00:40:08.590]  They don't do these things unless they're Manchurian candidates.
[00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.573]  One issue after another issue after another issue just in the last two or three weeks.
[00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:17.315]  It is so absolutely clear and powerful.
[00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.836]  We're facing an evil intellect.
[00:40:19.236 --> 00:40:23.080]  That the Manchurian candidate vibration is out there.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:30.026]  And then the question is, first of all, we have to be aware that the predominant media is completely manipulated.
[00:40:30.026 --> 00:40:33.789]  I can't believe the cops weren't even cold and they were blaming the cops.
[00:40:33.789 --> 00:40:34.370]  Absolutely.
[00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.971]  I mean the president was on Friday.
[00:40:35.971 --> 00:40:36.812]  This is incredible.
[00:40:36.912 --> 00:40:42.234]  You know, Alex, when I was on the city council, you know, I've been kind of a hippie all my life.
[00:40:42.234 --> 00:40:48.437]  And, you know, I remember being pulled over many times in Houston when I had long hair and being pushed around.
[00:40:48.437 --> 00:40:49.698]  And I didn't like it.
[00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:54.000]  But I was also a city councilman and I helped run the police department in the city.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.021]  And we had a hell heck of a good police department.
[00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.162]  Chief Edwards, he was a
[00:40:59.286 --> 00:41:02.307]  But there's a clear plan to overthrow everything?
[00:41:22.654 --> 00:41:23.295]  Absolutely.
[00:41:23.295 --> 00:41:24.916]  This is an attack on America.
[00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:29.380]  And if a policeman breaks the law, he should be tried and convicted.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:36.927]  But what is going on right now, as you're saying so eloquently, it's unbelievable that these people believe it.
[00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:44.113]  They're like, oh yeah, the President and the Attorney General, we've got to reform the cops in response to cops being dead.
[00:41:44.113 --> 00:41:46.155]  It's their fault they're dead.
[00:41:46.155 --> 00:41:47.336]  It's their fault they got shot.
[00:41:47.336 --> 00:41:47.957]  What the hell?
[00:41:48.297 --> 00:41:49.818]  And you know where this is coming from?
[00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:54.280]  This is not coming from somebody like Malcolm X or somebody like this.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.801]  George Soros, a Nazi collaborator.
[00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:59.462]  Hillary Clinton, all these globalists.
[00:41:59.462 --> 00:42:04.204]  He is a Hungarian communist, billionaire, who his track record
[00:42:05.618 --> 00:42:13.645]  It is white communist Illuminati stooges who are funding this, who are paying these Black Lives Matter.
[00:42:13.645 --> 00:42:15.386]  They admit that.
[00:42:15.386 --> 00:42:17.668]  $16 an hour to go out and do this stuff.
[00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.269]  Friends, please.
[00:42:19.269 --> 00:42:21.071]  Why is George Soros not arrested?
[00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.572]  He's involved in sedition.
[00:42:22.572 --> 00:42:25.595]  Of course he is, because we are, we are
[00:42:26.707 --> 00:42:29.429]  The situation in this country is past the rule of law.
[00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:30.530]  The truth is, you can look at Soros.
[00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.690]  He's tied into the dark side.
[00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:32.751]  Of course, of course he is.
[00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:37.594]  That guy's getting orders directly from the frickin'... And he wants to be part of the Illuminati.
[00:42:37.594 --> 00:42:39.355]  He's still a small time guy.
[00:42:39.355 --> 00:42:41.177]  He's getting direct orders from hell, folks.
[00:42:41.177 --> 00:42:42.277]  Look, I'll just say it.
[00:42:42.277 --> 00:42:42.978]  Your new book's out.
[00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:44.219]  It's about where they're getting the orders from.
[00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:45.580]  It's satanic, folks.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.420]  Life, love, and joy.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.281]  George Humphrey, my good friend.
[00:42:48.281 --> 00:42:49.662]  These people are out to get the whole planet.
[00:42:49.662 --> 00:42:50.743]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:42:50.743 --> 00:42:52.224]  You gotta unite against them.
[00:42:52.224 --> 00:42:54.966]  There's already been shot in the back.
[00:42:54.966 --> 00:42:56.307]  Nearly five cops in Dallas.
[00:42:58.246 --> 00:43:04.528]  Last week we pointed out that globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[00:43:04.528 --> 00:43:08.449]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:12.410]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.631]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:17.251]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[00:43:17.251 --> 00:43:18.592]  It wants to make us dependent.
[00:43:18.592 --> 00:43:20.132]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[00:43:20.132 --> 00:43:22.833]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[00:43:23.513 --> 00:43:30.357]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our knees and where we capitulate to their demands.
[00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:38.081]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week, because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[00:43:38.081 --> 00:43:44.105]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:44.765 --> 00:43:51.491]  You declare your independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:43:51.491 --> 00:43:55.374]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com

[00:45:58.642 --> 00:46:02.807]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:02.807 --> 00:46:10.116]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:46:10.256 --> 00:46:21.725]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:46:21.725 --> 00:46:29.231]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:46:29.531 --> 00:46:39.195]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:46:39.195 --> 00:46:43.617]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:46:43.617 --> 00:46:50.700]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.160]  That means it's clean.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.321]  That means it's pure.
[00:46:53.321 --> 00:46:56.242]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:46:56.242 --> 00:46:57.903]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:11.615]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.615 --> 00:47:13.456]  We are on the march.
[00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:16.618]  The empire is on the run.
[00:47:16.618 --> 00:47:20.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:22.887 --> 00:47:29.050]  Folks, we're gonna get into some really heavy stuff because I'm noticing either people are more awake or they're like zombies now.
[00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.673]  People I've known for 20, 30 years suddenly just hardly talk and just watch TV all day.
[00:47:33.673 --> 00:47:35.654]  They're in a mesmerized state.
[00:47:35.654 --> 00:47:38.696]  Even mainstream media admits most kids have lower language skills.
[00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.639]  ...are in a dream state, are brain damaged.
[00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:53.530]  They have this new Pokemon system where it projects false reality into the real world and you wear these goggles and use your phone and play Pokemon in the real world and kids are like collapsing and stuff and having convulsions that's happened before.
[00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.073]  The point is there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:58.655]  A lot of really advanced things going on.
[00:47:58.655 --> 00:48:00.837]  And so when you see this whole Black Lives Matter thing...
[00:48:01.744 --> 00:48:03.565]  I told the story Friday.
[00:48:03.565 --> 00:48:18.811]  Thursday, the day this happened, I was supposed to go meet with a supplement maker who had come up with a supplement over a decade ago that was put in Whole Foods, that's really high quality, but never took off nationally, that I was looking at trying to have an acquisition of.
[00:48:18.811 --> 00:48:19.351]  That's what we do.
[00:48:19.351 --> 00:48:21.071]  We fund ourselves with products.
[00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:22.172]  Got a big sale going right now.
[00:48:22.172 --> 00:48:23.832]  That ends tomorrow.
[00:48:23.832 --> 00:48:27.834]  20-40% off at FullRestore.com, but I digress.
[00:48:27.834 --> 00:48:29.054]  And she couldn't go to the meeting.
[00:48:29.054 --> 00:48:29.415]  She said,
[00:48:31.259 --> 00:48:35.690]  You know, the guy I had a baby with, he's been back to India, but he's Indian.
[00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:39.661]  You know, my son's five years old, he's half Indian, he's brown, the police are gonna kill him, I'm scared to go out.
[00:48:40.762 --> 00:48:46.827]  I had to sit there to a person who's successful in business and go, Indians don't even show up on the police shooting rate.
[00:48:46.827 --> 00:48:52.211]  Indians probably have some white collar crime, but there's like no known Indians being shot.
[00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:52.951]  And it didn't matter to her.
[00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:53.852]  She goes, she's brown.
[00:48:53.852 --> 00:48:54.532]  No, he's brown.
[00:48:54.532 --> 00:48:55.413]  He's brown.
[00:48:55.413 --> 00:48:59.696]  This is this mind control where people really believe this is an epidemic.
[00:48:59.696 --> 00:49:02.819]  This is an example of someone completely living in fear.
[00:49:02.819 --> 00:49:06.441]  Forget if the police are good or bad, this woman is literally
[00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:13.905]  You know, sitting there in her nice house, in her nice car, successful business person, shaking in fear that cops are going to kill her son because he's brown.
[00:49:13.905 --> 00:49:16.425]  It's total BS, George!
[00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:25.749]  Well, first of all, what we need to remember, what I need to keep remembering, is that white, black, Hispanic, Asian, we're all human beings.
[00:49:25.749 --> 00:49:28.630]  We're all part of... Cops have not shot any Indians that I know of!
[00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.511]  We're all part of God's creation.
[00:49:30.511 --> 00:49:32.592]  Exactly, but it's not... You know what?
[00:49:32.592 --> 00:49:33.212]  And I have...
[00:49:35.146 --> 00:49:45.350]  I have a lot of friends who are of color, and my friends of color are more aware of the New World Order, relatively, than most of the white people.
[00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.750]  That's what I found.
[00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.531]  Is that why they're being targeted?
[00:49:48.531 --> 00:49:55.633]  Absolutely, because they separate and control, separate and control, separate and control.
[00:49:55.633 --> 00:49:57.214]  By and large, most
[00:49:58.735 --> 00:50:10.449]  Native, black people, most African Americans are aware of the new world order, they want freedom, they've known direct slavery, and they're aware of the insanity.
[00:50:10.449 --> 00:50:13.893]  This is an absolute... So they're used as the detonator though?
[00:50:13.893 --> 00:50:14.854]  Of course they are!
[00:50:15.234 --> 00:50:30.904]  And the thing about it is, remember that all of Black Lives Matter is being funded by Eastern European Hungarian Communists through this, and most of the people saying the most outrageous things are white punks.
[00:50:30.904 --> 00:50:31.424]  They're the leaders.
[00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:32.925]  They're white punks!
[00:50:32.925 --> 00:50:38.209]  I've dealt with two or three of these kids in the last couple weeks, and it's like,
[00:50:39.235 --> 00:50:41.576]  You are unbelievable!
[00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:48.018]  And most of the black people that I've talked to in the last two or three weeks, they're just rolling their eyes.
[00:50:48.018 --> 00:50:50.519]  No, I agree, I agree, but the media... Most of the blocks aren't buying it either.
[00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:52.980]  No, I agree, but the media takes it and makes it look like that.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.681]  Of course it is!
[00:50:53.681 --> 00:50:55.801]  George, I mean, let's talk about, you're a smart guy.
[00:50:55.801 --> 00:50:57.462]  Business, politics, you name it.
[00:50:57.462 --> 00:50:58.522]  What is the point of this?
[00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:04.945]  Because to me, it's so ridiculous to have Hillary and the mayor of Dallas and Obama blaming the cops and white people and all this.
[00:51:04.945 --> 00:51:06.585]  Obviously, this is their own doing.
[00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.466]  They've set this up.
[00:51:08.126 --> 00:51:09.266]  What is the point of all this?
[00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:17.689]  Okay, first of all, you and I both know that a magician waves his hand up here with the wand, and it gets everybody looking up here.
[00:51:17.689 --> 00:51:18.589]  But he's picking your watch.
[00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:20.350]  So what are they doing while we're doing this?
[00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.550]  While we're watching this?
[00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:24.431]  They're creating a civil war.
[00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:30.613]  And destroying us, because America is the last bastion of freedom.
[00:51:30.613 --> 00:51:36.575]  As Thomas Paine used to say, America can be the beacon of freedom for the rest of the world.
[00:51:36.575 --> 00:51:36.975]  That's it, that's it.
[00:51:36.975 --> 00:51:38.216]  This is an attack on our country.
[00:51:38.216 --> 00:51:45.158]  Of course, attack on not only our country, but all of the good things that all human beings desire.
[00:51:45.158 --> 00:51:50.560]  That's right, they tried to take over our institutions, they haven't been fully successful, so now they're going to take a wrecking ball to it.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:52:09.044]  Yes, and the point is, is that if we human beings, if we use our common sense and we have a little bit of love in our hearts and a little bit of courage in our spines, we can easily see through this and we have, I'm a relative optimist.
[00:52:09.044 --> 00:52:16.705]  I know, I know that we as human beings, black, white, all of us together, we can stop this stuff.
[00:52:16.705 --> 00:52:17.465]  We do!
[00:52:17.465 --> 00:52:17.845]  That's it!
[00:52:17.845 --> 00:52:20.006]  I don't want us to be conned and be failures!
[00:52:20.506 --> 00:52:25.029]  Because I love everybody, and I have to sit here and just watch this government-funded crap.
[00:52:25.029 --> 00:52:26.030]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:32.134]  You know, I've known Alex for a long, long time, and you know what?
[00:52:32.134 --> 00:52:40.260]  There is not a person in this country who's talking about equal rights any more than you are, because it takes
[00:52:41.383 --> 00:52:44.845]  It's going to take all of us fighting this insanity.
[00:52:44.845 --> 00:52:46.446]  It's going to take all of us.
[00:52:46.446 --> 00:52:55.731]  And so for the listeners out there who are not white middle class people, who are supposedly the rednecks, we're all in this together.
[00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:56.591]  Slavery.
[00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:59.233]  It used to be the blacks were the slaves we saw.
[00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:00.954]  Now everyone is a slave.
[00:53:00.954 --> 00:53:02.915]  It's psychological slavery.
[00:53:02.915 --> 00:53:05.596]  The only way the slave master can win is playing us off against each other.
[00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:05.876]  Yes.
[00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:06.877]  What do you think?
[00:53:06.877 --> 00:53:08.918]  I see desperation in Hillary and the globalists.
[00:53:09.198 --> 00:53:09.539]  Of course.
[00:53:09.539 --> 00:53:10.501]  Let's get to the big point.
[00:53:10.501 --> 00:53:13.567]  You came in with some very chilling statements.
[00:53:13.567 --> 00:53:14.408]  I respect you.
[00:53:14.408 --> 00:53:16.392]  If you've warned me about it, it's always come true.
[00:53:16.392 --> 00:53:18.436]  You warned me about derivatives ten years before I knew what they were.
[00:53:20.097 --> 00:53:23.658]  George Humphrey, best-selling author, researcher, businessman.
[00:53:23.658 --> 00:53:26.058]  What is going on with Donald Trump?
[00:53:26.058 --> 00:53:28.799]  You were telling me earlier, yes, he's for real, but they're going to kill him.
[00:53:28.799 --> 00:53:30.519]  Well, I didn't say they're going to kill him.
[00:53:30.519 --> 00:53:31.620]  You said they're going to try.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.120]  That's a possibility.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.021]  Now, history repeats itself.
[00:53:36.021 --> 00:53:38.661]  In 1980, Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan.
[00:53:38.661 --> 00:53:41.982]  They had a Rangate.
[00:53:41.982 --> 00:53:46.543]  1991, we had Waco in Oklahoma City when Bill Clinton came in.
[00:53:48.223 --> 00:53:49.884]  In 2001, we had 9-11.
[00:53:49.884 --> 00:53:52.085]  These are all false flags.
[00:53:52.085 --> 00:53:57.888]  In 2008, we had the controlled breakdown of the economy.
[00:53:57.888 --> 00:54:10.135]  There's a very high possibility that there's going to be a major... And if you look at this, all these false flags have progressed in magnitude.
[00:54:10.135 --> 00:54:13.296]  And so what we're looking at... The next one's going to be huge.
[00:54:13.296 --> 00:54:13.817]  It could be.
[00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:19.502]  And the only way we stop it is to be aware of it right now.
[00:54:19.502 --> 00:54:22.905]  To do everything we can to diffuse that and to put it out.
[00:54:22.905 --> 00:54:25.147]  That's right, because if the enemy knows we're aware, they're going to back off.
[00:54:25.147 --> 00:54:27.329]  Now clearly, clearly, Ms.
[00:54:27.329 --> 00:54:28.911]  Hillary Rodham Clinton
[00:54:30.356 --> 00:54:36.900]  You know, back in the 90s, I wrote a couple books, one called Common Sense, another called Uncommon Sense.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.683]  I went up to Arkansas, and I met with a bunch of researchers up there.
[00:54:40.683 --> 00:54:42.064]  I went to Mena, Arkansas.
[00:54:42.064 --> 00:54:43.265]  I did the whole thing.
[00:54:43.265 --> 00:54:47.247]  And there's a whole list of the 82 different people between 1979 and 1992, between the ages of 12 and 57,
[00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:53.451]  Who all died violent deaths.
[00:54:53.451 --> 00:54:54.251]  And guess what?
[00:54:54.251 --> 00:54:57.833]  Their only common denominator was their connection with the Clintons.
[00:54:57.833 --> 00:54:59.393]  I'm not the one who came up with this.
[00:54:59.393 --> 00:55:00.914]  It's all over the internet.
[00:55:00.914 --> 00:55:03.375]  And anybody listening to this can check it out.
[00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:04.055]  It's called Arkansas.
[00:55:04.055 --> 00:55:05.496]  It's called Arkansas.
[00:55:05.496 --> 00:55:09.898]  Just like Bill Clinton's father was not Clinton.
[00:55:09.898 --> 00:55:11.659]  You know who Bill Clinton's real father was.
[00:55:11.659 --> 00:55:11.979]  Rockefeller.
[00:55:12.239 --> 00:55:14.780]  Yeah, Bill Clinton is a Rockefeller!
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.122]  That's the reason he got to go to Georgetown.
[00:55:17.122 --> 00:55:18.883]  That's the reason he got a Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:55:18.883 --> 00:55:21.684]  That's the way he got to Russia without a visa.
[00:55:21.684 --> 00:55:23.665]  That's the way he got to Yale Law School.
[00:55:23.665 --> 00:55:28.688]  That's the way he got elected the Attorney General of Arkansas at age 26.
[00:55:28.688 --> 00:55:30.409]  Come on, folks, let's wake up.
[00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:32.150]  Now, I think that about
[00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:46.657]  85 to 95 percent of the people who are listening to this probably know this, but the point is, is that it is up to us, the people who are listening to this show, is that it is up to us to build our base.
[00:55:46.657 --> 00:55:49.799]  We have to get, we need to reach a critical mass.
[00:55:50.419 --> 00:56:02.126]  And each of you who are listening, understand you are powerful, you have the ability to make a change, and as Mahatma Gandhi used to say, in the heart of each man and woman is the seed of the universe.
[00:56:02.126 --> 00:56:11.651]  No matter what color you are, how much money you've got, da da da da da da, realize that what we're saying, and what you're hearing, and what you know to be true,
[00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:16.614]  Is that love and justice and right action is important.
[00:56:16.614 --> 00:56:22.979]  We do not need to go down this road toward chaos and that's exactly what is being planned for us.
[00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.220]  It's so naked though, George, when you're awake.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:31.004]  I mean, I look at Hillary saying it's white people's fault and look at Obama saying that.
[00:56:31.004 --> 00:56:32.626]  It's just legitimizing this.
[00:56:32.626 --> 00:56:33.866]  They want this to get worse.
[00:56:33.866 --> 00:56:34.307]  Of course!
[00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:36.169]  Of course!
[00:56:36.169 --> 00:56:37.830]  I mean, it's so obvious!
[00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.493]  You and I did two... You were the lead guy.
[00:56:40.493 --> 00:56:44.157]  We did fall the Republic and the Obama deception.
[00:56:44.157 --> 00:56:47.280]  And we said Obama would do this, and this, and all.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.383]  And in fact, he did about three times more.
[00:56:50.383 --> 00:56:51.044]  Nobody but
[00:56:51.084 --> 00:56:55.545]  But nobody, except you, is talking about the TPP.
[00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:59.446]  It makes NAFTA and GATT seem like child's play.
[00:56:59.446 --> 00:57:05.747]  The TPP sells the sovereignty of this country, and nobody's talking about it.
[00:57:05.747 --> 00:57:19.810]  World governments coming in, taking full control of our lives, and we're sitting here seeing civil war be started in America, and police attacks across the country, as if police that are run by our governments, that we elect and control, are the problem.
[00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:24.894]  We need to look ourselves in the mirror and we need to look government in the mirror and take it back.
[00:57:24.894 --> 00:57:26.955]  This is out of control.
[00:57:26.955 --> 00:57:29.217]  Second Hour with George Humphrey, my friend, straight ahead.
[00:57:29.217 --> 00:57:33.420]  We'll talk about his book that gets into who are the Illuminati?
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.361]  Who pulls their strings?
[00:57:34.361 --> 00:57:35.842]  Why are they so unified?
[00:57:35.842 --> 00:57:37.504]  Life, Love, Joy.
[00:57:37.504 --> 00:57:39.906]  George Humphrey, the new book.
[00:57:39.906 --> 00:57:41.627]  We'll tell you how to get it straight ahead.
[00:57:41.627 --> 00:57:43.929]  We also have a huge special going and infortwestore.com.
[00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:48.881]  Shower Filters.
[00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:50.622]  We're introducing the best yet.

[00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:21.312]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:21.312 --> 00:58:29.555]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:58:29.555 --> 00:58:34.976]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:50.785]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:50.785 --> 00:58:52.086]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:52.086 --> 00:58:53.307]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:53.307 --> 00:58:58.592]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:58.592 --> 00:59:12.145]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:12.145 --> 00:59:13.506]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:14.267 --> 00:59:15.908]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:15.908 --> 00:59:18.491]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:19.792]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:19.792 --> 00:59:20.893]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:59:20.893 --> 00:59:22.234]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:22.234 --> 00:59:26.757]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:26.757 --> 00:59:29.900]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.061]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:33.061 --> 00:59:34.122]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:34.122 --> 00:59:36.062]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:36.062 --> 00:59:37.083]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:39.764]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:39.764 --> 00:59:43.045]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:43.045 --> 00:59:45.286]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:45.286 --> 00:59:52.389]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:55.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:08.387]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:11.888]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.888 --> 01:00:13.469]  By the way, it's not about credit.
[01:00:13.469 --> 01:00:17.490]  My crew doesn't want credit, neither do I. But George Humphrey's trying to give me credit.
[01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.431]  This guy is amazing.
[01:00:18.431 --> 01:00:19.271]  I learned so much from him.
[01:00:19.891 --> 01:00:33.196]  25 years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago a year ago five minutes ago, but also Nico and Daria and Wes and just all the rest of the crew Everybody they're amazing making this all possible you the listeners the affiliates.
[01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:43.619]  I am very honored to be here Trying to just have prosperity common sense peace among men and women And just brotherly love the problem is throughout history.
[01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:46.120]  There's an unseen force Christians called the devil
[01:00:47.014 --> 01:00:49.175]  That is manipulating human society.
[01:00:49.175 --> 01:00:51.075]  We're going to talk about that more in the next segment.
[01:00:51.075 --> 01:00:59.777]  I'm going to take a few calls as well before George leaves us at about 45 after when I air this special report on Putin warning of nuclear war that's so important it's gotten no attention.
[01:00:59.777 --> 01:01:01.338]  That's why we're going to air it.
[01:01:01.338 --> 01:01:04.519]  But the toll-free number to join us, a different number than the weekday number, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:04.599]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:06.739]  I'm not going to say first-time callers.
[01:01:06.739 --> 01:01:08.320]  I'm just saying have a good phone.
[01:01:13.161 --> 01:01:14.162]  Have your point, your question.
[01:01:14.162 --> 01:01:16.304]  We really want to talk to you.
[01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:17.365]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:01:17.365 --> 01:01:20.968]  All right, George, we've got three minutes, four minutes to break.
[01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:24.010]  Look, I don't know how the whole universe works.
[01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.712]  We're born on this planet in the middle of space around the sun.
[01:01:26.712 --> 01:01:27.613]  What is this?
[01:01:27.613 --> 01:01:29.394]  It's all crazy.
[01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.595]  But I've studied history.
[01:01:30.595 --> 01:01:39.403]  Every ancient society said there's a dark evil force manipulating through the ether, you know, from the sky, from another dimension to try to destroy humanity.
[01:01:39.403 --> 01:01:40.564]  And then I see our own elite.
[01:01:41.513 --> 01:01:48.917]  There's no doubt they're trying to destroy the creation, the genetics, the planet, us, while always posing that they're our saviors.
[01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.438]  Now, I haven't read your book yet, just got it today.
[01:01:50.438 --> 01:01:54.180]  I know you're a really smart guy, but basically you get into the unseen hand.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.761]  What's behind the Illuminati?
[01:01:55.761 --> 01:02:03.325]  Well, I know whether it's Bohemian Grove or Skull and Bones or any group, they believe they're praying to entities in another dimension that are giving them knowledge.
[01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:12.108]  And then I look at Darwin and Huxley and all these people, they envisioned biometrics, DNA, atomic weapons, a hundred years before they were being used.
[01:02:12.108 --> 01:02:19.791]  So, they're, whatever it is, humans who believe they're interfacing with something on the other side aren't getting something.
[01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:21.332]  I mean, there's something to this.
[01:02:21.332 --> 01:02:22.433]  There's no question.
[01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:27.737]  And the one called Jesus, his real name was Yeshua ben Joseph.
[01:02:27.737 --> 01:02:31.319]  He put an amazing soul on this planet.
[01:02:31.319 --> 01:02:36.804]  Now, his family, they were from an Essene family, but they were also Nazarene.
[01:02:36.804 --> 01:02:40.486]  The Nazarenes were kind of like the hippies of the Mediterranean.
[01:02:40.486 --> 01:02:43.649]  They were very, very cool, and they knew the prophecies and everything.
[01:02:44.529 --> 01:02:52.671]  In the mid-1940s, the Nag Hammadi, these texts were found in Egypt, and they were very well done.
[01:02:52.671 --> 01:03:00.752]  And they were the writings of the Essenes and the Nazarenes about what they saw as the world, as what was going on.
[01:03:00.752 --> 01:03:06.173]  Forty percent of what they talked about was called the arconic energy.
[01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:11.214]  And the Nazarenes, who were part of the tradition of the one called Jesus,
[01:03:11.994 --> 01:03:22.627]  wrote that there was a dark force and energy called the Archons that were not biological but it was sentient energy that comes down to... The Arabs call them genies!
[01:03:22.627 --> 01:03:23.749]  Of course!
[01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:25.631]  Of course!
[01:03:25.631 --> 01:03:28.875]  I won't go into that because I have some pretty
[01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:38.304]  Dark opinions about some of the people who are doing this, but why are human beings acting so crazy?
[01:03:38.304 --> 01:03:40.226]  Why are we doing this?
[01:03:40.226 --> 01:03:46.793]  If you talk to 99 out of 100 people, we can figure out how to make this world better, just like that.
[01:03:46.793 --> 01:03:47.954]  I'm not racist.
[01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:49.295]  I don't want to screw people over.
[01:03:49.295 --> 01:03:51.137]  No, we want... I don't have bad wisdom.
[01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:55.179]  As you said before, a rising tide lifts all ships.
[01:03:55.179 --> 01:04:14.007]  We want there to be prosperity for everybody, but there is a force in this universe, there is a force in this galaxy, there is a force in this solar system, and there's a force on this planet that is intentionally creating chaos and eating off of that energy.
[01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:16.807]  It's called the Arconic Force.
[01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:20.568]  And you know about this, I know about this, it's all over.
[01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:30.130]  And the point is, is that we as human beings represent the highest vibration of potential vibration of universal consciousness.
[01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:35.871]  Now, our DNA is still relatively simple, but it has the potential to grow.
[01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:37.371]  We'll talk about it more.
[01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:38.531]  We'll talk about it more on Tuesday.
[01:04:38.531 --> 01:04:39.791]  You're coming back on Tuesday.
[01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:42.452]  And look, whether people believe this or not, I've studied the elites.
[01:04:42.452 --> 01:04:43.152]  They believe this.
[01:04:43.953 --> 01:04:47.175]  But they are, like, tuned into the evil, thinking it's going to give them some power.
[01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.616]  They're going to build a machine and merge with it and be gone.
[01:04:49.616 --> 01:04:49.937]  Absolutely.
[01:04:49.937 --> 01:04:55.600]  They're totally throwing out everything we've already got for this promise of something they're getting.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.621]  It's just incredible.
[01:04:56.621 --> 01:04:56.961]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.306 --> 01:05:05.592]  Last week we pointed out the globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:09.515]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:13.478]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[01:05:13.478 --> 01:05:15.700]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.323]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[01:05:18.323 --> 01:05:19.664]  It wants to make us dependent.
[01:05:19.664 --> 01:05:21.205]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[01:05:21.205 --> 01:05:23.908]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[01:05:24.568 --> 01:05:31.411]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our knees and where we capitulate to their demands.
[01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:39.154]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week, because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[01:05:39.154 --> 01:05:45.157]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storable foods, or water filters, or shortwave radios at infowarestore.com.
[01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:52.540]  You declare your independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.922]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:07.960]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.742]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.742 --> 01:06:14.424]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:06:14.424 --> 01:06:17.366]  Run on for a long time.
[01:06:17.366 --> 01:06:20.228]  Run on for a long time.
[01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:23.190]  Sooner or later gotta put you down.
[01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:24.771]  Sooner or later gotta put you down.
[01:06:24.771 --> 01:06:28.674]  I was, during that 60 second break, ran in to get glass iced tea.
[01:06:31.616 --> 01:06:35.397]  And there was Obama on Fox News at NATO.
[01:06:35.397 --> 01:06:37.698]  We already played a clip last hour, but it was a new clip.
[01:06:37.698 --> 01:06:50.525]  It said live, this is going on like 10 o'clock at night over there or something, blaming tension and racism in communities for the cops getting shot in Dallas and saying gun control is the answer.
[01:06:50.525 --> 01:06:52.566]  The media hyped all this.
[01:06:52.566 --> 01:06:55.047]  There isn't an epidemic of blacks being shot by police.
[01:06:56.732 --> 01:07:01.314]  There's an epidemic of drug laws putting nonviolent people in jail, including blacks.
[01:07:01.314 --> 01:07:04.415]  And Hillary and Clinton got that through.
[01:07:04.415 --> 01:07:08.617]  And again, it's not about even being a Republican and blaming Democrats.
[01:07:08.617 --> 01:07:09.997]  I'm not a Republican.
[01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:11.778]  It's just logic and facts.
[01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.218]  It's not true.
[01:07:13.218 --> 01:07:14.479]  But it's the victory.
[01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.791]  A perception over reality.
[01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:18.951]  Delusion.
[01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:19.491]  Delusion.
[01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:20.431]  Lies.
[01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:21.751]  And who's the father of lies?
[01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:33.074]  George Humphrey, my friend, has written the new book that just came out, available on Amazon.com, Life, Love, Joy, A Story of Human Origins, The Polarity of Present Choices, and Our Unrealized Potential.
[01:07:33.074 --> 01:07:36.235]  And everything that globalists do is about suppressing our potential.
[01:07:36.235 --> 01:07:37.335]  And George is such a sweetheart.
[01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:39.195]  He's selling this book at cost.
[01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:40.076]  It's a powerful book.
[01:07:40.076 --> 01:07:40.736]  I just started reading it.
[01:07:41.736 --> 01:07:43.617]  He'll be back on Tuesday to talk about the book itself.
[01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:50.482]  But look, George, all I know is everything that social engineers do is about suppressing human potential.
[01:07:50.482 --> 01:07:53.564]  Everything they do is about cutting off resources.
[01:07:53.564 --> 01:07:59.929]  Everything they do is about telling us we're ugly, we're bad, we're no good, when we're not.
[01:07:59.929 --> 01:08:02.691]  Again, we're falling because we are bought into this system.
[01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:08.343]  And this system is doing everything it can from keeping us from ascending.
[01:08:08.343 --> 01:08:09.063]  Absolutely.
[01:08:09.063 --> 01:08:14.330]  And one of the things that we need to remember is that everything is quantum.
[01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:15.632]  Everything is light.
[01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:16.994]  Everything is vibration.
[01:08:16.994 --> 01:08:18.176]  Everything is consciousness.
[01:08:18.496 --> 01:08:19.016]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:48.716 --> 01:08:59.486]  We can continue to be controlled by the cultural zeitgeist, which is like the Hunger Games, and being controlled by the synthetic manipulation.
[01:09:00.757 --> 01:09:03.460]  Of victim consciousness, and that's exactly what they want.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:03.920]  Explain that.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.601]  Everything they do.
[01:09:04.601 --> 01:09:10.486]  Instead, when I get attacked, I feel more powerful and up to defeat it, but in victim consciousness, you grovel and submit.
[01:09:10.486 --> 01:09:10.806]  Absolutely.
[01:09:10.806 --> 01:09:11.887]  Explain the difference.
[01:09:11.887 --> 01:09:23.618]  And for whatever reason, you, perhaps myself, many of the people listening, we've broken out of what's called the cultural zeitgeist, the synthetic matrix, and we are more
[01:09:24.478 --> 01:09:33.404]  Connect it with our morphogenic field, and connect it with the universal, which is universal law, natural law, and what we're really going to do.
[01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:34.805]  We've broken out of the control paradigm.
[01:09:34.805 --> 01:09:47.294]  Yes, and we are able, if we continue to keep going, to activate, I don't want to get too esoteric here, but to activate the energy systems within our body, which are called chakras.
[01:09:47.894 --> 01:09:53.479]  And to become clearer and more aware and more full of light and more self-powerful.
[01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.201]  We human beings... Well, take the Pentagon.
[01:09:55.201 --> 01:09:56.522]  Separate from what you just said.
[01:09:56.522 --> 01:10:00.886]  The Pentagon in Jade Helm, which we never said was martial law.
[01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:02.608]  It was a training for martial law.
[01:10:02.608 --> 01:10:07.152]  The Pentagon says we must stop independent, self-empowered individuals.
[01:10:07.152 --> 01:10:12.537]  The threat, they said, was independently conscious individuals outside of the control grid.
[01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:13.617]  Of course it is.
[01:10:13.617 --> 01:10:15.678]  They actually admit they're scared of that.
[01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:19.519]  Of course it is, because it's all about power.
[01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:23.020]  And clearly, when we look at... They want us to tune into their controlled grid.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.181]  I'm not blaming the Pentagon, folks.
[01:10:24.181 --> 01:10:25.221]  This is their orders.
[01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:31.263]  They want us to tune into their wavelength, global government, political correctness, and then just give our will over to that.
[01:10:31.263 --> 01:10:36.685]  And clearly, as Alex said, we are not blaming most of the military.
[01:10:36.685 --> 01:10:39.145]  We're not blaming the Pentagon, per se.
[01:10:39.145 --> 01:10:40.986]  But we are blaming... Those in control.
[01:10:41.226 --> 01:10:42.808]  We're good to go!
[01:10:59.847 --> 01:11:00.607]  Accepted.
[01:11:00.607 --> 01:11:02.027]  But we're in the challenge part.
[01:11:02.027 --> 01:11:10.109]  We've got to accept the challenge and realize that most of what we're seeing is a dream or false or it's a it's a zeitgeist that's not true.
[01:11:10.109 --> 01:11:11.489]  It's synthetic in nature.
[01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:12.550]  It's a matrix.
[01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:15.770]  You and I and most of the people, we are trinary.
[01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:18.171]  We've got body, mind, and spirit.
[01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:20.891]  And we're carbon and we're sentient.
[01:11:20.891 --> 01:11:23.152]  We have the DNA to become
[01:11:24.372 --> 01:11:32.036]  Just incredible beings of multi-dimensional consciousness to bring love and consciousness and do the right thing.
[01:11:32.036 --> 01:11:33.257]  It's so cool!
[01:11:33.257 --> 01:11:37.039]  I am such an optimist, but at the same time... Exactly!
[01:11:37.039 --> 01:11:44.002]  All we want to do is build and bring all this goodness into the world, and then once you do that, there's the enemy right there trying to block you.
[01:11:44.002 --> 01:11:50.286]  And they're trying to block all this coming in, and then they're sitting there demonizing and just attacking local government.
[01:11:50.286 --> 01:11:51.706]  Just go kill some cop.
[01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:52.647]  That's how you fix the world.
[01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:55.689]  No, it's how you bring anarchy and death into the world.
[01:11:55.689 --> 01:12:05.537]  And just like in the 1500s, the 1600s, 1700s, England, France, Spain, Portugal, they went out and imperialized the whole world.
[01:12:05.537 --> 01:12:18.547]  They went to Africa, they went to South America, they went to Asia, and the imperialism was spread, and they did everything they could to make the people weaker, like bringing in heroin into China.
[01:12:19.707 --> 01:12:24.669]  The same thing is happening with right now.
[01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:32.291]  And we need to see through this mirage, see through the illusion, and realize that we do not have to be victims.
[01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:33.812]  Let me ask you this question then.
[01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:35.872]  I don't have a desire to have power.
[01:12:35.872 --> 01:12:37.313]  I don't have a desire to tell people what to do.
[01:12:37.313 --> 01:12:37.813]  In fact, I hate it.
[01:12:38.613 --> 01:12:43.777]  But at the same time, then people that want liberty don't want to be in charge, so we sit back and let evil run it.
[01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:58.707]  We have to just go ahead and get in charge to basically destroy their systems, and then turn open, free systems wide open, and then take free, sentient beings that want to be awake into that system, try to shift the paradigm.
[01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:02.730]  But then I don't have the will or desire to even control anything, so how do I ever shift that?
[01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:07.133]  Well, first of all, I'm sure you're aware of the four universal laws.
[01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:13.418]  The Law of Attraction, the Law of Conscious Manifestation, the Law of Allowance, and the Law of Balance and Harmony.
[01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:16.420]  For me, the hardest one is the Law of Allowance.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.362]  Letting other people do their thing.
[01:13:18.362 --> 01:13:23.486]  But, we have to have barriers because being in body, in the spirit... Well, exactly.
[01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:24.627]  I'm allowed to have my freedom.
[01:13:24.907 --> 01:13:25.067]  Right.
[01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.309]  So that doesn't mean you get to run me over.
[01:13:26.309 --> 01:13:38.962]  Yeah, but if somebody comes in and is gonna mess with us and destroy our families, destroy our culture, it is our right, it is our responsibility to stand up and say, no, this is not gonna happen.
[01:13:38.962 --> 01:13:41.425]  So isn't that the problem, is the good people have not taken action?
[01:13:41.745 --> 01:13:43.866]  Absolutely, and even Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:13:43.866 --> 01:13:48.287]  I lived five years in India, and I am a Gandhi.
[01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:52.069]  Gandhi was incredible, but he wasn't totally non-violent.
[01:13:52.069 --> 01:13:56.730]  He would talk about what is called Ahimsa, which most people say is non-violence.
[01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:04.233]  No, what he said, it is better for a man to go to war and kill than be a coward and say that he is non-violent.
[01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:12.900]  It takes courage to stand up for what is right and for what is free and what is natural law.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:16.643]  And that's what we have to do as human beings if we're going to get through this.
[01:14:16.643 --> 01:14:21.967]  Because, folks, we are in the sixth mass extinction period of time.
[01:14:22.287 --> 01:14:22.627]  That's right.
[01:14:22.627 --> 01:14:23.307]  Let's expand on this.
[01:14:23.307 --> 01:14:24.748]  And the elite are trying to gear us up.
[01:14:24.748 --> 01:14:29.289]  They're trying to get us ready consciously for human extinction like it's sexy and cool.
[01:14:29.289 --> 01:14:31.110]  They're already poisoning your food and your water.
[01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:32.330]  They're already coming after you.
[01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:34.551]  They're already destroying every institution.
[01:14:34.551 --> 01:14:36.852]  Not that it's perfect, but they want collapse.
[01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:40.935]  And you have to understand that this is the animating contest of liberty.
[01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:51.203]  This fight is meant to grow your muscles culturally, spiritually, intellectually, to be even stronger, to be able to deal with the incredible developments that humans are about to have.
[01:14:51.203 --> 01:14:56.808]  This is the ascension of humanity that's happening right now, and the globals are trying to suppress it.
[01:14:56.808 --> 01:14:57.688]  Absolutely.
[01:14:57.688 --> 01:15:01.832]  And this deal, this game, whatever you want to call this thing,
[01:15:03.405 --> 01:15:18.111]  You know, I've been doing this for years, and this last year and a half, my eyes have just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, because there's facade after facade after facade, and I know that I don't have all the answers, but I'll tell you what, folks, the game is on.
[01:15:18.111 --> 01:15:20.492]  There's no timeouts right now.
[01:15:20.492 --> 01:15:28.496]  Every single one of you watching and listening to this, it is essential that we come together, first of all, with love in our hearts.
[01:15:28.496 --> 01:15:29.436]  And we're going to break.
[01:15:29.436 --> 01:15:29.816]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:30.877]  Listen, listen, listen, folks.
[01:15:31.949 --> 01:15:36.511]  If you wanted to have some violent revolution, I'm not calling for that because information is the way to go.
[01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:39.352]  If they kiss in the corner, we physically fight and then we'll win, don't worry.
[01:15:39.352 --> 01:15:41.072]  We're ten times stronger.
[01:15:41.072 --> 01:15:50.596]  But, if you want to have a revolution against government, it's not some cop at a gas station pumping gas and shooting in the back so his kids don't see him at night.
[01:15:50.596 --> 01:15:54.317]  If you were going to go after somebody, it'd be George Soros, that's all I'm saying.
[01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:56.858]  You're a loser when you sit there and attack nameless people.
[01:15:57.859 --> 01:16:01.062]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:03.424]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.

[01:16:55.597 --> 01:16:59.759]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[01:16:59.759 --> 01:17:00.980]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.581]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:05.682]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:17:05.682 --> 01:17:06.783]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[01:17:06.783 --> 01:17:07.743]  I've been working all day.
[01:17:07.743 --> 01:17:10.224]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:17:10.224 --> 01:17:11.625]  I get in here at 830.
[01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:13.846]  I was kind of run down, you know.
[01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:15.327]  I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:17:15.467 --> 01:17:17.348]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:19.189]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:20.230]  I popped two of them.
[01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:22.511]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:17:22.511 --> 01:17:24.492]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:17:24.492 --> 01:17:25.973]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:27.314]  People really love it.
[01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:27.914]  Read about it.
[01:17:27.914 --> 01:17:31.736]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:37.019]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:41.242]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:17:41.242 --> 01:17:47.387]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:17:47.387 --> 01:17:53.292]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:17:58.581 --> 01:17:59.402]  Hey, everyone!
[01:17:59.402 --> 01:18:01.703]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:18:01.703 --> 01:18:05.546]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:18:05.546 --> 01:18:07.628]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:18:07.628 --> 01:18:17.896]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:18:17.896 --> 01:18:23.881]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:39.258]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:18:39.258 --> 01:18:39.738]  Thank you.
[01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.101]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:01.603]  You can't survive without it.
[01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:02.784]  But where do you get it?
[01:19:02.784 --> 01:19:08.792]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[01:19:34.424 --> 01:19:35.905]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:36.945]  Easy assembly.
[01:19:36.945 --> 01:19:37.846]  Low maintenance.

[01:20:01.852 --> 01:20:09.915]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.915 --> 01:20:25.241]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:26.642]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.956 --> 01:20:49.400]  You know what, Alex, in the past, I think that you have sold, I know, don't think, you have sold thousands of my other books called Common Sense, Uncommon Sense, 9-11, The Great Illusion, and you know what?
[01:21:04.366 --> 01:21:05.787]  Buy yourself through, Alex.
[01:21:05.787 --> 01:21:07.648]  Come on, we gotta support each other.
[01:21:07.648 --> 01:21:08.529]  No, no, nothing about me.
[01:21:08.529 --> 01:21:09.570]  No, no, no, no.
[01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:11.171]  Speaking of plugs, speaking of plugs.
[01:21:11.171 --> 01:21:24.700]  I'm gonna plug you because I love you and because you're doing this 24-7, 365, and I'll tell you what, this guy is, you know, he gets mad, he yells, sometimes he exaggerates, but I'll tell you what.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:38.774]  He is our guy and we need to support him 100% because what he's saying right now, everybody's got to chill and we've got to get objective and realize that we're being lied to.
[01:21:38.774 --> 01:21:43.059]  Blacks, white, Hispanics, Asians, we've got to stick together.
[01:21:43.059 --> 01:21:44.500]  Plus, I mean, it's all divided.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:44.801]  You're right.
[01:21:44.801 --> 01:21:45.602]  Sometimes I exaggerate.
[01:21:45.602 --> 01:21:46.843]  Most of the time, though, I underestimate.
[01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:47.724]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:47.724 --> 01:21:48.265]  Absolutely.
[01:21:48.265 --> 01:21:49.826]  I mean, all I do is try to tell the truth.
[01:21:49.826 --> 01:21:53.951]  Just like when we did those movies called The Obama Deception and The Fall of the Republic.
[01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:54.612]  Three times worse.
[01:21:54.612 --> 01:21:57.054]  It was much, much worse than what we said.
[01:21:57.054 --> 01:21:57.635]  Much worse.
[01:21:57.635 --> 01:21:59.377]  But we did, like, predict a lot of stuff.
[01:21:59.377 --> 01:22:00.018]  Absolutely.
[01:22:00.018 --> 01:22:00.939]  Those films are free online.
[01:22:00.939 --> 01:22:02.340]  Speaking of plug-ins, as you mentioned,
[01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:06.614]  We're running a food special of all the destabilization that's going on.
[01:22:06.614 --> 01:22:09.195]  The highest quality non-GMO produced right here in the U.S.
[01:22:09.195 --> 01:22:11.396]  with the top folks up in Utah, the Mormons.
[01:22:11.396 --> 01:22:13.236]  They're the best folks to get storable foods from.
[01:22:13.236 --> 01:22:15.857]  My Patriot Supply, we sell their whole spectrum of foods.
[01:22:15.857 --> 01:22:20.979]  We have InfoWare Select, which is their whole group of foods discounted where nobody else can do it.
[01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:22.960]  20 to 40% off.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.500]  X2 is about to sell out.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.921]  That's 20% off.
[01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:28.762]  All the non-GMO heirloom open pollinated seeds, 20% off.
[01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:32.546]  With the Alexa Pure and Pro Pure water filters.
[01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:33.928]  All of it.
[01:22:33.928 --> 01:22:35.911]  Optics, shortwave radios, everything.
[01:22:35.911 --> 01:22:37.313]  That ends tomorrow.
[01:22:37.313 --> 01:22:40.177]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:22:40.177 --> 01:22:43.542]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week, our crew will answer and take your calls.
[01:22:46.246 --> 01:22:47.427]  And that's how we fund ourselves.
[01:22:47.427 --> 01:22:49.428]  Free association, high quality products.
[01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:52.130]  These are the very best nutraceuticals you're going to find anywhere.
[01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:53.711]  The very best non-GMO seeds.
[01:22:53.711 --> 01:22:55.992]  The very best books, films, materials.
[01:22:55.992 --> 01:22:58.954]  Just whatever we think is the very best that we get the lowest prices.
[01:22:58.954 --> 01:22:59.894]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:22:59.894 --> 01:23:01.315]  So thank you for the support.
[01:23:01.315 --> 01:23:03.157]  And look, I've sat there, George.
[01:23:03.157 --> 01:23:06.198]  I've thought a lot about who runs this, who does this.
[01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.899]  Why do these elites want to do this?
[01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:09.981]  The globalists will do things that hurt themselves.
[01:23:11.536 --> 01:23:12.637]  For their larger program.
[01:23:12.637 --> 01:23:13.778]  And I don't know who runs it.
[01:23:13.778 --> 01:23:15.199]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:23.227]  So I go with the Isle of Patmos and John the Revelator and Mark of the Beast and world government and all of that, which says there's this evil outside group coming in to control humanity.
[01:23:23.227 --> 01:23:25.849]  That fits in with what you're saying in your new book.
[01:23:25.849 --> 01:23:31.674]  But all I know is whether it's Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the elites, they believe they're getting information from outside entities.
[01:23:32.435 --> 01:23:34.236]  And all I know is it's giving them power.
[01:23:34.236 --> 01:23:36.458]  But separate from that, maybe it's just mental.
[01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:38.619]  Maybe it's some weird twisted gene.
[01:23:38.619 --> 01:23:43.322]  Regardless, what the globalists are building is a very, very evil system, George.
[01:23:43.322 --> 01:23:44.603]  There's no question about it.
[01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:50.207]  And the fact is that both you and I have been at Bohemia Grove.
[01:23:50.207 --> 01:23:53.769]  We both know that there are satanic rites going on.
[01:23:53.769 --> 01:23:55.991]  We both know that there are ritual killings.
[01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:56.811]  What is satanism?
[01:23:56.811 --> 01:23:57.492]  Let's boil that down.
[01:23:57.492 --> 01:23:59.513]  It just means it's destructive.
[01:23:59.513 --> 01:24:01.374]  That's a big issue right there.
[01:24:01.374 --> 01:24:02.155]  What is satanism?
[01:24:04.757 --> 01:24:09.179]  It's hard to say, but it's service to self.
[01:24:09.179 --> 01:24:10.520]  It's service to self.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:18.585]  And there's a difference, supposedly, between the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd degrees of Freemasonry.
[01:24:18.585 --> 01:24:22.147]  And there's a difference between, supposedly, Lucifer and Satan.
[01:24:22.147 --> 01:24:22.948]  And this is a show
[01:24:23.248 --> 01:24:24.990]  All in and of itself.
[01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:30.496]  But the fact is, is that the one called Satan represents the arconic energy.
[01:24:30.496 --> 01:24:37.845]  He is here to control human beings, to create chaos, and not allow us our free will.
[01:24:37.845 --> 01:24:38.005]  Now,
[01:24:38.465 --> 01:24:46.451]  Everybody has different terms and words for it, but the one called Jesus, Yeshua, and other great teachers.
[01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:52.035]  We have the ability as human beings, right here, right now, to transcend this.
[01:24:52.035 --> 01:24:55.478]  Let me ask you a question then.
[01:24:55.478 --> 01:25:05.866]  If they sit there and they talk about all of this, I mean, obviously free will is the way to go, and if we're looking at this, the elites believe they're following Lucifer, getting power from Lucifer, and I'm one of the phone calls.
[01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:11.762]  All I know is that free will is the way to go.
[01:25:11.762 --> 01:25:13.264]  That's obviously the way to go.
[01:25:13.264 --> 01:25:16.547]  But so much about what this global system is about is about ending free will.
[01:25:16.547 --> 01:25:20.090]  I've got ABC news pieces where they go, everyone will soon get a microchip.
[01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:22.492]  They've gone from denying all this to admitting it.
[01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:24.814]  But meanwhile, the churches are totally dead not talking about it.
[01:25:24.814 --> 01:25:32.160]  You know, the amazing thing is, is that the two vice presidents of Google Corporation, Ray Kurzweil and Regina Dugan,
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.364]  Ray Kurzweil was called the smartest man in America by Bill Gates.
[01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:41.249]  His two best-selling books are Spiritual Machines and Transhumanism Is Now.
[01:25:41.249 --> 01:25:48.678]  He is actively advocating the creation of binary, synthetic, quote, human beings.
[01:25:49.298 --> 01:25:49.858]  What?
[01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:51.539]  That's artificial intelligence.
[01:25:51.539 --> 01:26:07.086]  And then there's Regina Dugan, who is perhaps the most dangerous woman, even more dangerous than Hillary, who was head of DARPA for five years, who is actively advocating taking a pill, a synthetic pill, to become a part of the binary net.
[01:26:07.086 --> 01:26:09.467]  We, as human beings, we're trinary.
[01:26:09.467 --> 01:26:10.868]  We have souls.
[01:26:10.868 --> 01:26:13.269]  We're not machines that are to be turned on and off.
[01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:16.431]  Yes, and we're carbon.
[01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:18.353]  We're not synthetic.
[01:26:18.353 --> 01:26:20.334]  We are here to be free.
[01:26:20.334 --> 01:26:21.716]  That's why there's a global carbon tax.
[01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:22.897]  There's a war on carbon.
[01:26:22.897 --> 01:26:24.938]  Of course there is!
[01:26:24.938 --> 01:26:27.580]  You know, what's the main phone besides the Apple?
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:28.982]  It's the Android.
[01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:35.146]  The android phones, they want slaves, they want good little slaves.
[01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:36.807]  If anybody asks, oh who's Apple?
[01:26:36.807 --> 01:26:37.428]  They're liberal.
[01:26:37.428 --> 01:26:48.656]  They have the worst factories in China with suicide nets, forced abortion, forced drugging, but it's okay because their CEOs have beards and have little different colored socks and go liberal, liberal, liberal.
[01:26:48.656 --> 01:26:51.238]  And they wear blue jeans when they give conferences.
[01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:54.081]  It's all camouflaged!
[01:26:54.081 --> 01:27:03.729]  I was in China not too long ago, next to the new Apple headquarters, and you know, what Alex is saying is right.
[01:27:03.729 --> 01:27:18.243]  Apple was one of the, not the first, but they are one of the five corporate, nine corporations to sell out to the NSA, and to the PRISM computers, and folks, the artificial intelligence, every telephone call, every time...
[01:27:18.923 --> 01:27:27.050]  It's already operating in there, creating artificial... They admit it, they admit it, but I can intellectually see it and spiritually feel it.
[01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:31.894]  We're already dealing not just with the beyond, but now it's got its AI against it.
[01:27:31.894 --> 01:27:33.815]  It's already there.
[01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.137]  And for those of you who don't...
[01:27:35.837 --> 01:27:38.619]  I'm sure 95% of the people realize this.
[01:27:38.619 --> 01:27:42.561]  Hollywood, by and large, is a vehicle of the Illuminati.
[01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:44.042]  They put this information out.
[01:27:44.042 --> 01:27:47.965]  They say they're following free will, but it's not informed consent.
[01:27:47.965 --> 01:27:52.608]  Movies like Ex Machina, an incredible movie, but it's right there.
[01:27:52.608 --> 01:27:57.151]  The new Terminator movie, Genesis, it's all out there, friends.
[01:27:57.151 --> 01:28:02.334]  I mean, without being paranoid, wake up, wake up, wake up, because you know what?
[01:28:02.954 --> 01:28:08.139]  Artificial intelligence is the greatest danger to the human beings on this planet.
[01:28:08.139 --> 01:28:10.462]  All you have to do is go into any coffee shop.
[01:28:10.462 --> 01:28:11.803]  I agree, but let's go beyond this.
[01:28:11.803 --> 01:28:12.564]  Let's finish that point.
[01:28:12.564 --> 01:28:13.024]  Okay.
[01:28:13.024 --> 01:28:14.666]  Let's go beyond this.
[01:28:14.666 --> 01:28:16.467]  There are seven and a half billion of us.
[01:28:16.467 --> 01:28:16.587]  Yep.
[01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:20.162]  The enemy thinks they're gonna win, but the men of humanity is aware of this.
[01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:21.883]  Even though there's only a billion of us left.
[01:28:21.883 --> 01:28:24.044]  When we're aware, game over.
[01:28:24.044 --> 01:28:26.544]  Because then humans are going next level.
[01:28:26.544 --> 01:28:28.585]  We're designed to defeat this.
[01:28:28.585 --> 01:28:30.666]  And this is all just a big test.
[01:28:30.666 --> 01:28:34.427]  I got a feeling that the guy in the sky has this all figured out, George.
[01:28:34.427 --> 01:28:35.708]  In my gut, we're gonna win, my friend.
[01:28:35.888 --> 01:28:39.470]  Yeah, we can do it, but the time to start is right now.
[01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:43.272]  Not next week, not next month, but right now to make a decision.
[01:28:43.272 --> 01:28:44.993]  Do you believe that life is sacred?
[01:28:44.993 --> 01:28:49.076]  And I know that life is sacred because we're part of God's creation.
[01:28:49.076 --> 01:28:49.816]  That's right, stay there.
[01:28:49.816 --> 01:28:50.857]  You have to believe in life.
[01:28:50.857 --> 01:28:56.580]  Whether it's a little lizard in your backyard, or the food you're eating on your table, we must be rational, sentient beings.
[01:28:57.992 --> 01:29:06.158]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:29:06.158 --> 01:29:06.978]  Here's why.
[01:29:06.978 --> 01:29:11.121]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:29:11.121 --> 01:29:12.062]  So please listen.
[01:29:12.062 --> 01:29:15.764]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:29:15.764 --> 01:29:20.207]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[01:29:20.247 --> 01:29:20.427]  I think?
[01:29:39.341 --> 01:29:43.345]  Of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for M4 Wars listeners.
[01:29:43.345 --> 01:29:45.087]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:29:45.087 --> 01:29:46.769]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:29:46.769 --> 01:29:48.511]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:52.375]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:29:52.375 --> 01:29:53.956]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:29:53.956 --> 01:29:55.057]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:29:58.933 --> 01:30:05.398]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:30:05.398 --> 01:30:18.208]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:30:18.388 --> 01:30:22.051]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:30:22.051 --> 01:30:29.036]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:30:29.036 --> 01:30:41.905]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:30:41.905 --> 01:30:43.446]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:30:43.746 --> 01:30:50.134]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:30:50.134 --> 01:30:55.080]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:30:59.173 --> 01:31:05.454]  Last week we pointed out that globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[01:31:05.454 --> 01:31:09.375]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:13.336]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[01:31:13.336 --> 01:31:15.556]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[01:31:15.556 --> 01:31:18.177]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[01:31:18.177 --> 01:31:19.517]  It wants to make us dependent.
[01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:21.077]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[01:31:21.077 --> 01:31:23.778]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[01:31:24.438 --> 01:31:31.285]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our knees, and where we capitulate to their demands.
[01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:39.033]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week, because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[01:31:39.033 --> 01:31:44.679]  You don't just declare your independence when you buy high-quality, storable foods, or water filters, or shortwave radios at m4store.com.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:52.430]  You declare your independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:56.356]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com
[01:31:58.607 --> 01:32:03.669]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:04.968]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:26.125]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.125 --> 01:33:27.607]  I'm taking phone calls right now.
[01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:35.234]  I have this incredibly important Vladimir Putin speech warning of nuclear war that no one is covering in US media coming up in the final segment.
[01:33:35.234 --> 01:33:39.698]  I want to go to Bill and Wild and Todd and Jeremy and Andrew and Anthony and Daniel.
[01:33:39.698 --> 01:33:41.600]  He's come back for at least an hour on Tuesday.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.783]  George Humphrey, my good friend of many years ago, new book out, Life, Love and Joy.
[01:33:46.804 --> 01:33:49.707]  Um, the elites believe they're becoming gods.
[01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:55.651]  Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet, I'm gonna merge the machines, but first humanity must be basically destroyed.
[01:33:55.651 --> 01:34:02.957]  So, I never cover this type of stuff because, you know, I just cover facts and I couldn't be able, you know, to agree the Federal Reserve was private even though it was admitted.
[01:34:02.957 --> 01:34:10.223]  But the elite believe the stuff that George is talking about, but not from his perspective, from an anti-human perspective.
[01:34:11.172 --> 01:34:13.274]  That's why they think we're all bad and gotta get rid of us.
[01:34:13.274 --> 01:34:14.795]  I mean, it's really evil.
[01:34:14.795 --> 01:34:19.939]  So we do, you know, get into the weird cosmology they're involved in.
[01:34:19.939 --> 01:34:23.062]  Regardless, we're seeing aliens here on Earth.
[01:34:23.062 --> 01:34:25.364]  Genetically engineered species are new.
[01:34:25.364 --> 01:34:28.787]  Animals being spliced with other animals, that's new.
[01:34:28.787 --> 01:34:35.212]  We're seeing a war on the Earth, and the people that claim they're trying to save the Earth are the ones prosecuting the war.
[01:34:36.731 --> 01:34:38.132]  It's so amazing.
[01:34:38.132 --> 01:34:46.897]  Al Gordon, these people in Rio, it is unbelievable that they get... You were a famous environmentalist before you got involved in this.
[01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:51.059]  Hey, I am the number one tree hugger and I still am.
[01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:55.481]  You know, you can't get... Is it crazy to see the folks that are killing the earth claiming they support it?
[01:34:56.542 --> 01:34:58.162]  Blows my mind!
[01:34:58.162 --> 01:35:01.323]  They're talking about this... Carbon's the problem, not GMO!
[01:35:01.323 --> 01:35:07.185]  And as they're talking, the chemtrails are right above them, and they're not even pointing that out.
[01:35:07.185 --> 01:35:10.586]  The chemtrails are poisoning us all.
[01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:11.906]  Which even Chuck Norris talks about.
[01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:12.706]  They're declassified.
[01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:14.147]  They're spraying aluminum dioxide on us.
[01:35:14.147 --> 01:35:15.787]  It's killing our brains.
[01:35:15.987 --> 01:35:19.288]  Bore on many other things and it's creating a synthetic reality.
[01:35:19.288 --> 01:35:22.689]  Are you seeing how a lot of the public's like literally brain-dead now?
[01:35:22.689 --> 01:35:27.731]  You know, once a week I'll get people, I'll say, what is that up there?
[01:35:27.731 --> 01:35:33.213]  And 90% of the people will look up and go, oh, I don't know, it's just normal or contrail.
[01:35:33.213 --> 01:35:35.414]  It is self-evident.
[01:35:35.414 --> 01:35:37.655]  It's eyes wide shut.
[01:35:37.655 --> 01:35:38.455]  It's declassified.
[01:35:38.455 --> 01:35:39.636]  Let's take some phone calls.
[01:35:39.636 --> 01:35:41.376]  Let's talk to folks in Kansas.
[01:35:41.376 --> 01:35:43.217]  Bill in Kansas, you're on here with George Humphrey.
[01:35:43.217 --> 01:35:43.477]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.912 --> 01:35:46.894]  Yeah, Alex, this is Bill.
[01:35:46.894 --> 01:35:51.917]  Hey, I have a question and then a quick statement.
[01:35:51.917 --> 01:36:06.809]  The first question is, is that could this, the guy in Dallas, could it possibly be the very first time that a mass shooter in the United States wasn't on some sort of SSR inhibitors, or do you think that the VA probably had him all doped up?
[01:36:06.809 --> 01:36:08.970]  You know, that's why I love taking calls.
[01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:11.032]  I should have been from the very first minute of the show.
[01:36:11.032 --> 01:36:12.653]  The listeners always bring the points.
[01:36:12.653 --> 01:36:14.134]  I've never seen a mass shooter
[01:36:15.063 --> 01:36:19.845]  Well, it was Kip Kinkle or Harrison Kleibel that wasn't on those drugs as they put you in a dream state.
[01:36:19.845 --> 01:36:24.226]  They've got so many people that were, you know, disarmingly discharged like this guy on it.
[01:36:24.226 --> 01:36:25.346]  Most of them are.
[01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.267]  I bet money.
[01:36:27.267 --> 01:36:28.747]  He's wound up by the media.
[01:36:28.747 --> 01:36:30.208]  He's mind controlled.
[01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:31.488]  He's in a dream state.
[01:36:31.488 --> 01:36:32.609]  I bet you.
[01:36:32.609 --> 01:36:33.469]  Where is that news?
[01:36:33.469 --> 01:36:34.749]  They're always on it.
[01:36:34.749 --> 01:36:36.070]  That's a great question, George.
[01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:38.231]  He's a Manchurian candidate.
[01:36:38.231 --> 01:36:39.772]  I mean, it's just pure and simple.
[01:36:39.772 --> 01:36:45.975]  Human beings don't do that to other human beings unless their neurological systems are overridden.
[01:36:45.975 --> 01:36:51.678]  Look, some cop kills one of my kids or somebody wrongfully and they don't get in trouble, then there might be an issue.
[01:36:51.678 --> 01:36:56.301]  What is this new thing where a cop did something in Minnesota, let's kill cops in Dallas?
[01:36:56.301 --> 01:37:00.243]  It doesn't work that way unless there is outside interference.
[01:37:00.243 --> 01:37:01.544]  And we just got to be aware of that.
[01:37:01.824 --> 01:37:03.745]  All of this is pre-conceived.
[01:37:03.745 --> 01:37:04.525]  It's so stupid.
[01:37:04.525 --> 01:37:05.065]  It's so stupid.
[01:37:05.065 --> 01:37:07.426]  It'd be like if you're a black guy and some Klan guy attacks you.
[01:37:07.426 --> 01:37:08.926]  You don't go attack some random white guy.
[01:37:08.926 --> 01:37:10.007]  You go find the Klan guy.
[01:37:10.007 --> 01:37:10.927]  Yeah.
[01:37:10.927 --> 01:37:13.368]  And the thing about it is we need to see through this.
[01:37:13.368 --> 01:37:14.628]  We need to be objective.
[01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:17.889]  We need to make sure... When the mainstream media is pushing it, that's the enemy.
[01:37:17.889 --> 01:37:18.549]  We know it's bull.
[01:37:18.549 --> 01:37:18.869]  Of course.
[01:37:18.869 --> 01:37:22.350]  I mean, the media's like, of course it's the white people's fault.
[01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:24.091]  What was your comment, Bill?
[01:37:25.652 --> 01:37:48.270]  All these people on both sides of the issue, the left and the right, they're being bombarded with all this bull, and they don't realize that in the middle of the heat of conflict, if they stood back and looked, that they all have common issues with the current legal and political system, and the conflicts are based on our
[01:37:49.343 --> 01:37:50.463]  Everybody's on the same page.
[01:37:50.463 --> 01:37:50.904]  Great point.
[01:38:15.327 --> 01:38:18.369]  That is attempting to manipulate and brainwash us.
[01:38:18.369 --> 01:38:19.250]  No, that's right, good point.
[01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:22.512]  Let me give us more calls, but I just want to say this.
[01:38:22.512 --> 01:38:24.534]  I want everybody to get ahead.
[01:38:24.534 --> 01:38:35.722]  Absolutely, and it's just fundamentally crazy that I would think if blacks, most people are just intermarried anyway, it's not even happening, a black person has a bad life, I get ahead, that's a load of horse crap.
[01:38:35.722 --> 01:38:37.603]  That's not how it works, George, in economics.
[01:38:37.603 --> 01:38:40.425]  Everybody knows an area where everybody's doing better, everybody does better.
[01:38:40.425 --> 01:38:40.966]  That's right.
[01:38:44.230 --> 01:38:45.550]  Unite it, we stand.
[01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:46.831]  Divide it, we fall.
[01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:47.731]  Unite it, we stand.
[01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:48.231]  Divide it, we fall.
[01:38:48.231 --> 01:38:49.431]  And they want to get us into this crisis.
[01:38:49.431 --> 01:38:51.392]  When I say united, I mean all Americans.
[01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:52.532]  United around the truth, though.
[01:38:52.532 --> 01:38:53.913]  We can't unite around the globalists.
[01:38:53.913 --> 01:38:55.073]  Around the Constitution.
[01:38:55.073 --> 01:38:57.454]  Because they stage these events to say unite around them.
[01:38:57.454 --> 01:39:00.674]  About truth and about love and about right action.
[01:39:00.674 --> 01:39:01.435]  That's right.
[01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:02.275]  Okay, great points.
[01:39:02.275 --> 01:39:03.275]  Thank you, Bill.
[01:39:03.275 --> 01:39:04.776]  Wild in Wisconsin.
[01:39:04.776 --> 01:39:05.816]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:39:05.816 --> 01:39:06.076]  Go ahead.
[01:39:08.906 --> 01:39:11.988]  Hi, two queries, one for Alex, one for George.
[01:39:11.988 --> 01:39:12.788]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:39:12.788 --> 01:39:18.651]  George, I know what I've seen, but what have you seen as rabbit hole bedrock?
[01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:19.751]  Excuse me, I didn't hear that, sir.
[01:39:19.751 --> 01:39:22.873]  What have you seen as radical bedrock, is that what you said?
[01:39:22.873 --> 01:39:24.854]  Rabbit hole bedrock.
[01:39:26.118 --> 01:39:28.160]  Give me a little bit more information.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.622]  What is your radical bedrock?
[01:39:29.622 --> 01:39:31.003]  He says he knows what you've seen.
[01:39:31.003 --> 01:39:32.885]  No, no, no.
[01:39:32.885 --> 01:39:35.048]  Like the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:39:35.048 --> 01:39:35.628]  Rabbit hole.
[01:39:35.628 --> 01:39:36.209]  That's what I just said.
[01:39:36.209 --> 01:39:37.010]  What is the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:38.932]  Oh man, it goes way, way, way, way deep.
[01:39:38.932 --> 01:39:43.316]  All we know is it's anti-human and it's old and it ain't nice.
[01:39:43.316 --> 01:39:45.118]  And we just need to keep going deeper.
[01:39:45.118 --> 01:39:45.619]  It's the devil.
[01:39:45.919 --> 01:39:57.284]  You know, if you pick a flower off the plant, off the weed, the root will still, we have to pull it out by the roots, and we need to find out who is behind the Illuminati.
[01:39:57.284 --> 01:39:59.305]  That's what, that's what it's about.
[01:39:59.305 --> 01:40:01.646]  And who is behind it in any of this world?
[01:40:01.646 --> 01:40:04.147]  It's not, God of this world, aim of this world.
[01:40:04.147 --> 01:40:05.708]  It is, other than,
[01:40:07.114 --> 01:40:27.055]  sentient human beings sentient terrestrial human beings and we all say this the elite believe they're getting off off world knowledge absolutely they believe that and and and and thought and conscious manifestation whether it is actually true or not actually true and so you're saying we have to get from Christ divine
[01:40:27.555 --> 01:40:28.896]  Technology to beat them.
[01:40:28.896 --> 01:40:45.866]  Christ is the universal energy, and we have to be who we are, but we also have to understand that there is an energy on this planet called the Archons, it's called the Black Goo, whatever you want to call it, that one... Well, you talked about it earlier, like the Muslims do counterclockwise around that meteorite.
[01:40:45.866 --> 01:40:46.726]  It's satanic.
[01:40:46.726 --> 01:40:48.007]  I mean... Well, it, you know...
[01:40:49.568 --> 01:41:03.437]  I have many friends who are Islamic who are great people, but the fact is every day they walk counterclockwise around a black cube that some people call the cube of Saturn or Satanic.
[01:41:03.437 --> 01:41:14.044]  And it is black goo, it is exactly what the Nag Hammadi talked about with the Essenes and the Nazarenes, and Jesus was a Nazarene, folks.
[01:41:14.364 --> 01:41:17.385]  This is insanity.
[01:41:17.385 --> 01:41:20.546]  And I'm not just going after Islamic people.
[01:41:20.546 --> 01:41:23.467]  All of the Occidental religions have their problems.
[01:41:23.467 --> 01:41:25.248]  One is they're worshipped with a black meteorite.
[01:41:25.248 --> 01:41:26.028]  Yep.
[01:41:26.028 --> 01:41:29.109]  I mean, we're going counterclockwise, we've got a problem here.
[01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:31.830]  Hey, ask yourself where... We're going the opposite direction of the planet.
[01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:35.291]  Ask yourself, where did the company Google get its name from?
[01:41:36.582 --> 01:41:37.363]  Goo.
[01:41:37.363 --> 01:41:38.944]  Black goo.
[01:41:38.944 --> 01:41:40.425]  Look at the last Hunger Games.
[01:41:40.425 --> 01:41:44.327]  The black goo for 50 years in every one of the horror movies.
[01:41:44.327 --> 01:41:46.889]  There is this black goo that is there.
[01:41:46.889 --> 01:41:48.750]  This stuff's been around.
[01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:52.112]  We've known about this for 4,000 years.
[01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:55.874]  There is a reason there is so much insanity on this planet.
[01:41:55.874 --> 01:41:57.535]  But it is up to us to heal it.
[01:41:57.535 --> 01:41:59.457]  And the poor Muslims are like sitting all around it.
[01:42:00.501 --> 01:42:02.763]  Oh my God, we've gone to the next level here today.
[01:42:02.763 --> 01:42:03.803]  I apologize to the callers.
[01:42:03.803 --> 01:42:04.524]  Thank you, Wild.
[01:42:04.524 --> 01:42:06.886]  I don't think we have time to go to any more calls.
[01:42:06.886 --> 01:42:07.926]  I've got to play this Putin clip.
[01:42:07.926 --> 01:42:08.727]  We're going to break here.
[01:42:08.727 --> 01:42:13.030]  We're going to break here in just a few minutes.
[01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:22.597]  Look, all I know is I believe in Christ, and I'm exposing evil, and the Black Lives Matter is run by Obama and the globalists to create civil war in this country, and they're like,
[01:42:23.217 --> 01:42:26.080]  A cop got shot in Georgia, or a cop got shot in Tennessee.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.262]  Well, the cops need to reform themselves.
[01:42:28.262 --> 01:42:30.645]  That's why the cop got shot in the back of the head.
[01:42:30.645 --> 01:42:32.386]  It's like, what?
[01:42:32.386 --> 01:42:37.291]  That is the most, it's like if like, there was some black racist, let's just go kill some random black person.
[01:42:37.291 --> 01:42:37.852]  What is that?
[01:42:37.852 --> 01:42:38.512]  No, that's evil.
[01:42:39.502 --> 01:42:40.523]  That's evil.
[01:42:40.523 --> 01:42:41.443]  And I stand against that.
[01:42:41.443 --> 01:42:48.689]  We're going to come back with this incredibly important Vladimir Putin piece, and I'll have some final words at the end of it, dealing with World War III.
[01:42:48.689 --> 01:42:49.789]  I'm not saying Putin's perfect.
[01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:53.592]  I'm just saying, if Putin's talking about World War III, we should be discussing it.
[01:42:53.592 --> 01:42:54.313]  It should be known.
[01:42:54.313 --> 01:42:55.754]  So I'm going to air this right here.
[01:42:55.754 --> 01:42:57.014]  George Humphrey, we'll see you Tuesday.
[01:42:57.014 --> 01:42:57.635]  Thank you.
[01:43:00.817 --> 01:43:03.879]  Socialists are preparing for the Trumpocalypse.
[01:43:03.879 --> 01:43:06.280]  How desperate could they be to stop Trump?
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:16.006]  Well, the Democratic National Convention has been caught paying for leftist protesters to harass supporters attending the Republican National Convention.
[01:43:16.366 --> 01:43:27.353]  Meanwhile, hacker Guccifer has released a 22-page document about the DNC spending $800,000 to sabotage the RNC.
[01:43:27.353 --> 01:43:33.037]  DNC operatives plan to stage a Trumpocalypse with shenanigans and tricks.
[01:43:33.317 --> 01:43:37.279]  In addition, Black Lives Matter has planned mass protests.
[01:43:37.279 --> 01:43:42.861]  Their leader is promising to release protesters en masse to sabotage the RNC.
[01:43:42.861 --> 01:43:50.423]  So-called liberals are once again hell-bent on quelling free speech and thereby undermining our First Amendment.
[01:43:50.423 --> 01:43:51.924]  This is Ashley Beckford.
[01:43:51.924 --> 01:43:56.786]  Check out the full story as well as other special reports at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:57.626 --> 01:43:58.146]  Not a group.
[01:43:58.146 --> 01:43:59.587]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:43:59.587 --> 01:44:00.907]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:44:00.907 --> 01:44:02.107]  Why is this so good?
[01:44:02.107 --> 01:44:07.408]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:20.952]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:44:20.952 --> 01:44:22.292]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:44:23.092 --> 01:44:24.733]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:44:24.733 --> 01:44:27.233]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:44:27.233 --> 01:44:28.594]  These are all parasites.
[01:44:28.594 --> 01:44:29.714]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:44:29.714 --> 01:44:31.055]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:44:31.055 --> 01:44:35.556]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:44:35.556 --> 01:44:38.697]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:44:38.797 --> 01:44:41.880]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:42.941]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:44:42.941 --> 01:44:44.863]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:44:44.863 --> 01:44:45.884]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:44:45.884 --> 01:44:48.586]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:44:48.586 --> 01:44:51.870]  And you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:54.112]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:44:54.112 --> 01:44:56.074]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:44:58.444 --> 01:44:59.264]  Hey, everyone!
[01:44:59.264 --> 01:45:05.386]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:45:05.386 --> 01:45:07.467]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:17.751]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:23.733]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:39.070]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.550]  I think so.
[01:45:58.334 --> 01:46:04.258]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.
[01:46:04.258 --> 01:46:04.998]  It works.
[01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:09.281]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com today and read the testimonials for yourself.
[01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:14.744]  There are thousands of them with an average voting score at an unprecedented 4.8.
[01:46:16.545 --> 01:46:28.502]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[01:46:28.502 --> 01:46:33.549]  Super Mel Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[01:46:33.689 --> 01:46:33.909]  We're good.
[01:47:02.394 --> 01:47:05.007]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:38.363]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:38.363 --> 01:47:47.231]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:47.231 --> 01:47:53.437]  I cannot help asking those who have caused this situation, do you realize now what you've done?
[01:48:10.143 --> 01:48:15.807]  Speaking nearly a month ago, President Vladimir Putin at the International Economic Forum in St.
[01:48:15.807 --> 01:48:31.219]  Petersburg, Russia, warned the group of international journalists there, repeatedly, that Europe, the United States, and Russia were drifting towards full-scale war.
[01:48:31.219 --> 01:48:33.761]  We know year by year what's going to happen, and they know we know.
[01:48:36.032 --> 01:48:42.275]  It's only you that they tell these fables and you buy it and spread it to the citizens of your countries.
[01:48:42.275 --> 01:48:45.636]  Your people do not feel a sense of the impending danger.
[01:48:45.636 --> 01:48:47.417]  This is what worries me.
[01:48:47.417 --> 01:48:51.699]  How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction?
[01:48:51.699 --> 01:48:52.959]  That is the problem.
[01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:55.120]  But they pretend like nothing's going on.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.921]  I don't even know how to get through to you people anymore.
[01:48:57.921 --> 01:49:05.084]  And the big news is, a month later, almost a month later, after we first reported on it,
[01:49:05.868 --> 01:49:14.652]  In mid-June, there has been almost no Western coverage of it at all.
[01:49:14.652 --> 01:49:18.093]  And that's exactly what Putin was getting at.
[01:49:18.093 --> 01:49:33.960]  Whether you love Putin or hate Putin, if the leader of Russia, with thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, is telling the West, I don't know how to get through to you, your media is controlled, you're being manipulated,
[01:49:34.847 --> 01:49:37.168]  NATO is putting missiles on our borders.
[01:49:37.168 --> 01:49:39.288]  We're having to move missiles in.
[01:49:39.288 --> 01:49:41.529]  You've overthrown Ukraine.
[01:49:41.529 --> 01:49:43.549]  You're on an offensive.
[01:49:43.549 --> 01:49:46.670]  You're funding and protecting radical Islam.
[01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:48.251]  Do you know what you've done?
[01:49:48.251 --> 01:49:53.592]  Do you know what you've done, as he said at the UN, destabilizing the Middle East?
[01:49:53.592 --> 01:49:55.673]  Why are you doing this?
[01:49:55.673 --> 01:49:59.634]  Where are the sound minds, across the political spectrum,
[01:50:01.115 --> 01:50:03.417]  Who should be stopping this?
[01:50:03.417 --> 01:50:08.080]  Russia has three overseas military bases.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.281]  You have hundreds.
[01:50:10.281 --> 01:50:13.503]  You have your spies inside our country trying to overthrow it.
[01:50:13.503 --> 01:50:16.165]  You have your CIA people trying to get into our embassies.
[01:50:16.165 --> 01:50:18.346]  You are at war with us!
[01:50:18.346 --> 01:50:24.871]  And the average American, the average European, the average Brit is not aware of this.
[01:50:24.871 --> 01:50:27.893]  Another threat that President Obama mentioned was ISIS.
[01:50:31.989 --> 01:50:34.390]  Well, who on earth armed them?
[01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:40.874]  Who helped to arm the Syrians that were fighting against Assad?
[01:50:40.874 --> 01:50:45.937]  Who created the necessary political climate that facilitated the situation?
[01:50:45.937 --> 01:50:48.619]  Who pushed for the delivery of arms to the area?
[01:50:48.619 --> 01:50:53.402]  Do you really not understand as to who is fighting in Syria?
[01:50:53.402 --> 01:50:58.385]  But the issue of a major world leader saying that we're moving to the brink of war
[01:51:00.336 --> 01:51:02.137]  And it's not in our news.
[01:51:02.137 --> 01:51:03.938]  That's the big story.
[01:51:03.938 --> 01:51:07.339]  It shows how incredibly controlled things are.
[01:51:07.339 --> 01:51:10.740]  Deutsche Bank, one of the biggest banks in the world, is plunging right now.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.701]  Much bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[01:51:12.701 --> 01:51:13.901]  If it continues, it'll make 2008
[01:51:15.598 --> 01:51:17.159]  Look, tame in comparison.
[01:51:17.159 --> 01:51:22.863]  Elites are building armored fortresses and redoubts all over the world, admitting they believe collapse is coming.
[01:51:22.863 --> 01:51:24.284]  Governments are digging in.
[01:51:24.284 --> 01:51:26.486]  Russia is digging in.
[01:51:26.486 --> 01:51:33.991]  Our supposed government is collapsing our borders and bringing people in with diseases and ignoring the Supreme Court rulings.
[01:51:33.991 --> 01:51:36.693]  It seems an age of madness.
[01:51:38.723 --> 01:51:42.145]  Or megalomania is now upon us.
[01:51:42.145 --> 01:51:44.407]  We've seen great evil out of Russia.
[01:51:44.407 --> 01:51:45.948]  We've seen great evil out of Germany.
[01:51:45.948 --> 01:51:50.271]  We've seen incredible evil out of Communist China.
[01:51:50.271 --> 01:52:07.163]  But America has had its problems as well and now we see Europe and the United States and the whole Anglo-American establishment filled with hubris and arrogance just violating domestic laws, persecuting the press, leaking classified material and getting away with it.
[01:52:08.504 --> 01:52:14.928]  This is the stuff that collapses and major wars and calamities are made of.
[01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:21.552]  And most historians point out the parallels between the start of World War I and what we now see happening today.
[01:52:21.552 --> 01:52:27.235]  And the parallels with the start of World War II and the climate politically we see today.
[01:52:27.235 --> 01:52:33.118]  Even the Pentagon admits that we're probably witnessing one of the most unstable periods in human history right now.
[01:52:33.118 --> 01:52:37.541]  But Obama says we've got the best economy ever and the world's the most stable it's ever been.
[01:52:39.381 --> 01:52:41.982]  As they do everything they can to push us into crisis.
[01:52:41.982 --> 01:52:43.383]  And it's not just the Democrats.
[01:52:43.383 --> 01:52:48.004]  They have their establishment Republican cohorts that are working with them.
[01:52:48.004 --> 01:52:52.126]  I have never been more concerned about what's happening on the planet today.
[01:52:52.126 --> 01:53:06.972]  And if we're able to raise the alarm, you the freedom lovers out there, the people that want to have a civilization, the people that don't want to have war, if we're able to come together, whether we be black, white, old, young, conservative, libertarian, Catholic, Muslim, whatever it is,
[01:53:08.146 --> 01:53:09.948]  We cannot continue to have these conflicts.
[01:53:09.948 --> 01:53:18.655]  We cannot continue to have this globalist crisis brand where they stir up the problems, exacerbate the crises, and then gain power out of it.
[01:53:18.655 --> 01:53:24.380]  Because all the money in the world is going to be worthless if we have a major nuclear war.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:28.223]  And that's what the Russian foreign minister and many others say we're going towards.
[01:53:28.223 --> 01:53:30.806]  And Putin is now begging with the press
[01:53:33.038 --> 01:53:40.741]  To trigger some type of debate and saying I can't believe how none of this gets through to the people of the West.
[01:53:40.741 --> 01:53:54.346]  Please spread this video far and wide and hopefully it will spur a debate that can cause some type of chain reaction that reverses our course or at least changes our course from assured Armageddon.
[01:53:54.346 --> 01:54:01.549]  20 years ago I would interview people like Nigel Farage, the head of UKIP, when they had a couple members of the British Parliament and a couple members of the EU Parliament.
[01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:04.090]  Now it's the fastest growing party in Europe.
[01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:07.130]  They just had the British exit the Brexit successfully.
[01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:09.931]  Nationalism and anti-globalism is rising.
[01:54:09.931 --> 01:54:13.512]  I have seen the power of the people when we take action.
[01:54:13.512 --> 01:54:15.253]  And sure, our elites are decadent.
[01:54:15.253 --> 01:54:16.193]  Sure, they're inbred.
[01:54:16.193 --> 01:54:20.014]  Sure, they're very, very narcissistic and disconnected.
[01:54:20.014 --> 01:54:24.035]  But they will pay attention when we the people force the issue.
[01:54:24.035 --> 01:54:25.756]  And we are forcing the issue on this,
[01:54:26.835 --> 01:54:32.124]  As well as many other issues going on here in the United States and around the world.
[01:54:32.124 --> 01:54:34.869]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[01:54:34.869 --> 01:54:39.416]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the hope.
[01:54:39.416 --> 01:54:40.258]  You are the resistance.
[01:54:42.114 --> 01:54:43.114]  All right, we're almost out of time.
[01:54:43.114 --> 01:54:45.596]  We've got a three-minute slip before the Sunday broadcast ends.
[01:54:45.596 --> 01:54:47.336]  I'll be back again, God willing.
[01:54:47.336 --> 01:54:48.657]  I don't take anything for granted.
[01:54:48.657 --> 01:54:50.438]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:54:50.438 --> 01:54:50.978]  to 3 p.m.
[01:54:50.978 --> 01:54:58.481]  for four hours, centralinfowars.com, forward slash show for people that don't have local affiliates or some affiliates don't carry the weekday show.
[01:54:58.481 --> 01:55:05.204]  But regardless, spread the word about the transmission because you see the censorship, you see the attempts to bring in control.
[01:55:05.204 --> 01:55:09.566]  It's because the globalists can't deal with real renaissance, real liberalism.
[01:55:10.526 --> 01:55:11.627]  That's private property.
[01:55:11.627 --> 01:55:12.468]  Keep more of your money.
[01:55:12.468 --> 01:55:13.929]  Have more guns.
[01:55:13.929 --> 01:55:15.190]  Have more free association.
[01:55:15.190 --> 01:55:16.972]  Liberal means more, not less.
[01:55:16.972 --> 01:55:18.353]  Not controlling the language.
[01:55:18.353 --> 01:55:19.995]  I want to say bye to my friend George Humphrey.
[01:55:19.995 --> 01:55:21.316]  He'll be back with us this Tuesday.
[01:55:21.316 --> 01:55:24.819]  But finally, we're self-funded.
[01:55:24.819 --> 01:55:26.561]  And it's because of you we've been able to do all this.
[01:55:26.561 --> 01:55:29.403]  You see our reporters all over the world, all over the country.
[01:55:29.403 --> 01:55:35.189]  Just cutting edge, breaking major news, derailing new world order operations.
[01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.769]  We're running.
[01:55:36.690 --> 01:55:52.273]  Huge specials, not just the 10% off for anybody that signs up for auto-ship for vitamins or minerals or other supplements, not just free shipping on orders for $50 or more, but 40% off on storable foods ends tomorrow and in full wars.
[01:55:53.294 --> 01:55:54.795]  Store.com.
[01:55:54.795 --> 01:55:56.036]  Super high quality storable foods.
[01:55:56.036 --> 01:55:56.716]  Highest quality.
[01:55:56.716 --> 01:56:00.379]  20% off all shortwave and crank radios.
[01:56:00.379 --> 01:56:03.381]  20% off all extra pure and pro-pure water filtration systems.
[01:56:03.381 --> 01:56:05.602]  All the great non-GMO seeds.
[01:56:05.602 --> 01:56:12.366]  And 20% off X2's super high quality halogen, the good halogen, the good iodine, and a bunch of other nutraceuticals.
[01:56:12.366 --> 01:56:15.428]  And 10% off all nutraceuticals.
[01:56:15.428 --> 01:56:16.469]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:17.490]  That ends tomorrow.
[01:56:19.392 --> 01:56:20.533]  So take advantage of that.
[01:56:20.533 --> 01:56:28.820]  And the profit we do make goes to send myself and like seven or eight other reporters to the DNC, the RNC, starting not this week but next week, and everything else.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.962]  So thank you so much for your support.
[01:56:30.962 --> 01:56:31.863]  You've got this commitment.
[01:56:31.863 --> 01:56:33.544]  We will not cower in the face of the globals.
[01:56:33.544 --> 01:56:34.705]  We will take action.
[01:56:34.705 --> 01:56:39.249]  And we fund ourselves selling products everybody needs that are game changers for ourselves and others.
[01:56:39.249 --> 01:56:40.850]  Because we're all about win-win.
[01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:44.113]  I don't promote something unless I truly have used it and know it's great.
[01:56:45.154 --> 01:56:46.516]  It's all about energy.
[01:56:46.516 --> 01:56:50.020]  It's all about, I wouldn't do something to you, I wouldn't want it to happen to me.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:52.342]  And that's why we have Providence, that's why we're so blessed.
[01:56:52.342 --> 01:56:54.685]  So I want to support you all and thank you all for your support.
[01:56:54.685 --> 01:56:56.267]  We got about 60 seconds left.
[01:56:56.267 --> 01:56:59.050]  George Humphrey will be back in studio with us this Tuesday.
[01:56:59.050 --> 01:56:59.350]  20 seconds.
[01:57:00.051 --> 01:57:03.013]  Alex, I'm always so honored to be here, and you know why?
[01:57:03.013 --> 01:57:15.399]  Because I have fun while I'm here, because talking about the truth, talking about human potential, talking about justice, and having somebody who has a spine and the courage to say it, I love you, buddy.
[01:57:15.399 --> 01:57:16.400]  Well, I love you, too, man.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.502]  I loved, like, 25 years ago, the Pat Buchanan campaign, putting signs up around town.
[01:57:20.502 --> 01:57:22.723]  I remember that like it was yesterday.
[01:57:22.723 --> 01:57:23.704]  I'll see you on Tuesday.
[01:57:24.304 --> 01:57:25.225]  You bet, my friend.
[01:57:25.225 --> 01:57:29.811]  Now the book, Life, Love & Joy by George Humphrey, it's available at Amazon.com.
[01:57:29.811 --> 01:57:30.412]  Where else?
[01:57:30.412 --> 01:57:34.797]  Amazon.com, Kindle, and maybe at another... Oh, there'll be no maybe.
[01:57:34.797 --> 01:57:35.698]  Just come and talk to Weldon.
[01:57:35.698 --> 01:57:36.660]  We're going to buy it.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.320]  I've been selling them.
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.081]  Okay, we got it.
[01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:39.523]  I love the fact you're selling them at cost anyway.
[01:57:39.523 --> 01:57:40.164]  Just get the word out.
[01:57:40.164 --> 01:57:41.346]  It's a powerful book.
[01:57:41.346 --> 01:57:42.247]  I've just started reading it.
[01:57:42.247 --> 01:57:44.309]  You want to find out who's behind the Illuminati, get the book.
[01:57:44.309 --> 01:57:45.230]  George Humphrey.
[01:57:45.230 --> 01:57:46.091]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:57:46.091 --> 01:57:46.933]  Great job to the crew.
[01:57:46.933 --> 01:57:47.453]  See you back.
[01:57:47.453 --> 01:57:48.014]  Lord willing, tomorrow.
