[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.
[00:15.000 --> 00:28.000]  Another world, another time, his life was green and rude, until the twisted fact.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:33.000 --> 00:43.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Well, I've been here for quite a while this morning, getting geared up for this broadcast.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  I just came skidding back into my Jessica chair.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  This is actually my office, the studio, as well as where we broadcast from on radio slash television.
[00:56.000 --> 01:08.000]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this Monday, already the third day, hard to believe of April 2017, already into month number four.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  We have the Democrats announcing they plan to have a filler buster of the Republican nominee.
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.000]  And of course, we have the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, saying he will invoke the nuclear option, meaning 51 votes can confirm him.
[01:23.000 --> 01:35.000]  That is a big deal, but that's why the Democrats are now floating around the idea that because the Russians got everybody elected, including most of the people that got elected to the House Senate, gubernatorial seats.
[01:35.000 --> 01:44.000]  It's been floating the New York Times, the Washington Post, Atlantic Monthly, that all of them have to be removed in a civil emergency under COG.
[01:44.000 --> 02:00.000]  The Democrats in an emergency six month operation will reorganize everything in America and then allow new elections that Homeland Security oversees.
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  I can't believe that's now out of the open. They're trying to push that. It shows you how crazed they are, how out of control they are.
[02:08.000 --> 02:18.000]  Those are the headlines that are in front of me today. Gibraltar, British Prime Minister prepared for war to defend Gibraltar. That's right.
[02:18.000 --> 02:28.000]  The unelected head of the EU, Junker, heir of the total Nazi fortune, he's the number one guy, the king of Luxembourg, his family stole Luxembourg in World War II.
[02:28.000 --> 02:40.000]  They've threatened to break up the US in economic action against Britain and they've also claimed that they will march EU armies into other countries on the continent to try to leave.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  And I said they're one of the biggest threats to world peace is the out of control dictatorial EU that's the new Soviet Union.
[02:46.000 --> 02:59.000]  The true existential threat, well now, they're threatening to basically cut off Gibraltar to punish England because that is on the tip of Spain and England's had it for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[02:59.000 --> 03:09.000]  And like the United States has Guantanamo Bay and Cuba. So things are, things are degenerating quickly just like we saw back in the 1980s with the Falkland War.
[03:09.000 --> 03:22.000]  So that's big news. That's what's coming up. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg Metro explosion 11 dead in Russia blast right as Vladimir Putin arrives in his hometown.
[03:22.000 --> 03:37.000]  And of course, ISIS has taken responsibility as they always do. And we of course saw the last year the Saudis warn Russia that if they kicked their forces out of Syria, they would start bombing Russia.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  And so there the proxy army run by them by Saudi Arabia has now struck.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  Very, very sad. And of course, we have a lot of news on that front.
[03:49.000 --> 04:01.000]  Because this is what Ergun has also called for. He's working with Saudi Arabia, the dictator who held fake elections and then survived a coup that he may have done himself to establish more territorial power.
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  Ergun has threatened more action calling for Muslims in Europe to stand up and uprise in holy war and begin mass murder.
[04:10.000 --> 04:20.000]  So unprecedented where foreign groups are brought in to work with the EU, bringing the country down or bringing the nation states down into the EU super state.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  And then they even hold the EU itself hostage.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  But it's okay. He's calling for violence in Jihad because we're, quote, fighting the grandchildren of Nazism, which in a way is true.
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  But Yonker wants the borders open and is working with Ergun. So the truth is, just like the Islamists have worked with the Nazis before, the same thing is happening yet again.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  It's like they did in World War Two. That's just two of the small areas we're getting into.
[04:44.000 --> 04:56.000]  Rand Paul is very optimistic about repealing Obamacare after golfing with Trump. Dr. Phil exposes global pedophile elite. It's a show canceled in one major country and more.
[04:56.000 --> 05:17.000]  It's all coming up. Tell your friends and family tune in now.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  Seven hundred people have been shot in Chicago. A hundred and thirty of them have been shot and killed, including 48 children killed in February alone.
[05:34.000 --> 05:43.000]  It's gotten so bad in some areas. Chicago activist Tio Hardiman said young people in South and West Chicago need to be equipped with helmets and bulletproof vests.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  But don't tell that to the mayor of non-citizens Roma manual. He's busy trying to take care of people from other countries.
[05:50.000 --> 06:00.000]  Chicago, you don't have a mayor. I suggest you try electing one in 2019. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:20.000 --> 06:31.000]  You can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.

[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  That's right, all across the world, nation-states and peoples are pulling out of globalism.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  It is in full retreat and collapse.
[08:33.000 --> 08:43.000]  And now, the head of the unelected EU, the heir to the great Nazi fortune of the Yonkers, the king of Luxembourg.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  They have another title for it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  His family did seize it in World War II, I guess with paratroopers.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  Richest country in the world per capita, he has declared war on any nation state that tries to get out of the EU.
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  He's declared economic war on England, and he's sworn to break the United States up last week.
[08:59.000 --> 09:06.000]  Now he's threatening to cut off the Rock of Gibraltar held by the British for hundreds of years on the tip of Spain,
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  hanging out in the Mediterranean, a key chokehold point to enter the Mediterranean.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  It was fought over quite a bit in World War II.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  They have films made like the Guns of Navarone about that whole area, and Guns of Navarone was fictional.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  The Guns of Navarone were real, and that's the type of issue we're talking about.
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.000]  Now the British Prime Minister is prepared for war to defend Gibraltar against the EU and Yonkers.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  So the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  We're being teleported back in time yet again with a crazy out of control Nazi royal threatening everybody.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  Can't make that up. That's all coming up. That's the type of insanity I've got.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  Of course, St. Petersburg, 230, St. Petersburg time.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  They're in the hometown of Vladimir Putin. He was back visiting there for an international conference, and a big blast went off.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  They found another bomb that appeared to be homemade, at least 11 dead.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  11 people were killed in a blast on the St. Petersburg metro on Monday.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  The Russian health ministry said in what authorities describe as a terrorist attack.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  ISIS is now taking responsibility.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  Of course, an explosion tore through a train as it was traveling between two stations in the Russian second biggest city,
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  and dozens more. A second device was found to fuse in another station.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  Russian Anti-Terrorism Committee said.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  And of course, now ISIS has taken responsibility for that.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  But here's the big issue. You pull these articles up.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  The Saudi ambassador, the Saudi government, Saudi princes all in the last three years,
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  but a lot, particularly 2016, threatened Russia that if they didn't leave Syria to the Islamist,
[10:40.000 --> 10:48.000]  Bahamia's forces funded out of Saudi Arabia,
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  that they would have terror attacks launched inside of Russia.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  So you can just Google, Saudi threatened Russia with terror attacks if they don't back out of Syria.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  And you can see that for yourself.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  Continuing. Here's another report.
[11:07.000 --> 11:15.000]  ISIS celebrates St. Petersburg metro blast that killed and now 11 pro-ISIS group draws a kill list of targets,
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  including names, addresses, and emails of some people in the UK as well as in the United States outside of the sun.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  We've got our normal Islamist news of the day.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  Graphic photos from Breitbart is,
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.000]  Islamic State throws Iraqi man accused of homosexuality from rooftop, just accused of it, killed.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  German police accused of covering up what they knew about a Christmas market killer,
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  first trying to say it wasn't Islamic when, of course, it was Islamist attack.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  Oh, but don't worry, new terrorist laptop bombs may evade airport security.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  Intel sources say so. They're thinking about not letting you have laptops on planes now.
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  Instead of, hey, how about we don't bring in Islamist from unvetted countries with fake passports like Somalia, Sudan,
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  when they don't even have a working government?
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  Oh, but you can't do that.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  So all of our rights have to be lost. That's from CNN. Isn't that just cute?
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  Oh, but don't worry, our little friend Ergun, the nice Muslim, he's been our friend, Obama's big buddy,
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  says Turks in Europe should defy grandchildren of Nazism because they're not completely letting him organize political groups
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  and letting even more Islamists stand, you know, five million in three years isn't enough.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  So he says, since we're already making you capitulate, accelerate this.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  And then he declared two weeks ago, holy war, jihad, and called for violence.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  And so did his foreign ministers and others.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  That's what globalism is, is criminal, unelected groups in our governments.
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.000]  Bring in the foreign client groups to then basically hold the nation states hostage.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  So we'll be getting back into more of that.
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  We have the nuclear option now on the table in the Senate because they are saying that they're going to do a filibuster
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  of the Republican nominee.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  And so 51 votes will get him over, so a lot of information unfolding there will be following that today.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  Clarence Thomas is set to be the longest serving justice on Supreme Court history.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  Isn't that funny? He went through a lot of trouble in his confirmation, got demonized by the press,
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  but now he's been one of the most effective justices and now about to be in just a few months the longest serving ever.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Now, what does that tell you about Trump?
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  And that brings me to my next issue that I'm going to cover more today.
[13:37.000 --> 13:49.000]  President Trump, if you search into the term failure or collapsing or disintegrating or just all these different terms,
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  stumbling, Trump crisis, you see thousands of articles a day saying he succeeded at nothing,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  CNN had an article out this morning.
[13:58.000 --> 14:08.000]  He has succeeded at nothing except the Gorsuch nomination and his address to Congress.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Those were both good.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  Really, he didn't kill TPP day one.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  He didn't begin to secure our borders again.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  He didn't get $3 trillion off exuberance into the stock market and the market was already starting to go down globally.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  He didn't get over 100 companies that I know of from Ford to Dodge to Hasbro to,
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  I mean, should I just keep going on foreign companies as well?
[14:28.000 --> 14:42.000]  Mississippi, it just goes on and on and on and on money pouring back into the United States.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Right as the economy is faltering, right as we're in crisis.
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.000]  I have a stack of news here where even the Washington Post admits that Obama was horrible for the economy
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  and then it's on the verge of collapse and then he even held back stimulus during the election,
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  thinking that Trump might be getting in.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Media admits Obama was terrible for economic growth.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  New York Post reports on that.
[15:02.000 --> 15:10.000]  So we're sitting here at this amazing point watching corporate MSM media root against the economy
[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  universally lie about Trump, say he's had no successes basically,
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  thinking they're going to get away with that if the economy implodes.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  Yeah, the Washington Post had three things he did right. CNN had two things he did right.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  One of them they said was going to debate going about NSA surveillance.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  Absolutely. All those illegal surveillance.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  So they mentioned a few things he did and he's tried to drain the swamp and term limits.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  He really did say no lobbyist. Nobody's done that in 50 years.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  But see, they're only begrudgingly picking a few things.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  There's hundreds. Go to Paul Watson's article, The First 50 Days of Trump.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  And then the White House put out their own that day that even had stuff we didn't think of.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  It's ridiculous and that's why they're freaking out because Trump is over delivering.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  3,000 plus arrests now of people, not just for child porn,
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  but with the kids trafficking the children, raping them, the real stuff.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  The FBI has been restricted to mainly going out for child porn, which is fine with me.
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  But the point is, is that it's the production of it.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  It's like, why would you go after the user instead of shutting off the supplier?
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  Then you get the users.
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  But again, they don't want to go after the kingpins and Paul Watson has a devastating report.
[16:34.000 --> 16:43.000]  A devastating report detailing massive child rape and torture and murder gangs all over the world
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  with detailed confirmed convictions that never get reported on.
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.000]  I mean, in Belgium, I mean the Netherlands, they are some of the worst.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  You talk about good stuff in the West, well, one of the bad things about the West is,
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  and the elites that control it, is pedophilia is rampant.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  It's even more rampant in Islam. It's just a fact. It's accepted in Islam,
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  sex with boys and girls as long as you're an adult.
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  Now, if you have sex with adults once you're an adult, then of the same sex, or out of marriage, then you're killed.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  So it's completely backwards.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  Shouldn't consenting adults, regardless, I mean, that's what you do in a free society.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  People can do what they want, but then you go after kids, then we kill you.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  No, see, everything's upside down.
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  And there's this new push as they try to make pedophilia public and pervasive
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  and the sexualization of children normal, people backlash.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Then the media spins it and says it's a hoax and doesn't exist,
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  and then uses media reports that aren't 100% on about cases and investigations
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  to then just come out and say, shut it down, don't debate it.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  We're not going to allow this to be looked at.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  Here it is, Dr. Phil interview exposes global elite pedophiles,
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  and then he's kicked off some networks here in the United States
[18:00.000 --> 18:07.000]  and completely banned by the Dutch, which have state run media.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  That's the newest articles out.
[18:09.000 --> 18:16.000]  So let me tell you, we get censored and blocked on this on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  unlike anything we've ever seen, especially when it's cut and dry, like KTLA saying, you know,
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  474 arrests, 28 kids caught in bondage, even more adult women in sex slavery,
[18:28.000 --> 18:38.000]  in bondage, locked up, in cages, controlled, in dungeons, and then no coverage after it.
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  We try to report on that.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  It's blocked on Facebook, blocked on Twitter because it's KTLA.
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.000]  Everybody knows that's big, one of the biggest TV stations, probably the biggest in the country.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  But never another report after it.
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  And we're seeing huge raids every day, and almost all of them aren't child porn folks.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  They're going after the people that actually have the kids.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  Thank God it's finally happening.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  And Trump is delivering on that, and that's why they're so scared.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  Hillary Clinton's first job was representing pedophiles.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  She admitted that.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  And the Democratic Party is the party of pedophilia.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  And the Republicans that are into it, a bunch of them are, that's their operatives.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  That's who they control.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  You see Republicans going up against Trump and going up against America?
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  They're handled, folks.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  They're controlled.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Look at all the page scandals, the rest of it.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  That's when the Democrats will burn somebody like Hastert, to say, the Speaker of the House,
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  who was running a whole bunch of stuff, folks, reportedly.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  He was a procure.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  And, again, Hastert was the lighter stuff, 13, 14-year-old boys.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  That's bad.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  But they weren't reportedly killing people.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  See, he's kind of a lower level.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  You don't get in the real club, Jill.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  I've got the high-level federal sources you name it.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  Stuff's so horrible that they can't even particularly tell me they just say,
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  it's raping children, babies to death.
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  That's the real caviar for them.
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  Feel the thrill, only at Slingbow.com.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  They say you can't take on the man and win.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  with all their money and lawyers.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  But they don't know Harry's.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  How's Harry's done it?
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  Simple.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  They ship directly from their site to you and do it for a lot less.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits,
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  Harry's passes the savings directly back to you.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  The result? A quality shave and more money in your pocket.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  Don't believe it? Try Harry's for yourself, for free.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Just pay three bucks in shipping when you sign up.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  Your set comes with a razor, shave gel, travel cover, and a post-shave balm.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  That's an almost $20 value, free.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  There's no catch and no commitment.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  You can cancel anytime.

[23:56.000 --> 24:21.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[24:21.000 --> 24:33.000]  And let's continue now to roll through all the news and information that we've got here in front of us coming up today.
[24:33.000 --> 24:43.000]  We have 11 killed at approximately 230 St. Peter's time today in Russia with another al-Qaeda slash ISIS attack.
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  We have the Supreme Court Justice reportedly going to be confirmed hopefully soon, and we've got the Democrats again threatening a filibuster.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  We have the mainstream media finally admitting that Obama was terrible for the economic growth, but they don't care.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  They're trying to crash the economy with what's happening with President Trump.
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  And one of the biggest things that could decide where this economy goes, not just here, but globally, is Obamacare.
[25:08.000 --> 25:28.000]  It's designed in every way on every front to consolidate control in the economy and give certain big medical companies and insurance companies the power to get waivers and other systems from the federal government and then be able with that unfair trade advantage to consolidate the market.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  That's what it's written for.
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  And of course to make you buy a product on unprecedented tax directly to corporations.
[25:37.000 --> 25:44.000]  Rand Paul is very optimistic and here's the good news about repealing Obamacare after golfing with Trump.
[25:44.000 --> 25:55.000]  The two were golfing yesterday at one of Trump's golf courses in Virginia, and he talked about the fact that he is very excited about it.
[25:55.000 --> 26:13.000]  And that's the word I got when Rand Paul was on a few weeks ago when all this started kind of kicked off his resistance to Paul Ryan's plan and the plan Trump was supporting on this broadcast was that the word he got was, hey, if this doesn't go through, it's on Paul Ryan and then it's up to the Freedom Caucus to see what they're going to do.
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  And so that way we get it repealed one way or the other and we make Congress do its job.
[26:18.000 --> 26:29.000]  I thought that was a great idea, the president, but then I saw him last week tweeting, you know, some mean things about the Freedom Caucus that I think are just really great people and I just don't think that's a very, very smart thing to do.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  I mean, we're finally seeing some things from Trump that I don't like.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  I always expected him to do things I didn't like.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  Sometimes I do things on my own broadcasts I don't like.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  And from day to day you're in a different mood, different things happen.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  The point is Trump's for real, he's not out to get us.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  He has the entire elite against him.
[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  But if the economy hears that we're not going to force her by to buy health care when that'll just break the economy.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  You just can't do that.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  Hospitals are supposed to give poor people free care.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  It's called charity care.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  So I most hospitals are quote charities, but they become for profit organizations.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  President Donald Trump golf with Senator Rand Paul this afternoon together the White House budget director that was yesterday.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  We had a great day with the president played some golf and we talked.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  There's a video of this about a little bit of health care. Paul told reporters after the game.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  I continue to be very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement on repealing Obamacare.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  The group golfed it from its National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, not far from Washington, D.C.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  Paul remains one of the toughest opponents of the House drafted bill to replace Obamacare
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  asserting that it doesn't sufficiently repeal the bill earlier in the week.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  Paul met with journalist Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report to discuss the future of the country.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  Intriguing lunch in the Hill offices of America's best senator, Rand Paul Drudge wrote afterwards on Twitter,
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  is bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  Yeah, Paul's really been shining the last six months.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  He kind of went sideways during the election, but I don't care.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  I love Rand Paul.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  I supported him initially for president till he went way back in the digits and kind of started working with MSM and stuff.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  And I just didn't like it, but his votes are great.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  Everything he's been doing is wonderful.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  A real conscience in the Senate.
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  I'd say Walter Jones is the conscience of the American people in the House.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  And it's so good to see him getting closer to Trump because he needs that ally.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  Both the president needs the ally, but so does Senator Rand Paul going into a reelection in a year and a half.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  So we're all in this together trying to restore the Republic, the globalists are the enemy,
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  the Democrats are the enemy, the Republican establishment are the enemy.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Speaking of Matt Drudge, he gave a rare interview.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  The last interview he gave was a year and a half ago, right here in the studio.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  And I'm flattered he gave me most of an hour.
[28:44.000 --> 28:55.000]  He was on for one 10 minute segment with, of course, the great broadcaster who's turned 75, Michael Savage Friday.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Hard to believe he's 75.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  I started out on air when he was 52.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  So he started out 23 years ago.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  I started out 22 years ago.
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  It's funny how Drudge started out the same time as Savage one year ahead of me.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  And so many others started out right around that time.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  But we've got some excerpts of that interview coming up as well in the next segment.
[29:18.000 --> 29:26.000]  We have got a ton of news dealing with what's unfolding with Obama's IRS chief,
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  but still in the government because there's such a rebellion against Trump.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  He's having massive trouble getting rid of all these people.
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[29:36.000 --> 29:42.000]  Infowars.com is one of the most censored websites in the world because it's where the truth lives.
[29:42.000 --> 30:00.000]  And because it's so powerful and because it won't let our liberty die in the dark of the Washington Post and all of its lies.
[30:12.000 --> 30:19.000]  This has already celebrated the attack, but that didn't stop CNN from politicizing it, saying it was retaliation for Syria.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  Although this may be CNN showing their hand.
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  Yes, it was retaliation for Syria.
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  The fact that Russia will not get behind the globalist regime change desired in Syria to remove Assad from power.
[30:30.000 --> 30:36.000]  Funny CNN would take that angle as ISIS released a kill list on the internet with names and addresses.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  And Russia has recently had nine diplomats killed since Trump's election.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  One must ask, how can ISIS release a kill list on the internet?
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  And how could people not realize there is a serious terror problem in the world?
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  And tolerance, open borders, and more forced regime change is not the answer.
[30:53.000 --> 31:11.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[31:23.000 --> 31:38.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  This system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  They lost.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  We won.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  Want to see what Trump's up against.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  It's time to ride, boss.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  We need a thousand pallet of beers.
[32:34.000 --> 32:40.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  And beef was for supper.
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  Revelation.

[32:59.000 --> 33:27.000]  Let's fix it.
[33:27.000 --> 33:36.000]  President Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to become an associate justice of the Supreme Court is caught in the firestorm of the Democratic panic,
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  deteriorating the very levers of the system the Democrats pretend to protect.
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  There are people who say, if you can't support this guy, who they're pushing forward as this is really nice person with the heart,
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  which we couldn't really find, that who would we support?
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  And I say, hey, if, yes, Merrick Garland.
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.000]  It's on all of us to let our Democratic senators know that we want them to hold the line on this filibuster next week,
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  like our lives depend on it.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  I'm on vote for Judge Gorsuch.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  I think he's a highly qualified man.
[34:15.000 --> 34:25.000]  Neil Gorsuch was given the highest rating by the American Bar Association and interprets the Constitution exactly as his would be predecessor Justice Scalia.
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.000]  There is no question about his character, about the mainstream nature of his jurisprudence, about his intelligence, about his qualifications.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  There's no question about any of that.
[34:34.000 --> 34:45.000]  And so to blow up the nuclear option over Gorsuch seems to be pointless partisanship, which will have long standing damage to the country. We have the 60 votes.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  So it forces people to think about being bipartisan.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  Once we get rid of that, you never have to worry about it again.
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  Has this been done to a Supreme Court nominee before? No.
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  Why is it being done to Judge Gorsuch? A couple of reasons.
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.000]  The Democrats claim this is a stolen seat. They think it should have been filled by President Obama's nominee,
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  Judge Merrick Garland, a year ago, shortly after Justice Scalia died.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  So they're bruised about that. They don't like Judge Gorsuch because he's too conservative for them.
[35:16.000 --> 35:27.000]  But the Democrats, in their feverish anti-Trump hypocrisy to oppose any bipartisan progress, may end up doing far more damage to the balance of power regarding future nominees.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  If the Democrats filibuster Neil Gorsuch, do you have the votes to change the rules?
[35:31.000 --> 35:42.000]  Filibustering judges at all is a rather recent phenomenon started by your next guest, Senator Schumer, after George Bush 43 got elected president.
[35:42.000 --> 35:53.000]  We didn't used to do this. Clarence Thomas was confirmed 52 to 48, the most controversial Supreme Court nominee in history, and not a single senator said he has to get 60 votes.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  Why should Senator McConnell work with you guys on this when you changed the rules first, when you decided to do this?
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  And again, a change that you yourself said...
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  Schumer looks like a demon.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000] ...and two months ago that you regret it was a mistake.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  We never, but I don't regret not changing it for the Supreme Court.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  We're not talking about Scalia for Scalia, which is what Gorsuch is.
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  We're talking about Scalia for somebody on the court who shares our values.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  And then all of a sudden, the things I fought for with scars on my neck that show us in this state are in jeopardy.
[36:31.000 --> 36:45.000]  If the Democrats force the hand of McConnell on this vote, abolish the filibuster, meeting only 51 next time around, when you might even have a liberal seat going up,
[36:45.000 --> 36:55.000]  then if it's only 51, the Republicans would be tempted to go for a far more hard-edged, conservative than Gorsuch is.
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  And that would be a self-inflicted wound by the Democrats.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  The Democratic Party has lost its grip on reality.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  If they knew what was good for them, they would get back to truly working for the interests of the American people,
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  rather than for their own leftist ideology.
[37:11.000 --> 37:18.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  I should mention some of the guests that are coming up.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  I put the call out for military veterans, patriots, people in intelligence agencies, you name it,
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  who are both public and private, to begin to go more public in defense of our republic,
[37:32.000 --> 37:40.000]  in defense of this president that's actually trying to deliver on transferring the reins of power out of unelected multinational organizations
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  like the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the EU is unelected as well.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  That's just outrageous. Back to the people.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  So you can say what you want about Trump.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  He's transferring the power back to the states, back to the people, and back to the Congress.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  He's turning loose the presidential powers.
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.000]  He's going to get TPP and hold it as a big bargaining chip for power or trillions.
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  He killed it.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  Oh, but he hasn't had any successes.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  We're going to get to some more of those successes in a moment and get into all the other news.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  But Blake Miles, who was a intelligence officer in special operations,
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  and of course, a Green Beret, comes highly recommended by a lot of great folks.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  He's a listener of the broadcast.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  He's coming for about 40 minutes to the next hour to talk about ideas.
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  He's got to fight this globalist takeover that we're in the middle of a civil war with.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  And then Daniel Estolin of the Great Bilderberg Reportage and his Bilderberg sources
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  on how big a crisis is globalism in right now.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  He's normally over in Europe.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  I believe he's joining us today from Mexico City.
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.000]  And then David Knight always a fire-breathing libertarian will be hosting the fourth hour.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  Here's just some of the news that we have in front of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  When I talk about running out of products, that is not a sales gimmick
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  because folks really do love our products.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  They need our products.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  They want our products.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  We were sold out of DNA force once for six months
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  because the BioPQQ alone is the only true organic type.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  Bioorganic, I mean, the only type is from an organic source.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  It's not fake.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  Everything else out there that still costs $45, $60 a bottle from our research is synthetic
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  and still expensive to make.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  That's why ours is so important.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  We have to buy it from the Pharmaceutical Division.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  It's a drug in Japan of Mitsubishi America.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  It's made here in America.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  That's why it's sold out all the time.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  By the way, it's in stock.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  We sold out of bio tricillinium this morning.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  Glass bottle filled with a bunch of capsules.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  The strongest out there, pure mustard seed, pure mustard seed.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  Cold extracted, the best out there.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  We sell it for a price half of what stuff that isn't as good as sold at major health food stores.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  Selenium is so important.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  Selenium is so absolutely king.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  That has sold out because we were running it with a combo
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  on Survival Shield nascent iodine X2.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  We'll put that up on screen there at an impoverished store for you right now.
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  So again, Survival Shield nascent iodine X2.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  We have a combo deal where it was 30% off when you got them singularly or by themselves.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  It's sold out.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  It'll be months until we get more of the bio tricillinium, unfortunately.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  X2 is about to sell out at the current sales rate the next 48 hours.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  And I'm keeping it until tomorrow morning.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  And then it's going to stop at 30% off the already discounted.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  We already discounted from 39 to 29.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  And now it is discounted to $20.
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  It is the only rare earth deep core mineral iodine out there.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  That's why it's so pure.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  And you can only get it two places in the United States.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  And we have had major shortages of it before.
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.000]  So we bought a ton of it a year ago.
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  And it's such a powerful element.
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.000]  It has to be kept in a DEA-controlled certified locker at the facility that Dr. Group has.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  One little crystal of it, again, at 96 degrees, turns into gas.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  So it's an amazing compound.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  It's the good halogen in the body that counteracts the fluoride, the bromide, the bromide,
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  all the bad halogens that attack our glands.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  It's changed my life.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  Well, frankly, I've gotten spoiled, but I hardly work out anymore.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  So I was working out super hard and lost a bunch of weight,
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  but then lost even more working out with this.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  And now I've kind of stopped.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm so focused on fighting the globals again.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  I've gotten that tunnel vision.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  I'm working out twice a week instead of four or five times a week.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  And I've got to stop it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  But the point is, X2 is what changed my life.
[42:04.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's going to sell out by Wednesday easily at the current 30% off.
[42:14.000 --> 42:22.000]  So I'm going to end the sale tomorrow morning and then sell out the rest at the normally discounted price.
[42:22.000 --> 42:30.000]  So if you want it and want to stockpile it, because I think we're going to end up getting more of the crystals.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  But they only get it certain places when they drill in certain areas of the United States,
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  and it is expensive for them to extract.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  They get it between seven and 12,000 feet, and they're doing deep earth drilling for natural gas.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  And so we're almost not worth it to them to sell it to them.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  At first it was like that.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  But then now big farmers involved and others are, and so it's getting bought up now.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  And so they're talking about increasing the prices for us or not even letting us have it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  And then that's a problem.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  There's only certain oil companies and gas companies go that deep and get this stuff.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  Then we've got to try to get it out of off the coast of Brazil.
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  And then there's whole import issues dealing with that.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  And so let me tell you, we've had to not sell some of our products that have shillogy in it before
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  for more than six months because they run out of shillogy in Tibet.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  Then we had to get a clean, organic, certified Russian form of it.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  So these are really good products.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  And there's a reason you don't seal all these products in stores because big companies want something easy to get
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  that they can just market and always have on hand cheaply.
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.000]  On third-party major sites, this product has over 3,000 reviews, 4.8 stars on power reviews.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  Nobody's got that because it is the best iodine.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  In fact, there's not even a comparison out there.
[43:48.000 --> 43:57.000]  Our old one was great from a very clean source of kelp, but it's hard to extract and it wasn't as strong and it wasn't as pure.
[43:57.000 --> 44:07.000]  So if you want to support the broadcast, triple 825-33139, triple 825-33139.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  And tomorrow it will go up $10 in price.
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  And then when it sells out, I'm going to go back to the original price on it on the next few runs
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.000]  because that could be the last runs of this and we need to fund our operation as much as possible
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  and turn lemons into lemonade.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  So again, this is the type of stuff going on for anybody that's successful.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  Obviously trying to bring people original things to the market.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  You get imitated, you get attacked, you get shut down.
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  So much of business with the way the country works and the world works is interference.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  It's blocking, it's manipulation, it's crony capitalism.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  It's not just open free markets and who can innovate the best.
[44:42.000 --> 44:48.000]  Speaking of selling out and I'm done plugging, we ran out this weekend of Superblue,
[44:48.000 --> 44:57.000]  the fluoride-free toothpaste that my dad developed with the biggest company that produces organic non-fluoride toothpaste in the nation.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  They produce it for us, we private label it.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  But a lot of folks didn't like that there was too much peppermint in it.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  It was hard for kids because it is concentrated toothpaste, a very small, dobulate, totally foams up in your mouth.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  So Superblue, I think we should change it to Superpink,
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  a Superblue non-fluoride toothpaste for children, bubblegum with iodine and nano-silver.
[45:19.000 --> 45:26.000]  It still has the tea tree oil in it, but it is not as strong for children.
[45:26.000 --> 45:35.000]  So again, anybody that wants to try this out or get it for their children and get them some first rate toothpaste and support the broadcast,
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  it's 996, it's a big tube and it's concentrated and it's available at infowarslife.com
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  or 888-253-3139. That's 888-253-3139.
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  I want to thank you all for your support because obviously we're under attack.
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.000]  There's a lot of manipulation going on, a lot of censoring on the Internet that they admit they're doing.
[45:57.000 --> 46:03.000]  U.S. News and World Report admitted this weekend that Google is the biggest censor in the world bigger than Communist China
[46:03.000 --> 46:11.000]  and that they are just quietly strangling free speech and particularly targeting libertarian, patriot, nationalist groups,
[46:11.000 --> 46:16.000]  whether they be liberal or conservative, that want to break away from these big corporate empires.
[46:16.000 --> 46:23.000]  Globalism is modern corporate imperialism that then reverses it and uses third world populations to drive down western wages
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  and consolidate complete and total control.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  Now there's the headline, the new censorship.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  And I'm not just singling out Google, they're just slicker about their censorship
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  and people say well then why are you on YouTube? Why are you on Google?
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  I mean I'm going to ride this pony till it has a heart attack.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  I'm going to ride this car until the wheels come off.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  I'm going to use every platform we can, I'm going to try to find new platforms.
[46:48.000 --> 46:57.000]  The media always ask how did I innovate? Because we've been very innovative in some ways, not innovative in others.
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  And I said I had to use any medium I could to get through to people.
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  And we're going to kind of go back to the days of printing off articles and saving them and having to hand them out
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  and having to do this by word of mouth like a lot of patriots did, getting the whole liberty movement started,
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.000]  getting the whole anti-globalist movement from basically being dead
[47:16.000 --> 47:23.000]  since it was started in the 50s to being reanimated, brought back and now sweeping the globe.
[47:23.000 --> 47:30.000]  The anti-New World Order understanding that started in America is now sweeping the planet.
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  And so many of you had grandfathers or grandmothers or aunts or uncles who would talk about global government,
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  the cashless society and the 10 global regions and a rising EU and a one world system.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  And you know your mom would laugh at him when you were a kid or whatever.
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  I mean my mom would kind of say oh you know your grandfather is eccentric.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.000]  But it turned out he was right about all of it because he was well read, he was educated, he was informed.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  He would go to the lectures when Werner von Braun would come to UT to speak
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  or whenever other folks were there and the only kids in the audience would be my uncle and my mother
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  because he drug them to all of it, maybe like another archeology event, another quantum mechanics seminar.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  Oh who's this Werner von Braun? And my mom looks back to all these incredible people.
[48:16.000 --> 48:24.000]  He almost took them once out to New York to go see Einstein speak.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  And they were like oh we don't want to hear Einstein so they didn't get to hear Einstein.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  Now they wish they heard Einstein.
[48:31.000 --> 48:43.000]  But if my grandfather, Mr. Hammond was still alive, he'd be sitting here co-hosting the show with us right now.
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.000]  He'd be flipping out over Yonkers, the heir to the Nazi fortune, the owner through fraud of Luxembourg, tax-exempt Haven,
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  because his family took it World War II, running the unelected EU and lecturing everybody.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  Okay when we come back from break, let me start getting into this now.
[49:01.000 --> 49:09.000]  Adam Schiff admits he has no definitive proof of Trump-Russia collusion.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.000]  Remember he's the one that got up and said that the survivors of the Benghazi attack were liars trying to sell books
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  and that Hillary never ordered a stand-down.
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  Even though thousands of members of the military were there in the situation rooms of all four branches of the military,
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  also in NATO, for at least nine hours that there was predator drones above in the 13 hours,
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  watching the stand-down orders come down from Obama and Hillary.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  He's now had to come out and say no definitive proof of Trump-Russia collusion.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  We can't be premature to reaching to conclusions.
[49:46.000 --> 49:54.000]  But then they want more investigations when nothing's found, when it's Hillary and Podesta and all of them in bed with Russia big time.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  But even more in bed with China.
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.000]  Of course Russia's trying to jockey around politically and do deals with politicians.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  Look at what's happened.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  I mean Trump should open up investigations into the outgoing Vice President Joe Biden,
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  whose son got control of tens of billions of dollars in gas total,
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  but four billion dollars of gas a year coming through into Ukraine and they just seized the Russian companies,
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  bringing in the Russian gas and have nationalized it and they're running it and making money.
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.000]  I mean there are hundreds of examples I know of where foreign governments are running the Democrats
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  and paying them off at massive numbers and for them to then come claim Trump's doing what they're doing in triplicate,
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  it's just crazy and Trump needs to call them out on all this big time.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  It's not enough to have a tweet, it's not enough to make a little statement.
[50:48.000 --> 50:55.000]  He's got to have fireside chats three times a week directly to the American people like Matt Drudge said in an interview Friday.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  He's got to use his charisma directly the American people will be back.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  Defendershield.com, the worldwide leader in EMF radiation protection.
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  Today Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  A quality shave and more money in your pocket.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  Don't believe it? Try Harry's for yourself for free.

[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  I'm not against people like that. It's just that Schiff has just got those most untrustworthy eyes.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  He's got creep-a-zoid eyes.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  Russian police focus on Islamic suspect in St. Petersburg attack.
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  Let's put an HD shot of this up on screen for TV viewers if we can.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  Boy, does that guy look creepy or what? Why the hell would you let five million people,
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  80% of military age men that look like this guy, into your country?
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  I mean, he looks like the Ayatollahumni.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  And then this is who reportedly was videotaped going on to the train.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  And we're just going to let it continue to happen.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  Oh my God, your religion says you're going to take over and kill us and make our women slaves.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  Please come in immediately. Let's have all the liberal groups sit here and praise you.
[55:17.000 --> 55:23.000]  While Ergon of Turkey sits there threatening Europe two weeks ago with terror attacks,
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  jihad, holy war, if they don't submit to him and then we get more attacks,
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  people running over folks with cars, stabbings, bombings, shootings.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  And it's okay though, because it's a religion apiece.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  Russian police focus on Islamic suspect.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  Kit Daniels, infowars.com, in St. Petersburg attack.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  Suspect with beard, Muslim cap spotted on security cameras.
[55:45.000 --> 55:52.000]  Russian police are focusing on Islamic suspect filmed by surveillance cameras inside St. Petersburg subway station
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  right before the bombing killed at least 12.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  And here's the deal. You're supposedly coming to Europe and you're going to want to be part of our culture,
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  but you keep your women wearing hoods over their heads or beekeeper suits.
[56:02.000 --> 56:09.000]  That's BS, man. It'd be like if Mormons were wearing, you know, their religious garb out in public
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  and putting in people's faces.
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  Which I've got a lot of Mormon friends and great people. I'm just saying, it'd be like if I was running around
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  forcing like doing communion in the street or something and then threatening people,
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  they better join Christianity. But imagine if I was bombing people.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  The suspect who had a beard and wore a Muslim cap left his briefcase on the subway car
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  and then quietly left the station according to Russian media.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  The police however did not exclude the possibility that man was a decoy meant to mislead the investigation.
[56:40.000 --> 56:50.000]  Earlier at Russian President Vladimir Putin said all possible situations are being investigated, including terrorism.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  Well, obviously it's terrorism and they've got the al-Qaeda ISIS groups taking responsibility.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  Homemade explosive device is diffused in St. Petersburg Metro at the Daily Blast.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  But don't worry. We have Adam Schiff. Let's play a clip going out to break of him.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  Saying we don't have any proof of anything going on with Trump and Russia.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  When they're in bed with the Democrats, the Russians have been historically,
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  and the Democrats are the ones who are allied with the real threat.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  They're the ones that launched this whole Islamic invasion, the Arab Spring impacted.
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.000]  They're the ones. Hillary Clinton, all of them. Schiff, Obama, you're responsible.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  You're the enemies of this country. Dirtbag, trying to kill our recovery,
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  trying to kill our borders, trying to kill everything. You piece of crap.
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  Let's go out to break with this piece of filth. Here it is.
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  Can you say definitively that there was collusion?
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  There were people affiliated with the Trump campaign who were working with Russians
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  to time the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  that had been hacked either from John Podesta or the DNC?
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point.
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  We are still at the very early stage of the investigation.
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  We really need to find out exactly what the Russians did.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  Because one of the most important conclusions that the intelligence community reached
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  is that they are going to do this again to the United States. They're doing it already in Europe.
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  So we can say conclusively this is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  You need to be thoroughly investigated, dirtbag.
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  Let's pause him back on screen. That guy is an enemy of the Republic.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  If you ever want to see the enemy, let me tell you, that's the enemy right there.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  That guy hates America and he thinks he's better than you
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  and he thinks he's going to outsmart you and keep sucking off you.
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  That's the parasite and the parasite press. That's the real name of the media.
[58:45.000 --> 59:11.000]  They're the fake stream parasite garbage media.
[59:11.000 --> 59:16.000]  Prostagart formula does just that with this mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants

[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.

[59:47.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I'm deep in the heart of Texas.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Not the one and only Junior Brown bringing us in.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Talk about therapy.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Listen to some of his rockabilly surf belly music and that will put me at ease.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Let's listen to about 60 seconds of this.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  That's part right here.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Hold the power.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  All you need is a big bonfire going.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Steaks on the grill.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Big ol' ice chest of cold beer in the night sky.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Music like this playing.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Then you're in Texas.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Some ol' 50's cars.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  All right, we got a lot coming up.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Big guest today, Daniel Eston.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  We also have this initiative with veterans and patriots to speak out and stand up for the president
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  and stand up for America because when Trump won the election, the real war just started
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  and you're seeing that they have gone from lying 99% of the time to just creating whole false realities
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  where it's like lying squared where they create lies built on lies built on lies that are lies.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  That's something that happened.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  They create whole new fake systems and kind of a grid layer to put you into a complete fantasy land.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Almost like the village out of the prisoner where it's just this whole context.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And that's what, I forget which CIA director it was back in the 60's.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  He was obsessed with the Russians creating this grid. He was talking about a false reality.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And manipulations with the men, manipulations.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  But that was because that's what they were trying to set up themselves.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  And so once you get into the manipulations of so many Machiavellian lies,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  you don't even know whose side you're on once you've put yourself into that.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Those that are trying to deceive become the most deceived.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Instead of being straight shooting.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And now Europe has brought in all these Turks.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  They've been politically activated. They've got families back home.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  They're saying they're going to start overthrowing Europe.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Bullying Europe into political submission to the Middle East.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Open the borders more or they'll burn things down.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Let more of the center will kill you.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  That's Reuters.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Urgans, Turks in Europe should defy grandchildren of Nazism.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Even though the Turks have famously worked with German expansionism.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And they were allied with Merkel.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  But you can also search, their minister called for a holy war.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Two weeks ago and it began.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  More burnings, more crashes, more stabbings, more shootings, more killings,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  more murder, more death.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And that's what they're running around doing now.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And the Chinese now are rioting in Paris.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Because one Chinese citizen got shot by police in some house.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And so now, you can't riot here in China, but go riot over there.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  That's what globalism is all about.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Exporting populations in, telling them never to assimilate,
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  having leftists you're allied with in the country say don't assimilate.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  That's globalism.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I mean, would China let tens of millions of Americans in
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  and let them have enclaves and let them defy the government?
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  The answer is absolutely not.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  But then China, who executes their own people with mobile execution vans
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  and kills political dissidents for no reason, including just innocent Buddhists,
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  they can lecture France on their police state.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  China calls for explanation after Paris police fatally shoot Chinese men.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  What?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  There's not even witnesses of what went on, it was in some house.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  The point is, is that China will execute you on the side of the street for no reason.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  They leave dead bodies in the streets in China.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Because if you show interest in somebody that's hurt, then you own the problem.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  So it's about completely not caring about anybody.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  And we get lectured by the Communist Chinese, the biggest mass murders in history.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Now I'm going to play some excerpts of a powerful, very rare, exclusive interview with Madrige
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  that Michael Savage got in studio last Friday that hits some key issues
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  of what Trump needs to do to defeat the globalist.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Then we'll get into the Supreme Court nomination.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  We'll get into the IRS is still persecuting people.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  130 of them have been shot and killed, including 48 children killed in February alone.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  It's gotten so bad in some areas.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Chicago activist Theo Hardiman said,
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  young people in South and West Chicago need to be equipped with helmets and bulletproof vests.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  But don't tell that to the mayor of non-citizens Rahm Emanuel.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  He's busy trying to take care of people from other countries.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Chicago, you don't have a mayor.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  I suggest you try electing one in 2019 for Infowars.com.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  This is Owen Schreuer.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include

[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more

[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret swells,
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  five-minute interfusion, I've got the body armor.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Which interfusion do you like best?
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's really incredible.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys, I love the Infowars crew
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  and I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  and just buy it, you will love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  It's a win-win, InfowarsLife.com.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Infowars.com.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  If you don't watch it, you're going to end up like Jason Adderley's boy.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Deal me out this hand, Jason. I'm about to bust.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom. Oh, good lord.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Standing.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Control. Manipulate scientific data.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Takeover, plastic control, world government, shutdown infrastructure, shivering the China.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Look at this person.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on. For your mind.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Matt Grudge is a very humble person but he has the number two most visited website in the world after MSM.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  DrudgeReport.com.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And Drudge, I can tell you, has done more in the last really decade to battle globalism
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  and to expose its tyrannies and to expose its plan as a giant megaphone or a huge amplifier
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  of my work and so many others' work.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  World Net Daily, the list goes on and on. Dr. Corsi, that he is the MVP.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  The MVP of the last two years is Donald J. Trump and the American people.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Seeing through MSM's lies.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  But the way Drudge quietly works behind the scenes, not just on air once every couple of years
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  or every day on his website is amazing.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And he came here a year and a half ago and laid out everything that was going to happen.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  MSM and collapse. Globalism and collapse. They're going to attempt to censor us next year.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  That was 2016. They did it and now it's all happening.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  Of course, he had a high level Supreme Court justice source.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  The other conservative.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  The one that's not dead. The one that's about to be the longest living and serving. It's no secret.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And a lot of stuff he told me I can't talk about.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  But I already from my sources have a lot of the same intel.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  I mean, I've got intel from the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  former head national security advisor, national security agency, national security council.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  And what's crazy is almost all these people are actually patriots and don't like globalism
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  and want to make America great again.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But it's the patriot group, the military, some of the intelligence agencies
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  against the Ivy League, the foundations, the big banks, the globalists,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  and they cannot stand the globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  That's why MSM, I finally figured it out about six, seven years ago.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  They were anti-military, but I was anti-gun confiscation drills, anti-police mission.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Until I realized, oh my gosh, I read some white papers.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  The globalists all over the world are giving police and military bad missions,
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  giving the bad guys intel so they fail on top of it to demonize their number one enemy
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  and get good people to give up and leave these agencies and groups so the evil can take over.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And since I figured that out, boys, like the clouds opened and things have just got better and better by the minute.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Let me tell you it's really evil. It's us, the American people on average.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Myself included. We're decadent slobs. We don't appreciate what we've got.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  We always blame somebody else. We have to change the country by our decisions and what we do.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And we've got to take action. I don't care if you're a veteran or just a citizen or an auto mechanic
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  or a farmer or a doctor or a lawyer or a police officer.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  This country and the world is in crisis. We've got such great future ahead.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  If we just reject globalism and modern anti-human eugenics based liberalism.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  So meeting with Rand Paul, encouraging him to be the big conservative stalwart leader, what's he's doing?
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Meeting and encouraging me. I know he does behind the scenes with other key people.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And he's just got such good advice. It's almost like, you know, to use the Lord of the Rings analogy
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  like Gandalf out there doing his important work behind the scenes invisible.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  He's not just invisible on the air and invisible in photographs. He's literally behind the scenes doing amazing work.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  So we salute Matt Rudge. I'm going to air a few of these clips back to back ahead of our next very informative guest that's joining us.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  But here's Matt Rudge. Something doesn't feel right in D.C. that another Matt Rudge claims Trump has actually saved the media.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Well, he doesn't claim it. That's the YouTube headline. The media was completely dead.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  They've gotten a dead cat bounce. Their ratings are actually up to what they were five, six years ago now
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  because of Trump. That's in the Nielsen writings today.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  So I love how he made everything interesting again because it was such a stagnant swamp.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And that now that there's actually a fight and a chance again and the parties really are in a battle, at least at one level.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Now people are tuning in because it's interesting again. Politics is interesting because now it's real.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  It's not like a Don King boxing match where all the horses are owned by the same guy. It doesn't matter who wins.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  This is real, folks. Republican and Democratic establishments against Trump, the American people, and Trump just keeping his head down desperately.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Now, now, Doug says some things. I'm going to play both these clips right now and then we're going to go to break them up with our guest,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  where he says, you know, he just needs to ignore the media and move forward.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I agree. He should ignore the media and responding to their bull. He should put out his message and what he's doing directly in fireside chats.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  And then he goes on and says he needs to use his charisma more. He's not really doing it.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Well, that means get back in front of the people yourself in your own events, Trump. You do that. It's over.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  You do what Ross Perot did in the campaign with those little informationals he did. You'll do it better.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  You were the top TV ratings ever, probably globally. Do it, Trump. Use your real strength.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Let's start playing these clips. Here's Matt Drudge on Michael Savage.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Well, I was in D.C. this week. I couldn't wait to get out of there. You know, nonstop sirens, nonstop bomb threats, a very strange feeling in the air.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  I grew up in D.C. was never like that. A sense of something is not right. You know, the highest percentage of Hillary voters was where? Washington, D.C.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Really? Trump is living in a place with the highest percentage of people who voted against him. It would have been as if Hillary went to Wyoming.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  No, be like Michael Savage broadcasting in San Francisco.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Come on.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  So maybe it maybe it can work. It works.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Maybe it can work. All right. Early days, Rasmussen, who I trust, who was literally the closest in the general election, people don't realize that.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Rasmussen actually got it right. He is showing danger for Trump. I don't think that's fake. I think he is showing danger.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  I think attacking the freedom caucus was calculated to get something through the House. That still doesn't mean he can get it through the Senate.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  You've got McCain who's going to block. You've got Lindsey Graham who's going to block.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  So Donald Trump has been dealt a very bad hand here. Does the audience understand that? He has a bad hand. And that's just the way it is.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Now, do you leave the casino altogether? Do you go to a take a break? Does he take a break?
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  You told me you think he should disappear for a while.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Well, you know, Nixon wasn't in your face since when did the president become someone who was in your face daily?
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  I wish he would just go to work behind the scenes. Just go away behind the scenes and go to work.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  But I think after Bill Clinton, you had to be in the public face every day. You had to be a part of the pop culture.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  Obama took it to new heights. The cover of People Magazine every other week or hour, you're out of favor.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  I don't think Donald needs to be, President Trump needs to be out front every day saying something.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  I think we would respect him if he got serious things done and the end result, you judged the tree by the fruit.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Melania is moving into the White House. Could this help to soften some of Trump's edges?
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  Will they care, though, Matt?
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  Nancy Reagan is billed as a secret behind Ronnie. She sued them. She played Watchdog.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  Please, this is a family show.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  Okay.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Is that what they did with each other? She was the Watchdog?
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  She was the Watchdog. I do think having Melania there and the son there.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  Yeah, you're right. The Rosie's. The Rachel's.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  I dare you, Rachel Maddow. Go after the son. I dare you.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Go ahead, Matt. Give it to her.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  I dare you, Rachel.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Give it to that sick freak.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  But hold on a second. I'm getting a little bit nervous about the media situation.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Do you know the media was near death? The New York Times was holding on to the short hairs.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  Do you know Vanity Fair was going under? CNN barely had a fraction.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Some of the networks had NAs. Do you know what NAs and ratings? Not able to register.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Unbelievable.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Trump has saved the media.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Look, record ratings now.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Why?
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  Because the opposition is consolidating. They're following every bouncing ball.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  People actually believe Trump is a Russian agent.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  But this is the drugged ones. This is the drugged ones. How do you get them off?
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Anyway, I don't mean to hog the airtime here. No, I'm not hogging.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  You don't do radio. I love it.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  Hold on a second here.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  Can FTL down in southern Florida, you're on the air with the drudge and savage?
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  Savage. You're talking about what should Trump do. Do exactly what he's been doing.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Run the country. It's been just over 60 days.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  And I'm getting a little tired of every time I listen to a station, including the conservative ones.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Oh, he's in trouble. He's, oh my God.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  I like the passion at least. That's a little more, thank you. They should put him in. Put him in.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  Here's the question. Should he get harder, Matt? Or should he back off and be Mr. Softy?
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  Go ahead. Hear the media maybe.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Wait, you know, the man sitting here in my broadcast chair is a personal friend of mine.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  We've known each other for a number of years.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  You don't know two people on earth who had more to do with Donald Trump getting elected.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Well, okay, I'll take response. You don't have to say that. I'll take it.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  You know why I'm back, Donald? I didn't know him at all.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  His message was my message. Borders, language, culture.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  He wanted a wall. He wanted to restore the faith in America.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  He wanted to restore our faith in the cultural basis of this country.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  So I figured let's go for it because the opposition here is against everything I believe in.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  But I saw that you were pretty consistently...
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  I come at it from a different side.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  I like Donald the man even before he ran.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  I think what he is one of the most fascinating Americans that have ever lived in the modern era.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  He is a throwback. You talked about an old school, an old school. He's old school.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  Part of me is his personality is not being totally used here.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  The charm, the guy who ran the hotel, the guy who had a number one TV show with the apprentice.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  And don't mock me, Rachel. Come on. This is part of charisma.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Charisma is needed in this job.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  All right, let's stop right there.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Now, that's a big compliment from Matt Drudge, not to myself, but to Paul Watson when they had dinner in London years ago.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  It was, you know, Alex's Americana, a real throwback.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  And I'm like, wow, being called an Americana throwback, that's the compliment I want.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Matt Drudge, amazing. Michael Savage, amazing. Full interview at SavageNation.com.

[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  It's called the Deep State. Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  New England FHER.com
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  He is a federal officer and also famous Navy shield and one of the leaders, one of their main teams. We'll just leave it at that.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  But it is so exciting to see the military veterans and others standing up for Trump on social media, but also at city halls. You name it and speaking out.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Because we're in an information war, the globalists are trying to take the country back. They're putting everything they can to bring down Trump.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  And so, because it was the military that said no to backing al-Qaeda in Syria and it has been the military and intelligence agencies that help the American people get informed with WikiLeaks, not the Russians, about what happened.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I've called on the military veterans and current activity, you name it, to do something that's pretty easy to do compared to what it was.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  It was hard to stand up against Obama because he was, you know, the president, you're not supposed to do that supposedly, even though you are.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  And now we have a president in the media saying, don't stand up for your president, actually trying to bring the country back.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  So the war just started on November 8th, ladies and gentlemen. And you can see that now.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And a great patriot that my sources have told us about is Blake Miles. So he's appreciate his courage, not just for the Republic, but now here in the homeland, standing up for our nation.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  I won't get into his whole bio or take the rest of the hour. Former United States Army Special Forces Green Beret, an engineering and intelligence sergeant, and then I won't go over all of his degrees and bios and all the things in active duty.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  He's done, but he comes highly recommended. He's got several websites. We'll put up on screen.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Steam it.com at Blake Miles, 84 Twitter, be miles 84. Folks want to get in contact with him and follow his important work. But we've put the call out modern Paul Revere's for other Paul Revere's to sound the alarm that hey, the fight has just begun and and
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Drudge just went on Michael Savage and said, hey, we're in crisis. They've got COG ready. They're in newspaper saying killed from removing something nasty is going on. And like Tonto said last week, they're clearly trying to get an overthrow set up.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  It's going to be resisted. We'd let them know you try legal stuff. It's going to be resisted. We don't want violence. We're winning peacefully. So we're trying to affect the future battle space in the info war or physically.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Now Blake, we've got a few minutes to break here, but I want to try to let you talk. I'm famous for interrupting when I get excited like a dog yapping. But we've never talked before, but thanks for coming on.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  What's your view on what's currently happening in the world?
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Honored to be here. Well, the most interesting thing that I found with Trump was that he gets he gets inside the enemy's head. And that's something that I haven't really seen before.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  And growing up, I didn't really see Reagan too much because that was before my time. I was still young. So I originally wanted Cruz to win. And then around June, June or July timeframe, I started recognizing that Trump gets underneath the media skin.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  He gets underneath the, the progressive skin. And that's something that it's usually flipped. It's usually flipped. Like we're the, the Patriots, the Americans, the people who believe in the Constitution.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  We, we get riled up by everything that they're doing. And finally, now here's someone that everything he does has a tweak to it has something that riles, riles.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  He knows how to turn the knife.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  Precisely, precisely. And there's, I never learned this while I was in special force, I actually learned it afterwards, but something called an OODA loop, which is learned by pilots.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  It's the observe, orient and decide and act. And it basically describes the pattern of if you're in a dog fight. So if you can get inside someone else's decision making process, you can change the outcome of the battle.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  You can throw them off.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Yep. And that's, and that's what I noticed Trump was able to do even now when he, every time he tweets, that's one of my favorite things with Trump is every time he tweets, there's usually, there's usually a, just a tiny tweak in there that, that sets people off.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  And I think it's interesting, interesting what Savage and Judge are talking about is that, you know, what, what should he be doing more of? I think they're exactly right.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  He needs to use his charisma more. He needs to, like you're saying with the fireside chats, he needs to get out in front more. But the reason that he needs to do more of that is because it, it gets inside of the OODA loop of the entire globalist establishment.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Because every, everything he does, it, it just, they hate him obviously. So him just talking about puppies or something is going to set them off. So there needs to be more of him getting out in front. And I like the fireside chat idea, but
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  Blake Miles, let's talk about it when we come back because you brought up an angle here that's so beautiful. That's right. He gets under their skin. Finally, we're on the initiative. We're not letting them lecture us. He's the only Republican to not be rolling over and let them dictate.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  If the rest of the Republicans did it, we'd save the country in a week. So this is critical wargaming, psychological warfare against the globalist using the truth. How do we win straight ahead with a former Green Beret in intelligence? I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  While Vladimir Putin was in St. Petersburg for a visit, a nail bomb blew through a train killing at least 10 people, wounding several others, including children. ISIS has already celebrated the attack, but that didn't stop CNN from politicizing it, saying it was retaliation for Syria.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  Although this may be CNN showing their hand, yes, it was retaliation for Syria. The fact that Russia will not get behind the globalist regime change desired in Syria to remove Assad from power. Funny CNN would take that angle as ISIS released a kill list on the internet with names and addresses.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  And Russia has recently had nine diplomats killed since Trump's election. One must ask, how can ISIS release a kill list on the internet? And how could people not realize there is a serious terror problem in the world? Intolerance, open borders, and more forced regime change is not the answer.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  I've got a tiger by the tail explained to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  You talk about creepy Russian police focused on Islamic suspects who went on the train, then it's before it blew up, killing now 12 people and injuring dozens others.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  And he's got the Iotola Khomeini, Khomeini look with the skull cap and the beard and all the rest of it. That's up on Infowars.com. Totally and completely creepy.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  And again, 5 million, quote, refugees, invaders of Syria, people that invaded Syria, Wahhabis to take it over. It was a watered down Shiite state, but was more inclusive.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  And are now going into Turkey and now into Europe and now to the U.S. 80% military aged men and the Saudis the last two years have threatened the Russians.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Don't stop our invasion of the rest of the Middle East or we'll bomb you.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  So Saudi Arabia has said they do this. They're the main suspects. We'll ask our guest, former Green Beret and intelligence what he thinks about all this in just a moment.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  But homemade explosive devices diffused in St. Petersburg Metro have a deadly blast.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  We ended up finding deep earth crystal sources of the purest iodine for our survival shield X2, the good halogen that just has done amazing things for myself and so many others.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  3,000 plus reviews on power reviews, 4.8 stars out of five. Nobody's got that because we were getting the purest kelp, which was about a third as strong and not as pure but still the best of the time.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  We discovered from big drilling rigs and a few places in the U.S. we're getting it for pharmaceutical companies.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  And we thought, well Dr. Group has a DEA license for some of his facilities. Let's get this because you have to have DEA approval to get pure iodine because you can, it's a precursor for a bunch of stuff.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  Anybody who's watching Breaking Bad knows that. This kind of stuff drugheads will break into your office and try to steal.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  This is an underclosed location in another state from Texas and then it's put into the palm oil and then you get the best stuff out there that really goes into your bloodstream and has amazing effects.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  Be sure and talk to your doctor first, but it's very, very safe, certified and safe. It's an element that you die without.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  We're running out of it. The oil company, gas company that drills for it wants a lot more money. They haven't gotten more of it since we bought a ton of it a year ago.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  We're about to sell out of the run we have, but I'm still offering it at 30% off. We sold out of the Biotrus selenium, 30% off.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  We sold out of our fluoride-free toothpaste in the adult formula. Bubblegum just came in today, by the way. It has the iodine and the, and the colloidal silver and stuff, but it's bubblegum flavor.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  It doesn't have a bunch of peppermint. It's too strong for kids in it. That's now available at m4store.com or m4slife.com.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  And that's how you fund us. They've had our sponsors. They've shut us down over the years. They taught us how to fund ourselves, selling products direct.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And guess what? Made us more successful than ever. Thanks for all the attacks, globalists. You just made us stronger.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  Like Nietzsche said, that doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger. Or like the Bible says, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Unless it's in God's plan that we get struck down as an example, that's fine. I don't care.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  But we have super blue bubblegum flavor now available right on time as we sold out this weekend to the adult formula.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And this is great for adults as well, but this is the toothpaste for your family and it supports the broadcast.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  But the iodine is going to go up to full price tomorrow. It'll take maybe a week to sell out at full price, and then it'll be a while until we get more.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  And that's going to be full price once we get it, because we don't know if we're going to get more of X2.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  And I've been selling it almost five years. I never told you that. That's what's happening. I hope it comes through.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  But I'm not going to sit there and get put over a barrel. I'm going to find other sources or whatever, because I don't want to sell this for a hundred bucks a bottle or whatever.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Because, you know, oil companies tell me, well, it's too expensive to extract it, and we're just going to leave it in the ground.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Or we've got people that want to buy it for more, whatever. There's more than one group we can get this from.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  We just have to fair it around with oil companies, gas companies, and figure it out and then test it and make sure it's as good.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  It is an incredible source from pretty close to Texas, not Texas, but close.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  And the next best stuff, or even better, they say, is from Brazil.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  So we'll see what happens in FullWarsLife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Okay, Blake Miles is our guest for the balance of the hour.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Blake Miles is a former United States Army Special Forces Green Beret, engineer and intelligence sergeant.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  He's involved in a lot of other amazing things as well today, and he joins us to go over a lot of issues.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I want to talk to him about cryptocurrencies as well. He's an expert on that.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  But Blake, you brought up, that's why I love getting veterans on, especially operators on, because you always have great angles.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Looking at Trump, there are attacks on him, how he finally goes on the offense.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  But the Republican cowards, even his own inner circle, keep bowing and thinking, groveling to the system, is going to protect them.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  So you've got the floor of the next 12 minutes. Tell us from your perspective what Trump needs to do, where he needs to go,
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  and what the American people need to do, because this is the battle for the Republic.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Well, what you're saying about, he has enemies around him, and you make that blatantly obvious.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  It'd be the equivalent of getting into a firefight, and you got your buddies next to you and around you, shooting across you and aside from you,
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  and doing all sorts of things to attract fire on you, which is the opposite of what you need.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  So he has to do more to rile up, what we're doing right here, getting...
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Energize the base. But you're so on target. I mean, it's true.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Energize the base, declare what's going on, and say, all I've got you, the people, all I've got you, I'm trying to deliver.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  Help me. He doesn't want to look weak. He's not weak. He's in there with like 100 wolves around the lion.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  And actually, one of the things that got me, when Tim Reems and Clinton were on the show, when they did that first call for action for veterans,
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  what really inspired me to reach out, I mean, aside from wanting to support Trump to begin with, was I've been a lot more active in like 4chan and Reddit,
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  and David Brock, he's one of my least liked individuals in the world at this moment.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Oh, he's sworn to destroy me publicly.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  I'm not a fan of him. But anyway, seeing the work that he does with correct the record before the election, during the election,
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  and now they've changed their name and their tactics to share blue or whatever. What they do is they have paid people and bots and botnets
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  and whatever other tools they can get from whoever else they have access to to basically control the narrative.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  They get on all of these forums, specifically like Facebook and Twitter, and you can see all those.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  But also in 4chan and the 4chan politically incorrect channel, important stories, important threads get slid by a bunch of nonsense stories
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  by people going on there and posting irrelevant stuff or posting stupid stuff that has no point.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  So the thing that I wanted that I recognize a need for is that I don't see the same sort of thing. Like if I had a wave of magic wand,
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  there would be a fund that we could pay people to do the exact same thing. But on our side, there needs to be something countering this paid propaganda machine.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  Exactly. Soros put 200 and something million into one march alone. He's putting hundreds of millions that we know of into the bots.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  They admit they're botting everybody. They're hitting us on YouTube, M4s, every word lies. Dirty tricks I can't even talk about on air.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  And then meanwhile, they accuse us and our success of Russian bots when there is no such thing. They've done nothing for us.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  The Olinsky tactic of accusing others of the exact same thing you're doing. With what they're doing on there, the first time I actually noticed this sort of tactic was in Bitcoin.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  There's actually kind of a civil war that happened in Bitcoin and I can see the reason why because it's a very disruptive technology.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  But what happened is there's two sides that formed. There's two factions that formed between them. And I recognized that there was these tactics of divide and conquer going on on Reddit.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  There's two factions that formed. And I recognized it and I could see the difference, the same patterns. And I see the same patterns now with what is going on in the political realm.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  People who support Trump are being divided from people who are classic Republicans or classic conservatives or just Americans that don't pay attention because they're working every day.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  The Russian drumbeat is the same thing that divides us from each other to working towards the goal of, you know, Americana, like you say.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  But yeah, David Brock specifically, the pin tweet I have is a story about him cheating the IRS out of like $1.2 million from not reporting taxes.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  And I'd like to see him go down. We need a targeting cell, honestly. I mean, if there are a lot of...
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  If we're going to have Victor, we've got to have targets to bring down. He wants to bring me down. I'm the target. Let's bring him down. How do we do it legally and lawfully?
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  That's right. Let's bring down David Brock. He wants a head on. Let's do it.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  I know for a fact that there are a lot of former special operations guys that it's hard to translate work. The work we do in special operations is really hard to translate in the civilian world.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  We have intelligent minds that see a lot of different angles. I'm not bragging about myself here, but I recognize the pattern enough with team guys. We see things very similarly.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  A lot of it's being conscious. You just have to start looking and then actually put yourself into that mode.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  But we want to be in a fight. There's a desire to get into this fight because I recognize the fight that's going on right now. What really brought me into this fight was when I first heard the clip of the heavy breathing ban at the Komet ping pong.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  The whole rabbit hole there is what really ignited this flame in me. I completely agree with the path that you went on. The pizza place was the honeypot, but the bigger story goes much, much deeper.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Once I understood what was going on there, I couldn't turn away. It's like what Craig Sawyer was talking about.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Exactly. Once you know this is going on with children on a wider scale and they're making jokes about it, then it's like as a man, there's no more fear. You're totally committed. Or you're actually aiding and abetting it.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  Yeah, and I have two kids myself and it's something that I haven't been able to shake from my brain. So, to your original question, what can be done? And I guess I could tie it into the cryptocurrency, you know, Bitcoin thing.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  It would be possible to raise funds through digital currency and disperse it based on the amount of output that people are doing. There needs to be groups of special operations people that want to get into this fight, that want to get into this psychological operation because that's exactly what it is.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  David Brock has a 501c3 that openly engages in psychological warfare against the United States and against the Constitution and there's a charity for it. So, well, 501c4, I'm not sure what he has.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  We can do the same sort of thing with much, much higher quality people. You know, he pays pennies to people that sit in dark rooms all day and hammer out trolling.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  Oh, and I love how on the show, Homeland, they act like I'm running all this and have rooms of fake stuff. We're just covering what's going on. In fact, here's an article out of the Daily Signal, Obama's IRS chief who dodged impeachment continues under Trump. There is total rebellion against Trump.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  The bureaucracy is just ignoring him. He can't even get his people in. That shows how good he is. The whole system is an open, total rebellion. It's insane.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  And there's, it goes back to the PsyOps thing and back to what I said earlier about the OODA loop is because Trump is so outnumbered, because his allies are very limited in his media circle.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  We have to do it.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Yeah. They're in his OODA loop right now because he's backpedaling and there's just not enough. We have to regain that momentum that we had.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  And Trump understands that fundamental. When you're doing right, you've got to move forward no matter what these people think, grovel to the media, they're going to leave you alone. No, that's like cutting your wrist with great white sharks, man.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  You got to go on the attack, especially when you've got the high ground. It's time to destroy these people. They're fighting for their lives. They lied about the election. They got caught rigging it. They're the ones that back radical Islam.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  They're the criminals. They're the ones paid off of the Chinese and the Russians. And you just see, we need to go on total offense right now.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  One thing that's changed, it's been a paradigm shift for me is with this whole pedigree thing is I never understood why it seemed that every time there was an opportunity for our political, the political parties to do something that would most likely benefit the American people.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Anytime they had that chance, it never worked out. It never played out the way that it could have or it should have. I never understood why. But now I'm starting to wonder if, well, I really don't even wonder anymore.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  I think that this pedigree thing is that it's the pinnacle of a black metal compromising system that runs.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Oh, that's it. Sex compromise doesn't work anymore. This is a sex compromise on.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  Yeah. I can't imagine. Affairs don't bring down politicians anymore. Drug use doesn't bring down politicians.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  In fact, they're told, you've got to do this, at least with underage. First, it's 17, 18-year-old, whatever. You've got to cheat on your wife to get in the club.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  You've got to talk to high-level folks, say you're in the FBI, then it's, oh, she's 17, just do it, we'll trust you. Then they're 15, then they're 8, then they're 10.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  Then you've got to run security while they're doing a ritual, you know, having sex with kids. Then it's kill them. I've talked to people involved.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  They say it is the most evil stuff they've ever seen. I'm talking to guys that have been in special ops 30 years, seen the most horrible stuff, and they say this is beyond.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  They said it's pure Satanism. And a lot of these guys are even atheists, as you know, and some of them in special ops don't believe in government, any of it.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  They think it's all bull. They actually go, I don't know why it's so evil, but it's real. They're devil worshiping.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  That's the, I mean, I'm a believer, firm believer.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  Well, I've talked to people, not just Craig, others. They've been on the rails. I mean, Craig won't talk about this. It's all classified.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  And they're now getting ready to go public because they catch them with the kids and with dead kids. And then it just gets shut off. And then finally, only it's only happening because Trump says, I'm backing you and gave him a green light.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Just like he gave special ops a green light to go after ISIS leaders. And they go, oh, he's reckless letting special ops pick the targets. Well, they're right there looking at the guy.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  That was one of the more frustrating things that I had while I was active duty was that it felt like more often than not, our hands are tied with a lot of things we couldn't do.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  I mean, it's what we're trained for. It's what we're, I mean, obviously there's a chain of command, but, you know, if you, if you tie the hands.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  You've got the target in place, you got to wait two hours, what goes back to the White House.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  And Obama's on vacation, you know, with the $65,000 for the hot dogs.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's a, I firmly believe that this is a battle between good and evil at this point. And the pedigree stuff proves that.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  And it's, it's going to force people to make that decision of what side they want to follow.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Blake Miles, stay there. I agree. And Trump is green lining the police military to go after the bad guys.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  So we want a leader that was green lining it. He's doing it. Now it's up to us.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  Hi, Auntie Christine. Thanks for the Easter basket you sent me. It has all my favorite candies in the stuffed bunny rabbit.

[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  It's called the Deep State. Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Deep State was first revealed in the Runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  Newsmax, Lutobs, and Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda at bookstores everywhere or check out our free offer.

[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  I got soul, and I'm super bad in a good way.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  I'm out out to get people, and I know you're not. You're the most awesome audience ever.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  I can't hardly go to sleep now, though. We're in such an epic battle, and the lines are so clear.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And globalism is so obvious.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  And Junkers is the Nazi family, one of the most rich in Germany, that the royalty in Prussia, the military house of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, took over Luxembourg.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  He rules it. He's the EU head, threatening military action.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Let me shift gears with our guest, Blake Miles, former Green Beret engineering and intelligence sergeant that went on with all his degrees and other work.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Since then, it would take too much to go over his 16, 17 year career to cover all that.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  But highly recommended by a lot of great patriots, and we'll put up his web address and more on screen for folks.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  What do you make of EU threatening to kick the British basically out of Gibraltar?
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  So now they're threatening war, the prime minister is. And the Brits, you see what you want, they don't threaten war unless they're ready to go.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  This is like Falkland's war again. All over EU, Junkers is threatening to attack everybody.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Angela Merkel, EU army, poses the greatest threat to the world. That's zero hedge.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And then now, this is out of express, EU could break up the US Junker, the jaw-dropping threat last week.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  And then now they're threatening the UK.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  German MEP says European army will not happen. Thanks to Brexit. I mean, the EU says, oh, you want to leave, we'll just march troops in.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  And then it's some weirdo Nazi air. It's like, what twilight zone am I in here?
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Well, I think it speaks to the fact that they know their corner. They know that their time is short because it's...
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  We gathered, we had the momentum when Trump won with Brexit with all these other events that are going on around the world.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And more and more people are waking up and they don't have the guaranteed win that they had when they thought Hillary was going to be in office.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  So now, you know, this is their plan B. Their plan B is to create as much chaos and as much strife as possible.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  And so they can pick up the pieces. It's the same technique that they're running on a small scale here with the United States on beating the Russian drum and dividing up everyone who...
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  I agree. Is the frantic squawking of the Democrats a death row because they are just crazed?
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  I think... I wouldn't call it a death row. I think most of them don't even... most of them believe it. I think, well, at the higher up, they don't believe it.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  At the higher up, they know what's going on, but most of them down below firmly believe that Trump is a...
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I agree. It's a cult then. They just are like zombies.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  Yeah. And it's... I think the few that understand the big picture that aren't fighting against it, they are firmly on the wrong side.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  And one thing that I've learned is, you know, I think the whole goal for Satan is to make everyone as miserable as he is for making the wrong choice.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  And that's the path that they're wanting to travel right now. And that's what they're working on, actively working towards it.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  Well, we know Trump's a stalwart and a great patriot. And I get the fact people that are around him are feel surrounded, so they're kind of trying to hedge their bets.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  That's the most dangerous move. But communicating the president, he's got to launch the fireside chats. There's a president. He's got to do it.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  I don't know why he's not... Next time he calls me, and I'm talking to him in weeks, I'm going to say please, and I've missed calls, please launch the fireside chats.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  Let's talk about what else? Because you were in psychological operations, obviously, in intelligence.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  From your research, what do we do? We have the truth. We have the prosperity. We have all these things he's done in just 70 days in.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  We're like 71 days in. What does he need to do next? And what do we need to do? Because he is surrounded.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  And folks, this is the battle for everything. Because they're going to go to pure authoritarianism. If they defeat Trump, they're going to go after all of us.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  But it's fine. I'm trying to spare everybody. Because I'm not worried about it. I'm tired of playing games these people.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com. Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride. Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more. Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  we have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free. Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at InfoWareStore.com and support the InfoWare while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  If this feeble attempt to defeat the globalists has been so successful, imagine what happens when you take action.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  I've got a bunch of breaking news to start the next segment. Our Bilderberg insider on where the elite are, Daniel Estolin, who's in Toronto. He was in Mexico City in Spain. He's in Toronto now coming up.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  But I want to give our guest Blake Miles. I hope he'll come back. Former Green Beret involved, of course, in intelligence and engineering and more. His view on what else we can do.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  I've been asking a lot of questions in the five minutes we have. What do you want to impart to viewers?
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  Well, two things that are coming to mind right now. I reached out to Craig Sawyer about this topic as well. When he ran into the problem with the you caring, the fundraising, my brain immediately went to Bitcoin and digital currencies,
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  blockchain technologies, because that's actually that's a WikiLeaks was when they got shut down by PayPal can get donations and PayPal. That was one of Bitcoin's original Bitcoin has turned out to be absolutely fabulous.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  I was just scared of it thinking what regulators would do to me if I got involved, but it's beautiful.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  I mean, I'd be happy to advise in whatever way I can. I actually have a debit card where I can send Bitcoin into a wallet and I can use the debit card.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Sure. It's taken me five, six years, but I just don't want to stir my listeners into something. I don't love it now. It's totally proven. It's amazing.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  It's a complete game changer. And the reason it's a game changer is twofold. The currency in itself can't be controlled, but also the data, the data stores, how the information is transferred and conveyed around.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Sure. But also just the idea of this breaks the back of the globalists and their money monopoly.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Yeah, because they have no control or they can't control how much they make, which is great because we all know how fun it is to know that trillions of dollars are printed since whenever.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  But one of the other things that I found was this, that's FEMA website that I mentioned. What it does is it's censorship resistant in that anybody who posts on there, it basically converts their posts into an HTML text document that's small in size,
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  but it distributes it throughout all the nodes and all the people that are running nodes on this that uses the same blockchain type technology that Bitcoin uses.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  That's steemit.com forward slash at Blake Miles 84. Yep. And so you can't, you can't like attack it. You can't just shut down. You could attack the URL. You could take down the website, but anybody who is running these nodes still has access to all the.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  We'll talk to you and other experts because clearly they're moving towards even shutting down in fours. What do we do to be more redundant? Obviously be on our email and fours.com for such a letter, but we're now moving into that time where we want to defeat their censorship,
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  but we may not, at least in their first wave, if they kill the president and bring in COG, we're going to go dark for a while. It's going to be these underground systems that are going to keep us in contact.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  Well, I thought about that. I think blockchain technology is, is where the future is going as far as censorship resistance.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  If, if you took your shows and actually, so there's two things that the, there's text based stuff, but there's also, I mean, it's, it's tough to get video in that sort of a format, but there's transcripts.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  Yeah. Well, and then that's something that I would, I would, I would want to do is like I started typing up transcripts.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  We're out of time, but Blake, I think we should have a round table discussion on air and we should start a daily broadcast with a round table of people that rotate through.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  So folks are on vacation or on missions or all the things they're doing where we have like maybe 20 guys and gals that are involved in all this.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  You have like a three hour show every day where they rotate through and just debate and cover all these different topics on air to the American people because this is the battle for the Republic.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Blake Miles, thanks for joining us. We appreciate you.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Thank you. Thank you. Great point. That's why I love getting these guys on. It's a huge brainstorm every time and people can bitch about the military and bad things.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  It doesn't matter. At least they're engaged. They're involved. They're not rolling over. They're so alive compared to the general public.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  And I want the general public to become alive like that. We're not like, oh, look, these guys are alive. Aren't they great? No, we all need to be alive. That's the answer.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  Ron Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago is a disaster. On Friday, Ron moved forward his plans to implement a Chicago only ID card specifically for noncitizens that will ensure they can get access to welfare.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  Part of this plan is also allowing noncitizens to get these IDs from the city without leaving any trace behind at the office to avoid federal interference.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  But while Ron was out fighting for the rights of noncitizens, his city is in disarray.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  So far this year, 700 people have been shot in Chicago. 130 of them have been shot and killed, including 48 children killed in February alone.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  It's gotten so bad in some areas, Chicago activist Theo Hardiman said, young people in South and West Chicago need to be equipped with helmets and bulletproof vests.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  But don't tell that to the mayor of noncitizens, Ron Emanuel. He's busy trying to take care of people from other countries.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  Chicago, you don't have a mayor. I suggest you try electing one in 2019. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  Gobs and school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  We're the solution. Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Offs General Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Americans need to see this film.

[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  Stand up if you're counting for what you were about to receive. We are the dealers. Give you everything you need.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  But what happens when the globalists break the compact of humanity and begin to cut off the resources and save developments bad?
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  We have to break with them. Daniel Estelund, best-selling author, investigative journalist, Super Builderberg Sluth,
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  probably Jim Tucker discovered it and exposed it, but Daniel Estelund actually penetrated it and infiltrated it.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment, but before you go any further, Russian police focus on Islamic suspect in St. Petersburg attack.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Suspect with beard, Muslim cap spotted on security cameras. Saudi Arabia threatened the last few years over and over again.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  If Russia didn't back out in Syria, that's right on their border, that they would attack them using Islamic jihad groups.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  Let's be clear. I was against the Iraq war just like Trump because most of Muslims don't want war,
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  but the leaders are enslaving them like a cult and driving them through the Wahhabist to do these things.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  And it is totally sick. Is this guy a decoy? We don't know.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  But the bombing obviously now, 12 people dead in St. Petersburg, all that unfolding.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  What's happened with them saying Russia is running Trump? Totally ridiculous.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  Globalism is in crisis. We have the British threatening to go to war with Spain over Gibraltar in the EU,
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  kicking it out, meaning cutting off its supply lines.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  We've got just craziness taking place with the elites pushing their world government.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  We have Peter Thiel of Bilderberg saying the tide's going on on globalism,
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  which is just modern world corporate colonialism.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Is that true or what's really happening? What's the plan? Because I know what Estlin's going to get into.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  I haven't talked to Estlin like a year. It's great to have him on.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  This is out of the San Francisco Chronicle and in a bunch of other papers today.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Oh, cyborgs at work. Employees getting implanted microchips.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  The military to put chips in Tripp's brains. That's another headline.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  They go from Estlin and I talking about it 15 years ago being cooks to now.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Oh, we're doing it. It's fun.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  That famous photo of Zuckerberg walking bipedally while everybody else is wearing goggles on their heads.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  That's what's happening. And then the worldwide battle against pedophile rings.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  We know the global issues is political systems to compromise political organizations.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  So Estlin, I haven't talked to Estlin in almost a year. Again, we're going to talk to him about all his amazing sources.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  I know he's got Bilderberg sources. I don't know who their names are.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  He's given us amazing intel. You're in half before the housing collapse.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  He said they're going to plunge the housing system in a year and a half and gave the reasons.
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  He's laid it all out. And so Daniel Estlin.com.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  He joins us via video Skype from Canada where he's at right now.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  So Daniel, great seeing you again. Thank you for joining us. You're a radio listener in FullWars.com.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  You can always see the video feeds, folks. It's free.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Let me ask you to just set the waterfront for us here.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  I've made my points for three minutes. What do you want to cover today?
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  I'm just guessing what you might want to cover because we're focusing on the same war that's going on.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  But what else is on your palate?
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  I think Alex, it's great to be back and show you right. I haven't been on for about a year. A lot has been going on.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  And in this past few weeks, first of all, you won the very important award in Mexico.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  Just came back there from Mexico. Congratulations.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  First of all, NATO, Montenegro is something I want to discuss.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Urgent issue that Americans need to understand.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  The treacherous and treasonous attempt by the United States and the world.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  The presidency back, win the White House back. We can discuss that as well.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  I think at no time in America's prior history, Alex, has anything so openly subversive and treacherously treasonous ever been perpetuated in the United States of America before.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  I think the closest being the, you know, the covert conspiracy single-handedly swore it by America's military hero,
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  General Smidley Butler in 1934, on a band of elitist bankers, traders attempted a coup d'etat against the FDR administration.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  We know the game, the all too familiar dividing conquer strategies.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Once again, the globalist go-to modus operandi. We're seeing it right now in St. Petersburg.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  We're seeing it in the United States. We're seeing it in Europe. We're seeing it in Latin America.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  We're seeing it all over the world.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  And again, this is being implemented through the multi-pronged assaults, waging an open insurrection war against the Donald Trump administration in America
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  in order to successfully execute a coup d'etat committed by traders and to take down America as the latest banana republic.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  Daniel, you don't like labels, but, I mean, you've been so on target over the years in your books I've read,
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  both novels with classified stuff and both non-novels. It makes my head spin.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I just respect you more as the years go on. You're one of those maybe 10 people I know that have been so on target.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  It's actually scary. People think I'm on target. It's my guests that are on target.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  But looking at globalism, I would call you a classical liberal. You didn't like Bush. You don't like all this stuff.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  You're very liberal policies. I agree with a lot of those as well. You're a real liberal.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  We see Nigel Farage. I'd call a real liberal for Trump. It's not that Trump's perfect.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  It's just that clearly the power structures against him, they hate him, and then you lay out St. Petersburg.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  What's happening? They were their agenda. So where should we start? You have the real liberals and then nationalists of every race, color, creed,
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  and then you've got Republican establishment, Democratic establishment, elites, European elites, all wanting this global system,
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  trying to prop it up, and then just we're allied with radical Islam. We're not against Islam, but just radical Islam.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Who are the players? Where are we right now?
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Well, Alex, the ruling elites' long-time agenda has been to destroy the United States and the West from within.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  And in reaction to last year's growing anti-globalist movement represented by the Brexit vote and also anti-establishment Trump election,
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  the elite is becoming desperately aggressive right now, fighting for absolute domination and population control,
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  insidiously wiping up unstable domestic conditions throughout the Western world,
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  engineer to explode with racial, class, religious, and also politically charged civil war violence in both America and Europe.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Which is seen in the United States, we have seen in Europe, in Spain, in Italy, in France, in England, in Germany,
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  in other countries as well, in Portugal and also in Greece.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  In the United States, this takes the form of mass deployment of a robotically dumbed-down, highly manipulated, yet well-organized political left.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  And again, we've seen this with the flake movements in the United States right after Trump election.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  Now, constituting the elite's weapons of mass destruction against Trump's reactionary or militarized authoritarian federal forces,
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  soon spilling blood and chaos as America's very own spring uprising.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  The coming riots are aimed at causing the violent breakdown of civil society in both America and Europe.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  Of course, coal-timed with the ongoing...
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Let me just back, you're spewing so much knowledge here.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Clearly, they're trying to foment, race for all this crap.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  You mentioned that.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  They're trying to foment war.
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  They admit they're trying to foment war.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  So let's dial back and talk about that some specifically, because this is unprecedented.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  The COG mainstream papers saying overthrow Trump, calling for civil war,
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  and they're saying implode the economy to hurt nationalism as if the public doesn't get.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  You're going to hurt our economy to get...
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  I mean, forget Trump.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  They're openly saying, make us poor like Brexit to teach us to serve this system.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  So, I mean, what's happening?
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  Well, Alex, there is a new norm in America that is one of chaos, race wars,
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  and also mass shootings that are supposedly real.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  Of course, you can provide a mountain of evidence to debunk the visual mainstream media narrative,
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  police announcements, or whatever intelligent sources are saying.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  And of course, this new norm is even being contributed to by many alternative media sources
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  the interest of being correct, no, and authentic about what they're saying.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  I think for the first time in modern American history, we have a generation
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  that doesn't know what order, calmness, and peace look like.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  They have no idea what it's like not to be at war or even to be in a war
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  that has realistic scenarios for the possible ending date.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  And now, with the ruling elite moving as fast as ever to get the new world order done,
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  we're seeing a brand new level of chaos and fear slowly becoming the new norm
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  that particularly the millennials are being led to believe is inevitable
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  and the new unavoidable reality.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  So, I think that's what's happening.
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  I agree. John McCain said the new world order is collapsing in crisis.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  All the elites are saying it.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  I think it's premature to say that, but they're finally hitting the alarm bell.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  Why are they saying that?
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  You know, Alex, the chaos once almost exclusively limited to the Middle East
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  that we've become so accustomed to watching on television,
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  is slowly but surely carrying over to the United States
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  and also to Russia as we saw today,
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  one slide up gladiably operation staged event at a time.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  No longer is chaos something happening thousands of miles away.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  It's happening right here in America. It's happening in Russia, in my hometown.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  And notice, you know, I keep saying chaos because unlike Operation Gladio,
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  which occurred throughout Europe mostly from the 1960s to the early 1980s, 1990s, sorry,
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  the current so-called Operation Gladio B, which again, you know, we can call Northwood.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  Seving purely stage they bring in people that will do it.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  Well, it's much more sophisticated.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  You have Gladio B unlike Gladio A is being conducted in an era of mass psychological terror
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  and deception made possible by technology, legalized propaganda, fake terror groups like ECs.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  Amazing. Abandoned, genuinely moved so quick, but it's all so on target while getting my brain burning here.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  Let me ask this before I go to break.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Why do they hate Russia so much?
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  I mean, Russia, I'm not, you know, you're a Russia expert.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  I've never been there. I just study it.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  They're not expanding. They're trying to build their country.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  They have good policies for their people.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Why are the elites so out to get Russia?
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  I just, it's crazy.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  Because you can't have one world government, you order one world company limited unless you can destroy it.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  The only nuclear powered, China has nuclear weapons, but China is a military, is an economic superpower.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  Russia is the only alternative to the military superpower that is the United States.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  So again, until you can destroy Russia, you will not have your one world, whatever you want to call it.
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  But their program destroying Russia is failing, the Russians always dig in.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  So where does that go?
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  They just keep doing it and trying to destroy it anyway possible.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  And again, chaos or order out of case, and this is what we're seeing right now.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  Keep in mind, Alex, that the people behind the economic policies in Russia are all the same liberal crowd
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  pulled there by the Bill Clinton presidency 20 years ago.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  In other words, Putin may be a great leader and a great politician and a great strategist,
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  but his hands are tied because again, Putin as the president controls foreign policy.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  The Prime Minister Medvedev.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  That's right. He's completely surrounded like Trump.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  While he's a liberal, stooch trader who works for the interests of the Western governing elite
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  with all the bankers who represent Russia.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  So Putin and Trump are both surrounded.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  They like Putin suggested they meet with me.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  Don't let them intimidate you.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  They need to come together, laugh at the whole system.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  And they need to have a huge, you'll have all the ratings.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  They need to like have a two hour talk on TV.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  Let's talk about that right now.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  We need to get Putin and Trump together right now to just absolutely lay out what's happening.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:59.000]  Daniel Esselen is our guest. Stay with us.
[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Laudinger
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  They say you can't take on the man and win.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.

[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  Think about this. Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead,
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.

[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Don't send your Ken folks around to give him a talking to.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  Been there.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  Daniel Eslams will still about 50 after that he's going to jump.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  And then we're going to have David Knight coming up. I've got other breaking news here.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  Susan Rice flashback. I know nothing about Trump, I'm asking.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  But it's being reported that the White House, the former Obama White House,
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  was saying she's the one that unmasked it all.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  So the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Daniel Estolin, a Bilderberg fame, is our guest.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Let's put his Twitter up on screen because I'm told that's one of the best ways he wants folks.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  He's just launched that new Twitter there.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  He's got a huge website and best-selling book in like 20-something languages last time I checked.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  But you can go to Estolin Daniel at Estolin Daniel. That's his official account right now.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  Now Daniel, going back to you, looking at all this, I don't want to be overconfident.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  But as you said, nationalism is rising, globalism is now exposed.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  But then Junker, the heir of the Nazi fortune, he's one of the top Nazis in his family, that's admitted,
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  threatens the US, they threaten the British about Gibraltar, telling Spain to kick it out of the EU.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  They're threatening war. I mean, this is all exploding quickly.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  So you talk about desperate panic. Boy, that's happening. So what do you make of this?
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  We have a new desperate panic, Alex, and that's Montenegro.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Oh yeah, you wanted to get into that. You've written articles about that.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  Let's talk about Montenegro. You wrote a story about that. Tell folks.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  It's very important. Last week, the United States Senate voted to support the assertion of a very small country,
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  Montenegro and Tornado. And this issue of so little interest to the majority of the American senators
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  that the standing quorum rule was overturned for the vote.
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  The only two are descending voices where senators Lee and Paul.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  Nevertheless, Alex, its assertion to NATO can become that red line which will edge the world closer to World War Three.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  Now, Montenegro borders Serbia, Russia's historical ally.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  Do we really want to go there again? We know what happened in 1940.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  Clearly it's a set piece by McCain to start a new war because he can't get it in Ukraine.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  Exactly. Only this time it will be a full-scale world thermonuclear war.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  And the Russians have said, and they've never backed off, that here's our red line. It's over.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  If the United States draws Montenegro into a military alliance, Alex,
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  what would happen if Russia does the same with America's neighbors?
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  Do we want Russian missiles and Cuba?
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  Yeah, do we want Mexico to make an alliance? It's crazy. Or Cuba again.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  Exactly. Now, you know, this isn't the first time the United States...
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  By the way, there are Russian troops back in Cuba again.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  Exactly. Now, this isn't the first time that the United States government
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  tries to draw Russia into an open confrontation.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  Back in June 2014, NATO's foreign ministers met in Brussels
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  and agreed to offer Georgia, one of former Soviet republics,
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  a substantive package to actually help, you know, come closer to them.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  And they launched a war on Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  Exactly. You know, nothing in what you hear in the corporate American and European-based media
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  is, of course, objective and impartial. It is all derived from the Atlanticist ideological vision.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  And it's foaming at the mouth war that we pay for. We don't even get anything.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  We should be trading with Russia like Trump goes, they've got more stuff than Africa.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  Let's roll in there and exploit it all, help them, help us.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  But they don't want trade, do they?
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  Well, exactly. NATO is portrayed as a defender of Western democratic civilization
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  against the supposedly barbaric hordes of the East.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  And I agree. What do you make of Trump then openly ridiculing NATO?
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  Because it makes sense for a businessman to look at the angles Russia is not our enemy.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  We should be involved with Russia.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  Exactly. But of course, you're not going to hear this point of view from the corporate media
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  because they're simply not interested in the facts on the ground in Montenegro,
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  but only furthering NATO propaganda about it.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  In interviews, the media is ignorant of the complexities of political scene in Montenegro
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  and takes for granted the statements of Montenegro government officials
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  known for their decades-long abuse of power, defamation of political opponents,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  and outright lies.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  What we get from the narrative is a rosy picture of Montenegro
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  welcoming NATO with open arms and bouquets of flowers,
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  whereas the majority of Montenegrins are either against NATO membership
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  or absolutely indifferent on it.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Because they know NATO brought the last three wars in the Balkans.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Well, we know because we saw the people welcoming U.S. soldiers with open arms
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, and we know how that ends.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  And the truth of the matter is that nobody in Montenegro dreams about NATO
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  since everybody knows full well that NATO bombs killed Montenegro citizens,
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  including children, junior NATO airstrikes against-
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  Let me ask you this. We're going to come back more with the brain, Daniel Estlund.
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  Every topic I bring up has got scientific info on it.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Why wouldn't the elite want to do business as a Russian
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  when they got more resources than Africa and are many times bigger than the U.S.?
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  It's crazy.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  Alex, progress and development of society is directly proportional to population density.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  So if you have progress, if you have technology, if you have development,
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  you can have more people, which means that the elite circles are going to have
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  fewer opportunities to control society.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  And that's why they're trying to dismantle the world, deindustrialize the world.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  They see humans as competition.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Exactly.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  Like they're aliens.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  What about the globalist mindset that you're an expert on with Daniel Estlund straight ahead
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  and then we're going to play a clip of anybody that doesn't want war with Russia,
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  like Rand Paul, is a Russian agent.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  And then the hell, I'm under criminal investigation.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  You're a red badge of courage.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  Although this may be CNN showing their hand.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  Yes, it was retaliation for Syria.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  The fact that Russia will not get behind the globalist regime change desired in Syria
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  to remove Assad from power.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  Funny CNN would take that angle as ISIS released a kill list on the internet with names and addresses.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  And Russia has recently had nine diplomats killed since Trump's election.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  One must ask, how can ISIS release a kill list on the internet
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  and how could people not realize there is a serious terror problem in the world
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  and tolerance, open borders and more forced regime change is not the answer.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  We need each day with our modern diets.

[2:35:37.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  Welcome to Seeker 12 by Infowars Life.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  Welcome to Seeker 12 by Infowars Life.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  Welcome to Seeker 12 by Infowars Life.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  Welcome to Seeker 12 by Infowars Life.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  Welcome to Seeker 12 by Infowars Life.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:37.960]  They're trying to start a war there, now Trump can veto it or NATO can veto it, but regardless,
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:39.200]  they want to start a war.
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:42.080]  What do you think the global order is going to do?
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.360]  Because last time we had you on a year ago, you said, well, there have been some problems,
[2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:46.840]  but they're not in crisis yet.
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:50.720]  It sounds like you're saying they're panicked, they're in crisis, they're getting, it seems
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.160]  like they're like Junkers saying we'll start a war with Europe, we'll march an EU Army
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:37:01.760]  in, we'll economically destroy the UK, they're threatening us with breaking America up.
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:05.320]  It seems like this doesn't look like what winners do, but you're the expert.
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:09.720]  So the next 13 minutes you've got the floor before you got to go, give us your presentation.
[2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:14.960]  Again, Daniel Estolin, the best-selling author of the Club Bilderberg and so many books,
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:18.800]  you can follow him, obviously at Twitter, and we'll put that up on screen for TV viewers.
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:23.000]  But Daniel, again, what other knowledge do you want to impart to folks?
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:27.640]  I think it's important to understand why these people want to start a war.
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:31.960]  World's financial system, Alex, can survive until about the end of 2017.
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:37.240]  The total collapse, the system that we know today, will come no longer than January, February
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.000]  2018.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:44.800]  Every financial instrument and mechanism available was used up to avoid the 2008 near collapse.
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:46.960]  So there's no more money in the current system.
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:50.760]  The International Monetary Fund and also the United States policy to stimulate the outflow
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:55.360]  of capital from developing countries, which includes, obviously, China and Russia, thus
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:38:02.000]  buying time for themselves, have taken out over $200 billion from Russia, manipulating
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:06.760]  their currency, devaluing the rubles through the central bank, and, of course, the director
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:11.120]  of the central bank was put there by Clinton's allies in the United States.
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:16.120]  And these are the same people who also caused the outflow of over $1 trillion from China
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:18.440]  and doing the same thing with Lijuan.
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:23.560]  In addition, they also took out between $2 and $3 trillion, which were literally stolen
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:28.760]  from the offshore accounts of the British elite via a Panama paper scandal, bringing
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:33.240]  to light the money hidden by the aristocracy, mainly English aristocracy.
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:35.200]  This in fact was the beginning of Brexit.
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:38.040]  Now, Trump has two options available to him.
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.920]  You either save the United States economy and sink the economies of the rest of the
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:45.120]  world because, again, you don't have enough money in the system to do everything, or you
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:47.760]  save the world at the expense of the United States.
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:52.080]  And according to Trump, there will be no more dollars for international investments.
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:55.040]  Only investment available will be to save the American economy.
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:00.960]  Thus, in his first speech, he explicitly talked about the need to invest in U.S. infrastructure,
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:04.960]  something that you and I talked about over a year ago, before Trump's election, before
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:06.360]  the primaries.
[2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:11.280]  We said the need for progress and development of society goes through infrastructure and
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:12.480]  space exploration.
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:17.920]  Because when we build infrastructuralics, we're actually reorganizing the physical space
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:20.720]  time of the planet, allowing our world to attain-
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:25.240]  We're taking fiat crap and actually building something and making it about human activity.
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:26.240]  That's one way of putting it.
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:30.440]  So, you know, if your system is increasingly moving to higher levels of efficiency, such
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:35.400]  as, you know, from coal-based economy to an oil-based economy to a nuclear-based economy,
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:39.040]  there'll be an increase in the productive power of human labor at every step of the
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:40.040]  way.
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:42.400]  And that's the way the actual wealth is created.
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:43.400]  That is simply the way of-
[2:39:43.400 --> 2:39:47.200]  But as you know, the globalists admit they want a post-industrial world squeezing off
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:48.200]  resources.
[2:39:48.200 --> 2:39:52.240]  That's really Trump's great sin, is he wants cheaper energy and innovation and a world
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:53.760]  based on humans.
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:57.840]  And that goes through, actually, probably one of the greatest speeches ever made by United
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.760]  States politician, in this case, Donald Trump made one of the greatest speeches ever, when
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:03.920]  he talked about the need for space exploration.
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:09.400]  And again, money has no intrinsic value, it possesses no magical powers.
[2:40:09.400 --> 2:40:11.680]  Only exploration and trailblazing.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:12.680]  Exactly.
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:13.680]  Yes, sir.
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:14.680]  God, you're amazing, Daniel.
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:15.680]  You've got to come on more often in one year.
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:17.880]  It's like hard to get you on when you're on your own fire.
[2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.680]  But so, looking at this, this is truly a cut-and-dry epic battle by the parasite forces that want
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:28.440]  a new neo-futilism serfdom, as you've exposed your Bilderberg sources, and people that aren't
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:30.920]  perfect but believe in humanity and their grandkids.
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:34.720]  And let's just say it, Trump wants to be the turnaround guy for humanity.
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:38.640]  He wants a dynasty for Kushner, who would be the first Jewish president, if that's what
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:39.640]  they're sending him up for.
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:40.640]  I don't care.
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:41.640]  He's a great guy.
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:42.640]  He's not just his own family.
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:46.720]  They're setting Kushner up to be president if he can deliver in all his roles.
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:48.600]  And the world doesn't even know what they're witnessing.
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:52.440]  Trump wants to turn it all around, change the destiny of the world.
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:53.440]  That's incredible.
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.440]  Well, Alex, exactly.
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:59.840]  You know, we are the gates of a worldwide economic default and dismantling of the capitalist
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:00.840]  system.
[2:41:00.840 --> 2:41:03.760]  And the only difference, again, going back to Hillary Clinton, is that Clinton would
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:07.640]  have pushed us into World War, which would probably have meant the end of mankind as
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:08.640]  we're doing.
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:09.640]  That was the old answer to collapse.
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:11.080]  We can't do that now.
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:13.880]  You can't do that because, you know, is a war a way to write up debt?
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:16.200]  You know, with debt, you write off responsibility.
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:20.280]  But the end result is the same, planet Earth, as we know it, ceases to exist now because
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:22.680]  Trump is a builder.
[2:41:22.680 --> 2:41:24.280]  He constructs things.
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:27.920]  So when you actually build things, you don't want to destroy it because that relents progress
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:28.920]  and development.
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:33.760]  He's a classic archetype of made the image of God, a architect, a builder.
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:34.760]  Exactly.
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:38.240]  You know, at the global level, those who supported Clinton are also inside the European
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:42.440]  Central Bank International Monetary Fund, Council of Europe, European Parliament, endless
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:45.280]  U.S. think tanks, liberal lobby groups.
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:48.440]  And in Russia, these people are represented by the United Russia.
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:51.000]  That's President Putin's party in Prime Minister Medvedevs.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:55.640]  Of course, Putin has very little to do with United Russia in the sense that his policies
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:41:59.800]  of progress and development and his own party's the enemy.
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:05.000]  It's a very complicated system because, again, Putin represents foreign policy and the national
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:09.240]  economic policy is run by the Prime Minister Medvedev, who is one of the liberal stooges
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:12.240]  representing the interests of the world elite circles.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:17.160]  You know, Putin and Medvedev are from the same political party, but they are ideological
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:18.160]  enemies.
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:22.560]  And with the exception of Putin, all leading positions within the sphere of Russian economic
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:28.200]  policy from 1992 until Trump's elections were in the hands of the neoliberals linked
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:29.720]  to the Clinton clan.
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:30.720]  And that's very important.
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:35.160]  Is it true that Putin really is a Christian now, has picked up on Alexander Shultz and
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.360]  Vincent Durgan and others, and sees the vision of humanity, having kids, defeating Satanism?
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:42.480]  I mean, is Putin really for real?
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:43.800]  Putin is for real.
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:48.520]  And the problem for the United States government, for Trump, is that Trump is not going to work
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:52.400]  with the liberal people in Russia or anywhere else for that matter, handpicked in the early
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:53.400]  1990s.
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:54.880]  So that's why they're panicking even more.
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:42:59.000]  Well, they are because, you know, in the first phone call, Trump and Putin reached an agreement.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:04.240]  The neoliberal pro-Clinton team, untouchable and unreachable, you know, to President Putin
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:08.200]  up to the election of Donald Trump, you know, to the post of the United States president,
[2:43:08.200 --> 2:43:09.760]  loses its protection.
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.840]  Until Trump's victory, any attempt to eliminate the treacherous and the traitorous neoliberals
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:19.120]  from Russia's economic posts would have been interpreted in Washington as a declaration
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:23.040]  of war against the interests of transnational elite circles.
[2:43:23.040 --> 2:43:27.560]  And the answer would have been decisive for blocking Russia's access to swift chips, to
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:30.440]  deeper sanctions and a full-fledged economic embargo.
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:33.960]  We have avoided that for Donald Trump's presidency.
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:38.920]  Now we just need to see how Trump and Putin can work together to defeat these neoliberal
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:40.480]  world elite circles.
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:42.920]  Who are anti-human fundamentally?
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:47.000]  And again, if I was Trump, I would have met with him, you know, five or six leaders.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:51.720]  I know he's meeting with China first, coming up in the next few days, but Putin said, hey,
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:52.720]  I want to meet.
[2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:54.640]  He actually came out and said, look, nothing enough.
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:58.040]  They should come out, have big meetings, talk about stuff, and break it.
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:02.360]  Because I know Trump's advisers are saying, oh, it looks too bad to be with the Russians.
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:04.120]  That's how they paralyze everybody.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:06.520]  Like the president's not supposed to talk to the Russian.
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:07.520]  He's our president.
[2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:09.080]  He's supposed to talk to whoever he wants.
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:14.280]  This idea by these little pieces of crap like Schiff in the Congress, that everybody
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:17.200]  that, you know, they don't want to have war with Russia is a Russian agent.
[2:44:17.200 --> 2:44:21.760]  When Russia isn't expanding, it's just, it's absolutely outrageous.
[2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:29.400]  Alex, you know, the transnational elite circles, they have lost their power base and are left
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:31.960]  out of access to the United States money and economic.
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:32.960]  No, I agree.
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:33.960]  They're panicking.
[2:44:33.960 --> 2:44:34.960]  So they're trying to fight back.
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:38.720]  They're openly saying kill Trump, saying have COG overthrows.
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:40.000]  Why is Trump letting them do that?
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  Are they that weak?
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  It doesn't matter.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  Or what's happening?
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:48.720]  Um, I don't know, but I can tell you from, from Russian history that it took president
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:53.920]  Putin two presidencies to actually get control of all the circles of power within the Russian
[2:44:53.920 --> 2:44:54.920]  government.
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.320]  And of course, in the United States, you're seeing the same thing on these people.
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:01.480]  They will do everything possible to recover the power they lost, making use of wide range
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:04.560]  of hybrid, irregular methodologies from mega terrorists.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:05.560]  Yeah.
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:06.560]  Deep state.
[2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:07.560]  People ignoring.
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:08.560]  Well, that's why you've been free.
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:09.560]  Zachariah.
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:10.560]  A Bilderberg guy says Trump's most powerful.
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:13.720]  I mean, uh, uh, uh, Putin's the most powerful leader in the world, not that Russia is even
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:14.720]  that powerful.
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:17.080]  Now economically, you know, economically, it's like Italy.
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:21.080]  It's because he actually is in power, which we're not pushing dictatorship, but instead
[2:45:21.080 --> 2:45:24.680]  of globalist manipulation, it's a guy for Russia in charge.
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:27.680]  And that's why he's so hard to deal with it because finally a country's actually in
[2:45:27.680 --> 2:45:28.680]  charge of itself.
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:32.680]  Well, look what they're doing all over the world in Western Europe, assassination, assassination
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:37.400]  of politicians, Russian ambassador hundreds of top Russians killed 30 or 40 very, very
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:38.400]  top ones.
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:39.400]  What do you make of that?
[2:45:39.400 --> 2:45:43.800]  Part of the part, you know, part parcel of what we're talking about civil society breakdown,
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:48.760]  civil disobedience, United based or Europe, Russia thus far has been able to avoid that.
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:52.320]  You know, to using refugees as a weapon of destabilization and terrorism.
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:56.920]  Of course, look at the refugee crisis in Europe, 60 million displaced, of which five
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.440]  million are from Syria alone.
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:04.240]  And you said an end game in, in 2007, 10 years ago, they would use refugees as weapons.
[2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:05.920]  God knows you had sources inside.
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:07.080]  They've been playing this forever.
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:10.680]  Well, Bilderberg has been planning the things, you know, they, they planned generations ahead.
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:15.120]  And in Germany today, more than 200 cities have shelters for refugees.
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:19.560]  Many of them living in slums in the ghettos, segregated from the rest of the population.
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:20.560]  The tensions are palpable.
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:25.320]  And it's only a matter of time, Alex, before an explosion and social breakdown occurs in
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:27.120]  Germany, in Italy, in Holland.
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:28.120]  And that's how you started.
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:33.040]  What are they planning to do after the social breakdown happens that the media is hyping?
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:38.440]  Well, the next step is war is just a matter of time before cooler heads will not prevail.
[2:46:38.440 --> 2:46:42.600]  For now, we're ahead of the game, let's just see if Putin and Trump can actually get together
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.200]  sooner than later and see if we can have a common plan to work.
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:47.200]  Sure.
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:49.960]  So it's not that Putin and Trump are even perfect, they just don't want to have World
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:50.960]  War.
[2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:51.960]  They love their families.
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:53.920]  They're just not completely insane.
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:58.000]  David Rockefeller, the omnibudsman of the globalist, the founder of Bilderberg.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.920]  I know you said four or five years ago, he wasn't really running things anymore.
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:03.160]  101 dies two weeks ago.
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:04.800]  Another bellwether of this.
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:05.920]  Talk about David Rockefeller.
[2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:09.640]  And then who from your research do you think is the leader of the new world order?
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:11.080]  Or are they still contending?
[2:47:11.080 --> 2:47:14.600]  Alex, it's I think it's very important also to understand that when you're talking about
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:20.560]  these these elite circles, who's actually running the system, Donald Trump, and I'm
[2:47:20.560 --> 2:47:23.640]  going to get to Rockefeller in a second, represents, you know, the latest and the most
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:28.200]  desperate attempt by one of the one part of the world's elite circles to survive this
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:31.880]  economic Armageddon that is upon us.
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:35.560]  Trump versus Clinton was the fight between the representatives of the two of the world's
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:40.200]  supernational power structures, the Rothschilds behind Trump against the Rockefellers behind
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:41.200]  the Clinton.
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.960]  That said, none of the Rockefeller family, not the Rothschild family, represent true
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:49.720]  power above them, you know, above the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, we have the Astors, the
[2:47:49.720 --> 2:47:54.200]  Lodges, the Flemmings, the Grosvenors, the Mathesons, the Keswick's, whose fortunes are
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:57.200]  measured and counted in trillions of dollars.
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.640]  Trump represents a change in the paradigm of society as we have never seen in the history
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:02.880]  of humanity.
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:07.040]  The way things stand right now, Alex, capitalism is dead because capitalism needs perpetual
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:09.160]  markets in a way of expansion.
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:10.840]  And the elite circles have a problem.
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:15.920]  They urgently need to find a system that could replace the no longer functioning capitalist
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:16.920]  system.
[2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:21.640]  And the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House is the first step towards a new world.
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:25.960]  Not a new world order, but rather a new world struggling to be born, unsure of a true world.
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:31.600]  You're saying Rothschilds are backing Trump versus the eugenics-based Rockefellers?
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:32.960]  Exactly.
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:34.400]  If again, if you kind of look at the people-
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:38.280]  I got told that my CA sources three years ago, they said, oh, you're backing the Rothschilds.
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:39.280]  Watch what they're about to do.
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:41.640]  They're going to try to actually give wealth back to the people.
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:42.640]  Not because they're even good.
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:44.640]  They don't want a total world by bloodbath.
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:48.120]  It's just that this time their interests coincide with our interests.
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:52.040]  Because again, behind Clinton, you have the Rockefellers, the transnational bankers, which
[2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:58.200]  is the world company limited, the globalist non-American, you know, or American power
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:03.040]  elite circles, George Soros, Hollywood, et cetera, against the people-
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:06.400]  So are you saying this is a Rockefeller elite trying to bring down Trump?
[2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:08.320]  Well, the people above Rockefeller level.
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:14.200]  And then the people backing Donald Trump are the non-American finance CS circles centered
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:18.800]  in the city of London, Hong Kong, world-centered, almighty laundering, drugs, intelligence,
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:23.480]  and British control, leftover elite circles of the British Empire, the Rothschilds, European
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:29.720]  elite represented by the old European aristocracies, such as the houses of Sage Coburg, Austro-Hungarian
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:34.320]  aristocracy, and also Ottoman nobility, as well as the Venetian Black nobility.
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.800]  And then on a smaller scale, you have the intelligence agencies, so on and so forth.
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:42.440]  But again, these are big groups of people, very powerful individuals historically.
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:47.360]  Was it fair to say most U.S. intelligence, for what I research, is for Trump?
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:51.560]  Most U.S. intelligence, except for the DEA, NSA, and the CIA.
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:55.720]  All right, well, it's a crazy time to be alive, Daniel, we've got 50 seconds left.
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:49:57.220]  What else do you want to add?
[2:49:57.220 --> 2:50:03.000]  I think, again, be vigilant, be intelligent, don't follow the propaganda techniques, analyze,
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:04.240]  and also ask the right questions.
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:05.240]  Why is this being done?
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:08.280]  Who's going to win and who's going to benefit when all is said and done?
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:11.600]  All right, and again, on Twitter, what's the best place for people to get in touch with
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  you?
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:14.320]  At Estwell and Daniel, that's my Twitter account.
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:19.320]  And again, Alex, congratulations on a very important international, very prestigious
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:23.160]  journalistic award in Mexico, I also want an award for my documentary film.
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:26.160]  I know I got the Big Press Club Award, one of the biggest groups in Latin America, I'm
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:27.160]  very honored.
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:28.960]  I wish I could have gone, but there was death threats, so I couldn't.
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.320]  I want to thank them, though, for their great work.
[2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:31.320]  Thank you, Daniel.
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:32.320]  Thank you so much, sir.
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.320]  I'm going to come back with some final comments straight ahead.
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:36.680]  You know, there's our award for the operation, all the great crew.
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:40.760]  When we come back, we're going to hit some other news I haven't covered yet, then we've

[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:16.440]  when you're flying.
[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:20.520]  That's insane in the day because Islamists might put bombs on them, but we don't want
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:26.240]  to ban the Islamists coming in like the photos we have out of Russia, the main suspect going
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:31.720]  and leaving a suitcase on board the vehicle.
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:37.320]  And from LA to New York, people are fleeing the leftist command bases.
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:40.560]  People are fleeing New York at an alarming rate in New York Post.
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:46.960]  They're leaving these heavenly places, but then the folks that are fleeing, they come
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:51.760]  to other freer areas and then demand that we adopt those very cultures.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.400]  We adopt those very, very systems.
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:54:59.280]  It's frustrating.
[2:54:59.280 --> 2:55:03.560]  But it's good people sitting down and laying down and taking all this that allows all this
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:04.560]  to happen.
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:09.040]  You know, I've got a stack of news here I didn't even hit.
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:14.880]  Dealing with Trump says national security aides are completing a North Korean review.
[2:55:14.880 --> 2:55:19.360]  And the Trump says he wants to fix the North Korean problem.
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:23.920]  And people make a joke that after 55 years, since the North Korean ceasefire, we're still
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:29.720]  at war with North Korea, that he's a bad guy, but the problem can't be fixed.
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:35.000]  I love the people that couldn't fix the problem for almost 60 years, saying Trump's wrong
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  for wanting to fix it.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:37.480]  Don't you love that?
[2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:41.240]  These pessimists, these losers.
[2:55:41.240 --> 2:55:45.520]  But on top of that, U.S. warrants China, its patients is running out, his North Korea
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.080]  aggression continues.
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:51.640]  That's up on info wars.com from the Daily Caller.
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:57.720]  Defense sec matters on Korea's reckless actions must be stopped.
[2:55:57.720 --> 2:55:58.960]  That's the real issues going on.
[2:55:58.960 --> 2:56:01.680]  Meanwhile, look at these reports.
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.680]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:10.080]  Cyborgs at work employees getting implanted with microchips all over Europe, all over
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:12.600]  America.
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:13.600]  It's here.
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:22.640]  And then another one, military.com, super seals, elite units pursue brain-stimulating
[2:56:22.640 --> 2:56:25.600]  technologies, microchips.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:29.320]  The globalist want control of humans, they want robots to replace us.
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:35.600]  It's not that technology's bad, it's that there's Trojan horses, you know.
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:40.280]  Not a very good Trojan horse, but there it is.
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:47.800]  It's crapping on us, dropping little Hillary balls on us.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:51.320]  There's other stories that Daily Mail are aliens trying to contact Earth, mysterious
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:55.640]  energy signals are coming from space, confirmed scientists, you know, who knows what's going
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:56.640]  on.
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:57:00.840]  Let's just say this, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:05.760]  And the most important thing we can do is be conscious of what's happening and think
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:09.600]  about what's happening and then spread the word about sources of news and information
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:14.040]  you found to be accurate, like infowars.com.
[2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:17.120]  Because metaphysically, when you spread videos, when you spread articles to people you know
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:22.000]  or people you don't know on your Twitter, your Facebook, your email, or personally work
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:25.800]  telling people, hey, look at this, that breaks the back of the globalist that want to direct
[2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:26.800]  what you're doing.
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:30.440]  We've already beaten them so bad with Trump and with other nationalist movements.
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:32.800]  We're in crisis, but the war is now.
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:36.760]  They're trying to shut off our deep earth crystal iodine pure source that nobody else
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:37.760]  has.
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:38.760]  Well, guess what?
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:40.440]  We got stuff we bought a year ago, we're about to run out of it.
[2:57:40.440 --> 2:57:44.280]  You know, this is the crystals being manufactured into the palm oil right now.

[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:01.120]  till we sell out of that batch and then I'm going to do full price on the last batch and
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.040]  that may be it, may go back to seaweed, but I got a feeling we'll be able to find the
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:06.040]  sources.
[2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:13.800]  Can't beat it at $20 and 96 cents a bottle, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple

[2:58:44.440 --> 2:58:45.440]  We need you.
[2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:46.440]  You're the resistance.
[2:58:46.440 --> 2:58:58.360]  Info Wars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state of the art
[2:58:58.360 --> 2:58:59.360]  line of advanced, highly tested body armor from infowarsstore.com.
[2:58:59.360 --> 2:59:02.000]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.720]  piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[2:59:04.720 --> 2:59:09.840]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary process and technology that disperses more
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.320]  kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:19.560]  synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
[2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:22.480]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:26.520]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:28.440]  of advanced lightweight armor.
[2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:29.520]  It works.
[2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:33.080]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:37.960]  ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[2:59:37.960 --> 2:59:42.720]  Defender Body Armor is now available through infowarsstore.com so you can defend yourself,
[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:47.760]  your family, and finance the info war against the globalist all at the same time, a total
[2:59:47.760 --> 2:59:52.680]  360 win.
[2:59:52.680 --> 3:00:00.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.720 --> 3:00:05.080]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity, but the truth is whether it's Obama
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:08.560]  or George Soros, they're losers.
[3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:12.680]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us failed.
[3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:18.240]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war.
[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:22.520]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls and our minds.
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:24.800]  We have to be good.
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:25.800]  We have to be pure.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:26.800]  We have to be strong.
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:30.400]  We have to build prosperity and we have to bring every one of every race, color, and
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:35.640]  creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:39.000]  fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:47.880]  Yes, we've won the first face, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun, but
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:56.880]  Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:01:11.960]  This is the heart of 1776, you're a white male.
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:16.760]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:21.320]  Move, bitch, get out of the way.
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:27.320]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:31.760]  Info warriors helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.240]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:41.040]  I will not let you down, you'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking
[3:01:41.040 --> 3:01:42.040]  a lot.
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:43.760]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:49.360]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:55.760]  It's a raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:01:56.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:01:56.960 --> 3:02:01.920]  I'm David Knight for this fourth hour, April 3rd, 2017, and we just had that Marvel intro,
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:02.920]  and I thought it was interesting.
[3:02:02.920 --> 3:02:08.720]  The story that was, I believe it was on Dredge Report, it's from The Guardian.
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:13.160]  Marvel executives say the emphasis on diversity may have alienated readers.
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:18.560]  You don't know what you think, you think we haven't had enough of the PC narrative being
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:22.320]  shoved down our throat, said people have had enough of new female and ethnic minority characters.
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:23.520]  Let me give you an example here.
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:28.920]  They said they've changed thores, had a sex change, now we have a female thore.
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:32.920]  We now have a black teenager who took over as Iron Man, I guess what you call him, Iron
[3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:39.640]  Teenager, a biracial Spider-Man, and a teenage Muslim girl who is now Ms. Marvel.
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:42.280]  And as a result, there are falling comic sales.
[3:02:42.280 --> 3:02:44.840]  See, millennials don't even want this.
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:49.720]  This is, I don't read comics, of course, even, but their audience, their younger audience
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:52.640]  is not even buying this stuff.
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:58.880]  They would like to see some intelligent story lines instead of just pandering to this political
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:02:59.880]  correctness.
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:03.880]  You know, an example of this is what just happened in Montana.
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:12.280]  We had Montana Democrats vote against a bill that would ban the use of foreign law in the
[3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:13.280]  state.
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:16.080]  Well, we think you're talking about sharia law, and we wouldn't want to ban sharia law
[3:03:16.080 --> 3:03:20.880]  because let's accept it in the name of political correctness and multiculturalism.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:24.920]  So Democrats in Montana have opposed a bill, this is Breitbart, banning the use of foreign
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:27.640]  law in the state courts and the grounds that it could target Muslims.
[3:03:27.640 --> 3:03:31.440]  I mean, we wouldn't do something that would, anybody would think that we're politically
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:32.440]  incorrect.
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:36.880]  It bans the application of foreign law in Montana's courts, and it focused on sharia
[3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:42.280]  law for a good reason, because as you'll see here in just a moment, sharia law is being
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:44.440]  put on us in a multitude of ways.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:45.840]  It is not a fantasy, folks.
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:50.800]  Now this bill passed on party lines 56 to 44, the Republicans passed it, but it now has
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:56.080]  to be sent on to a Democrat governor who will either sign it or veto it.
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:57.520]  What do you think he's going to do?
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:00.480]  Will they have the votes to override what you know he's going to do?
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:03.200]  Now, this is what one of the Democrats said.
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:06.640]  The courts have said that laws that single out certain religions violate the First Amendment.
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:13.360]  Well, of course, but it doesn't say that ruling, that shutting out foreign law violates the
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:15.080]  Constitution or the First Amendment.
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:17.880]  They said this was peppered with anti-Muslim bigotry.
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:21.680]  Another Democrat representative, Laurie Bishop, said, our children are watching.
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:25.560]  Yeah, your children will be living under sharia law if you don't do something about it.
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:31.560]  And let's understand, as a Republican from Missoula said, he said the bill was an attempt
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:35.520]  to push back against a constitution that is constantly under assault.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:40.240]  Let me explain to you, this happened long before sharia even came on the scene.
[3:04:40.240 --> 3:04:45.400]  You've had Justice Kennedy, who has been considered to be the swing vote on the Supreme Court,
[3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:50.560]  because he likes to constantly read foreign law into our Constitution, into our body
[3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:51.560]  of law.
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:52.720]  We'll talk about this more on the other side.
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:05:00.240]  Stay with us.
[3:05:00.240 --> 3:05:08.320]  On Friday, Ron moved forward his plans to implement a Chicago only ID card specifically
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:12.000]  for non-citizens that will ensure they can get access to welfare.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.200]  Part of this plan is also allowing non-citizens to get these IDs from the city without leaving
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:20.040]  any trace behind at the office to avoid federal interference.
[3:05:20.040 --> 3:05:24.440]  But while Ron was out fighting for the rights of non-citizens, his city is in disarray.
[3:05:24.440 --> 3:05:29.760]  So far this year, 700 people have been shot in Chicago, 130 of them have been shot and
[3:05:29.760 --> 3:05:33.840]  killed, including 48 children killed in February alone.
[3:05:33.840 --> 3:05:38.760]  It's gotten so bad in some areas, Chicago activist Tio Hardiman said, young people in
[3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:43.400]  south and west Chicago need to be equipped with helmets and bulletproof vests.
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:47.880]  But don't tell that to the mayor of non-citizens Rahm Emanuel, he's busy trying to take care
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:49.880]  of people from other countries.
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:52.400]  Chicago, you don't have a mayor.
[3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:55.440]  I suggest you try electing one in 2019.
[3:05:55.440 --> 3:06:02.440]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:06:55.440 --> 3:07:02.440]  and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[3:07:55.440 --> 3:08:02.440]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[3:08:25.440 --> 3:08:39.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, April 3rd, 2017.
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:40.920]  I'm David Knight.
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:47.960]  We were just talking about Marvel, marveling at the fact that their comic sales are collapsing
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:49.600]  on their new characters.
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:55.360]  And as we look at this and we look at the moves and Montana, by the Democrats to say
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:00.040]  let's not have a bill that would say that we have to stick to the Constitution and to
[3:09:00.040 --> 3:09:01.040]  domestic law.
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:03.160]  This is a bill that says we're not going to have foreign law.
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:05.040]  We're not going to live under foreign law.
[3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:08.800]  They said, no, that sounds to me like you're trying to single out Schreer law.
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:11.360]  And it's like, well, Schreer law would be included in that specifically.
[3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:14.360]  And there's good reasons for that.
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:20.640]  As they point out, these are the people, the Democrats went along party lines, Democrats
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:26.200]  opposed to supporting the Constitution and banning the use of foreign law.
[3:09:26.200 --> 3:09:30.000]  And Republicans saying, no, we have seen a Constitution that is constantly under assault.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:33.560]  And as I said before, we went to the break in the last segment.
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:36.800]  It's been under assault, not just from Schreer law.
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:41.480]  Anthony Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice, has been called the swing justice.
[3:09:41.480 --> 3:09:43.480]  This is a guy who was appointed by Ronald Reagan.
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:49.200]  He's been called the swing justice because he loves to interject foreign law into his
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:50.800]  decisions.
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:53.360]  Now when you do that, makes you very unpredictable, doesn't it?
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:55.720]  Also makes you very unconstitutional.
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:09:58.840]  The Constitution is what constitutes our government.
[3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:00.800]  It's the basis for what we do here.
[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:02.760]  It's what they swear allegiance to.
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:04.840]  They don't swear allegiance to French law.
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:06.960]  They don't swear allegiance to Schreer law.
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:10.400]  They swear allegiance to the US Constitution.
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:14.920]  And then they go in and pull these other issues into it.
[3:10:14.920 --> 3:10:17.560]  And so when we look at that, we understand this is something that's been going on a very
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:19.360]  long time in our country.
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:23.120]  It's one of the reasons why we don't have a Constitution anymore except in name only.
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:27.880]  It's simply, it's just a dead letter if you understand what's in the Constitution.
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:32.040]  But now this is going to go before the Democrat in Montana.
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:36.360]  We'll see whether that gets vetoed or whether it gets passed along.
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:42.320]  And before we leave the Supreme Court, we just had the Senate committee move Neil Gorsuch
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:45.080]  to a full vote before the Senate.
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:50.280]  It went along partisan lines 11 to 9 because they have decided that they're going to do
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:52.200]  everything along partisan lines.
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:54.280]  It illustrates another thing though, I think that's very important.
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:10:59.000]  And we had a lot of discussion about this bill that was put forward by Paul Ryan that
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:00.320]  Donald Trump signed on to.
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:04.280]  And I had a lot of people when I said this is a bad bill that should never have been
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:06.480]  put forward because it doesn't have repeal in it.
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:10.440]  A lot of people said, well, you gotta understand they couldn't get this through the Senate because
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:11.440]  they need to have 60 votes.
[3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:13.080]  And I said, no, that's not true.
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:17.760]  They can do anything in a nuclear option just as you're going to see with Neil Gorsuch.
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:19.840]  And I said that a week or two ago.
[3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:23.640]  I said, they're going to not be able to get past the filibuster.
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:26.560]  And so they're going to go nuclear on it.
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:30.760]  And they're going to say, we're going to be able to shut this down and have a vote.
[3:11:30.760 --> 3:11:34.920]  And we're going to have a straight up vote, 51 votes will decide.
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:36.880]  And that's what they're going to do with Neil Gorsuch.
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.360]  That's what they could have done with an Obama repeal bill.
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:42.280]  And the Republicans have the votes.
[3:11:42.280 --> 3:11:46.440]  They have seen the Republicans leading us along every election telling us that they're going
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:47.440]  to repeal Obamacare.
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:49.280]  And they consistently refuse to do it.
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:53.640]  They always come up with an excuse, even when they have control of the House, the Senate
[3:11:53.640 --> 3:11:54.640]  and the presidency.
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:11:57.600]  They come up with an excuse as to why they don't want to do it.
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:03.160]  And you've got to understand that it is the establishment in both parties, both Republicans
[3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:05.600]  and Democrats who want Obamacare.
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:07.640]  And now we've got people within the Trump administration as well.
[3:12:07.640 --> 3:12:11.400]  We had Jared Kushner bring in Zeke Emmanuel, the architect of Obamacare.
[3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:14.680]  And he'd been talking about it back to the beginning of January, saying, hey, they're
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:16.880]  not going to be able to get rid of it.
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:18.480]  At best, they're going to be able to change it.
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:20.080]  Maybe we can work with them and do that.
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:24.800]  And so Kushner brought him in for three meetings with senior policy advisors at the White House
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:28.280]  and a meeting with Donald Trump to tell him how important it was to keep Obamacare.
[3:12:28.280 --> 3:12:29.280]  This is the architect.
[3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:32.120]  This is the brother of Rom Emanuel.
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:34.680]  So we have a lot of issues here.
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:36.560]  It's not the freedom caucus.
[3:12:36.560 --> 3:12:41.200]  The freedom caucus are the people who stood by Donald Trump when Paul Ryan and the GOP
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:42.880]  establishment threw him under the bus.
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:48.880]  Remember when you had the tape that came out about a month before the election?
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:51.680]  Grab them by the whatever, okay?
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:12:54.160]  And Paul Ryan was telling everybody, save yourself.
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:12:55.160]  Leave him alone.
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:56.160]  He's going to fail.
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:00.200]  And the House freedom caucus stuck by him.
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:05.120]  So we need to understand what caused Donald Trump to win.
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:06.120]  We want repeal.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:09.560]  We want repeal of the structure that is in place.
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:14.360]  And that means that you take out these dictatorial powers that were given to health and human
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:17.000]  services to that secretary.
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.800]  And even though we've got somebody in there now that was appointed by Donald Trump, if
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:25.200]  you use those powers to try to fix Obamacare, you are going to be essentially doing what
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:27.120]  Boromir tried to do in Lord of the Rings.
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:28.120]  Remember the Ring of Power?
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:33.040]  If I just use this for good, now if you use it for good, it will turn into a power in
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:34.040]  and of itself.
[3:13:34.040 --> 3:13:38.800]  It will not only corrupt your power, but it will be there as a mechanism for somebody
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:40.280]  else to reinstate that.
[3:13:40.280 --> 3:13:44.240]  When we go back and we look at how Marvel is pushing this down people's throats.
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:50.840]  And again, they're saying, we're seeing our comic book sales on these new diverse characters
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:52.320]  have alienated readers.
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:53.800]  People say they've had enough of this.
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:54.800]  And what have they done?
[3:13:54.800 --> 3:13:56.160]  Well, they've turned Thor into a female.
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:02.080]  They've turned Iron Man into a black teenager, Spider-Man into a biracial teenager.
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:03.920]  Ms. Marvel is now a Muslim teenager.
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:08.320]  You can't get the idea there's certain people that they don't like, like white men.
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:13.720]  And they go on to say, what we saw in sales was that any character that was diverse, any
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:16.400]  character that was new, are female characters.
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:20.000]  Anything that was not a core Marvel character, people were turning their nose up.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:21.240]  But then they were defiant about that.
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:25.080]  They said, but let me be clear, our heroes are not going anywhere.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:26.080]  Our new heroes.
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:27.080]  Yeah.
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:28.080]  Well, you know what?
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:29.080]  That is literally true.
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:30.080]  They're not going anywhere.
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:33.440]  And your sales aren't going anywhere except down because we don't like to have this stuff
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:34.440]  jammed down our throat.
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:39.040]  At the end of the week last week, it was a very shameful moment of cowardice in North
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:40.440]  Carolina in the legislature.
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:46.720]  And of course, they had the HB2, the trans bathroom bill that had come up.
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:49.120]  And of course, that was in reaction.
[3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:52.680]  And I think that there was some issues with the way that bill was written.
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:56.440]  I would like to see the state government say, hey, we're going to get the government out
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:14:57.920]  of bathrooms completely.
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:15:02.400]  We're going to let you decide how you're going to do the bathrooms in your particular
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:05.960]  business in your private property, in your church or whatever.
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:12.720]  We're going to not dictate that to you either from a tranny agenda or from a conservative
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:13.720]  agenda.
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:15.280]  We're not going to dictate your bathrooms to you.
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:16.280]  How about that?
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:17.720]  How about having some freedom in that?
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:21.480]  But instead, they came up with HB2 because they were concerned it was in Charlotte.
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:29.280]  They had a person there who was a man who was wearing women's dresses who had been convicted
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:32.120]  as a sexual offender who ran this thing through in Charlotte.
[3:15:32.120 --> 3:15:33.800]  And they said, we're not going to do that.
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:36.520]  We had all these different institutions come in and bully them.
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:40.920]  But the one that broke their back was the NCAA.
[3:15:40.920 --> 3:15:44.800]  And the NCAA, this was reported by the Washington Post, they said the most recent threat came
[3:15:44.800 --> 3:15:45.800]  from the NCAA.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:50.840]  It gave lawmakers until last Thursday to change the law if North Carolina was to host any
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:56.200]  college sports championships through 2022.
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:15:59.760]  And they said that ultimatum loomed large over the debate Thursday as some legislators
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:02.720]  criticized the Collegiate Association.
[3:16:02.720 --> 3:16:03.720]  Why not?
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:08.920]  Because these are people who not only live off of the taxpayer, but they don't pay any
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:10.920]  taxes themselves.
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:12.400]  What does the NCAA do?
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:19.560]  Well, the NCAA uses these universities, which are taxpayer supported in stadiums that are
[3:16:19.560 --> 3:16:24.200]  paid for by the taxpayers, but they aren't taxpayers themselves, just like the NFL as
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  a taxpayer.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:30.840]  Taxpayers get hit with a bill to bill stadiums for these multi-billionaires, and they don't
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:31.840]  pay taxes.
[3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:33.240]  The NFL doesn't pay taxes.
[3:16:33.240 --> 3:16:38.960]  Going back to an article back in 2015, it was on April 15, 2015, the Washington Post
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:43.320]  pointed out that, hey, it may be tax day for you, but it isn't tax day for these sports
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:44.320]  organizations.
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:46.640]  The NFL takes in $327 million.
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:49.280]  They pay their commissioner $44 million.
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:52.840]  They pay 297 other employees at least $100,000.
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:55.600]  They pay no taxes, NCAA.
[3:16:55.600 --> 3:16:59.040]  They take in $874 million.
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:01.440]  Their president makes $1.7 million.
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:09.880]  They have 87 employees who make at least $100,000, but they come in to the state of North Carolina,
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:14.480]  and they say, you better get this fixed, and you better fix it by Thursday, or we're going
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:21.920]  to shut down all championship games until 2022, and they said, yes, sir, yes, sir, and
[3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:22.920]  they got it fixed.
[3:17:22.920 --> 3:17:23.920]  They got it fixed on Thursday.
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:28.440]  In a way, what they did was they said, we're going to shut this down, and we're not going
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:33.480]  to let any new laws happen for the next four years, and people on both sides were furious
[3:17:33.480 --> 3:17:34.480]  with them.
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:39.080]  Because it was clear what they were doing, they were simply pandering to this organization
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:46.080]  that lives off of taxes, pays no taxes because they have tax exempt status, their 501c corporation.
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:48.360]  Why are they involved in political lobbying?
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:53.920]  Clearly, they have an agenda just like Marvel Studios does, not Marvel, but Marvel Comics.
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:58.080]  Marvel Studio hasn't got into that yet, but they clearly have an agenda just like those
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:02.960]  people do, just like Disney does, and they're allowed to continue to do that.
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:05.960]  It's absolutely amazing that this would continue on.
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:08.800]  Now, let's go back to the Sharia law that was in Montana.
[3:18:08.800 --> 3:18:12.520]  The Democrats say, we're not going to support a bill that says you're not going to be able
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:18.680]  to use foreign law in Montana because it might be used to stop Sharia law.
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.120]  Well, do you think it might be a good idea to stop Sharia law?
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:24.000]  Do you really want to live under that?
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:28.400]  I mean, that is how insane these people are when they make political correctness their
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:30.080]  God.
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:36.040]  We have Facebook now has decided that they're going to count how to the Pakistani government,
[3:18:36.040 --> 3:18:40.880]  they're going to block what is considered to be blasphemous content.
[3:18:40.880 --> 3:18:42.880]  Here's what Sharia law looks like, folks.
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:46.720]  85% of anti-Muslim posts have already been removed.
[3:18:46.720 --> 3:18:50.640]  And they say that this is just the first Islamic country that's going to make the demand.
[3:18:50.640 --> 3:18:56.920]  They're working, Pakistan is, with 27 other Muslim countries to make similar demands.
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:19:01.680]  And they have arrested and they're prosecuting people for posting this blasphemous content
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:04.120]  that Facebook is being a snitch to.
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:08.440]  As one of the individuals talking about it, David Wood of answering Islam.org says he
[3:19:08.440 --> 3:19:12.720]  thinks the next step by Facebook management will be turn over the identities of those
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:15.240]  who are charged with blasphemy offenses in Pakistan.
[3:19:15.240 --> 3:19:19.360]  So they're going to rat people out and they're going to censor it for Sharia law.
[3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:23.520]  And what do they do to people that have blasphemous content?
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:24.960]  That's a death penalty.
[3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:28.160]  I mean, we're talking as serious as it gets here, folks.
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:32.400]  And so here you have the Democrats who say, I can never support the death penalty under
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:33.400]  any circumstances.
[3:19:33.400 --> 3:19:34.400]  And I agree with him.
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:38.200]  In principle, I support the death penalty, but I don't think we have an honest enough
[3:19:38.200 --> 3:19:40.280]  judicial system to apply it.
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:42.400]  But they say we're going to oppose the death penalty.
[3:19:42.400 --> 3:19:43.600]  We're going to oppose foreign law.
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:48.760]  And yet they do it because they don't want to oppose Sharia law, where people in Pakistan
[3:19:48.760 --> 3:19:51.960]  are going to get the death penalty because they're rat it out by Facebook.
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:59.880]  Stay with us to be right back.
[3:19:59.880 --> 3:20:04.080]  They say you can't take on the man and win that one small company doesn't stand a chance
[3:20:04.080 --> 3:20:07.400]  against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[3:20:07.400 --> 3:20:09.360]  But they don't know Harry's.
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:10.800]  How's Harry's done it?
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:11.800]  Simple.
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:14.600]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:17.120]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[3:20:17.120 --> 3:20:20.560]  They ship directly from their site to you and do it for a lot less.
[3:20:20.560 --> 3:20:25.160]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings directly back to
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:26.160]  you.

[3:23:22.680 --> 3:23:24.240]  and natural soaps.
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:26.320]  Your family deserves the best.
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:28.640]  Happiness is 5starsoap.com.
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:31.440]  Why not put your money up the drain for a change?

[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:42.120]  Calben Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned
[3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:47.440]  real soaps that are triple concentrated, soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils.
[3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:57.440]  See their full selection of soaps at 5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[3:07:36.300 --> 3:24:32.840]  the bubble gum flavor.
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:38.960]  The new flavor has just arrived at infowarstore.com and of course still has the iodine, the nano-silver,
[3:24:38.960 --> 3:24:43.600]  the things that are going to kill the bacteria in your mouth that create gum disease.
[3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:47.480]  But for some of the people, especially the children, who said, well, we don't like the
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:53.520]  strong peppermint oil taste, which I really do love, I tell you, I can taste a big difference.
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:57.200]  And it's a big difference in the way my mouth feels in the morning after I've brushed with
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:24:58.200]  a different toothpaste.
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:02.240]  I had to go back to an older toothpaste because it was out of stock for a while.
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:06.360]  And I could tell such a big difference in a bad way when I use the old toothpaste than
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:07.840]  it was when I used Super Blue.
[3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:12.000]  When I used Super Blue, I'd wake up in the morning and my mouth would still taste fresh,
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:15.160]  not the way it does with the other toothpaste that I went back to.
[3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:21.120]  So now we have it in a format that is going to be a little bit easier for children to
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:22.120]  access.
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:24.000]  Or maybe you didn't like the peppermint flavor.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:29.080]  We now have it in two flavors, but still with the same active ingredients, iodine and nano-silver
[3:25:29.080 --> 3:25:32.840]  that are going to kill the bacteria that create gum disease.
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:37.440]  The gum disease that causes you to lose your teeth, but also causes you to have heart disease.
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:41.560]  Those are both very well-known side effects of gum disease.
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:46.600]  So we have, and this is going to be ending soon, our 30% off survival shield X2 nascent
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:25:47.600]  iodine.
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:52.400]  Remember we went to a deep earth source about four years ago.
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:54.840]  And now we're facing a big threat to our supply.
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:58.960]  So it's going to be something that we used to, could just go in, as Alex pointed out.
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:02.440]  We used to be able to get just about a month supply or so of production, but now we're
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:08.040]  being told that we have to buy a massive amount or simply stop selling the true deep earth
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:09.040]  iodine.
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:17.120]  So we have that now on sale at 30% off that it will be ending soon at infowarslife.com.
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:21.840]  Going back to what we were talking about in terms of Sharia law and the Democrats pushing
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:26.160]  back against it in Montana, there have been a number of states where they have expressly
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:29.480]  said we're not going to be put under a foreign system of law.
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:33.000]  We've worked hard to establish this system of law.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:35.640]  It is not anything that we need to apologize for.
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:39.400]  As a matter of fact, it's far better than any other system, it's not perfect.
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:43.480]  No system of law, no constitution is perfect, but we need to get back to our constitution,
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:46.040]  not continue to turn to foreign law.
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:52.800]  And as we're talking about with Facebook, they're blocking blasphemous content in Pakistan.
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:26:55.640]  This is what Sharia law looks like, folks.
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:27:00.960]  Censorship, death penalty for people who don't push their religion.
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:03.080]  We do not want that here in America.
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:06.640]  They've actually got a team, sounds kind of like what the Democrats want to do with
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:07.640]  the FCC, doesn't it?
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:12.400]  They've got 25 members who are working to search out content that they don't like.
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:15.160]  In this case, blasphemous content.
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:19.920]  And Facebook is going to work with them to shut this down and possibly to rat these people
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:20.920]  out.
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:24.240]  And remember, this is something that carries a death penalty in Pakistan.
[3:27:24.240 --> 3:27:25.240]  They said they're going to work.
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:31.520]  Now, this is the first country, first Islamic country to get Facebook to play along.
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:34.600]  But they're working with 27 other Muslim countries to make, that are making similar
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:35.600]  demands.
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:37.280]  So I guess we can call it now Sharia book.
[3:27:37.280 --> 3:27:42.720]  Meanwhile, we got Erdogan talking about how Turks in Europe should defy the grandchildren
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:43.720]  of Nazism.
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:47.880]  You see, when you want dictatorial powers, the way you get them is to call other people
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:51.360]  Nazis, call other people Hitler.
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:56.560]  The amazing thing about this, the irony of this is that Erdogan was sending foreign ministers
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:27:59.200]  into all these European countries.
[3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:03.000]  And that's what created the friction because they said, look, we don't want to have you
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  campaigning.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:08.080]  We don't want massive groups of people meeting here that are going to get worked up and start
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:11.160]  fighting with each other over politics within Turkey.
[3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:16.960]  But they have so many Turks that are now in Western Europe that they really needed to
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:18.760]  do this in order to win their election.
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:20.920]  And what was the point of the election that's coming up?
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:25.800]  Well, the point of the election was to give Erdogan dictatorial powers.
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:29.960]  So he goes there to campaign for dictatorial powers, when he gets the campaign rallies
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:33.280]  and say, we don't want this, we don't want your people campaigning here, then he calls
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:36.480]  them Nazis, calls them Nazis.
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:44.240]  Let me remind you that it was the Turks 100 years ago, 1915 to 1916, that did the Armenian
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:48.480]  genocide that the Turks to this day want to pretend didn't happen.
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:54.600]  Limpkin coined the term genocide for what had happened there, what the Turks did to the
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:28:58.840]  Armenian Christians in that area, trying to wipe them out to a person.
[3:28:58.840 --> 3:29:02.200]  Oh, we haven't seen that anywhere else, have we?
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:03.440]  See it everywhere.
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:09.080]  You see this culture, this religion, this government, all three tied together, everywhere
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:11.600]  they go, they want to eliminate everyone else.
[3:29:11.600 --> 3:29:18.200]  And he has the audacity when he's campaigning for dictatorial powers to talk about Nazi-like
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:22.200]  tactics in the Netherlands and Germany and other places.
[3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:28.200]  What people need to understand is that he's sent massive numbers of people that he calls
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:30.600]  his brothers and sisters voting in Europe.
[3:29:30.600 --> 3:29:35.680]  He wants them to answer this fascist oppression that doesn't let him campaign for dictatorial
[3:29:35.680 --> 3:29:37.680]  powers in the country.
[3:29:37.680 --> 3:29:40.800]  Are those people voting in European elections?
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:41.800]  Probably are as well.
[3:29:41.800 --> 3:30:00.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.200 --> 3:30:03.160]  Terrorism has struck again, this time in Russia.
[3:30:03.160 --> 3:30:07.440]  While Vladimir Putin was in St. Petersburg for a visit, a nail bomb blew through a train
[3:30:07.440 --> 3:30:11.800]  killing at least 10 people, wounding several others, including children.
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:16.400]  ISIS has already celebrated the attack, but that didn't stop CNN from politicizing it,
[3:30:16.400 --> 3:30:19.000]  saying it was retaliation for Syria.
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:24.320]  Although this may be CNN showing their hand, yes, it was retaliation for Syria, the fact
[3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:29.360]  that Russia will not get behind the globalist regime change desired in Syria to remove Assad
[3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:30.360]  from power.
[3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:34.880]  Funny, CNN would take that angle, as ISIS released a kill list on the internet with
[3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:36.640]  names and addresses.
[3:30:36.640 --> 3:30:40.520]  Only Russia has recently had nine diplomats killed since Trump's election.
[3:30:40.520 --> 3:30:44.480]  One must ask, how can ISIS release a kill list on the internet?
[3:30:44.480 --> 3:30:48.560]  And how could people not realize there is a serious terror problem in the world?
[3:30:48.560 --> 3:30:53.560]  Intolerance, open borders and more forced regime change is not the answer.
[3:30:53.560 --> 3:30:56.360]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[3:30:56.360 --> 3:31:02.040]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:04.080]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:31:04.080 --> 3:31:06.920]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:12.960]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:17.920]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[3:31:17.920 --> 3:31:22.880]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[3:31:22.880 --> 3:31:28.000]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:29.720]  you can to purify your air.
[3:31:29.720 --> 3:31:34.720]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:31:34.720 --> 3:31:37.720]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[3:31:37.720 --> 3:31:39.920]  The general public doesn't.
[3:31:39.920 --> 3:31:43.880]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:31:43.880 --> 3:31:47.480]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:31:47.480 --> 3:31:51.040]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[3:31:51.040 --> 3:31:54.240]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:31:54.240 --> 3:32:00.400]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, nymphalwarstore.com.
[3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:03.880]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[3:32:03.880 --> 3:32:06.160]  in stock nymphalwarstore.com.
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:07.960]  Research across the board is clear.
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:11.880]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[3:32:11.880 --> 3:32:13.280]  clots and heart attacks.
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:17.920]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[3:32:17.920 --> 3:32:20.640]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:20.640 --> 3:32:25.120]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[3:32:25.120 --> 3:32:27.720]  iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:27.720 --> 3:32:32.280]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[3:32:32.280 --> 3:32:34.840]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:32:34.840 --> 3:32:39.440]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[3:32:39.440 --> 3:32:44.360]  peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver and more, due to requests from listers who found that
[3:32:44.360 --> 3:32:46.880]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[3:32:46.880 --> 3:32:50.840]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint-free.

[3:33:05.920 --> 3:33:13.320]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:13.320 --> 3:33:17.040]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[3:33:17.040 --> 3:33:25.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm David Knight and we've just been looking at the
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:29.480]  Democrats pushing against the idea that we should prohibit foreign law being used in
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:30.480]  our country.
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:37.520]  You know, we have an article here from AP that some states, and they were about to get
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:44.280]  up, listen to this folks, about to get up to about a dozen states that would require
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:48.400]  high school students to know something about the Constitution, to actually teach the Constitution.
[3:33:48.400 --> 3:33:49.400]  Isn't that amazing?
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:50.400]  Isn't that amazing?
[3:33:50.400 --> 3:33:54.520]  Kentucky last week in Arkansas on March the 16th became the latest of more than a dozen
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:58.480]  states since 2015 that have required the high school social studies curriculum to include
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:03.400]  material covered by the 100 questions asked on the naturalization exam and that's pretty
[3:34:03.400 --> 3:34:06.800]  shallow stuff folks, pretty shallow stuff.
[3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:12.120]  But think about that, we've gone only about a dozen states, that's only 24%, that means
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:19.240]  74%, three quarters of the states still don't want you to know anything about the Constitution.
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:22.360]  They tried to teach it a little bit when I was in school, they were talking about the
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:27.120]  Declaration of Independence and they would immediately stop it in that preamble when
[3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:32.720]  you said, you know, we create these governments to stand to protect our rights and we have
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:37.800]  life liberty in the pursuit of happiness, stop it right there, they didn't want you to memorize
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:42.520]  or to even read the part that says that when governments become destructive of these rights,
[3:34:42.520 --> 3:34:47.120]  it is our right and duty to alter or abolish that government because that was the essence
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:51.760]  of what they were doing, they were declaring independence from a government that was abusing
[3:34:51.760 --> 3:34:52.760]  these rights.
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:56.720]  Now one of the people who was in Fairbanks, Alaska talking about this retired classroom
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:35:01.680]  teacher said, rights might be inherent, but ideas need to be taught, boy put that on the
[3:35:01.680 --> 3:35:03.840]  blackboard for your kids.
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:09.960]  Rights might be inherent, but ideas need to be taught, if we're not teaching them to
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:15.200]  our kids, they're going to be falling for this Sharia law, whatever other foreign law we
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:20.120]  have, Anthony Kennedy or any Supreme Court justice wants to be reading into the so-called
[3:35:20.120 --> 3:35:25.720]  constitutional decisions that they're making, where they sit there and veto our laws up
[3:35:25.720 --> 3:35:26.720]  or down.
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:30.440]  You know they say, we don't want to see Roe v. Wade used as a litmus test, I think they
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:35.680]  ought to use Marbury v. Madison as a litmus test, if you've got a Supreme Court justice
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:40.080]  who says as they all do, they all do, they'll say, well, you know, that's been ruled on,
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:41.080]  that's the law of the land.
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:44.920]  Well, the law of the land at one point in time was that you had to return runaway slaves.
[3:35:44.920 --> 3:35:49.320]  The law of the land at one point in time was that you could jail people if you didn't like
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:53.200]  the movie that they made, and that was the law of the land for about 50 years.
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:57.520]  We had a film producer who was interestingly enough making a movie about the American Revolution,
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:03.240]  the Spirit of 76. Woodrow Wilson administration didn't like that at all because they wanted
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:07.840]  to get into World War I on the side of Britain.
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:11.760]  And so they said, that makes Great Britain look bad, your movie does.
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:15.920]  So we don't want you to put that out there, and they censored it, and the guy took it
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:19.120]  out in Chicago, then put it back in an L.A., and then they sent him to jail.
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:24.040]  They gave him pretty stiff fine, $10,000 back in the early century, there you have Spirit
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:28.840]  of 76, I forget what year that was in, they put him in jail, they gave him an incredibly
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:33.760]  stiff fine, and they said the Supreme Court says that movies don't get First Amendment
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  protection.
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:39.400]  So when you say that the Supreme Court, these nine politically appointed judges, and understand
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:45.480]  that that's what's going on here, this vote today was, it's going to be up or down, based
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.640]  strictly along partisan lines, it would have been that way with the Democrats as well.
[3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:53.800]  You had Hillary's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine say, we're going to ram through whoever
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:58.400]  we wish, and we're going to do it with the nuclear option, we're going to get rid of
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:01.000]  the filibuster, we've done this before, we're going to do it again, we're going to put
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:04.560]  in whoever we wish, we don't really care what the Republicans think.
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:07.800]  And now they're pretending that it's the end of the world, that the Republicans are talking
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:11.440]  about using the nuclear option.
[3:37:11.440 --> 3:37:14.920]  It's always political folks, and everything that they do is political, but if you want
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:19.560]  to ask them, you want to really get the gist of what they're talking about, when they say
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:24.320]  that Roe v. Wade is a law of the land, it isn't, it isn't, it isn't the law of the land
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:27.960]  anymore than the Supreme Court decision that struck down First Amendment protection for
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:33.120]  movies or the Supreme Court decision that said slaves had to be returned, it's just
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:35.160]  not, it's just not.
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:41.760]  So it'll always be subject to change, and when they say it's the law of the land, they're
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:44.840]  ignoring the fact that they don't make law.
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:49.360]  Remember it was our most statist founding father, Alexander Hamilton, who said the judiciary
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:51.320]  is the least to be feared because it has no power.
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:54.360]  Well, it's the most to be feared today because it has the most power.
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:59.120]  It says in judgment of everything, and it works in collusion with the permanent established
[3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:04.360]  bureaucracy that is also unaccountable to the American people, unelected by the American
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:07.840]  people, and together, the bureaucracy and the Supreme Court pretty much tell us what
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:13.000]  we can, can and can't do, and say it's the law of the land when it suits them.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:16.360]  So yeah, it's the Supreme Court decision, that's what Roe v. Wade is.
[3:38:16.360 --> 3:38:21.360]  All of those decisions are Supreme Court decisions, they're not law, they're not law, sorry.
[3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:26.200]  The law is made by our elected representatives, and I know every lawyer will get upset with
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:30.640]  me and angry about this, but that's not the way I read the Constitution, and it's not
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:34.280]  the way it's going to read to you if you read the Constitution either.
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:39.480]  Now before we move on here, I want to, there's one little side story here that I thought
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:42.560]  was very interesting that came out of RT today.
[3:38:42.560 --> 3:38:50.200]  HSBC points out that central banking partners are ditching the euro for the pound sterling.
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:51.200]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:56.880]  We were told that it was going to be the economic ruin of Great Britain to have Brexit, but
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:03.280]  HSBC says bankers around the world see the UK as a safer prospect for their reserve investments
[3:39:03.280 --> 3:39:09.800]  than the euro zone, because there is so much uncertainty about the euro.
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:14.120]  The euro could collapse, the euro's got all of this debt that they have saddled it with.
[3:39:14.120 --> 3:39:19.560]  They say they favor the British currency as a long-term stable alternative despite uncertainty
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:20.960]  over Brexit.
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.760]  Well, as we move along, it's kind of interesting, there was an article on CNN last week saying
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:31.800]  that Henry VIII was going to set the pattern for how they were going to proceed and unroll
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:36.840]  this thing, because they had the great repeal bill, which is talking about how their first
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:42.320]  day served notice with article 50 saying we're going to leave the European Union, and then
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:45.160]  they put up the great repeal bill, which is going to try to go through the details of
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:49.680]  how they're going to get rid of the influence of the European Union and their laws.
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:52.480]  The first thing they're going to do is just bring them all over and say we're going to
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:54.840]  continue on with the status quo.
[3:39:54.840 --> 3:40:00.280]  However, we're going to acknowledge the fact that now we run our own lives, and it has
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:04.640]  a parallel to Henry VIII when he did that against a globalist government run by the
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:08.960]  Pope at the time, because when you understand this back and forth, so many people love to
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:13.480]  attack Christianity, they need to understand that when Catholics were killing Protestants
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:18.240]  and Protestants were killing Catholics, it was largely because there was an intertwining
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:22.720]  there of political and religious power, kind of like what we see with Sharia laws, what
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:24.680]  we don't like about Sharia law.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:28.720]  We don't like to have those two things put together, that's why the very first amendment
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:33.760]  in the Constitution says we're not going to do that here in America, and that would prohibit
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:38.360]  Sharia law here in America if applied, but of course they can also ignore it.
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:45.200]  But when Henry VIII, for his own personal reasons, had six wives and he wanted to eventually,
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:48.480]  but he wanted to get rid of that first wife, and so he broke with the Pope, but that was
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:53.800]  a breaking in terms of political issues as well.
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:56.960]  And what he did at that point in time was he said, all right, we're going to establish
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:00.200]  all of our own laws, and we're going to set up our own ministers, and they're now going
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:04.680]  to rewrite certain laws that had been intertwined with the Pope.
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:07.520]  And so that's why they're saying this is going to be the same type of thing they're going
[3:41:07.520 --> 3:41:08.520]  to do.
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:11.200]  They're going to bring in, they're going to say this is our law now that we have, take
[3:41:11.200 --> 3:41:15.840]  a snapshot of the status quo, and then like Henry VIII, say we're going to give powers
[3:41:15.840 --> 3:41:21.280]  to these ministers, to these bureaucracies to alter or hopefully abolish, although I
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:23.920]  doubt that they really will abolish much of this stuff.
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:27.320]  That's really what they've got to watch out for, because the bureaucracies are always
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:28.960]  going to try to build their own empire.
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:33.680]  So there'll be a fight between the bureaucracies, just as we see between the FCC and the FTC,
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:35.920]  fighting for who's going to control the internet.
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:40.520]  That's really the baseline of what's underneath all this talk about losing our freedoms.
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:45.560]  Yes, they are going to give the ISPs the ability to sell your information, as they did before
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:47.800]  Obama changed it at the 11th hour.
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:49.400]  So it's not really a change in your freedom.
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:53.640]  They don't want you to pay attention to the fact that you're not free, that you really
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:58.960]  don't have any privacy, that Facebook and Google and all these social media outlets can track
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:03.520]  you and have more information about you than the ISPs do, in spite of what Nancy Pelosi
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:08.200]  said, they do have more information about you than your ISP does, because you give it
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:09.200]  to them.
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:13.600]  You tell them everything about your life you put it there, and they curate that, and they
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:16.800]  preserve that, and then they sell that information.
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:18.680]  So they want to pretend that none of that is happening.
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:21.680]  They want to pretend that the government is not watching everything that you have.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:25.080]  They want to pretend that they didn't give these corporations legal immunity to turn
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:29.120]  over all the information they've collected on you to the government, which can then use
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:34.280]  it to do an analysis either on mass public opinion or to single out individuals that
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:36.480]  they want to target.
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:38.840]  They want to pretend that none of that is happening, and they want to say, look, Donald
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:41.200]  Trump is killing our freedom online.
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:48.240]  The reality is, is that the FCC has taken a very aggressive position of trying to take
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:50.840]  over control of the Internet.
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:54.040]  The FTC has had some control over the Internet.
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:42:58.640]  They've used that very sparingly, but the FCC has been very, very aggressive about trying
[3:42:58.640 --> 3:42:59.720]  to assert control.
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:02.880]  So that's really what is at the bottom of that.
[3:43:02.880 --> 3:43:06.000]  So you're going to see in England that same kind of struggle within the bureaucracy.
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:10.680]  So who is going to have a little empire here and an empire over there, and who's going
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:11.680]  to have control of this?
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:13.840]  You'll have bureaucracies fighting each other.
[3:43:13.840 --> 3:43:17.160]  They're going to take over these laws, and hopefully they will decide that some of these
[3:43:17.160 --> 3:43:18.440]  laws they really don't need.
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:19.760]  That's what they were fighting for.
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:25.280]  They were fighting so that they could have sovereignty and have self-government.
[3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:27.200]  And that's what that looks like.
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:29.760]  And that's one of the reasons, if you want to go back and do a history lesson, it's one
[3:43:29.760 --> 3:43:38.160]  of the reasons why people are so anti-Christian is because of all the political recriminations
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:39.160]  that were taken on people.
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:41.840]  When you changed from one church to the other, you were changing political allegiance from
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:46.920]  one monarch who supported the pope to another one who opposed the pope and so forth.
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:51.200]  Or you had situations in Geneva, Switzerland, where Calvin was coming after Catholics and
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:54.080]  killing them because he was an administrator.
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:43:57.920]  He wanted to make sure that he ran the government as well as the church.
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:03.640]  And they used the church as a way to strengthen their governmental control on people.
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:06.560]  We were in Salzburg, Austria, and I'll never forget.
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.960]  I told my family when we went there, I said, this is why Europeans hate Christianity so
[3:44:10.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  much.
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:18.040]  We had this massive palace there, if you saw the sound of music where she makes all these
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:21.680]  costumes for the kids and they go on a field day and they're running through these manicured
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:22.680]  gardens and everything.
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:25.080]  Well, that was a palace that was built there.
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:27.640]  If I remember correctly, I think it was Mirabel Palace.
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:30.000]  Salzburg was essentially a city-state.
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:31.840]  They didn't have a strong central government.
[3:44:31.840 --> 3:44:33.360]  Governments were very decentralized in Europe.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:37.400]  They didn't consolidate into a nation-state until the late 1800s.
[3:44:37.400 --> 3:44:42.320]  And the guy that ran it was a Catholic bishop, and he got all his money from the lucrative
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:43.880]  salt mines that were there.
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:46.680]  So the people were laboring very hard in the salt mines.
[3:44:46.680 --> 3:44:51.040]  There you see, there's a, I think that's, that might be it, yeah, they, they has wonderful
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:56.040]  palace that he built, and it would have been bad enough if he had built it for himself.
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:45:04.240]  But he built it for his mistress, just flaunting the fact that he is defying everything that
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:07.480]  the Catholic Church was telling everybody about the fact that they weren't going to be
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:09.280]  marrying what, well, I didn't marry her.
[3:45:09.280 --> 3:45:12.520]  She's my mistress, and you're going to pay, you're going to work in the salt mines to
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:14.160]  build this beautiful palace here.
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:18.400]  And I said, it's no wonder that the people in Europe hate Christianity because they think
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:20.040]  that's what Christianity is about.
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:22.880]  It's totally corrupted, totally corrupted.
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:28.760]  But let's take a look at the exposure of what I would call Obama Gate.
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:32.360]  That's what we really ought to talk about with this, because this is really, they want
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:38.960]  to try to entrap Donald Trump and impeach him with leaks that are being conducted out
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:46.680]  of law enforcement and the surveillance state via Washington Post and try to impeach a president.
[3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:47.680]  Does that sound familiar?
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:48.680]  Does that sound like Watergate?
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:53.480]  We even had Robert Redford talking about, oh yeah, we had the Watergate happening back
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:54.480]  then.
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:56.440]  Let's, let's make sure that this happens again.
[3:45:56.440 --> 3:45:57.440]  Let's do this again.
[3:45:57.440 --> 3:45:58.440]  We're at a moment like that.
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:02.200]  Well, you know what, if you really want the parallel to Watergate, you need to take a look
[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:08.080]  at what was going on in the Obama administration, using the power of the president to spy on
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:13.080]  your political enemies in an illegal way, and then cover it up.
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:14.960]  And that's what is starting to emerge now.
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:19.840]  They want to make a big deal out of the fact that Donald Trump quoted a New York Times headline,
[3:46:19.840 --> 3:46:25.880]  and they just put up there the article that we had by Don Salazar, Reince Priebus, holding
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:30.520]  up a New York Times article going on Fox News and even having Chris Wallace push back against
[3:46:30.520 --> 3:46:34.440]  it and say, well, that didn't say anything about Trump Tower.
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:36.840]  It says he's wiretapping Trump and his people.
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:38.120]  It doesn't matter.
[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:39.520]  It's not just Trump Tower.
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:40.520]  You understand that, right?
[3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:44.360]  And you understand that they don't do it the old fashioned way.
[3:46:44.360 --> 3:46:52.040]  They don't get burglars, plumbers to break into somebody's office and do it that way.
[3:46:52.040 --> 3:46:57.080]  It's much easier today to do it wirelessly, to do it warrantlessly, to cover it up.
[3:46:57.080 --> 3:47:01.760]  And now we're starting to see that evolve.
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:04.040]  And the question is, will the press talk about this?
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:07.200]  I want to play for you a two-minute clip that we've got here.
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:10.080]  Go out to the break here of Fox News.
[3:47:10.080 --> 3:47:12.200]  This is a senior correspondent, Adam Halsey.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:13.200]  Lay this out.
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:14.200]  Let's play that clip.
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:16.600]  We don't know who spoke to Devin Nunes.
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:18.800]  We know it's not someone at the White House.
[3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:21.840]  We don't know who spoke to the White House about this other than what Nunes has said
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:23.400]  in front of the press conferences.
[3:47:23.400 --> 3:47:26.280]  The sources we're talking to are separate from both of those entities.
[3:47:26.280 --> 3:47:28.320]  They don't really have a horse in this game.
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:32.920]  They are frustrated with the way the agencies, they say, are being politicized more than
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:34.560]  they've seen before in their careers.
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:36.720]  And one reason why they're speaking out is because of that.
[3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:40.360]  The second reason is because Nunes came out in front of the cameras, has his finger on
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:43.280]  it, they say, so they want to make sure that it's done correctly.
[3:47:43.280 --> 3:47:47.360]  What we've learned is this from multiple sources is that it's all about intelligence-gathering
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:48.360]  methods.
[3:47:48.360 --> 3:47:51.360]  The fact is a lot of these men and women in the intelligence communities did not want
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:55.160]  to speak about what's been going on because they were concerned about those methods being
[3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:56.160]  known.
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:00.960]  And now they figured they might as well at least clarify things, since Nunes has been
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:04.640]  leaked to by someone they don't know, or at least they tell me they don't know.
[3:48:04.640 --> 3:48:05.640]  We know that there was this.
[3:48:05.640 --> 3:48:08.600]  There was electronic surveillance of Trump and the people close to Donald Trump, including
[3:48:08.600 --> 3:48:12.640]  some supporters, for up to a year before inauguration.
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:17.080]  That information was disseminated, we're told, through NSA channels.
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:19.720]  It's unprecedented, I'm told, the way this was done.
[3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:23.280]  The mission of U.S. citizens is supposed to be massed, and that means basically taken
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:24.280]  out of a report.
[3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:31.680]  So for example, if I call somebody in Bulgaria, and that's picked up somehow by our agencies,
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:35.120]  and there's nothing there involving national security, there's nothing there involving
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:39.820]  a crime, that report would come out and it would say, American number one, or my name
[3:48:39.820 --> 3:48:40.820]  would not be there.
[3:48:40.820 --> 3:48:46.320]  What I'm told now is when these reports came out, names were there, and that is unprecedented.
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:50.920]  Basically they say that the information that was unmasking, this unmasked information,
[3:48:50.920 --> 3:48:56.200]  these names of Americans who had done nothing wrong, was disseminated to all of the NSC,
[3:48:56.200 --> 3:49:00.880]  some at DOD, Clapper, Brennan, basically the people at the top.
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:04.680]  They also say, I'm told, that the rights knew about this possibly as well.
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:07.920]  Now, I know there's some reports out there that she was the one that ordered this.
[3:49:07.920 --> 3:49:08.920]  We do not know who reported this.
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:10.400]  Okay, let's hold it right there.
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:11.400]  Let's hold it right.
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:13.240]  Here's the key takeaways, folks.
[3:49:13.240 --> 3:49:17.520]  We've got people said they are seeing the agencies politicize in a way that they've never seen
[3:49:17.520 --> 3:49:18.520]  before in their careers.
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:20.120]  That's why they're blowing the whistle on this.
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:23.200]  They say this information is being disseminated through NSA channels.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:24.200]  And then here's the other thing.
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:27.680]  They're saying, well, this is something that was just picked up as we were listening to
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:28.680]  foreign traffic.
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:32.440]  And they say, well, if that's the case, it's supposed to simply say, and there's no illegal
[3:49:32.440 --> 3:49:35.880]  activity involved, then you don't put down anybody's name.
[3:49:35.880 --> 3:49:38.920]  You say American number one said this, or American number two said this.
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:42.520]  But if there's no illegal activity, you don't put any names on it.
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:46.960]  But because this was politically motivated, because this was ordered by Rice, what they
[3:49:46.960 --> 3:49:49.720]  did was they put those names down there.
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:50.880]  They were not supposed to do that.
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:53.800]  And then that in and of itself was unprecedented.
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:49:57.960]  Then what they did, after unmasking these names, they sent the names around.
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:03.800]  They disseminated this to the National Security Council, to the DOD, to Clapper, to Brennan,
[3:50:03.800 --> 3:50:05.920]  to all the people at the top.
[3:50:05.920 --> 3:50:08.320]  You understand what's going on here?
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:09.400]  This is key, folks.
[3:50:09.400 --> 3:50:12.160]  This is why I said this is Obamagate.
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:14.760]  This is the parallel to Watergate.
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:18.440]  This is using intelligence services, leaking this stuff through their surrogates in the
[3:50:18.440 --> 3:50:23.360]  Washington Post to do a coup, to do a coup.
[3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:25.520]  And that's exactly what happened with Watergate.
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:26.520]  Watergate was a coup.
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:27.800]  And I'm not defending Richard Nixon.
[3:50:27.800 --> 3:50:28.920]  I don't like Richard Nixon.
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:29.920]  I didn't like anything.
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:31.420]  He created the EPA.
[3:50:31.420 --> 3:50:33.760]  He put on wage and price controls.
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:35.520]  He gave us a 55-mile an hour speed limit.
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:38.320]  This guy had no respect whatsoever for the Constitution.
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:41.040]  A 55-mile an hour speed limit.
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:46.200]  That may sound trivial to you, but that is a violation of the Constitution.
[3:50:46.200 --> 3:50:50.800]  So I'm not supporting him, but the way he was taken down was simply a coup.
[3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:51.800]  That's what they're trying to do.
[3:50:51.800 --> 3:50:53.480]  And it ought to backfire on them.
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:57.880]  This ought to be reported by everybody, because this is the real story, not the Russian BS
[3:50:57.880 --> 3:50:58.880]  that we're hearing about.
[3:50:58.880 --> 3:50:59.880]  Stay with us.
[3:50:59.880 --> 3:51:00.880]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:00.880 --> 3:51:01.880]  Hi, Auntie Christine.

[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:12.680]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[3:52:12.680 --> 3:52:17.240]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:21.040]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.

[3:53:01.720 --> 3:53:03.880]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?

[3:54:08.080 --> 3:54:09.560]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:13.800]  Just want to remind you before we get back into the Obamagate and of course this is what's
[3:54:13.800 --> 3:54:14.800]  happening.
[3:54:14.800 --> 3:54:21.080]  It's ordering, according to Bloomberg, ordering the unmasking of people in a very illegal way,
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:22.080]  folks.
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:25.640]  This is something that is, of course, so Obama's already left office, but this is the
[3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:26.640]  real story.
[3:54:26.640 --> 3:54:29.480]  You want to know who hacked the election?
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:31.400]  You know who hacked the primary?
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:32.400]  What was the DNC?
[3:54:32.400 --> 3:54:34.400]  And we're going to tell you more about this in just a moment.
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:37.680]  But before I get back to the news, I just want to remind you that we now have the new
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:42.720]  flavor of super blue fluoride-free toothpaste and that's the bubblegum flavor.
[3:54:42.720 --> 3:54:48.520]  So a lot of children wanted something that was sweeter, not as strong, and so now we
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:49.520]  have that.
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:54.280]  It's perfect for people, especially kids who don't like the strong peppermint taste.
[3:54:54.280 --> 3:54:55.280]  I like that.
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:54:59.320]  I like the peppermint oil, but it also has, regardless of which flavor you get, it has
[3:54:59.320 --> 3:55:04.400]  these key ingredients, iodine, nano silver that are going to fight bacteria that causes
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:11.320]  gum disease, that causes heart disease, and that's the key thing that's going to keep
[3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:14.800]  your mouth fresh that's going to fight the bacteria in your mouth, regardless of which
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:15.800]  flavor you get.
[3:55:15.800 --> 3:55:16.800]  That is now in stock.
[3:55:16.800 --> 3:55:20.000]  The new bubblegum flavor, you'll find that at infowarstore.com.
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:26.680]  Also, for the first time in four years, we're facing a major deep earth iodine shortage.
[3:55:26.680 --> 3:55:31.520]  We are going to be continuing this special, probably, I don't know if it may end today,
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:35.680]  it's 30% off survival shield X2 nascent iodine.
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:40.120]  Before we could simply get as much as we wanted, but now we're going to have to get
[3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:44.880]  a massive amount or change the formulation, so if you want to get this current formulation,
[3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:49.680]  now is the time, and we've got it discounted, 30% off survival shield X2 nascent iodine
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:52.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:55:56.680]  That was telling you about the report from Fox News, and he was talking about how people
[3:55:56.680 --> 3:56:01.240]  were unmasked, and how, as the NSA loves to say, well, you know, we were just listening
[3:56:01.240 --> 3:56:05.720]  to foreign communications, and we're allowed to do that, and if we hear an American talking
[3:56:05.720 --> 3:56:09.080]  to somebody, then, you know, we get that information, but of course they're not supposed to release
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:13.120]  that information, especially if it's a high political official, especially if they're
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:15.280]  going to use it for political purposes.
[3:56:15.280 --> 3:56:20.920]  And this is why I've said all along, the people who can fix the surveillance state are the
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:25.080]  people who, if they don't fix it, are going to be the first victims of it, and now we
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:26.080]  see this happening.
[3:56:26.080 --> 3:56:29.080]  We see it being used now for political purposes.
[3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:36.320]  Right about reports that a Bloomberg columnist, Eli Lake, named Susan Rice, Obama's National
[3:56:36.320 --> 3:56:42.000]  Security Advisor, she has her access to all this national security information, and instead
[3:56:42.000 --> 3:56:46.600]  of anonymizing it, if there's no crime that's being committed, and putting American number
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:50.600]  one said this, American number two said this, instead of doing that, they actually put down
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:55.480]  names, and then they decided that for political reasons, they would pass those names around
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:56:59.760]  all the people that are part of the intelligence community, and then you saw that some of those
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:04.320]  people went along and politicized that and passed it through their mouthpiece, the Washington
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:10.040]  Post that runs the database for the CIA, Jeff Bezos owns both of those things.
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:13.920]  So this is the way this stuff is being used now.
[3:57:13.920 --> 3:57:17.720]  And let's look at one other aspect of this that has also come up.
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:22.800]  And that is the guy who is at the bottom of this fake Trump dossier that everybody mocked.
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:26.960]  Remember that was put out by BuzzFeed, and everybody, even the never Trump mainstream
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:28.480]  media mocked this.
[3:57:28.480 --> 3:57:32.040]  And BuzzFeed said, well, we don't necessarily believe it either, but we just thought that
[3:57:32.040 --> 3:57:35.880]  everybody ought to be able to see this, even though we haven't verified it, even though
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:36.880]  they don't believe it's true.
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:38.000]  They want to put it out there.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  Why?
[3:57:39.000 --> 3:57:40.600]  I guess it makes some money out of it.
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:57:45.600]  But that thoroughly discredited dossier, and again, you think that word dossier makes
[3:57:45.600 --> 3:57:47.120]  it sound very impressive.
[3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:50.320]  Now we see a relationship that's evolved here, and we don't have much time.
[3:57:50.320 --> 3:57:53.520]  So guys, focus in on this paper here, because I kind of laid this out.
[3:57:53.520 --> 3:57:54.520]  It's pretty sloppy.
[3:57:54.520 --> 3:57:55.600]  But you get the idea.
[3:57:55.600 --> 3:57:59.800]  This guy here, Glenn Simpson, who is at the center of this, look at the bottom here.
[3:57:59.800 --> 3:58:02.280]  Look at what I wrote down at the bottom, pull that down.
[3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:05.720]  This guy who is a Fusion GPS founder, okay?
[3:58:05.720 --> 3:58:10.720]  Now they put out the dossier working with the former MI5 guy, Chris Steele.
[3:58:10.720 --> 3:58:16.200]  The same guy, Glenn Simpson, also has a relationship with a Clinton supporter who hired him to get
[3:58:16.200 --> 3:58:18.000]  dirt on Donald Trump.
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:24.080]  Then the third part of the equation now we learn is that he was also working with a Russian,
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:30.040]  to a former Russian co-intel guy to try to roll back sanctions against Russian criminals.
[3:58:30.040 --> 3:58:31.960]  How much more obvious does it get?
[3:58:31.960 --> 3:58:34.360]  These people are accusing Trump of what they're doing.
[3:58:34.360 --> 3:58:36.360]  Join us tonight for the Infowars Nightly News.
[3:58:36.360 --> 3:58:48.160]  We're going to begin doing that live starting tonight.
