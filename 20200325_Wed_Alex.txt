[3:12:39.700 --> 3:12:44.700]  this is what's coming, this crisis, no matter what you believe about its origins or no matter
[3:12:44.700 --> 3:12:49.580]  what you believe about how severe it is or not severe, because I know opinions vary on
[3:12:49.580 --> 3:12:56.540]  that but they're using it to steal every asset from society, where this goes long term is
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:13:04.300]  that America becomes impoverished masses like Mexico with certain protected corporations
[3:13:04.300 --> 3:13:10.340]  that get the government bailouts like Amazon and Boeing and maybe Tesla and Google and
[3:13:10.340 --> 3:13:15.340]  others just going to be a few wealthy all powerful Orwellian corporations running your
[3:13:15.340 --> 3:13:21.020]  life and you will have nothing and you'll be entirely dependent on the government because
[3:13:21.020 --> 3:13:26.340]  your pension will disappear as is already happening pensions are vanishing you will have no retirement
[3:13:26.340 --> 3:13:31.340]  you will have no savings if you're left holding dollars when this great reset comes or I should
[3:13:31.340 --> 3:13:36.100]  say horrifying reset you will lose almost all the value the purchasing power of those
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:41.420]  dollars that is already beginning to happen so this bailout this multi trillion dollar
[3:13:41.420 --> 3:13:47.900]  bailout is theft it is theft from you it's theft from the people it is government theft
[3:13:47.900 --> 3:13:54.060]  it's beyond hoarding it is it is a mass coordinated stealing of everything that you own from your
[3:13:54.060 --> 3:14:01.660]  retirement to your 401ks to your business your corporate stocks everything it could be your
[3:14:01.660 --> 3:14:07.340]  home your commercial real estate everything they're going to steal it from you and in
[3:14:07.340 --> 3:14:12.180]  fact I want to encourage you there's a video series out there that was created by Mike
[3:14:12.180 --> 3:14:18.140]  Maloney it's called the hidden secrets of money and in fact I'd like to ask the producers
[3:14:18.140 --> 3:14:22.860]  I'd really like to see if we can invite Mike Maloney on as a guest of mine next week if
[3:14:22.860 --> 3:14:26.940]  we're all still functioning and online I'd really love to have Mike Maloney on because
[3:14:26.940 --> 3:14:31.380]  he gets this and and that video series called the hidden secrets of money which is very
[3:14:31.380 --> 3:14:36.580]  professionally produced I think it's on YouTube you can watch it for free it explains exactly
[3:14:36.580 --> 3:14:41.860]  what money is versus what fiat currency is and these bailouts are just creating endless
[3:14:41.860 --> 3:14:47.340]  fiat currency and all of us if we are to protect our liberty and protect our assets and protect
[3:14:47.340 --> 3:14:53.340]  our savings and prevent the government from stealing from us we need to understand how
[3:14:53.340 --> 3:15:01.100]  the Federal Reserve is a giant theft scam system and how the senators have just now
[3:15:01.100 --> 3:15:05.980]  created a new bill and members of the house as well they've created this new law this
[3:15:05.980 --> 3:15:12.380]  bailout bill you know I want my bailout money this is massive theft they package it as a
[3:15:12.380 --> 3:15:15.540]  gift oh we're going to send you thousands of dollars we're going to bail you out we're
[3:15:15.540 --> 3:15:18.620]  going to bail this company out we're going to bail out employees we're going to bail
[3:15:18.620 --> 3:15:24.220]  out stocks it's not a bailout it's theft they're going to end up owning everything owning you

[3:20:40.580 --> 3:20:46.820]  a lot of screaming about bailouts but you know look the lyrics of that song are more
[3:20:46.820 --> 3:20:51.940]  applicable now than they were even in 2008 it's it's about bailing out these wealthy
[3:20:51.940 --> 3:20:57.660]  connected corporate executives you know it's about bailing out the Jeff Bezos type people
[3:20:57.660 --> 3:21:02.860]  of the world and bailing out probably even the tech giants and and amazon is going to
[3:21:02.860 --> 3:21:09.020]  be probably the monopoly retailer in america because retail fronts that are in your local
[3:21:09.020 --> 3:21:14.940]  city are all collapsing I mean they were already under intense pressure because of amazon and
[3:21:14.940 --> 3:21:19.140]  prime delivery and so on and now with this coronavirus your local retailers other than
[3:21:19.140 --> 3:21:24.660]  walmart and target and Costco and so on your local retailers are basically crushed and
[3:21:24.660 --> 3:21:30.660]  gone and that is a very scary world if we have to depend on Jeff Bezos and amazon in
[3:21:30.660 --> 3:21:36.260]  order to get goods especially since amazon bands many natural supplements and natural
[3:21:36.260 --> 3:21:42.220]  products they will not let us sell through their fba program which is fulfilled by amazon
[3:21:42.220 --> 3:21:47.140]  it won't let us sell many things even glutathione for example which is really important for
[3:21:47.140 --> 3:21:52.220]  liver detox and and helping your body detox pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and things
[3:21:52.220 --> 3:21:59.140]  like that so amazon is going to be sort of the last monopoly retail giant in a world
[3:21:59.140 --> 3:22:03.740]  of collapse in a world of homeless this we're going to see many people losing their homes
[3:22:03.740 --> 3:22:07.900]  over this sadly we're going to see the homeless population spike all over the country and
[3:22:07.900 --> 3:22:12.940]  we're going to see homeless people in small towns that we used to only see in cities and
[3:22:12.940 --> 3:22:17.620]  of course we're going to see people fleeing the cities as well that's already begun so
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:23.860]  the economic impacts of this are enormous now it's worth pointing out that the virus
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:30.020]  did not cause these economic impacts the virus merely initiated this failed system that has
[3:22:30.020 --> 3:22:35.020]  been put in place where the can has been kicked down the road since the 2001 dot com crash
[3:22:35.020 --> 3:22:39.380]  and the 2008 subprime mortgage crash instead of fixing the structural problems in the
[3:22:39.380 --> 3:22:44.980]  economic system the fed under different presidents has just bailed out everything that that's
[3:22:44.980 --> 3:22:49.060]  why that song I want my bailout money it's just bailing everything out well that doesn't
[3:22:49.060 --> 3:22:53.420]  fix the problems and it doesn't eliminate the bad decisions in the system that lead
[3:22:53.420 --> 3:22:58.300]  to the situation where everybody is highly leveraged nobody's got any backup money nobody
[3:22:58.300 --> 3:23:03.340]  has any savings nobody has any redundancy or resiliency in the system so instead of
[3:23:03.340 --> 3:23:08.540]  letting companies that make bad decisions fail we're now going to have more bailouts
[3:23:08.540 --> 3:23:14.060]  now trillions of dollars of bailouts by creating new money which is really new debt so all
[3:23:14.060 --> 3:23:18.980]  of these trillions people think well the government can create money for free that's not the case
[3:23:18.980 --> 3:23:23.660]  that's coming out of your pockets folks your pockets as a taxpayer you're the one doing
[3:23:23.660 --> 3:23:28.620]  the bailouts of the rich wealthy corporations and the corporate executives who are being
[3:23:28.620 --> 3:23:33.180]  selected to survive this while others who are not so lucky who are not being selected
[3:23:33.180 --> 3:23:39.420]  are being allowed to fail and thus we have no functioning system no no free market anymore
[3:23:39.420 --> 3:23:45.220]  we have no reward for being correct no reward for saving money you are punished for saving
[3:23:45.220 --> 3:23:49.700]  money because your savings are about to become less and less valuable as the government prints
[3:23:49.700 --> 3:23:55.300]  new money to have a helicopter handouts to the whole country you can always count on
[3:23:55.300 --> 3:24:00.260]  the government to do the wrong thing and they're doing it yet again this is the wrong thing
[3:24:00.260 --> 3:24:05.980]  and let me give you an example of that right now I had a supplier out of Hong Kong contact
[3:24:05.980 --> 3:24:13.020]  me and say they've got the ability to manufacture 100,000 n95 masks per week and they wanted
[3:24:13.020 --> 3:24:18.540]  to know if we wanted to import those masks and then retail them in America and I think
[3:24:18.540 --> 3:24:24.020]  they even quoted me a price of $1.28 per mask which seems higher than usual but of course
[3:24:24.020 --> 3:24:27.300]  there's a lot of a lot of demand right now and and they were telling me well you could
[3:24:27.300 --> 3:24:33.940]  sell these in America for you know $5 a mask or more or $6 a mask you know so they're they're
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:38.220]  saying oh you could make half a million dollars a week by selling these masks in America and
[3:24:38.220 --> 3:24:44.620]  I told them no I'm not interested you know why because anybody selling n95 masks in America
[3:24:44.620 --> 3:24:51.900]  today is accused of profiteering off of the pandemic and you can be rated at gunpoint
[3:24:51.900 --> 3:24:56.900]  because the president signed the executive order that says oh hoarders are going to be
[3:24:56.900 --> 3:25:00.340]  they're going to have a knock on their door you're going to be rated at gunpoint you're
[3:25:00.340 --> 3:25:04.860]  going to have your inventory confiscated by the federal government so even when free
[3:25:04.860 --> 3:25:11.100]  market forces attempt to import masks and distribute masks or sell them even at a more
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:16.220]  fair price I don't know a $1.99 a mask or something you would still be accused of being
[3:25:16.220 --> 3:25:21.180]  a profiteer you would be rated at gunpoint you would be maybe arrested maybe fined maybe
[3:25:21.180 --> 3:25:25.740]  the DOJ comes after you and shuts you down that's what the government is doing right
[3:25:25.740 --> 3:25:31.500]  now which is why those of us like myself and Alex Jones who's built we've built businesses
[3:25:31.500 --> 3:25:36.220]  we've built distribution hubs we've built these things that work in the private market
[3:25:36.220 --> 3:25:42.740]  in free enterprise we are the ones who are refusing to handle those now high risk items
[3:25:42.740 --> 3:25:47.260]  even though we could theoretically assist society in getting more masks into the hands
[3:25:47.260 --> 3:25:51.420]  of people who need them but we won't do that because the government is threatening all
[3:25:51.420 --> 3:25:57.420]  of us threatening us with arrests and gunpoint raids and DOJ prosecutions so that's how government
[3:25:57.420 --> 3:26:03.500]  is blocking the supply of N95 masks the government is making the situation worse with these anti
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:08.620]  hoarding laws and there's no telling where that's going to expand to by the way you know
[3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:13.500]  today it's oh if you have medical masks you're a quote hoarder which by the way the government
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:17.820]  is the biggest hoarder of all look at their underground caves ten years of supplies of
[3:26:17.820 --> 3:26:23.060]  ammunition and medical gear and and you know antibiotics and communications and firearms
[3:26:23.060 --> 3:26:27.180]  and everything else but apparently they didn't have enough N95 masks in the caves underground
[3:26:27.180 --> 3:26:32.700]  so now they have to go steal it from the businesses that are trying to sell those supplies that's
[3:26:32.700 --> 3:26:37.020]  insane that is the opposite of a free market and that's what's happening in America now
[3:26:37.020 --> 3:26:41.700]  that's why my focus today is on economics we're seeing a collapse of the free market
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:48.700]  and the rise of a communist centrally controlled economy under a republican president for god's
[3:26:48.700 --> 3:26:54.060]  sake under a republican president we're having a communist centrally planned government and
[3:26:54.060 --> 3:27:00.020]  it's wrong and it's dangerous and it will have inefficiencies in the system and trump
[3:27:00.020 --> 3:27:05.580]  should let the free market work on this let me give you another example i in my ranch
[3:27:05.580 --> 3:27:11.180]  i have thousands of pounds of organic oats and organic almonds and camo camo and things
[3:27:11.180 --> 3:27:17.180]  like that goods that expired six months ago that i could not sell in my own store the FDA
[3:27:17.180 --> 3:27:23.420]  won't let me sell them so i've been feeding oats to my donkeys and my goats because i
[3:27:23.420 --> 3:27:28.460]  can't legally sell these to people who who might be starving soon across america i'm
[3:27:28.460 --> 3:27:32.180]  literally sitting on thousands of pounds of oats and almonds and other foods which is
[3:27:32.180 --> 3:27:37.260]  insane but i can't sell them without being arrested and fined why isn't there some kind
[3:27:37.260 --> 3:27:42.220]  of executive order to say hey if you're sitting on good food make it available to the public
[3:27:42.220 --> 3:27:46.740]  i'll sell it at cost i don't need to make any money i'd rather help people and yeah
[3:27:46.740 --> 3:27:50.660]  i'm gonna donate a lot of it to local churches and things like that but did you know that
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:55.700]  food banks won't even accept expired food and i'm i'm gonna have to convince the churches
[3:27:55.700 --> 3:28:00.660]  to take the food because normally they won't accept so-called expired food so i'm eating
[3:28:00.660 --> 3:28:05.860]  oatmeal and almonds i'm you know i'm i'm gonna be eating my way through the apocalypse
[3:28:05.860 --> 3:28:09.540]  on expired foods that are perfectly good while the government would threaten me with arrests
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:15.540]  and fines if i try to make that food available to others this is insanity the market is not
[3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:20.300]  being allowed to work yeah i'll barter food with neighbors and friends and things like
[3:28:20.300 --> 3:28:24.620]  that under you know the underground market that's the only way i can do this and if they
[3:28:24.620 --> 3:28:30.180]  want to come arrest me for for bartering oatmeal with my neighbors then then go for it i'm
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:34.740]  trying to help people stay fed and stay alive and get through this and the government is
[3:28:34.740 --> 3:28:38.820]  in the way the government is doing the wrong thing at every opportunity the government
[3:28:38.820 --> 3:28:43.940]  is gonna get people killed with these bad ideas and bad economics and bad finance we
[3:28:43.940 --> 3:28:47.020]  need to get through this stay with us mike adams here on the alex jones show we'll be

[3:29:59.060 --> 3:30:03.420]  in a one-world government currency a chinese communist social score to control every facet
[3:30:03.420 --> 3:30:09.140]  of our lives but now it's here they are using this coronavirus lockdown to tell all these
[3:30:09.140 --> 3:30:13.140]  shops and stores do not accept cash and now they're announcing all over the country they're
[3:30:13.140 --> 3:30:17.780]  going to stop accepting cash and only certain businesses can stay open well what do you
[3:30:17.780 --> 3:30:21.980]  do next to put the final nail in the coffin and launch the mark of the beast how stimulus
[3:30:21.980 --> 3:30:27.300]  bill envisions digital dollar to ease coronavirus recession only stores that are allowed to be
[3:30:27.300 --> 3:30:33.180]  open can accept it evil patriots and people of course can't use it and attracts everything
[3:30:33.180 --> 3:30:39.460]  you do so there it is folks mark of the beast global digital currency all being rolled out
[3:30:39.460 --> 3:30:46.260]  in this hysteria and a lot of people are buying into it so you've just green lit the globalist
[3:30:46.260 --> 3:30:51.020]  absolutely taking control of your lives but info wars predicted all from the very start
[3:30:51.020 --> 3:30:57.300]  that's where tomorrow's news today you have to look really hard at mainstream television
[3:30:57.300 --> 3:31:04.460]  news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it i did extensive
[3:31:04.460 --> 3:31:09.540]  searches online with different search engines i i did a bunch of research looking at different
[3:31:09.540 --> 3:31:16.020]  tv archives and i couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news stories with medical
[3:31:16.020 --> 3:31:23.580]  doctors on there talking about zinc zinc zinc the element on the periodic table that is
[3:31:23.580 --> 3:31:31.700]  essential to life and that is the most anti-viral natural compound out there in thousands and
[3:31:31.700 --> 3:31:37.940]  thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities including big studies on the
[3:31:37.940 --> 3:31:46.380]  coronavirus family so do yourself a favor search engine zinc and anti-viral three words
[3:31:46.380 --> 3:31:54.980]  zinc anti-viral zinc anti-viral do yourself a favor zinc anti-viral i made four police
[3:31:54.980 --> 3:32:02.620]  state films more than a decade ago specifically warning of the plan to suspend habeas corpus
[3:32:02.620 --> 3:32:07.780]  the right to even have access to a court the right to not be secretly arrested secretly
[3:32:07.780 --> 3:32:12.500]  disappeared and i wanted a patriot act they claimed was for terrorists was really for
[3:32:12.500 --> 3:32:18.020]  the american people well now they admit it is and bipartisanly the justice department
[3:32:18.020 --> 3:32:24.660]  is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear americans whenever they want under the guise
[3:32:24.660 --> 3:32:29.660]  of coronavirus but they just say during the emergency it'll be for every other crime you
[3:32:29.660 --> 3:32:37.380]  can imagine it's the chairing on top of a nice big fudge sunday called marshal law oh
[3:32:37.380 --> 3:32:42.020]  and the sprinkles on it it's the big great depression everybody's gonna have so folks
[3:32:42.020 --> 3:32:45.700]  are all excited that you're getting time off work oh you're gonna get time off from your
[3:32:45.700 --> 3:32:56.060]  whole future your family your health and forced inoculations and gun confiscation you're
[3:32:56.060 --> 3:33:13.500]  listening to the alex jones show waging war on corruption it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:33:13.500 --> 3:33:20.580]  all right we're gonna talk about some of the numbers and some of the risk factors and
[3:33:20.580 --> 3:33:26.660]  maybe some things that you can do to protect yourself as america gets into the more accelerated
[3:33:26.660 --> 3:33:33.220]  phase of the spread of this but on a personal note and a little bit of humor here you know
[3:33:33.220 --> 3:33:38.500]  if you're looking at my appearance yes my hair is getting crazy long i'm not obviously
[3:33:38.500 --> 3:33:44.420]  i can't get a haircut and this continues i'm gonna end up with a mullet like john from
[3:33:44.420 --> 3:33:50.540]  hall notes from the 1980s so you know we will we'll be sporting some real interesting hairdos
[3:33:50.540 --> 3:33:56.340]  probably pretty soon but whatever that's just the nature of where we are and you know i've
[3:33:56.340 --> 3:34:01.300]  been self-quarantine for for some time now and i'm growing food and i'm hatching baby
[3:34:01.300 --> 3:34:09.060]  chicks i've got i think now like 25 eggs in the incubator hoping to hatch a few dozen
[3:34:09.060 --> 3:34:15.540]  baby chicks and later this year i'll have free range eggs so i've stocked up on chicken
[3:34:15.540 --> 3:34:21.660]  feed and i'm planting potatoes which is a little late in the season for texas but whatever
[3:34:21.660 --> 3:34:26.820]  i encourage you to not only get stored food as alex mentioned earlier but also start thinking
[3:34:26.820 --> 3:34:30.940]  about growing your own food because that's really what's going to sustain you long term
[3:34:30.940 --> 3:34:35.820]  if the food supply shortages continue to to crater and it's really a question of how how
[3:34:35.820 --> 3:34:40.740]  much food can can make it to store shelves in the months ahead i've warned people just
[3:34:40.740 --> 3:34:46.180]  in case be prepared for not just six months but maybe a year but once you go beyond about
[3:34:46.180 --> 3:34:49.700]  six months or a year that's when you need to get into garden seeds and growing some
[3:34:49.700 --> 3:34:53.500]  food and planting some things you can plant onions and garlic and you can you can grow
[3:34:53.500 --> 3:34:59.140]  berries and and even kumquats and pomegranates and all kinds of things in many areas across
[3:34:59.140 --> 3:35:04.220]  the country so it's it's a good idea to do that and also those those fruits that i mentioned
[3:35:04.220 --> 3:35:08.500]  which are are sounding very delicious right now actually they contain vitamin c so they
[3:35:08.500 --> 3:35:13.940]  actually have nutrients and like the the peel of kumquats which are little small like
[3:35:13.940 --> 3:35:20.860]  citrus small oranges basically and you eat the peeling and that is very antiviral by
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:25.540]  the way so you can grow medicine at the same time that you're growing your food and i strongly
[3:35:25.540 --> 3:35:31.700]  encourage you to do that a couple of things to mention here i got a tip this morning i
[3:35:31.700 --> 3:35:37.860]  can't yet tell you the city because i'm sworn to silence on on that but i'm getting tips
[3:35:37.860 --> 3:35:44.460]  that the reefer trucks in the reefer truck manufacturers are getting hit with massive
[3:35:44.460 --> 3:35:51.820]  orders for trucks reefer trucks to be able to transport dead bodies in america because
[3:35:51.820 --> 3:35:56.620]  there's an anticipation of a lot more dead you know it's it's over a hundred dead per
[3:35:56.620 --> 3:36:02.060]  day now in america and that number continues to rise exponentially remembers about a month
[3:36:02.060 --> 3:36:06.300]  ago when i i was in studio with alex and i said that if you look at the numbers will
[3:36:06.300 --> 3:36:12.460]  have about five hundred and eighty deaths on april fourth and i remember that specifically
[3:36:12.460 --> 3:36:16.380]  because i remember getting calls and texts from people who said that's impossible we're
[3:36:16.380 --> 3:36:20.860]  never gonna have five hundred people die in america from this is gonna be over in two
[3:36:20.860 --> 3:36:26.860]  or three weeks well we had five hundred eighty deaths i think two days ago so my model was
[3:36:26.860 --> 3:36:32.580]  wrong in the sense that it was late it was too optimistic and depending on where this
[3:36:32.580 --> 3:36:37.540]  goes i'm convinced we're gonna see tens of thousands of of dead people in america mostly
[3:36:37.540 --> 3:36:42.740]  in the liberal cities by the way new york cities san francisco los angeles but also
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:46.940]  we're not going to escape this and in places like like texas in the cities houston san
[3:36:46.940 --> 3:36:53.860]  antonio austin and dowell's fortworth that it's it's earlier in texas and and the midwest
[3:36:53.860 --> 3:36:59.540]  and arizona and florida it's it's earlier in the curve but within two or three or maybe
[3:36:59.540 --> 3:37:04.220]  four weeks we're going to be closer to where new york city is right now in new york city
[3:37:04.220 --> 3:37:08.900]  is just about out of morgue space now that's that's on drudge right now that new york
[3:37:08.900 --> 3:37:12.660]  city is running out of space for for dead bodies and as a result i think that's why
[3:37:12.660 --> 3:37:17.780]  these orders are going in for the trucks the the reefer trucks to transport dead bodies
[3:37:17.780 --> 3:37:22.900]  now i don't know where they're transporting them to there's a question for you is it going
[3:37:22.900 --> 3:37:27.620]  to be some kind of mass grave thing or that doesn't make sense if they're infected so
[3:37:27.620 --> 3:37:33.220]  you you got to start thinking about mass cremations which gets into kind of the the china scenario
[3:37:33.220 --> 3:37:39.180]  right the the big mobile cremation containers but let's get to what you can do to help protect
[3:37:39.180 --> 3:37:43.980]  yourself the number one this is interesting the number one comorbidity factor that was
[3:37:43.980 --> 3:37:52.060]  found in i think seventy six percent of patients who died from corona virus was arterial hypertension
[3:37:52.060 --> 3:37:56.980]  which is basically high blood pressure so high blood pressure is probably the number
[3:37:56.980 --> 3:38:04.100]  one factor that that gets you more accelerates the timeline of dying from this so if you
[3:38:04.100 --> 3:38:10.340]  don't have high blood pressure your chances of dying go down significantly but here's
[3:38:10.340 --> 3:38:14.940]  a question i did the research on this the american heart association says that a hundred
[3:38:14.940 --> 3:38:19.660]  million americans have high blood pressure that's roughly a little bit under one-third
[3:38:19.660 --> 3:38:25.860]  of the population of the country and since that is predominantly an adult not not children
[3:38:25.860 --> 3:38:29.540]  it's it's more than one-third of adults have high blood pressure and most of those adults
[3:38:29.540 --> 3:38:34.740]  are controlling their high blood pressure using blood pressure medications and the question
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:42.340]  is does the medication which artificially lowers your blood pressure does that offer any protection
[3:38:42.340 --> 3:38:48.660]  from corona virus fatalities or does the medication make the fatalities worse and right now we
[3:38:48.660 --> 3:38:53.340]  don't have any data on that so it could be either way we honestly don't know yet but
[3:38:53.340 --> 3:38:59.020]  if you have high blood pressure then there are some things that you can do right now
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:39:04.620]  you can of course reduce your intake of sodium which by the way is very high in storeable
[3:39:04.620 --> 3:39:09.300]  foods and canned soups a lot of people are buying Campbell's soups off the shelf well
[3:39:09.300 --> 3:39:14.380]  they're loaded with sodium some of those soups have what 800 milligrams of sodium in a can
[3:39:14.380 --> 3:39:20.740]  or more a lot of the stored snack chips and so on have very high sodium which can inflate
[3:39:20.740 --> 3:39:24.700]  blood pressure so you would want to avoid those things if you're in this category of
[3:39:24.700 --> 3:39:28.540]  having high blood pressure and there are also foods that you can eat that lower blood pressure
[3:39:28.540 --> 3:39:32.940]  such as watermelons and cucumbers and basically celery fresh fruits and vegetables all the
[3:39:32.940 --> 3:39:37.180]  things that you might imagine eating healthy can literally save your life in the sense
[3:39:37.180 --> 3:39:41.540]  of reducing your risk of dying from the corona virus the other thing that came out of that
[3:39:41.540 --> 3:39:48.320]  same study which is good news for all of us is that fewer than 1% of those who died from
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:55.180]  corona virus had no comorbidity factors in other words perfectly healthy people who did
[3:39:55.180 --> 3:39:59.060]  not have heart disease did not have diabetes did not have strokes did not have underlying
[3:39:59.060 --> 3:40:05.860]  conditions they did not die in big numbers at all so healthy people even though they
[3:40:05.860 --> 3:40:10.100]  may go into serious medical conditions they may have permanent lung damage they still
[3:40:10.100 --> 3:40:15.900]  survived and pulled through almost everybody who died over 99% of those who died had some
[3:40:15.900 --> 3:40:22.820]  other risk factor such as diabetes and the things I just mentioned but in America today
[3:40:22.820 --> 3:40:27.820]  we live in a nation that is the least healthy nation in the world and so if we're comparing
[3:40:27.820 --> 3:40:33.700]  ourselves to Italy well yes Italy has a much older population but America has a less healthy
[3:40:33.700 --> 3:40:39.300]  population we have sedentary lifestyles we have people who are on 12 different medications
[3:40:39.300 --> 3:40:43.540]  because they have 12 different underlying conditions and I believe that the virus is
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:48.580]  predominantly in America going to kill those individuals who have health problems which
[3:40:48.580 --> 3:40:53.420]  sadly as we just showed you know 100 million Americans have high blood pressure so there's
[3:40:53.420 --> 3:41:00.260]  a potential for this to really sweep through the US population that depends on pharmaceuticals
[3:41:00.260 --> 3:41:05.020]  that has underlying health conditions that has not resorted to healthier lifestyles or
[3:41:05.020 --> 3:41:08.900]  healthier living and you know I'm trying to say that's just very very calmly and very
[3:41:08.900 --> 3:41:13.460]  matter of fact but the truth is if you ever needed an excuse to get healthier and stop
[3:41:13.460 --> 3:41:19.860]  eating the junk food and maybe make more smoothies and boost your intake of nutraceuticals
[3:41:19.860 --> 3:41:24.140]  and nutritional supplements or vitamins or just healthy eating fresh vegetables grow
[3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:29.380]  your own food sprout your own food this is it folks this is the time to do it and you
[3:41:29.380 --> 3:41:34.020]  can make a difference by starting today you could start sprouting food today you could
[3:41:34.020 --> 3:41:38.580]  have broccoli sprouts or alfalfa sprouts or whatever you have and you can take your zinc
[3:41:38.580 --> 3:41:42.980]  tablets and crush up the zinc into a powder and mix it in with the water that you're using
[3:41:42.980 --> 3:41:49.940]  to irrigate your sprouts and you could sprout bioavailable zinc rich sprouts which could
[3:41:49.940 --> 3:41:53.940]  save your life literally save your life and I don't even I'm not selling sprouts or anything
[3:41:53.940 --> 3:41:57.780]  like that I'm just trying to help you stay alive this is the time to do it you can have
[3:41:57.780 --> 3:42:02.180]  sprouts to eat in three days you could lower your blood pressure in a week you could boost
[3:42:02.180 --> 3:42:07.900]  your zinc intake almost immediately you could be healthier tomorrow what are you waiting
[3:42:07.900 --> 3:42:13.460]  for we know that that healthy people mostly don't die from this it's the unhealthy people
[3:42:13.460 --> 3:42:18.900]  who die predominantly that's who's dying right now but people are dying at almost any age
[3:42:18.900 --> 3:42:23.580]  so an unhealthy person in the 20s or 30s or 40s can still die from this so being young
[3:42:23.580 --> 3:42:28.180]  doesn't make you immune but being healthy makes you immune that's the takeaway that's
[3:42:28.180 --> 3:42:32.180]  the big news here that's the good news here so why aren't we telling people to get healthy
[3:42:32.180 --> 3:42:35.820]  across the nation instead of waiting for a vaccine well we'll answer that on the other
[3:42:35.820 --> 3:42:52.540]  side of this as Mike Adams here on the Alice Jones show we'll be back with much more.
[3:42:52.540 --> 3:42:59.900]  Every week every day every hour every minute every second right now is critical history
[3:42:59.900 --> 3:43:04.220]  is happening right in front of us and we can't be spectators we've got to be men and women
[3:43:04.220 --> 3:43:09.740]  in the arena regardless of race color creed age sexual privacy doesn't matter the globalist
[3:43:09.740 --> 3:43:14.300]  with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge their economy and start a new depression
[3:43:14.300 --> 3:43:18.820]  China who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy while
[3:43:18.820 --> 3:43:23.620]  ours is going into a free fall spiral and Trump's desperately trying to restart it and
[3:43:23.620 --> 3:43:28.620]  create confidence and the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China just a month
[3:43:28.620 --> 3:43:34.140]  or so ago and their response is saying Trump is terrible because they want America to fail
[3:43:34.140 --> 3:43:38.980]  they want you to fail but you can expose them you can speak out you can share the articles
[3:43:38.980 --> 3:43:43.980]  and videos and reports at info wars and bandot video that exposed them and the globalist
[3:43:43.980 --> 3:43:48.620]  will go down it's already blowing up in their face right now so press the attack on the
[3:43:48.620 --> 3:43:55.740]  info war and defeat the NWO Newtonian physics documents the fact that for every action there's
[3:43:55.740 --> 3:44:01.580]  an opposite and equal reaction and that matter is not destroyed it is simply transferred into
[3:44:01.580 --> 3:44:06.380]  another form well we're seeing that happen right now the globalists are openly trying
[3:44:06.380 --> 3:44:10.340]  to hype up the coronavirus trying to kill our economy and trying to have martial law
[3:44:10.340 --> 3:44:14.860]  shut down around the country and trying to stampede Trump into implementing it so they
[3:44:14.860 --> 3:44:19.420]  could blame the imploding economy on him but Trump has seen through it and so he's
[3:44:19.420 --> 3:44:24.380]  let them implement the draconian controls and is saying do you really want a depression
[3:44:24.380 --> 3:44:28.500]  for something that's killed far less than the flu ladies and gentlemen now is the fight
[3:44:28.500 --> 3:44:34.060]  of our lives and the good news is their attack on humanity and on independent media has caused
[3:44:34.060 --> 3:44:38.860]  a lot of people to start thinking for themselves and so the traffic to info wars dot com and
[3:44:38.860 --> 3:44:44.900]  bandot video is triple our previous records right now so you're doing a great job spreading
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:48.940]  the word and people are tuning in to find out the truth like never before because of
[3:44:48.940 --> 3:45:00.340]  you the modern paul reveres for more than eight weeks info wars has researched this deadly
[3:45:00.340 --> 3:45:01.900]  coronavirus and it is deadly it targets those who already have pre-existing conditions compromise
[3:45:01.900 --> 3:45:07.380]  immune systems and those over 70 particularly bad it is deadly but the globalists are hyping
[3:45:07.380 --> 3:45:12.180]  it as an economic and psychological warfare weapon to implement martial law and throw
[3:45:12.180 --> 3:45:17.900]  Trump out of office but regardless the mainstream media will not tell you about natural compounds
[3:45:17.900 --> 3:45:23.460]  that are known to be extremely antiviral like zinc so I don't care where you get zinc for
[3:45:23.460 --> 3:45:28.060]  yourself your parents and grandparents your children please go out and research zinc and
[3:45:28.060 --> 3:45:32.940]  then know that we have three different formulas that have zinc in them at a very nice dosage
[3:45:32.940 --> 3:45:38.700]  level real red pill real red pill plus and vitamin mineral fusion and all of these products
[3:45:38.700 --> 3:45:43.740]  are 40 and 50% off right now at info wars store dot com even though we're very very close
[3:45:43.740 --> 3:45:49.300]  to selling them out you ship within 24 hours to secure yours today and boost your defense
[3:45:49.300 --> 3:46:00.100]  at info or store dot com the globalist and the enemy of the people corporate media have
[3:46:00.100 --> 3:46:06.860]  worked overtime like the devil to destroy all independent pro america truth-based media
[3:46:06.860 --> 3:46:11.180]  and chief amongst their enemy has been info wars but thanks to you spreading the word
[3:46:11.180 --> 3:46:15.660]  that thanks to you supporting info wars we are still on the air and have actually expanded
[3:46:15.660 --> 3:46:20.180]  in the face of their tyranny it is now more critical than ever that you take this opportunity
[3:46:20.180 --> 3:46:25.220]  to share band on video info wars dot com and the articles and reports that are so critical
[3:46:25.220 --> 3:46:29.860]  because the world is waking up and needs this information now more than ever for myself and
[3:46:29.860 --> 3:46:36.500]  the info wars crew you have our undying pledge and commitment to fight these tyrants harder
[3:46:36.500 --> 3:46:42.100]  than we ever have before and to defend basic freedom and justice and the american way of
[3:46:42.100 --> 3:46:48.020]  life this is the crossroads america and the planet in the balance whatever you do please
[3:46:48.020 --> 3:46:58.500]  take action and spread the word god bless and good luck you're listening to the alex
[3:46:58.500 --> 3:47:13.380]  jones show big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[3:47:13.380 --> 3:47:21.180]  it's mike adams our final segment for today here on the alex jones show i'm gonna rapid
[3:47:21.180 --> 3:47:26.940]  fire some hot button issues here so much to cover kaiser permanent a and this was covered
[3:47:26.940 --> 3:47:32.900]  by the intercept we also covered it at natural news has threatened to fire nurses for wearing
[3:47:32.900 --> 3:47:39.740]  their own n95 masks as they are treating coronavirus infected patients and the healthcare workers
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:45.860]  unions are up in arms over this obviously this is an attempt in my opinion by kaiser permanent
[3:47:45.860 --> 3:47:51.780]  a to spread the virus why on earth would you tell nurses to not wear masks so that there
[3:47:51.780 --> 3:47:56.460]  have been efforts in california to deliberately spread the virus to make it worse the cdc
[3:47:56.460 --> 3:48:00.980]  of of course withheld testing kits from the entire nation for almost four weeks back in
[3:48:00.980 --> 3:48:08.300]  february and we've had what sacramento county in california announced an end to all quarantines
[3:48:08.300 --> 3:48:12.540]  and isolation just letting letting everybody just interact with the public in order to
[3:48:12.540 --> 3:48:18.220]  spread it more aggressively and then i think two days ago los angeles county told doctors
[3:48:18.220 --> 3:48:22.540]  to stop testing for the virus they said it's it's over we surrendered to the virus we're
[3:48:22.540 --> 3:48:28.060]  not even going to test anybody anymore just going to let it spread and hope we can deal
[3:48:28.060 --> 3:48:33.940]  with the infections in the hospitals that is a that that's like a suicide pact for california
[3:48:33.940 --> 3:48:38.620]  but it's all an attempt to make it worse i think probably to embarrass trump to have
[3:48:38.620 --> 3:48:43.620]  a bigger crisis to have a bigger crash this is how the democrats are using exploiting
[3:48:43.620 --> 3:48:49.260]  this crisis to make things worse for america tucker carlson is correct when he says that
[3:48:49.260 --> 3:48:54.900]  big tech censorship is in the way here of people getting access to good information
[3:48:54.900 --> 3:48:59.180]  about how to prevent the spread of this and even natural cures the kinds of things that
[3:48:59.180 --> 3:49:04.580]  i talk about a lot we're censored everywhere if trump should issue any executive order
[3:49:04.580 --> 3:49:09.220]  right now it should be to end the censorship at least during the pandemic you know you
[3:49:09.220 --> 3:49:15.660]  can re-censor us after the pandemic but right now stop the censorship of voices that are
[3:49:15.660 --> 3:49:20.260]  trying to help america get ahead of this and stop the infections but you know of course
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:26.300]  jack dorsi at twitter they will gladly allow beijing to push their communist chinese propaganda
[3:49:26.300 --> 3:49:32.820]  on twitter but an american patriot like myself can't tell people to take vitamin c that's
[3:49:32.820 --> 3:49:38.740]  banned so so twitter is nothing but a communist chinese front now and google is the same thing
[3:49:38.740 --> 3:49:42.500]  and facebook is the same thing youtube is the same thing so it's time to stop that it's
[3:49:42.500 --> 3:49:48.740]  time to end that in fact it's time for america to end any reliance on communist china and
[3:49:48.740 --> 3:49:53.540]  i hope that some one of the silver linings of all of this is that maybe there's a wake
[3:49:53.540 --> 3:49:57.980]  up call that we need industry here in america that we need to stop allowing china to buy
[3:49:57.980 --> 3:50:03.580]  off universities and buy off senators like feinstein who of course sold millions of dollars
[3:50:03.580 --> 3:50:09.300]  worth of stocks reportedly after that that classified briefing right remember that briefing
[3:50:09.300 --> 3:50:13.700]  back in january when they got information from the cdco then and some republican senators
[3:50:13.700 --> 3:50:17.060]  too they also sold millions of dollars worth of stocks while they were telling the public
[3:50:17.060 --> 3:50:26.020]  everything was fine okay i also believe that trump should recommend healthy living advice
[3:50:26.020 --> 3:50:29.820]  for the american people for the reasons i just spoke about in the last segment that high
[3:50:29.820 --> 3:50:34.420]  blood pressure is the number one comorbidity factor in this and if you have high blood
[3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:39.620]  pressure you can start healing that today but it takes nutrition it takes eating better
[3:50:39.620 --> 3:50:43.940]  fresh fruits and vegetables maybe some nutritional supplements or nutraceuticals can help as
[3:50:43.940 --> 3:50:48.760]  well but getting off the junk food getting off the canned soups from from camels getting
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:52.900]  off the high sodium food and so even those of you who are eating stored food during this
[3:50:52.900 --> 3:50:57.180]  will watch your sodium intake as well and i know the stored food is important but you
[3:50:57.180 --> 3:51:02.580]  might drink more water for example you know or you might even exercise on a treadmill in
[3:51:02.580 --> 3:51:08.260]  your lockdown home or apartment so you can sweat out excess sodium which will also help
[3:51:08.260 --> 3:51:14.860]  lower your blood pressure the number of deaths in italy is declining because italy is just
[3:51:14.860 --> 3:51:20.260]  about to get over the hump of new infections there's a lag time behind the time when they
[3:51:20.260 --> 3:51:26.940]  had that very aggressive lockdown and so that lockdown is producing results for italy and
[3:51:26.940 --> 3:51:31.540]  they're going to start to see a more accelerated decline in the number of deaths it's already
[3:51:31.540 --> 3:51:35.940]  begun and it will continue the question is how do they exit the lockdown there's a lot
[3:51:35.940 --> 3:51:39.700]  of talk about there about the exit strategies how do we end these lockdowns and get people
[3:51:39.700 --> 3:51:44.300]  back to work but without reintroducing new infections back into the population where
[3:51:44.300 --> 3:51:49.060]  we end up with a another repeated lockdown which we absolutely want to avoid i don't
[3:51:49.060 --> 3:51:54.020]  have the answers for all that right now but it's something that's being talked about also
[3:51:54.020 --> 3:51:59.460]  an important note because so many people chose to treat their high blood pressure with pharmaceuticals
[3:51:59.460 --> 3:52:04.500]  rather than having healthy lifestyles we now have a situation where i believe big pharma
[3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:10.940]  will be killing more americans than the corona virus it's people's reliance on the drugs
[3:52:10.940 --> 3:52:16.900]  that has given them a cover for their health symptoms rather than treating the underlying
[3:52:16.900 --> 3:52:21.900]  condition which is hey you're eating junk foods you have a sedentary lifestyle you need
[3:52:21.900 --> 3:52:26.980]  to exercise more even in mild ways just walking you need to eat healthier instead of telling
[3:52:26.980 --> 3:52:32.260]  people to do that all the doctors across america told people not just take these drugs just
[3:52:32.260 --> 3:52:35.620]  take this pill here's a statin drug here's a blood pressure drug here's an Alzheimer's
[3:52:35.620 --> 3:52:40.700]  drug here's a depression drug here's an erectile dysfunction drug so people live it on drugs
[3:52:40.700 --> 3:52:45.840]  which allowed them to pretend like they weren't sick but they are sick they're still sick they're
[3:52:45.840 --> 3:52:49.940]  relying on big pharma that's what's going to get them killed because the corona virus
[3:52:49.940 --> 3:52:55.900]  kills people who have underlying health conditions so we are a big pharma nation more americans
[3:52:55.900 --> 3:53:00.940]  are on more drugs than any other nation any other population in the world and that i
[3:53:00.940 --> 3:53:05.620]  believe is going to result in a very high case fatality rate in america maybe matching
[3:53:05.620 --> 3:53:11.060]  that of italy possibly we'll see we'll see where this goes but maybe the lesson from
[3:53:11.060 --> 3:53:17.860]  this is don't hook your population on pharmaceuticals when you should be recommending even doctors
[3:53:17.860 --> 3:53:22.700]  should be recommending eat healthier folks eat healthier have an apple every once in
[3:53:22.700 --> 3:53:27.660]  a while instead of just cookies and fried chicken nuggets and everything all the time
[3:53:27.660 --> 3:53:31.740]  have a freaking apple eat a chunk of celery with peanut butter on it there's nothing wrong
[3:53:31.740 --> 3:53:37.260]  with that you know be healthier and you won't die that's that's a very important message
[3:53:37.260 --> 3:53:42.620]  another important point currently there's no testing of asymptomatic carriers in the
[3:53:42.620 --> 3:53:48.060]  united states and senator ran paul mentioned this as well he did not qualify for testing
[3:53:48.060 --> 3:53:52.660]  under normal circumstances he would never have been tested well i have a big warning
[3:53:52.660 --> 3:53:59.380]  on this for all of america and even for president trump if you don't test the asymptomatic carriers
[3:53:59.380 --> 3:54:04.500]  you will never identify those who are spreading the infections you will never be able to really
[3:54:04.500 --> 3:54:09.500]  lock this down so you're going to have to sooner or later expand the testing to people
[3:54:09.500 --> 3:54:14.220]  who have no symptoms you can't just test the people who are symptomatic you'll never find
[3:54:14.220 --> 3:54:19.940]  all the cases and so the spread of this across america is going to continue and it's going
[3:54:19.940 --> 3:54:27.660]  to accelerate and one one of my big concerns is that texas for example will become more
[3:54:27.660 --> 3:54:33.180]  like new york at some point certain cities in texas now rural america is going to be
[3:54:33.180 --> 3:54:38.180]  in relatively good shape you've got the low population densities you've got people having
[3:54:38.180 --> 3:54:43.060]  more outdoors time and frankly people are healthier in rural america at least those
[3:54:43.060 --> 3:54:47.860]  who live on farms and and grow some of their own food they're way healthier so rural america
[3:54:47.860 --> 3:54:51.860]  will never i don't think will be subjected to these harsh draconian lockdowns but the
[3:54:51.860 --> 3:54:56.340]  cities which is where most people live the cities are going to be really death zones
[3:54:56.340 --> 3:55:02.220]  and you'll see what i'm talking about in about three to four weeks it's going to happen across
[3:55:02.220 --> 3:55:07.100]  america because of big pharma because of of the underlying health conditions and because
[3:55:07.100 --> 3:55:13.700]  of the lack of testing of asymptomatic carriers so with that said i think that i know that
[3:55:13.700 --> 3:55:18.820]  opinions vary among all the different guests here on info wars dot com and i think you
[3:55:18.820 --> 3:55:26.220]  know where i stand on this this is a very real pandemic it's going to kill if it kills
[3:55:26.220 --> 3:55:30.620]  less than 100 000 americans at the end of all this i'll be amazed i'm convinced it's
[3:55:30.620 --> 3:55:35.260]  going to kill at least 100 000 americans although it may take some time and and and hopefully
[3:55:35.260 --> 3:55:40.900]  we can slow that maybe there's going to be a miracle drug maybe a miracle vaccine i doubt
[3:55:40.900 --> 3:55:46.100]  it the vaccine will probably be more dangerous than the epidemic but things could change
[3:55:46.100 --> 3:55:50.660]  and it also depends on how we as a nation respond to this but my advice right now to
[3:55:50.660 --> 3:55:57.820]  anyone watching and listening is get healthy get prepared because we're only just beginning
[3:55:57.820 --> 3:56:03.020]  this in america right now but also get out of the dollar because eventually the dollar
[3:56:03.020 --> 3:56:08.300]  is going to crater the the banks will eventually some of them will go down and if you don't
[3:56:08.300 --> 3:56:12.540]  convert your dollars into things like gold and silver and land and firearms and ammo
[3:56:12.540 --> 3:56:17.420]  and things that hold value you're going to lose everything you're going to lose your
[3:56:17.420 --> 3:56:20.620]  money you're going to lose your pensions you're going to if you don't convert to things other
[3:56:20.620 --> 3:56:25.020]  than the dollar now the dollar will spike in the short term as more economic failures
[3:56:25.020 --> 3:56:29.620]  in other countries lead people to rush into the dollar as a safe haven but that's only
[3:56:29.620 --> 3:56:34.500]  temporary a few months later the dollar will crater and with all this bailout money out
[3:56:34.500 --> 3:56:40.860]  there the dollar is going to lose purchasing power by the day so the long term strategy
[3:56:40.860 --> 3:56:45.740]  for you to survive is get healthy get out of the dollar and get out of the cities and
[3:56:45.740 --> 3:56:50.220]  that's it that's that's my best advice right now for today and that's those are things
[3:56:50.220 --> 3:56:53.820]  that i have done and those are things i'm recommending to everybody i know and those
[3:56:53.820 --> 3:56:59.580]  are things that will keep you alive and will help you have some assets still under your
[3:56:59.580 --> 3:57:04.460]  ownership when all this is said and done now whether we have any liberty left is another
[3:57:04.460 --> 3:57:09.140]  conversation i don't know but i'll tell you what i'm not giving up my guns and i'm going
[3:57:09.140 --> 3:57:13.620]  to demand my first amendment rights of course my second amendment rights as well and i don't
[3:57:13.620 --> 3:57:17.700]  want to be surveilled by the government and i'm going to fight for liberty but in order
[3:57:17.700 --> 3:57:22.180]  to do that we have to stay alive and we have to have assets so there's a lot of priorities
[3:57:22.180 --> 3:57:27.260]  right now if you do all this right we can get through this together thank you for watching
[3:57:27.260 --> 3:57:31.420]  mike Adams here the health ranger for the alex jones show i'll join you again in a week
[3:57:31.420 --> 3:57:57.780]  with more information take care
