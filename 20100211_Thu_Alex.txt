[03:11.720 --> 03:16.360]  in a manner that's more mainline meant to make the yuppies feel more comfortable

[05:03.240 --> 05:07.640]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[05:11.560 --> 05:15.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.880]  it's true total government control of electricity
[05:17.880 --> 05:21.400]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.000]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.720 --> 05:32.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[05:32.440 --> 05:35.560]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.680]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.680 --> 05:42.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[05:42.120 --> 05:45.320]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[08:58.360 --> 09:01.960]  what's really going on reading in between the lines
[09:01.960 --> 09:06.760]  going over the stories that are on page 17c
[09:06.760 --> 09:09.560]  the important things that are hidden in the background
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.040]  as they feed you a buffet of lies you literally have to search for the
[09:14.040 --> 09:17.480]  crumbs of truth well we expose the crumbs of truth
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.320]  every day on this program and getting back to this
[09:23.320 --> 09:28.840]  tea party movement this hijacking of well-meaning constitutionalists out
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.360]  there people that are trying to do something good for the
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.400]  country people that believe in the founding fathers
[09:35.400 --> 09:40.840]  people believe in the principles of smaller government
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.520]  and human rights real human rights not the kind of human rights the un says
[09:44.520 --> 09:48.600]  that you're granted under their authority god given
[09:48.600 --> 09:53.240]  human rights the right to be secure in your person and property
[09:53.240 --> 09:55.960]  the right to keep big government out of your life
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.600]  the right not to be taxed to death and we're gonna get on the tax run because
[10:00.600 --> 10:03.880]  the things that obama are saying obama agnostic
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.560]  on deficit cuts and tax increases president obama said he was agnostic
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.840]  about raising taxes on households making less than $250,000 a year
[10:14.840 --> 10:18.760]  as part of a broad effort to rein in the budget deficit
[10:18.760 --> 10:26.120]  do you understand they gave out $27 trillion and now obama is agnostic
[10:26.120 --> 10:29.960]  on taxing those making less than a quarter million dollars a year in their
[10:29.960 --> 10:33.160]  homes quarter million ain't what it used to be folks
[10:33.160 --> 10:36.840]  you got a wife you got two or three kids you got two cars
[10:36.840 --> 10:41.640]  you got a mortgage payment $250,000 before taxes
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.040]  quickly quickly turns into about a hundred fifty
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.120]  hundred seventy five thousand dollars before any expenses
[10:50.120 --> 10:56.120]  and they will expense you like no other but again getting back to the tea party
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.120]  movement and sarah painlin in particular now the big
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.320]  stories oh she wrote on her hand she's just like
[11:03.320 --> 11:09.160]  everybody else she needs to cheat to what does it say about america
[11:09.160 --> 11:12.680]  when we look up to leaders who are cheating
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.440]  in the open do we like this kind of behavior
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.360]  is that what we've become a nation of consumers and cheaters
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.520]  so obsessed with things like the ipad that nothing else matters
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.880]  that trinket toys are more important than our families
[11:29.880 --> 11:34.760]  our friends our livelihood the state of the nation
[11:34.760 --> 11:40.040]  and i've got proof of that in my stack you know i just talked about that $27
[11:40.040 --> 11:44.680]  trillion let that sink in $27 trillion
[11:44.680 --> 11:51.880]  $27 trillion and again they give the crumbs to the public
[11:51.880 --> 11:59.240]  okay $350,000 of the stimulus package went to poke county
[11:59.240 --> 12:04.200]  a little school district what did poke county do with their $350,000
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.160]  let me tell you what they did they bought ipad
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.920]  or not ipads ipods for the kids parents
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.400]  oh that's a great way to spend $350,000 for education
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.840]  ipods for the kids parents i can't make this stuff up
[12:18.840 --> 12:22.200]  poke school district to give ipods to some parents
[12:22.200 --> 12:25.240]  the poke county school district is giving away ipods to some parents the
[12:25.240 --> 12:28.600]  school district is using the device to reward parents of children with
[12:28.600 --> 12:32.280]  disabilities who fill out a 10-minute online survey
[12:32.280 --> 12:36.040]  the district wants to know um how long it's connecting with parents and how
[12:36.040 --> 12:39.000]  the parents get involved in their children's education
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.760]  so let's give them an ipod how about a phone call
[12:42.760 --> 12:47.240]  how about a meeting how about the teacher getting together with the parent
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.040]  and the student who has this learning disability
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.200]  how about not just spending a bunch of money on ipods
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.520]  and again it's crumbs $350,000 that's laughable
[12:58.520 --> 13:02.440]  in comparison to what the bankers have stolen
[13:02.440 --> 13:05.960]  giving each other hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses sometimes
[13:05.960 --> 13:11.880]  billions in bonuses because most of us can't even wrap our
[13:11.880 --> 13:16.680]  heads around what 27 trillion dollars really is
[13:16.680 --> 13:19.880]  and that is an old number let me repeat that that is an old
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.240]  number who knows we could be up to 35 40 trillion by now
[13:23.240 --> 13:26.520]  they're not going to tell us the truth anyway we know this
[13:26.520 --> 13:31.240]  we know this the emails from aig and tim geithner
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.760]  have leaked we know it we know they were instructed
[13:36.760 --> 13:42.280]  almost under the national security act not to tell where the money went
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.600]  and then you got hacks like jim kramer getting up on his cnbc show
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.520]  saying you know what as a commentator i should be able to say this
[13:52.520 --> 13:57.480]  i'm going to say it the babarian illuminati the trilateral commission
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.880]  leeman brothers and the queen england aren't all bad
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.280]  and his little correspondent next to him is in such shock that he just let this
[14:06.280 --> 14:08.520]  bomb drop first of all the babarian illuminati
[14:08.520 --> 14:12.360]  supposedly doesn't exist the trilateral commission doesn't have any power
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.520]  the queen is a figurehead and leeman brothers must not exist either
[14:16.520 --> 14:19.160]  i mean that's the main line talking points is the these are things you're
[14:19.160 --> 14:22.280]  not supposed to be concerned about but then all the sudden you have this guy
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.000]  step up and say not only are they the power structure but they're good
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.120]  they're so good and the woman standing next to him goes
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.200]  wow and then just immediately moves on does not want to discuss
[14:34.200 --> 14:40.520]  what her boss just talked about but we do need to discuss it we do need to talk
[14:40.520 --> 14:44.280]  about how our country is being hijacked by these phonies
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.320]  and sarah palin folks is one of these phonies
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.800]  now off a cnn they just recently did a poll and 71 percent of the public says
[14:53.800 --> 14:56.920]  the former alaska governor is not qualified to serve in the white house
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.560]  absolutely not qualified let me repeat that she is not qualified
[15:01.560 --> 15:04.680]  to be the next president of the united states vice president of the united states
[15:04.680 --> 15:08.040]  i don't think she could have a cabinet position
[15:08.040 --> 15:11.640]  she sounds like mrs pearl from the hogan family
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.560]  and because america is so tv obsessed and pop culture obsessed
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.480]  they see a pretty face with an accent that's willing to go on saturday night
[15:19.480 --> 15:25.240]  live and we love her but it's all an illusion when 71 percent
[15:25.240 --> 15:29.880]  still say that she's not fit to hold office you know the height machine
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.160]  is at work trying to pump her into your psyche
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.200]  as the next big thing and obviously their target audience
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.320]  are mainline republicans and conservatives and those who have woken up
[15:43.320 --> 15:47.880]  somewhat to the pseudo fascist state that we live under again it's not about
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.400]  the obama administration it's not about the first bush administration the
[15:51.400 --> 15:54.680]  second bush administration the clinton administration
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.840]  they're all in lockstep with one another gradually
[15:58.840 --> 16:05.080]  through incrementalism they have marched toward a global government
[16:05.080 --> 16:08.360]  that's what this kopenhagen treaty was all about
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.440]  have we forgotten what they tried to put on paper
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.920]  have we forgotten that they actually signed a three page accord that was so
[16:16.920 --> 16:22.680]  broad that it did actually in fact create a high-level global panel
[16:22.680 --> 16:27.000]  that they want to use again to launch their global government that actually
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.760]  happened you know they didn't get the 185
[16:30.760 --> 16:34.280]  states or nations to sign on to it like they wanted to but they got some of the
[16:34.280 --> 16:38.200]  big players in there and by the way i had to get to this
[16:38.200 --> 16:42.280]  china is now coming up and saying that the whole thing
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.520]  was a scam now i'm not in love with china folks in fact i'm one of its big
[16:46.520 --> 16:50.120]  biggest critics i was thoroughly horrified and
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.640]  disgusted this year when on the 60th anniversary of the
[16:55.640 --> 17:00.920]  Mao communist chinese regime the Mao regime
[17:00.920 --> 17:05.640]  we decided it would be a good idea to like the empire state building up in
[17:05.640 --> 17:09.400]  china's colors horrified and disgusted couldn't believe
[17:09.400 --> 17:13.960]  my nation had fallen in such a manner but it did
[17:13.960 --> 17:17.560]  but i have got a look at this not everybody in china is bad
[17:17.560 --> 17:19.640]  and this is out of the guardian you're probably not going to see this in the
[17:19.640 --> 17:23.480]  us press but for some reason the united kingdom
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.760]  london they're talking about the climate change scandal
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.400]  china fears of rich nation climate conspiracy at copenhagen revealed
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.640]  conspiracy to divide developing world will make future talks harder
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.080]  says leaked government report
[17:39.080 --> 17:44.600]  i can't even pronounce this guy's name uh... but uh... i'm gonna try
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.560]  zai zenhua at the u n talks in copenhagen december 2009 said recently
[17:49.560 --> 17:53.000]  that rich nations were completely trying to make conflict
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.240]  among developing countries rich nations further their conspiracy divide the
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.160]  developing world at december's u n climate summit in copenhagen
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.160]  well canada convene or a connived and the e u acted
[18:05.160 --> 18:08.440]  to please the united states according to an internal document
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.520]  from chinese government think tank obtained by the guardian
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.720]  the document which was written in the immediate aftermath of copenhagen but
[18:15.720 --> 18:19.640]  has now only come to life provides the most candid insight yet into chinese
[18:19.640 --> 18:22.680]  thinking on the on the uh... fraught summit
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.840]  it was unprecedented or unprecedented for a conference negotiating process to
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.120]  be so complicated for the arguments to be so intense for the
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.720]  disputers to be so wide and the progress to be so slow
[18:33.720 --> 18:37.080]  notes the special report well it wasn't about saving the planet
[18:37.080 --> 18:41.880]  that is the front that is the cover the planet is okay
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.000]  and you know i'm pretty agnostic out there
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.600]  but if there is a god boy did he come through this year
[18:48.600 --> 18:53.480]  just as they're about to pass this nightmarish legislation
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.040]  this global government takeover in copenhagen what happens
[18:58.040 --> 19:02.360]  the emails of phil jones michael man and the rest of the u n stuges
[19:02.360 --> 19:07.160]  leaks online an insider a hacker someone released them
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.760]  and these things are the death blow you know i'm covering some of this
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.120]  in my upcoming film invisible empire a new world order to find
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.080]  the outmarch 30th and one of the emails
[19:21.080 --> 19:24.520]  from phil jones clearly states clearly states
[19:24.520 --> 19:27.640]  how would the scientific community embrace me
[19:27.640 --> 19:33.560]  if i were to report that the earth has actually been cooling for the last seven
[19:33.560 --> 19:39.320]  years this is in 2005 2005 they knew
[19:39.320 --> 19:44.680]  he says it's been cooling since 1998 but that's not statistically significant
[19:44.680 --> 19:49.080]  and then they dump all the raw data so no one can look at it
[19:49.080 --> 19:52.200]  it's the alex jones show we'll be back after this go check us out over at

[21:04.280 --> 21:07.960]  currency to ensure purity content weights and measures
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.000]  of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.480]  this reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system
[21:15.480 --> 21:19.560]  wisdom being lost with time the government we once entrusted to protect
[21:19.560 --> 21:22.280]  from counterfeit has colluded with private business
[21:22.280 --> 21:26.680]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced
[21:26.680 --> 21:30.520]  this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable
[21:30.520 --> 21:33.880]  to our elected government but has also caused the dollar to lose more than
[21:33.880 --> 21:37.400]  90 cents of its original value now foreign governments are trying to
[21:37.400 --> 21:40.680]  divest themselves from this once world reserve currency

[22:06.360 --> 22:09.560]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[22:09.560 --> 22:13.560]  is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[22:13.560 --> 22:16.760]  americans at home and have turned a tremendous influence
[22:16.760 --> 22:20.760]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.960]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[22:25.960 --> 22:29.960]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[22:29.960 --> 22:33.640]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[22:33.640 --> 22:36.920]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[22:36.920 --> 22:40.680]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[22:40.680 --> 22:44.520]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[24:17.080 --> 24:21.160]  out on assignment
[24:21.160 --> 24:26.200]  we were just hitting up the tea party movement
[24:26.200 --> 24:31.240]  talking about how palin and others have really come in and hijacked this thing
[24:31.240 --> 24:34.920]  look if they're giving palin a show on fox news
[24:34.920 --> 24:39.320]  if she's being courted by rooper murdoch
[24:39.320 --> 24:44.520]  if you can see the literal talking points on her hand which is totally staged
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.040]  folks okay she could have been more incognito than
[24:48.040 --> 24:51.080]  putting it on her hand she did that on purpose so she would get
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.760]  press for it and there is a long way to go before 2012
[24:56.760 --> 24:59.800]  but let's say she doesn't even run in 2012 what they'll do
[24:59.800 --> 25:02.920]  is they will capitalize on her current popularity
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.960]  to try to hijack elections locally like the one in texas
[25:07.960 --> 25:15.000]  i'm for rick perry i like rick he's good for texas we're letting those
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  those fat cats in washington know when rick perry gets elected
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.280]  that we're not going to stand for it he is total establishment
[25:24.280 --> 25:28.680]  he's been to the bilderberg group he's mainline he could be groomed to be one
[25:28.680 --> 25:31.960]  of the next presidents of the united states
[25:31.960 --> 25:35.880]  this guy is bad news brown he's not for the little guy
[25:35.880 --> 25:42.200]  he's not for the people he is the washington fat cat
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.520]  that's the reality that's the truth and that's why it's so important
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.280]  so important that we put all of our energy
[25:50.280 --> 25:57.320]  behind a real candidate like deborah medina who glenn beck attempted to tear
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.920]  down today on his little psi op program and we're
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.360]  going to play those clips coming up but finishing up on these tea parties
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.840]  it kind of disgusted me yesterday when i got an email hey man i can't
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.240]  believe this but marvel comics who's teamed up with the un in a couple like
[26:17.240 --> 26:19.640]  two three years ago they teamed up with the un
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.120]  in 07 i forget what month it was to promote global government
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.760]  okay they openly and in fact you know print that article off for me marvel
[26:28.760 --> 26:32.760]  teams up with united nations i'd like to read that one on the air
[26:32.760 --> 26:35.960]  so what is marvel doing now they're demonizing
[26:35.960 --> 26:42.360]  the tea parties and they're doing so through captain america let me repeat
[26:42.360 --> 26:47.720]  that through captain america the comic book icon
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.080]  that fought eight off hitler and the nazis
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.680]  during world war two for those people that aren't comic book geeks out there
[26:56.680 --> 27:00.280]  well even people who aren't i mean the older generation knows what i'm
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.840]  talking about captain america stands for good
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.040]  and captain america is on a recon mission of course with his black friend
[27:10.040 --> 27:14.120]  and they are doing surveillance of what the tea parties because
[27:14.120 --> 27:17.880]  you're guilty until proven innocent in this country now they are
[27:17.880 --> 27:20.920]  surveilling the tea parties they are surveilling
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.400]  anti-war protests they are taking your information you
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.400]  are on subversive lists they are taking it over the top in places like
[27:29.400 --> 27:33.160]  south carolina where you're supposed to register as a subversive
[27:33.160 --> 27:37.240]  what the hell is that what is a subversive someone who doesn't agree with
[27:37.240 --> 27:40.520]  the main line way of thinking now has to register
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.800]  you make me sick so captain america is on recon with his black friend
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.640]  and of course they show a crowd shot everybody's white
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.200]  see you're not allowed to be black or latino
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.640]  you have to be anglo-american to be for the constitution of bill of rights
[28:01.640 --> 28:06.360]  to be for the tea parties again give me a break i went to a couple of these tea
[28:06.360 --> 28:09.000]  parties i went before they hijacked them and i gotta
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.720]  tell you it wasn't all white people folks
[28:11.720 --> 28:14.760]  there are plenty of people out there with different colored skin who do
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.600]  believe in the constitution bill of rights i can't believe it but it's true
[28:18.600 --> 28:22.520]  so in this comic book they try to polarize everybody
[28:22.520 --> 28:25.800]  captain america thinks it's racist so it must be
[28:25.800 --> 28:29.000]  racist because the black guy talks to captain america is like why are these
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.960]  people doing this they're racist what why are you doing this to us marvel
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.160]  well they're not the good guys folks and you need to you need to be totally and
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.920]  completely aware of their propaganda
[28:42.920 --> 28:45.880]  they've got their own film studio out there right now
[28:45.880 --> 28:49.320]  and they're about to put together an avengers movie and who are the avengers
[28:49.320 --> 28:55.320]  going to be working with the united nations they always like to put global
[28:55.320 --> 29:00.680]  government in a positive light same thing with the gi joe movie this year
[29:00.680 --> 29:05.800]  the united nations is here to help that's why you have model u n all
[29:05.800 --> 29:09.880]  across the country this is the vehicle
[29:09.880 --> 29:13.880]  for which they want to launch a global
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.960]  government that's why the u n headed up these kopen
[29:17.960 --> 29:23.560]  hagan climate talks nothing to do with climate change
[29:23.560 --> 29:26.760]  and they want it both ways i'm seeing headlines
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.880]  out of the new york times out of yahoo news that we're having these snow storms
[29:31.880 --> 29:34.600]  why because of global warming if there weren't snow storms it'd be because of
[29:34.600 --> 29:38.280]  global warming but now we're having snow storms because of global warming
[29:38.280 --> 29:41.720]  we'll be back after this it's the alex joneshow i'm jason bermus setting in

[31:25.880 --> 31:29.080]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[31:29.080 --> 31:33.480]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[31:36.760 --> 31:39.800]  bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more matches
[31:39.800 --> 31:42.360]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[31:42.360 --> 31:46.680]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[33:23.800 --> 33:31.640]  out on assignment we're gonna shift gears right now
[33:31.640 --> 33:38.760]  from the tea party movement into cyber security what is cyber security jason
[33:38.760 --> 33:45.000]  well let me tell you what it is it is the complete takeover of the web and i
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.840]  know most of you are too busy to actually read the bill
[33:48.840 --> 33:53.320]  that will change the internet forever change the way that we get information
[33:53.320 --> 33:57.000]  forever but lo and behold jason bermas has not only
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.640]  read the bill but he's marked it out for you
[34:01.640 --> 34:09.080]  and let me tell you about this bill okay this bill is a nightmare
[34:09.080 --> 34:13.480]  it is total and complete internet control it is putting
[34:13.480 --> 34:21.640]  the federal communications committee the FCC who are already demons in my eyes
[34:21.640 --> 34:25.880]  i mean they've gone after talk radio they've gone after television
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.120]  they are really the boundary of the establishment
[34:30.120 --> 34:33.720]  if anybody goes outside of those boundaries the FCC steps in
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.160]  and says no no no no no you can't go on the airwaves with that
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.040]  and then you're censored so they're gonna put the FCC
[34:42.040 --> 34:50.600]  in control of this new internet what else are they going to do
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.440]  well in this bill they're also going to set up believe it or not
[34:54.440 --> 35:00.680]  a scholarship program for students k through 12 let me repeat that for you
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.080]  students k through 12 because they're going to start monitoring
[35:05.080 --> 35:12.040]  all of your internet activity and this is in section 12 federal cyber
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.080]  scholarship for service program now what is this
[35:17.080 --> 35:21.240]  well they're trying to recruit and train quote unquote
[35:21.240 --> 35:25.240]  the next generation of federal information technology workers
[35:25.240 --> 35:34.280]  and security managers security managers they are training the children
[35:34.280 --> 35:39.320]  to get hooked into a slave type of internet and become cattle tails on
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.960]  those who don't abide by the rules that's why we have all this talk of
[35:43.960 --> 35:48.040]  cyber bullying and white papers by Cass Sunstein
[35:48.040 --> 35:53.320]  saying we have to go after 9 11 truth groups and that paper is just over the
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.160]  top i've read that one on air before oh my god
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.080]  so in section 12 subsection four we shall
[36:01.080 --> 36:05.480]  provide a procedure for identifying promising k through 12 students for
[36:05.480 --> 36:08.760]  participation in summer work and internship programs
[36:08.760 --> 36:11.960]  that would lead because you're going to need this
[36:11.960 --> 36:15.880]  to certification of federal information technology workforce standards
[36:15.880 --> 36:19.960]  and possible future employment so right off the bat
[36:19.960 --> 36:23.960]  they're letting you know if you're going to be working with the internet in the
[36:23.960 --> 36:30.360]  future you will need to be certified certified
[36:30.360 --> 36:33.720]  by the federal information technology workforce standards
[36:33.720 --> 36:37.240]  and who are they putting in charge of this whole thing nist the national
[36:37.240 --> 36:43.400]  institute of standards and technology the main conspirators in covering up
[36:43.400 --> 36:47.160]  what happened at world trade center one world trade center two
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.640]  and world trade center building seven nist is in charge a criminal
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.440]  organization hell bent on lying to the american people
[36:56.440 --> 37:02.840]  that's what's in this bill over 400 congressmen voted for this thing how
[37:02.840 --> 37:05.240]  many of them you think actually read it
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.680]  two three four maybe less five count them one two three four five
[37:10.680 --> 37:15.640]  dissenting votes five people said no ron paul among them
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.600]  and when i last checked you can go to the open congress page
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.520]  and this was on sunday it's probably much worse now but over 2000 people had
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.240]  had rung in and said no we don't want this six percent of those 2000 people
[37:29.240 --> 37:36.200]  were for this bill so how does a congress of 400 plus voting for it
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.240]  represent the american people it doesn't they don't represent us
[37:41.240 --> 37:44.760]  they are not or they're not here for me and you it is not a government for and
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.840]  by the people anymore folks and you can see that with the recent
[37:48.840 --> 37:53.400]  five to four because it's always five to four supreme court decision
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.120]  that said oh yeah special interest can just give up as much money as they want
[37:58.120 --> 38:05.080]  they can buy off our politicians we love it it's great
[38:05.080 --> 38:09.400]  let's go some other provisions in this bill it's going to build new protocols
[38:09.400 --> 38:12.440]  to enable the internet to have robust security
[38:12.440 --> 38:18.840]  as one of the key capabilities all software will be streamlined through
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.400]  the government and pre approved no more open source
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.760]  no more open source internet and by the way today i also have in my stack that
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.760]  google is going to launch their own internet
[38:32.760 --> 38:36.280]  now anybody who listens to this program knows that google is
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.800]  heavily heavily intertwined with the national
[38:39.800 --> 38:45.400]  security agency and the global intelligence apparatus
[38:45.400 --> 38:49.000]  the true power structure and they announced
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.480]  new internet hooray new internet from google yeah
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.840]  everybody loves google yeah and what this will be
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.080]  is kind of a beta test program for internet too
[39:03.080 --> 39:10.200]  and what is internet too well internet too
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.320]  will require you in some way shape or form to give up your biometric data to
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.560]  get on the internet now they've started training some people
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.040]  with things like the ibm thinkpads a few years ago that came out with the
[39:24.040 --> 39:27.320]  thumb scanner so you'd run your thumb across and nobody else could get on
[39:27.320 --> 39:30.520]  your computer to be locked out unless you had the biometric
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.120]  thumbprint now you could see similar things
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.680]  to get on the web in five or ten years on the internet too
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.480]  you will swipe your finger your data will come up it'll say hello
[39:43.480 --> 39:47.640]  jason bermus or whoever you are and you'll be logged in as that person
[39:47.640 --> 39:52.280]  so now every site you go to everything you download
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.640]  everyone you talk to online via instant messaging
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.560]  will now be completely associated with you they won't just have their little
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.920]  data mining programs where they go to your facebook profile your myspace
[40:02.920 --> 40:09.560]  profile your aim profile your yahoo no you will sign in digitally
[40:09.560 --> 40:13.080]  with your biometrics and it may not even be a thumb scan in the future
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.760]  we know that xbox is ready to launch project natal
[40:16.760 --> 40:22.200]  which is a five megapixel camera in your home with a motion sensor
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.920]  that has voice recognition technology and body recognition technology it can
[40:26.920 --> 40:30.680]  tell where you move it scans your body in
[40:30.680 --> 40:35.000]  it sees your face it puts an avatar of you on the screen if you want you can
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.200]  shop amazon with it like the jetsons so it may not be a thumb
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.840]  scan for internet too it may be an iris scan
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.880]  we don't know yet but anyway you slice it it's a nightmare
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.880]  here it is right here google to build high speed internet network google ink
[40:53.880 --> 40:57.320]  plans to build a super fasty they always tell you it's going to be super
[40:57.320 --> 41:00.120]  fast oh the internet's dying it can't handle all
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.040]  the bandwidth we need to restrict it that's their excuse we're going to make
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.080]  it faster because here in america we're obsessed
[41:07.080 --> 41:10.280]  with things bigger stronger faster
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.160]  to build a super fast internet network for up to half a million people
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.280]  a project that could pressure telecommunications companies to
[41:18.280 --> 41:23.240]  loosen their control of web access in the united states
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.000]  the internet company has locked horns with the likes of AT&T
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.840]  horizon and others over net neutrality google wants telephone companies to
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.040]  permit consumers to run any web application they want
[41:34.040 --> 41:37.400]  while carriers do not want to lose control of networks they have invested
[41:37.400 --> 41:40.680]  billions of dollars to build
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.040]  and again folks this is a smoke screen okay they're they're telling you google
[41:46.040 --> 41:48.440]  is building this high speed internet network
[41:48.440 --> 41:51.800]  it's going to have about a half a million people on it this is a beta test
[41:51.800 --> 41:56.920]  this is a prime example of a beta test they always try it out in smaller groups
[41:56.920 --> 42:02.520]  before they implement it statewide or nationwide
[42:02.520 --> 42:06.840]  so be on the lookout this out of Reuters today and please please please please
[42:06.840 --> 42:10.360]  please please please please please please
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.480]  go out and read this bill that they passed
[42:13.480 --> 42:20.920]  it's only 50 pages long i know a lot of you are smarter than i am
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.440]  you read at a higher level hell if you read at an eighth grade level you can
[42:24.440 --> 42:29.080]  read this thing in less than an hour and understand
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.560]  Jason Bermas is making a big deal about this Alex Jones is making a big deal
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.280]  about this because this is a total net
[42:36.280 --> 42:39.880]  takeover if this thing goes through the senate
[42:39.880 --> 42:42.600]  and trust me if it goes through the net the senate it'll be even more night
[42:42.600 --> 42:46.120]  marriage you may not have info wars comm in 12 months
[42:46.120 --> 42:50.840]  you may not have prism planet dot tv in 12 months
[42:52.200 --> 42:58.840]  section seven licensing and certification of cyber security professionals
[42:58.840 --> 43:01.800]  beginning three years after the date of the enactment of this act it shall be
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.440]  unlawful for any individual to engage in business in the united states or to be
[43:06.440 --> 43:10.200]  employed in the united states as a provider of cyber security services
[43:10.200 --> 43:13.720]  to any federal agency or information system or network designated by the
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.200]  president or the president's designee as a critical
[43:16.200 --> 43:19.400]  infrastructure information system or network who is not licensed and
[43:19.400 --> 43:22.760]  certified under the program and then you read into the bill
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.960]  and it's every network every network whether it's private or not in fact
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.920]  they have programs in here where they will buy off small businesses
[43:32.920 --> 43:37.240]  with a check for a hundred thousand dollars
[43:42.120 --> 43:45.400]  so this is how they get you into receivership do you understand
[43:45.400 --> 43:48.280]  so the people that are employing less than a hundred people
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.120]  have to comply then they give them their little blood money their payoff a
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.240]  hundred thousand dollars and then they're just they're serving
[43:55.240 --> 43:58.280]  the system i've got alex jones on the line
[43:58.280 --> 44:04.680]  alex what's up okay so i am listening to you driving down the road on our new
[44:04.680 --> 44:08.120]  free iphone app and i just wanted to point out
[44:08.120 --> 44:12.120]  that we've had this out for less than 48 hours
[44:12.120 --> 44:15.080]  and it's already number seven on the free apps
[44:15.080 --> 44:18.920]  about to eclipse the new york times in usa today it's above
[44:18.920 --> 44:24.680]  things like the wall street journal uh and fox news so
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.680]  the system cannot compete with the truth and hearing you go over that bill
[44:30.680 --> 44:33.720]  per demos written articles or lots of written articles
[44:33.720 --> 44:36.920]  you've got the actual bill i'm glad you're covering this
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.480]  because people don't understand that in 1996 with telecommunications act
[44:41.480 --> 44:47.560]  they did the same thing to radio tv and all the phone systems they paid nine
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.280]  million dollars to go in and put in the hubs in all the major phone companies
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.640]  i did this in 1996 but it came out
[44:55.640 --> 44:59.160]  three years ago uh you were supposedly broken in the
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.000]  in the services to chronicle that oh a whole floor
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.320]  you know with the at&t building is the nsa and everything's wired through it
[45:07.320 --> 45:11.560]  none of that was secret because they had to pass the law to do it we knew the
[45:11.560 --> 45:14.920]  whole infrastructure and so now they're going down to even
[45:14.920 --> 45:19.640]  tiny internet companies websites you name it this is what the un's calling for
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.240]  it's what has done things calling for it's what italy
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.240]  and what australia have already implemented in the last two weeks
[45:27.240 --> 45:32.280]  this is happening now they are already building all the new networks forcing
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.520]  all traffic onto their system for making surveillance and control it and they
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.880]  state it is the censor this everybody needs to understand
[45:41.880 --> 45:44.760]  that they are moving in high gear because they know we're going into a
[45:44.760 --> 45:47.320]  depression they're going to watch new wars
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.560]  state's terror attacks and you're just on fire jason the way you break it down
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.400]  uh i'm vegan paul wasenker demo to listen to what you just said in the last 15
[45:55.400 --> 45:59.240]  minutes for people to take the audio of this get it out to everybody the way you
[45:59.240 --> 46:02.440]  stated it was just even better than i could
[46:02.440 --> 46:07.000]  what you explained that they only had five votes against it
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.680]  and you've got it now in the senate an even worse
[46:10.680 --> 46:15.320]  version and then you go to where people can comment to congress
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.360]  and i was on that myself yesterday you can't find anyone for it no one wants
[46:20.360 --> 46:26.280]  this it's unconstitutional uh and again it is the end of
[46:26.280 --> 46:29.800]  freedom folks they are they're talking about bailouts to the newspaper
[46:29.800 --> 46:32.280]  those aren't bailouts it's the government taking control of them
[46:32.280 --> 46:35.640]  it is the five-year cent coms on the web attacking them
[46:35.640 --> 46:39.640]  these guys don't even hide that they're with cent com it's so unamerican
[46:39.640 --> 46:43.960]  because they don't want us exposing the private fellow to serve so please
[46:43.960 --> 46:46.680]  continue to walk back through that bill for people
[46:46.680 --> 46:50.280]  and i hope folks are concerned about this we need to
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.840]  get concerned just because i've been up there for years telling you their
[46:52.840 --> 46:55.640]  internet takeover plan and it's happening exactly as i said it was
[46:55.640 --> 46:59.160]  i was reading your own document doesn't mean now we just accept it
[46:59.160 --> 47:03.400]  we get out there and we warn everybody this is really going on
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.720]  this is really happening i mean this is the takeover of the biggest part of
[47:07.720 --> 47:11.480]  what's left of industry in the us they've gotten rid of our factories
[47:11.480 --> 47:14.920]  they've got they're getting rid of service everything is on the web now it's
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.600]  the only thing keeping us moving and now they're just seizing it and
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.040]  seeing we're going to have private partnerships with everyone and microsoft
[47:22.040 --> 47:26.760]  is running the 15 giant cyber security bases they built or building or are
[47:26.760 --> 47:30.920]  going to build like at san antonio mainstream san antonio news
[47:30.920 --> 47:35.000]  tries to go take photos of the giant complex and they come out and try to
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.080]  arrest them i mean folks this is real that they are
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.160]  doing it now just like with copenhagen because we got the word out we were able
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.520]  to back them off on that and the flu we were able to back them off
[47:46.520 --> 47:49.960]  that's why they got to shut the web down because we can get there by
[47:49.960 --> 47:53.400]  but this is the ultimate fight right now jason i'm gonna let you get back to what
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.080]  you're doing but i'm so glad i said cover whatever you want today
[47:57.080 --> 48:00.600]  i want i'm working on some other things we're taking care of
[48:00.600 --> 48:05.160]  here and and i'm just so glad that you are focused on this because
[48:05.160 --> 48:08.360]  you realize what's happening and people should read the bill
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.200]  because i see the idiot to comment the story the curtain fall and steven
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.120]  erin reichel and that's not happening when it's kind of kids you say something
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.920]  out of there i mean folks this is it this is it if they can shut
[48:20.920 --> 48:24.360]  down our free speech start retailing it it's over
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.040]  and taking over all the businesses and industry and making everyone wire into
[48:28.040 --> 48:31.400]  the government hubs and run their software over your system
[48:31.400 --> 48:36.680]  all computer programmers all hackers all internet free speech people everybody
[48:36.680 --> 48:40.200]  you better go wild about this and call the speaking senate
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.200]  and get the states involved in industry you can't seize control of our
[48:44.200 --> 48:47.320]  industries like this this is a globalist power granted
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.480]  three months ago they had a total control of the web
[48:51.480 --> 48:58.360]  uh a pressing system through icand to the united nations jason keep
[48:58.360 --> 49:01.640]  taking my god bless you thank you so much alex
[49:01.640 --> 49:06.120]  folks what are the chances that this bill passes in congress and less than a
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.520]  week later google announces that they're about to build a high
[49:10.520 --> 49:14.520]  speed internet network and then it's praised by the
[49:14.520 --> 49:20.360]  fcc in the article and the fcc in the bill are the ones behind the takeover
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.600]  that are willing not willing they're putting nist in charge of the standards
[49:24.600 --> 49:29.400]  and technology of the web let me read this subsection for you
[49:29.400 --> 49:33.640]  section five state and regional cyber security enhancement program
[49:33.640 --> 49:37.480]  subsection six the transfer of cyber security standards
[49:37.480 --> 49:42.280]  processes technology and techniques will be developed
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.640]  by the national institute of standards and technology
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.400]  and then the fcc welcomes the move of google
[49:51.400 --> 49:56.120]  to the high speed internet game and then you read on in this article
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.280]  google to build high speed internet network and you find out that the fcc
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.720]  is about a month away from submitting a national
[50:03.720 --> 50:08.200]  broadband plan to congress let me repeat that for you
[50:08.200 --> 50:13.080]  the federal communications committee the people responsible
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.160]  for keeping censorship alive and well on the radio
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.360]  and on the television still the two main forms of communication in this world
[50:22.360 --> 50:27.000]  quickly being surpassed by the internet and that's why we're so dangerous here
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.680]  we are a month away from that same organization of tyranny
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.800]  once run by colin powell's son i'm not sure if he's heading up the fcc right
[50:35.800 --> 50:40.920]  now but he sure as hell maybe from submitting a national
[50:40.920 --> 50:45.000]  broadband plan see they're going to restrict how much internet you get to
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.240]  have and they're going to charge you by the download by

[51:41.800 --> 51:45.000]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.240]  the liberties of the people than a standing army hi

[52:09.560 --> 52:13.560]  as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[52:13.560 --> 52:18.840]  americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in congress
[52:18.840 --> 52:23.560]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us

[54:17.960 --> 54:24.040]  security act section by section and of course this intertwines with the new
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.480]  story out yesterday google to build high-speed internet
[54:27.480 --> 54:32.120]  network and remember this new network is going to
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.320]  standardize everything they use the term harmonization
[54:35.320 --> 54:38.520]  what that means is that you won't be able to get on the web
[54:38.520 --> 54:45.560]  without their software no more open source and again in this article the
[54:45.560 --> 54:49.000]  FCC is about a month away from submitting a national broad bad plan to
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.600]  congress now in section section is this this is a long
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.600]  section section six nist standards development and
[54:58.600 --> 55:04.440]  compliance you will be in compliance or you will not be on the web
[55:04.440 --> 55:11.080]  in subsection two two FCC broad band plan in developing the national
[55:11.080 --> 55:14.680]  broadband plan pursuant to section six thousand one k of the american
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.680]  recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the federal communications commission
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.440]  shall report on the most effective and efficient means to ensure the of the
[55:22.440 --> 55:24.920]  cyber security of commercial broadband networks
[55:24.920 --> 55:28.920]  including consideration of consumer education and outreach programs
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.000]  layman speak we are taking over all the web
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.760]  all of it every single bit of it will be under
[55:36.760 --> 55:44.200]  our secure control they talk about mandatory licensing
[55:44.200 --> 55:47.560]  i mean this thing is a nightmare and again if you go
[55:47.560 --> 55:50.840]  on the congressional page where the bill is
[55:50.840 --> 55:54.600]  there is no support for this bill
[55:54.600 --> 55:58.360]  there is no representation out there for us in congress
[55:58.360 --> 56:03.480]  five people one of them ron paul said no to this
[56:03.480 --> 56:07.640]  yet you go to the actual bill and nobody wants it
[56:07.640 --> 56:14.360]  but the fat cats in washington standard software configuration
[56:14.360 --> 56:17.880]  software configuration specification language you see
[56:17.880 --> 56:23.080]  they're going to make it all under them you will have to operate
[56:23.080 --> 56:27.080]  within their boundaries and then on top of it
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.320]  they're going to use this technology to recruit your kids into a tattletail
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.960]  society and job remember they're going to give
[56:35.960 --> 56:42.360]  scholarships and summer internship programs to k through 12 students
[56:42.360 --> 56:45.240]  so you know they're going to go to johnny's 12 years old
[56:45.240 --> 56:48.120]  he's in eighth grade he's about to go to high school he's real handy with the
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.920]  computer and they're going to say johnny
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.200]  well we've been monitoring your internet activity and
[56:54.200 --> 56:57.400]  you know you're really good at researching and we notice that you know
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.320]  your way around the web how would you feel about interning
[57:01.320 --> 57:05.400]  with us oh that sounds great and they'll go to one of their little
[57:05.400 --> 57:10.040]  reeducation centers they'll be like well you know if other students or teachers
[57:10.040 --> 57:14.200]  are on the internet and they're over at a site like info wars dot com or
[57:14.200 --> 57:19.080]  prismplanet.tv let us know who is this person
[57:19.080 --> 57:22.440]  this is all before they actually get you to thumb scan
[57:22.440 --> 57:25.160]  where you're totally enslaved on the internet and they know everything you're
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.800]  doing but like alex mentioned with this telecommunications
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.480]  act in 1996 they've been doing a lot of this
[57:33.480 --> 57:37.800]  right out in the open hepting versus atnt let me repeat it for you
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.200]  hepting versus atnt now this was just one case
[57:42.200 --> 57:48.280]  of literal dozens of whistleblowers not just atnt all the major telecommunication
[57:48.280 --> 57:51.560]  companies have a secret room where the internet
[57:51.560 --> 57:56.520]  line is split okay so one with the private company
[57:56.520 --> 58:00.680]  one to the national security agency that we love so much folks
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.440]  now that secret room then tracks traces and databases
[58:04.440 --> 58:08.760]  every single thing you do on the web so it gets your ip address it says the ip
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.080]  address has gone to yahoo mail and google and info wars and
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.720]  routers and it just goes through the entire thing
[58:15.720 --> 58:19.640]  but then you're on the im it records that too
[58:19.640 --> 58:22.600]  and then you're on your email wait it records that too then you're on your
[58:22.600 --> 58:26.600]  cell phone and it records that too and what do they do they throw
[58:26.600 --> 58:30.120]  these cases out of court and what does eric holder say
[58:30.120 --> 58:34.520]  he says get him out of here this is national security shut your mouth we'll

[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:27.400]  in the year or two we've got and that is max
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:31.080]  already the censorship the isp's walking us and others
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:35.720]  wiki leaks the electronic frontiers foundation others
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:40.360]  the true defenders of the web are all under attack this is a true revolution
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:43.400]  like it's turning through the main reason i call back in jason is it's even
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:47.400]  worse than what you're saying and paul Watson listening curtain
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:50.440]  demo thing you can pull this up because i read this over and over again
[1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:55.880]  the last head of the fcc but the current head is well last year said
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:59.320]  that they're going to offer free broadband it's not free they take your
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.920]  tax money they put in these high-powered broadband
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:07.720]  uh systems that then compete with the free market
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:10.440]  that's the main reason i'm against i have to pay for it no i should subscribe
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:15.640]  to it if i want it this is for education but then because anyone can get it
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:20.520]  the fcc is over it so they come in with hyper-powered systems
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:24.840]  they do deals with google yahoo microsoft who are all helping them spy
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:28.280]  those groups all help build the control grid in china now building it in
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:31.960]  idli and australia where they're putting this in and there's ceiling
[1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:37.960]  and they say that you there will be filters that are complete it will be
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:42.920]  like g-rated we won't be there uh because we're listed as terror and
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:45.640]  hate and everything else already for no reason
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:50.440]  and so it's not just that they control the infrastructure and all the companies
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:54.680]  and are saying they're going to censor and hire all these youth brigades
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:03:00.120]  to to to man the system and and to engineer the society
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:04.440]  through scholarships and the rest of it where they create this google everybody
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.640]  else come out with their own phones you won't be able to be designed with
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:10.920]  google everybody else come out
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:19.080]  with their own phones you won't be able to get it i mean you already can't get
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.640]  most apple apps on your google phones they all block each other back and forth
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:27.400]  and so this is just like we paid to build roads
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:31.240]  and now central of spain comes in and buys off rick perry
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:35.000]  and he hands 8 000 miles of texas roads over to them
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.360]  and then we start fighting saying no this is just we're being shanghai we're
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:41.000]  being robbed we're being looted look i'm gonna let you get back to your
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.840]  breakdown of the bill it's just it's so much worse than even the bill
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:49.640]  states and it's just look the it look radio is free until the 30s folks the
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.320]  fcc took over it's going to be the same thing here but on the web there's
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:56.840]  unlimited channels they don't have the excuse of claiming it's a limited
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.040]  spectrum they are hijacking it we'll say remember
[1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:02.760]  back when the web was free yeah but not anymore
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.600]  god bless you barmas thank you so much alex and i want to point out
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:09.960]  that again this isn't just nist standards a criminal organization this
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:14.520]  isn't just the fcc takeover again a criminal organization

[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:10.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:14.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:17.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:21.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:25.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:30.280]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:33.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:37.320]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:41.240]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:44.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:47.880]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:27.400]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:31.400]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:35.000]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.800]  and american drug war was really one of my favorite films two or three years ago
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:38.280]  when it dropped i think it dropped in oh seven
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:43.240]  and for those of you out there that maybe have a child and his teens are off to
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.200]  college or a nephew or a cousin that
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:49.720]  isn't willing to pop in an alex jones product or a
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:53.480]  jason bermas product they don't want to throw in an end game or a loose change
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:57.160]  final cut i gotta tell you the kevin booth movies
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:01.320]  american drug war and now the sequel to that how we won the west is a great
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:05.480]  way to do so a great way for them to open their minds up and say wow this had a
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:08.200]  lot of really interesting information i hadn't seen before
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:11.000]  where are you getting these videos and then you hit them with the fall of a
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.440]  republic or an obama deception and all those are heavily
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:18.120]  discounted right now at info wars dot com when you buy more than one video
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:21.080]  someone come with a free t-shirt you can get loose change final cut for five
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:24.200]  dollars uh my film fabled enemies which exposes
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:27.160]  the international intelligence operation that was
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:31.160]  nine eleven still relevant today still super important
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:36.520]  today when deborah medina goes on to glenn back and glenn back plays possum
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:39.880]  i don't know much about her we got her on the line let's ask some questions
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:43.080]  what does he dig in right away if you had a nine eleven truth or in your uh
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:48.120]  in your mists like we're undercover spies ready to slit the throats of america
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.920]  no we're trying to save this country glenn that's what we're trying to do
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:57.080]  would you fire them and she kind of you know dodges the question a little bit
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.680]  but then after the thing glenn back is all over he's rick perry all the way
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:04.360]  perry perry perry that's how you know this man
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:07.320]  is a phony that's how you know he's disingenuous
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:11.080]  it's not only because he got a 50 million contract with fox it's not only
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:15.720]  that he fakes crying for magazine covers it's not only that he does stage shows
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:21.320]  it's not only that he was an alcoholic top 40 dj before this
[1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.960]  the fact is he doesn't care about this country
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:27.400]  he sure acts like he does he loves to wrap himself in the flag
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:31.720]  but when the real issues come out when the mass murder of 3000
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:36.920]  plus citizens and millions now millions across the world world
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:41.640]  subsequently when it comes out that we were right you think glenn back's going
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:44.040]  to apologize you know he will probably jump on the
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:48.760]  bandwagon that's what these chameleons and snakes do
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:51.640]  that's why they jumped on the tea party bandwagon folks all right i'm going to
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:57.000]  go to a few callers let's go to chris in rod island chris you're on the line
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.520]  yes sir chris all right let's go to tim in texas tim you're on the line
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:06.920]  jason hey jason hey great filling job as you always do
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.600]  um two quest or two things on beck and one on jason bermus
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.760]  all right on on beck i'm tired of this progressive
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:20.440]  wishy washy uh false flag when they use the word progressive
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:23.640]  it's really just deceiving all the neocons out there
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:26.760]  and if they can it's some hundred year old philosophy started by tennie
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:30.760]  roswell for whatever his spiel is the word that he uses globalists these
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:33.800]  people believe in global government global currency
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:37.480]  and it's not just as limited narrow minded aspect of
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:41.160]  progressivism or any kind of isms these are globalists
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:44.600]  i agree 110 percent when you look at glenn beck by the way tim
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:48.040]  he speaks to his audience like they are children
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:51.160]  he gets up in front of a blackboard with a piece of chalk
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:54.920]  and he he literally like he's teaching a class
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:58.760]  of you know seniors in high school or 10th graders or eighth graders
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:02.360]  or 10 year olds he talks to you like you're a kid
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:06.280]  and people are buying into it go ahead make your other point tim
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:10.040]  well he probably has to do that because a lot of the audience really does need
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.640]  that kind of draw me a big colored picture and it's
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:16.440]  effective he's getting him you know he throws enough truth in there to
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:21.320]  abscade to real truth the other thing on beck is though
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:24.200]  i'm just baffled and i've been wanting to ask alex about it um
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  napolitano just an amazing guy comes on to alex the show and says alex you
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:33.320]  are getting the word out better than anyone i know
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:37.400]  how is beck allowing him to be the guest host on that show
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.120]  with these two competing ideologies well i would say this you know napolitano
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:45.160]  does say a lot of the same things that beck does and he's a little more
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:49.480]  guarded obviously you know napolitano isn't talking about 9 11 truth
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:53.560]  so napolitano is a good mainstay and i think beck sees him as somebody who
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:57.240]  already has a base audience so if he leaves you know he can still have the
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:00.440]  viewership it's not going to hurt him and he'll stay within the boundaries so
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:04.760]  in other words you won't see napolitano plugging info wars dot com or alex
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:07.160]  jones while he's hosting the glenn beck program
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:11.240]  and you know it's all a wink of the eye and a handshake glenn beck is
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.040]  fully aware of info wars dot com of prism planet dot tv of the obama
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:20.040]  deception of father he knows who we are he steals half of our stuff
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:23.560]  hell he steals three quarters of our stuff all right final point tim
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:27.480]  the audiences are real similar i think there's just this
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:32.600]  i'll see this dynamic between the patriot movement in the beck movement
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:35.480]  to where it could either merge or explode in a
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:39.160]  conflict and it's well i hope we can get a man listen when i went down
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:42.280]  to the tea party in san antonio and i thank you for the call

[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:40.360]  they should protect the internet and i'm like joe did you read the bill oh no i
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:43.240]  didn't read the bill and then a few other people
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:47.240]  commented that you know only good americans voted against this bill there
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.680]  were five people and joe says well what's a good american you know
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.560]  trying to be all sarcastic well i said a good american is someone that at least
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:57.320]  read the bill or the objectionable parts that people are protesting
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.800]  no no response and he's like yeah yeah yeah bermus they're all gonna round us
[1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:04.120]  up and i had to type back to him i said look man
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:08.200]  no one's talking about roundups but if you want to see the actual government
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:12.760]  document where they say it's okay to implement roundups in this country of
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:16.600]  u.s american citizens please go to and i put down the link
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:20.360]  army dot mill and linked to the civilian in

[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:27.960]  they love to put these things out there and then implement them
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:31.800]  incrementally or in times of a disaster that's what they're for
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:35.800]  all right let's go to the next tim tim in new york tim you're online
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:40.120]  hey jason how's it going good i just wanted to actually uh
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:43.640]  two things real quick uh first of all i just believe back will show us true
[1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.440]  colors you it'll be forced to and have no choice you know you'll
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:51.080]  he'll have to go with the status quo at some point in time and everybody will
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:53.960]  see through that because everybody's looking up now you know nobody's
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:57.880]  nobody's just off you know buying into it everybody's watching what people do
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.240]  and not just what they say i think so they only have you know they're working
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:05.880]  on borrowed time and my second question uh i have a
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:09.000]  nine-year-old and i'm not really with her mother like we haven't been together
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.600]  and i'm trying to raise her i mean i'm fully awake i mean
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:16.440]  and you know and you know about then i'm trying to you know tell her to be
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:19.000]  informed because it's going to be reached one point where
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.960]  she's just going to be you know in the system and you can't you know she
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:25.560]  won't be able to see the you know the the the light of the truth you know she'll
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.640]  just be you know enveloped in in you know this lie sort of like we all were
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:33.560]  before we woke up sure but uh i'm just saying in a bomb sorter you know
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:37.160]  hammers on me for you know just not scaring her as much but that's what
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.520]  she's worried about you know he didn't with too much truth and and i i don't
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:44.200]  think that's possible but um i just i just wanted to know if you had any advice
[1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:48.600]  or anybody up to looking over how well i've got all right i've got a uh uh
[1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:52.200]  four-year-old niece she's about to be five uh she's about to be actually she
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:55.000]  she just turned five i was there for her fifth birthday in december
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.760]  and i don't sugarcoat anything for the girl you know she she speaks
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:04.360]  uh i'm not there to lie to her and i see her conundrum my my brother is not
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:08.200]  with his uh his baby mama and they do
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:11.960]  have some conflicts on you know where she should go to school
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:16.040]  what doctor she should see and these are things that you do have to work out
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:20.040]  with that other parent you know we you're both parents it's 50 50 and this
[1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:24.280]  what you do have to look out for is making sure that the uh mother doesn't
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:29.400]  go to cps or something like that and say look what uh look what my uh
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:32.840]  my ex-boyfriend is teaching my my young daughter i want a restraining order
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:36.360]  you have to be real careful because state workers they don't know that you
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:40.200]  have a first amendment they will use color law to try to take your children
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:43.000]  away and it's well documented but that doesn't mean
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.880]  we stop so i would say this build on the relationship you already have
[1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:51.640]  with the mother of the child and don't sugarcoat things you know there are
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:55.080]  times for restraint but now ain't the time it ain't the
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:58.280]  time for restraint when we have an economy where openly
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:01.480]  they're saying 10 unemployment it's more like 20 percent
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:07.160]  when obama is saying he's agnostic on raising taxes of people making less than
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.080]  families not just people families making less than 250 thousand dollars a
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:14.280]  year and everything they've done is a big tax this healthcare bill
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.040]  huge tax they say they want to start implementing
[1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:22.760]  climate change legislation locally and on a state level
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:28.040]  another tax so now is not the time to be quiet now is not the time to be
[1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:31.400]  restrained and you know nine years old before you know what they'll be 10
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:34.280]  then they're going to be 16 a teenager then they're going to be 18 off to
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:39.240]  college then they're going to be 24 in the workplace
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:43.480]  and they can't have enough truth i wish i had more truth when i was a youngster
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:47.160]  the shock of waking up after 9 11 wouldn't have been so hard
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:50.840]  but you've got to take that and work with it use it to your advantage

[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:05.080]  and abraham lincoln and the first chapter is all about that the eight

[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:13.160]  of president lincoln and it was extremely interesting

[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:22.120]  interest that it'll clobber this the key points that basically will shut down
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.840]  the internet will turn into another fascist state
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:28.280]  uh... that's computer groups college students
[1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:33.560]  so regular students uh... you know seeing that you know all the techies or
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:38.520]  people who were really interested get it get it uh... like a viral uh... what
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:41.400]  do you call it uh... i'm trying to think of what what they call those uh...
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:44.360]  those letters they send you if you if you put your name at the bottom
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:47.560]  and you send it out to 20 other people something like that
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.240]  until the whole planet knows and they get pissed off at what's going on
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:54.760]  especially civil liberty groups it doesn't matter right wing left wing
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:57.640]  middle of the road let's face it everybody has a
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:02.760]  has a interest in this type of thing and uh... i i and also
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:07.720]  get these people to call uh... what also it make them the interest get a list
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:11.400]  of senators congressman key people that that are basically
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:14.920]  that could stop this bill even the people who will basically may have thought
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:17.560]  this was a good idea somebody con them into it
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.400]  and sometimes they'll shut it down once they realize the true consequences
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:25.160]  i've done this locally i i thought that i was even uh...
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:29.400]  you know uh... i'll i'll say it simply that i was quite a bribe and on a
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.160]  corrupted this is a situation and when i wouldn't take the bribe they
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:36.360]  literally try to beat me to death but i got the information out there and
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:39.800]  everybody kept doing exactly that and the good information got out there so
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:42.360]  so well that they just was shut down they couldn't get it
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:46.120]  get it forward i think and george let me tell you it is so important to get this

[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:41.880]  but i wanted to hit up some of these other news stories
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:46.840]  so i can at least mention them out there Reuters photographer says reborn
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:50.360]  after freed by us the u.s military freed a Reuters
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:54.440]  photographer in iraq on wednesday almost a year and a half after
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:59.160]  snatching him from his home in the middle of the night and placing him in
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:04.280]  a military detention center guess what without charge
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:08.760]  is that how we set an example for the rest of the world
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:12.680]  going after a Reuters photographer imprisoning him
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:19.560]  with no charges no due process for 18 months and thank the lord that they
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:24.360]  they let him go but you would think Reuters one of the top news agencies
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:27.320]  out there really a mouthpiece mostly for the establishment but at least some of
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:31.080]  the news is raw would have been raising holy
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:35.640]  hell about one of the photographers being illegally detained for 18 months i
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:39.720]  didn't hear anything about this story till what was it
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:44.200]  this was released on wednesday wednesday i find out about this this is a big deal
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:48.440]  folks imprisoning journalists without charge
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:55.800]  sets a very dangerous precedent and we should be up in arms about it
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:59.960]  priest checks fingerprints for mass attendance check this one out it's out
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.520]  of Warsaw a Polish priest has installed an
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:05.320]  electronic reader in his church for school children
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:08.920]  to leave their fingerprints in order to monitor their attendance at mass
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:13.960]  again further furthering the slave state
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:19.160]  getting us acclimated to giving up our biometric information at church at
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.680]  church and they make the excuse the pupils will mark their
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:25.320]  fingerprints every time they go to church over three years and if they
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:28.120]  attend 200 masses they will be freed from obligation of
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:30.600]  having to pass an exam prior to their confirmation
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:34.200]  the paper set so it's always for a good thing oh you won't have to take a test
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:38.760]  oh you'll get a discount oh it's for your safety
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:44.920]  no thanks folks no thanks and then i really had to cover this one
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:49.320]  Pentagon to rewrite evolution create a mortal life
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:52.520]  or the other sub headline this one's out of wire Pentagon looks to breed
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:57.880]  immortal synthetic organisms molecular kill switch included
[1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:02.920]  and basically scientists have found the gene that makes you age
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:07.640]  and they have stated yes this gene uh in some is different and that's why
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:10.040]  there's a biological age and then there's the
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:13.720]  actual age that you've progressed your physical age
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:18.040]  what you look like how you're living you know how your body's holding up
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:22.200]  and really they've been studying this stuff for 30 40 50 60 years
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:27.480]  but now it's coming out in the public eye the Pentagon's mad science arm
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:30.920]  may have come up with the most radical project yet DARPA
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:35.720]  oh yes the good people over at DARPA is looking to rewrite the laws of
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:38.920]  evolution to the military's advantage creating a synthetic organism that can
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:41.080]  live forever or can be killed with a flick of a
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:45.640]  molecular switch now we've discussed on this program
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:49.720]  and Alex has discussed how the elite truly do believe
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.280]  that they will become immortal and rule the planet as gods and anti-aging
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:57.400]  technology is out there they've been able to de-age mice
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:01.640]  and other smaller organism and that's public god knows what's going on
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:05.480]  in black operations god knows what's going on in the underground bases that
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:10.120]  nobody talks about that Jesse Ventura slightly exposed
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:14.200]  on his true tv show uh during the 2012 episode it was
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:17.080]  that one that one was really weird to me it really wasn't so much about 2012 it
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:20.120]  ended up being about the Denver airport and the underground facilities there
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:22.520]  those underground facilities are all over the country folks
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  they're in new mexico they're all over washington dc
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:30.360]  and there is a large one in colorado god knows what they're doing out there but
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:34.360]  they really believe that they're going to be able to do this now do i believe
[1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:37.080]  it i don't know i don't know the technology that well
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:40.760]  i'm joe average baby i i couldn't tell you if i could live forever
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:44.920]  but i know they believe it and i know they believe that we don't even deserve
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:47.720]  to be on the planet when they do it and i know
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:51.480]  that elitists like ted turner have made statements
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.800]  saying that they want a population reduction so that 350 million people are
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:38:00.440]  on this earth 350 million
[1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:04.200]  that means about one out of 20 of us get to live maybe
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:09.640]  maybe and that's ted turner and then ted turner gets confronted on that by we
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:13.720]  are change about a year ago and he's like no no no no 350
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:18.040]  million that's not me that's not me i'm more with the un's new numbers two to
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.160]  three billion on the planet oh two to three billion we're only at
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:24.520]  six point five ted so what's that mean the guy
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.760]  stands to the right of me and the guy stands to the left of me need to get
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:30.840]  shot in the head or maybe i need to get shot in the head that still means one
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.320]  out of every three or two people need to die
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:38.200]  how sick is this guy and the planet can handle six point five billion folks it
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:41.960]  can handle seven it can handle ten it could probably handle 15
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:45.720]  but they don't want to tell you that they want to have talking heads like
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:49.400]  damon vickers come on and point out well you know these guys in third world
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:53.240]  nations they're having 20 30 kids could give me a break
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:57.080]  that's that's rare you know the people that are having 20 to 30 kids their
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:02.120]  royalty they're the elitists they're the saudi princes out there
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:05.800]  they're the open dictators with five or six wives
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:10.600]  seven mistresses that's who's having 20 to 30 kids
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:14.280]  all right let's go back to some callers let's go to brett in montana brett
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.360]  you're online hey thanks for having me i wanted to talk to
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:22.680]  about the tsa and the whole um images
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.200]  that they have i i worked for tsa for uh four years
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:31.240]  after 9-11 happened i just felt that uh you know tsa was going to
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:34.680]  be what i needed to do to help protect my family
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:39.160]  i wasn't awake back then anyways um you know
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:44.120]  i've been hearing a lot of stories on your on your site lately about tsa
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:47.720]  about you know uh people being drunk and stuff it
[1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:51.480]  i gotta tell you that um i was there in the very beginning
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:56.120]  when um when tsa got rolled out and we took over
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:03.560]  all the uh security and um at at that time i was working in orange county
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:07.960]  working at that airport and this stuff's been going on for a while
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:11.560]  well let's let's talk about your life hold on you're a you're a tsa
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:15.800]  employee explain to people how tsa is really a revolving door
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:20.600]  because the screening process isn't that great and the pay isn't that great
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:24.120]  well i mean the pay is you know compared to
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.640]  what else is out there it's not that bad you're making about 14 15 bucks an hour
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:32.680]  but um it's that's not that great though that's not something that you would
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:36.280]  want somebody who's supposed to be a security professional somebody who's
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:39.800]  trained to protect us it's 14 an hour you know
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.320]  that's slightly above what i was making as a pizza guy i'm really
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.840]  about the same because i was getting tips i mean it's not something that you you
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.360]  you go into and say hey this is going to be the career for the rest of my life
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:53.960]  very few people do that very few i mean i when i go to the airport
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:58.680]  and i'm screened i almost never see the same person twice every once in a while
[1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:02.280]  i'll see somebody who works at the airlines again and again but whenever i
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:05.320]  go up to the thing there's always somebody different checking my license
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:08.360]  there's always somebody different wanted me and they're always young you know
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:12.120]  they're you know early 20s to mid 30s and then
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:15.640]  some of the seniors are over there but i really see it as a young person's job
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:19.240]  but you're saying you know you've been in this since 9 11 and you've seen this
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:21.720]  type of you know not so much corruption but kind of
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:26.120]  lackadaisical behavior drinking power trips this type of thing
[1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:30.440]  i would absolutely be bold enough to say that there's corruption going on i
[1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:34.600]  remember um one of our checkpoint managers
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:39.160]  given out his tsa business card to uh some of the local
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:43.240]  women because it was it was john Wayne airport there in orange county so we've
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:47.800]  got a lot of uh beautiful women uh flying out to
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:51.400]  vegas for the weekend while you know they work out there for the weekend
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:54.440]  he's given us his business card to these women
[1:41:54.440 --> 1:41:59.640]  saying you know hey i i got this uh the security badge i can get you around
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:04.440]  security and he got caught doing it we try to make a big stink about it in
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:08.600]  then they uh clear out the launch room kick everybody
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:13.560]  uh everybody out drag us in there with uh two of the managers
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:18.840]  and threaten that we will never work for another federal agency
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:22.920]  ever again that will get fired if you don't shut up i mean there's all kinds
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:26.200]  of stuff going on and let me tell you this is the norm
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:30.600]  this is the norm for them to say you're not going to blow the whistle and it
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:33.720]  happens on all levels people think that whistleblowers
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:37.400]  are embraced no they're usually fired they're usually disgraced
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:41.560]  they're usually gone after things are said about them that are not true
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:45.160]  in order to try to discredit them in the public eye so their stories
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:48.360]  never get out and if they do the credibility of those stories
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:52.440]  are questioned i thank you for the call brett you know i had a buddy of mine
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:56.120]  served in the military got out of the military and instead of having to go
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:42:59.480]  over to iraq and afghanistan uh back in oh three
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:03.880]  he ended up being a leguardia security detail you know tsa security over at
[1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:07.000]  leguardia one of the biggest airports in the country
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  and he would tell me you know kind kind of after i woke him up and i showed him
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.800]  some movies but i was talking to him before i was
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:18.120]  making movies and that kind of woke him up but what really woke him up was
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:22.040]  when i was talking about the drills going on on 9 11 he said to me you know
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:25.400]  i've been working now two three years at leguardia
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:31.320]  and i got to tell you i have never never seen a security breach that was not
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.680]  part of a government drill and he explained to me how they did this he's
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.520]  like what they'll do is they'll send in a team of about
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:42.440]  eight to ten people they'll go all throughout the airport
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:46.280]  and they will put certain things that are undetectable
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.120]  in lockers after they get through security different components
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:53.240]  and then somebody will go through and grab all these components and say oh
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:56.920]  you failed or oh you passed but he said never
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:44:01.480]  never ever ever ever ever did something get through that wasn't supposed to
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:04.920]  that wasn't part of a government drill and he'd say
[1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:08.360]  well they'll send two or three guys over to my station and then they'll send
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.880]  three or four guys over to another station and they'll try to bombard us
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:14.840]  so that we're just getting through and we don't make the connection
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:17.640]  and he said it was very rare that they did make that connection
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:22.120]  and that uh basically the national security agency the fbi and the people
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:25.400]  at homeland security the people running these drills would often get this stuff
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:29.800]  through just like they got the underwear bomber through
[1:44:29.800 --> 1:44:36.520]  still the mainstream refuses to discuss the 50-year-old sharp dressed
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:44.120]  indian man that led this uh alamutab all the way through security got him on
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:48.760]  the plane as a sudanese refugee without a passport
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:52.280]  again they want to body scan you but they didn't want to body scan
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:55.560]  the underwear bomber even though they had those there
[1:44:55.560 --> 1:44:58.920]  they didn't want to forget about the body scanners folks they didn't want a
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:02.440]  passport from the guy he shouldn't have been on the plane he
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:05.640]  didn't even have a passport
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.760]  all right let's go to our next caller gary in massachusetts gary online
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:15.400]  hey jason how are you today good good i was reading the cyber security bill
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:18.680]  there i have a question on it kind of interesting um
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:22.600]  there's a section that says they can shut down federal and u.s. government
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:26.040]  networks and take them from the internet and then it says or
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:30.520]  networks as if it's or other networks in the interest of
[1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.040]  national security so that kind of bothers me and um
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:38.600]  yeah i'm i'm curious i mean if it's really other networks like any network
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:43.320]  we are up against a very very serious multi-pronged attack right now on our
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:46.280]  freedoms from the all the things you guys talk about
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:50.440]  you know the swine flu fake false flag epidemic
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:53.960]  uh... eco science and the plans in the white house i mean all this stuff
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:56.760]  happening all at once it's it's maddening
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.760]  well it can be maddening and again if you're just waking up or you're just
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:04.200]  starting to take a look at this information it could be overwhelming
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.480]  i mean i remember when i first woke up to nine eleven i mean the first couple
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:11.400]  weeks it was in two thousand two it was in the run up to the iraq war i started
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:14.120]  looking at sites like nine eleven timeline dot net
[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:18.440]  and uh... stand down dot net and really just reading the synopsis this before i
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:22.280]  you know even thought about controlled demolition it even passed my mind
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:26.040]  and i was losing you know i'm in new york i'm losing sleep i can't believe
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.520]  this i want to think the best of my country i almost signed up for the
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:31.640]  military after nine eleven i'd already taken the asfab test
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.400]  i almost joined the national guard in my uh sophomore year of college with my
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:38.440]  buddy and luckily thank the thank the lord
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:42.280]  uh... my stepfather is an x marine and he just kept throwing the recruiter out
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:45.320]  saying get the hell out of here you know my kid isn't going into the military
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:49.320]  i don't care what you tell him and i didn't end up going and my buddy
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:53.000]  who did join the national guard did end up having to go to iraq for
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.160]  a year and he got blown up in a tank and he lost hearing in his right ear and
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:02.280]  it's a horrible story but at the same time there's i only had so much time
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.240]  where i was kind of like in shock didn't know what to do
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:08.200]  before i started taking action and by taking action i mean i was just showing
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:11.640]  people websites at the time it's printing things off grabbing videos
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:14.360]  and this is before the time that even the usb stick
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:17.800]  so i'm burning cdrs for people saying please watch this
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:21.480]  film please watch road to tyranny uh you know check out
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:25.400]  in plain sight all these things in plain sight didn't come out till 2004 so
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:28.360]  really just running up and then that led me
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:33.160]  and you know by taking small action for years getting laughed at ridiculed
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:37.080]  losing friends family members not wanting to talk to me my stepfather
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:40.280]  mocking me on another level you know thank god he didn't have to go to the
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:43.720]  military but boy he said some really wacky things to me
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:48.360]  while i was first getting into 9 11 truth and that all stopped
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:51.640]  once i put out loose change second edition
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.600]  uh with the two other guys once we put that film out and it started to become
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:58.600]  an international sensation now it was the mainstream press that was taught
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:03.080]  attacking me now it was mainstream radio that was attacking me but
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:06.200]  the regular people that i know and love and care about
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:10.040]  all came around every single one of them and they said you know what
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:12.760]  i may not agree with everything you're saying but you're obviously asking
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:16.600]  questions for the right reason and we just have to put it that way to
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:19.080]  other people say look you know i'm not telling you what to
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:21.960]  believe but look at this cyber security act
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:26.040]  and you know you just talked about some of the civil liberty concerns
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:30.360]  they actually put that in the bill as if as if they're concerned with our civil
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:33.000]  liberties they say well whether societal and civil
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.320]  liberty concerns are adequately addressed notice it doesn't say
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:40.840]  to ensure that the constitution and bill of rights are followed to the t
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:46.120]  no we'll see if societal and civil liberty concerns are adequately
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:48.680]  addressed what does that mean that means they
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:51.560]  don't have to go to by the constitution that means they don't have to go by the
[1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:56.040]  bill of rights and again this is about all networks
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:49:02.280]  all networks it's not just government networks it's not just company
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:06.680]  networks the entire infrastructure is being taken over
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.960]  and it's more than the federalese it's more than j rockefeller who introduced
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:14.440]  this bill this is about globalism an international
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:20.680]  cyber security standard chinese style internet that's what
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:23.240]  we're really talking about josh in arkansas josh
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:29.080]  online yes i think that first time i'm up here in

[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:14.360]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:17.800]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:20.680]  it's true total government control of electricity
[2:05:20.680 --> 2:05:24.200]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[2:05:24.200 --> 2:05:27.800]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:31.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:35.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:38.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:41.480]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:34.120]  tuesday snowstorm shatters local records we're seeing this in places like
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:37.400]  chicago we've got the headline over here
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:42.360]  washington dc record levels baltimore maryland
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:46.680]  record levels and what does the mainstream media say
[2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:50.600]  well they say it's because of global warming see they have their cake and eat
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:54.680]  it too if there was no snow it's global warming
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:59.000]  if we have too much snow it's global warming but they don't even use the
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:02.600]  term global warming anymore they say climate change so it can be
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:06.360]  all encompassing doesn't matter that china has
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:10.600]  internal documents saying that well this is really about a consolidation of
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:14.680]  power and world government and i'm no fan of the chinese or their
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:17.640]  policies but let's look at these other headlines
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:22.280]  and again these are all out of the uk mainline publications
[2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:27.880]  this is saturday's global mail the great global warming collapse as science
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:32.360]  scandals keep coming the air has gone out of the climate change movement
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:39.880]  of course it has because the ipcc is a un organization hellbent on global
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:44.520]  governance and really a one world order a new
[2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:50.440]  world order with the elitist at the top with the bankers in control
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:54.840]  and us as the serfs and slaves has nothing to do
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:57.880]  with saving the planet and everything to do
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:03.160]  with taxing you to death and controlling your lives from the inside out saying
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:06.520]  how much energy you can use what kind of home you can live in
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:11.000]  how many cars you can have how many children you will be allowed
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.280]  also coming up an invisible empire ted turner talking about one and two child
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:18.360]  policies in this country he calls them voluntary folks there's
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:23.320]  no such thing as a voluntary one child policy
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:27.560]  okay doesn't exist it's like black sunshine doesn't happen
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:31.400]  okay just doesn't happen climate change
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:35.160]  research bungal the research institute run by the head of the un's climate
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:38.600]  body has handed out a series of environmental awards to companies
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:43.400]  that have given it financial support that's called quid pro quo
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:47.560]  again nothing to do with the climate and everything to do
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:52.200]  with empowering world government and kickbacks the energy and resources
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:55.320]  institute of which doctor rajendra pashery
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:58.360]  is the director general has given corporate awards to companies such as
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:02.440]  pepsi and honda oh yes pepsi and honda are so green
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:06.680]  as well as indian businesses those same companies have given financial
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:09.800]  backing to terry through grants or paid for
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:14.280]  consultancy work oh we'll hire him as a consultant
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:18.280]  for a couple hundred thousand dollars a year that would never sway his opinion
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:22.840]  no no no new errors in ipcc climate change
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:26.280]  report the united nations panel on climate change is facing fresh criticism
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:29.640]  today as the sunday telegraph reveals new factual errors
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:33.400]  and poor sources of evidence in its influential report to government
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:39.960]  leaders this was the end all be all report i believe back in 2007
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:43.320]  and let's just go through the list but the top list this is what the mainstream
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:48.920]  media is telling you the corporate controlled press is admitting this
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:52.680]  it contained the publication of inaccurate data of the on the potential
[2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:56.040]  of wave power to produce electricity around the world which was wrongly
[2:11:56.040 --> 2:11:59.640]  attributed to the website of commercial wave energy company claims based on
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:02.920]  information and press releases and newsletters
[2:12:02.920 --> 2:12:07.000]  new examples of statements based on student dissertations
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:12.360]  two of which were unpublished did you hear that student dissertations that
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:15.880]  were unpublished more claims which were based on
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:19.720]  reports produced by environmental pressure groups
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:23.080]  they are the latest in the series of damaging revelations about the ipcc's
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.800]  most recent report published in 2007 last month the panel was forced to
[2:12:27.800 --> 2:12:30.840]  issue a humiliating retraction after it emerged statements about the
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:34.600]  melting of himalayan glaciers were inaccurate
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:39.320]  they used some you know kid who was a mountain climber in his 20s
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:43.320]  saying that he took pictures and it looked like the glaciers were melting
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:47.640]  no scientific evidence whatsoever zero
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:53.800]  zero point zero evidence and then i got to end it on this note i thought of
[2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:58.520]  killing myself says climate scandal professor phil jones and phil jones is
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:02.360]  featured again in my upcoming film invisible empire
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:07.000]  and this guy said boy when this happened i just felt so bad i almost killed
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:10.600]  myself and what's really disgusting about the article
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:15.080]  is that they relate his experience to dr david kelly
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:18.760]  saying that dr david kelly killed himself he was murdered
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:22.680]  murdered they're saying he killed himself
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:26.760]  after he came out publicly and said that the uh defense department out in the
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:31.080]  uk had sexed up intelligence about iraq and weapons of mass destruction all
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:34.120]  the sudden you find him in the woods with his wrist cut
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:37.320]  and they're trying to say that that's a suicide and it's in relation
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:41.160]  no they killed this guy for telling the truth
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:45.080]  the inquests have shown it the cover-ups have shown it
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:48.760]  but now phil jones oh i just i couldn't deal with it now he won't admit that he
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:52.360]  was wrong or that he was lying he's just upset about the way the
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.480]  media handled it read the emails folks the emails are the most damning thing
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:14:01.640]  you could possibly read don't read the media spin read the emails
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.000]  all right let's go back to a few more callers let's go to jim
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:09.320]  in virginia jim you're on the line oh no jim he hung up let's go to chris in
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:12.760]  kentucky chris you're on the line hey jason thanks for taking my call
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:15.560]  you got it i just you know all the information you gave out about the
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:18.600]  cyber attacks and things like that i think it's also just attack the worsening
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:22.200]  economy they just want to get the complete control
[2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:25.880]  of what i agree what i agree and you can tell that
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:31.000]  when obama is apathetic or what is it and no i'm sorry agnostic
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.560]  towards taxes on regular americans before when he was a champion of the people
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:38.920]  where there will be no new taxes we're leaving iraq we're getting out of
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:42.600]  afghanistan we're going to come fish fiscally responsible we're getting rid
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:47.800]  of lobbyists none of it was true zero of it was true they just continue to
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.600]  bail out the banks with trillions of dollars
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:55.000]  they continue to pass nightmarish legislation like the give act
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.680]  they promote youth core and they are trying to
[2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:02.600]  put this country under more socialization which is just going to lead
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:06.040]  to a global government takeover go ahead chris
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:09.800]  and i just also you know you're right about the 911 truth i'm a
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:14.040]  former volunteer firefighter and after 2002 when i woke up i was trained in
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:16.680]  you know in fire behavior and it was in the way he started talking about the
[2:15:16.680 --> 2:15:20.760]  steel melting i said wait a minute no way it doesn't melt at that temperature
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:24.280]  no way people need to realize that you know they've come out with so many
[2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:27.960]  different stories i appreciate the call let's go through a few of those stories
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:33.560]  first day okay well it just got so hot that the steel melted and then the
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:37.240]  building pancake floor by floor by floor then you start looking at the videos
[2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:39.640]  and it doesn't pancake floor by floor you can see
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.600]  huge ejections from the explosions that are taking place 2040 and 60 floors
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:48.920]  below the supposed quote unquote pancake so then
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:51.640]  they come out and they spin it and they say well it didn't really have to be
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:54.920]  hot enough to melt the steel it just had to weaken it
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:58.520]  and then this domino effect happened and the central columns gave way
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:01.880]  remember they told you it was a hollow tube nothing could have been further
[2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:06.440]  from the truth it was a huge cross-section grid
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:10.520]  i mean it's got a control what they told you and what really
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:15.960]  happened and then we point out well there were temperatures of over 2700
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:17.960]  degrees at the base of the world trade center
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:23.080]  jeffy will only burns at 1800 degrees they were refused to address that point
[2:16:23.080 --> 2:16:26.520]  when you talk about the molten metal it doesn't exist
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:29.720]  they don't want to talk about the molten metal they say this is their talking
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:33.080]  point back this is what the people over at skeptics magazine like tom
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:38.040]  schermer and other scumbags say they say well it didn't have to be that hot
[2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:41.560]  you know at 1800 degrees at look listen we're not talking about
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:47.080]  when steel loses its strength we're talking about the molten metal
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:52.040]  that was found on the site and then john gross of nist the national institute
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:56.360]  of standards and technology which are in charge of this cyber security act
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:02.600]  with the fcc same organization gets up in front of a college
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:06.920]  classroom at a lecture and says well i was on the site i never saw any of it
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:10.440]  and then a professor from that school all in loose change final cut you get a
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:14.440]  for five bucks case dvd whole nine over at info wars
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:16.920]  dot com one of the professors who's at the lecture
[2:17:16.920 --> 2:17:20.760]  says well wait a minute what about this molten metal and he's like well could
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.240]  just show it to me did you just see it yourself
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:27.000]  he's like well no but it was reported oh i don't know of any reports and then
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:30.680]  we play the firefighters talking about the molten
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.600]  metal we play ken holvin of the federal emergency management
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  agency talking about the molten metal dripping from building six
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:42.840]  we show you the clips where they talk about 2000 plus degree temperatures
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:47.320]  weeks after the attacks but the debunkers don't want to touch it
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:52.520]  because it's the truth god forbid we act like grown-ups in this country and
[2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:56.360]  talk about the truth the truth has become like some

[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:15.320]  tyrannical system in which corporations special
[2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:19.880]  interests dominate our lives on behalf of offshore banks
[2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:23.400]  to one where we have a government for and by the people again

[2:18:46.760 --> 2:18:50.760]  internet has been going on long before that
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:55.160]  even with the passage of the homeland security act
[2:18:55.160 --> 2:19:00.600]  the somebody off there are monitoring stations for example uh in new jersey

[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:13.720]  where each of the uh high-speed serial links coming into the network were being
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:16.680]  tapped and brought into this back rooms that everything coming into and out of
[2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:20.440]  the station to monitor exactly what happens people don't understand they go

[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:28.280]  to what we can do as a people when we get over our fear
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:35.960]  and we turn that fear into activism into proactively attacking the system that
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:39.240]  is trying to destroy us all right let's take a couple more
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:44.680]  callers let's go to justin in oklahoma justin you're online
[2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:50.440]  yes sir uh yeah um my sources are a little little look up some of the stuff
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:53.800]  but i have a few questions um one of them would be
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:59.320]  something i heard on tv about um in afghanistan how we were doing everything
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.640]  to make their lives better and like uh supposedly our
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:08.840]  government allowed rape supposedly let me let me stop you because you are just
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:11.560]  like going through this so slow first of all
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:14.920]  we're not in afghanistan to help anybody but ourselves
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:20.040]  we put in our dictator hamid karzai a chevron executive
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:24.040]  and we allow we don't allow we fund his brother
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:29.800]  the lead opium dealer in afghanistan for the last eight years covertly through
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:33.480]  the central intelligence agency that's the bush administration
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:37.720]  that's the obama administration point one point two
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:42.520]  right now as we speak nato and us forces nato
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:47.480]  un forces again it's about globalism it's about internationalism
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:51.960]  are digging in for a huge offensive on quote unquote
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:58.360]  taliban fighters it's a dog and pony show we could have been in and out of
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:01.800]  that country in two three months that's not what we wanted
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.960]  we want that country to build the infrastructure of a eurasian
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:11.080]  union under our control a conglomerate of iraq which we've taken over
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:15.800]  of afghanistan which we've taken over of saudi arabia which we've worked with
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:21.400]  for really decades now we want iran we're beating the drums against
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:25.960]  yemen and we're looking to take over that region as far as the rape goes my
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  friend that was out in 2004 to let me say
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:34.920]  that again 2004 senators came out of hearings
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:38.760]  not just looking at the guantanamo bay pictures that we've seen
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:42.680]  but seeing some of the actual rape videos they've
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:46.600]  videotaped some of these rapes and killings and they were disgusted
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:51.800]  so there is no question that united states military personnel
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:55.560]  are over there torturing and raping people yes that's the that is the
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:59.480]  uncomfortable truth that most people don't want to address go ahead justin
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:03.080]  the bill that was passed not about our own doing it but
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:07.080]  the fact of a bill passed allowing rape to be legal
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:11.880]  a male can deny his wife a food for three days and that there is a rape
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:13.480]  uh... she can
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:17.960]  uh... you can try her for murder if he does not enjoy his pleasures
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:21.480]  and uh... what are you talking about Islamic law
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:24.360]  justin i'm not sure what you did if you're discussing
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:28.360]  you know laws from other countries you know some of these things are chauvinistic
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.040]  they are in favor of male dominance but i can assure you
[2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:36.440]  there are no laws to be passed by the united states government or even
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:40.040]  internationally where rape is okay i can promise you that rape
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:44.280]  not okay appreciate the call let's go to michael in california michael you're
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:45.880]  online
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:49.480]  hey jason good morning or afternoon uh...
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:53.240]  something that i came across on channel two fox network
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:57.880]  channel two in san francisco is that in april
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:03.560]  the city and county has decided that they will send out the first
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:08.840]  carbon tax bills in the country now the interesting point about this is that
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:12.440]  the u n was created in san francisco
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:15.640]  uh... but they have announced that come april
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:19.400]  you all businesses this is only business not people
[2:29:19.400 --> 2:29:24.200]  but all businesses in the city and county of san francisco will be receiving
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:28.280]  their first carbon tax bill of the year well they couldn't let me tell you
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:32.040]  something couldn't get it in on the federal level
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:35.000]  and they couldn't get it in on the international level with the copenhagen
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:37.240]  climate conference so what are they going to do they're going to bring it to the
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:40.760]  local level first and see which suckers pay into it
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:43.880]  we'll be back after this with richard reeves it's the alex joneshow i'm jason

[2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:17.800]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:22.040]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:26.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:30.120]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:33.960]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:37.320]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:30:37.320 --> 2:30:41.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.520]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:22.520]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots

[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:35.080]  he is on assignment we are joined now by richard reeves a local activist and
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:38.440]  host of front line texas richard how are you today
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:42.200]  hey jason i'm doing great and thank you and alex and the crew for having me on
[2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:47.000]  hey no thank you for coming in i want to just give a short synopsis of who you
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:51.560]  are and how you really became awakened to the patriot movement because you've
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:54.360]  you've been a local activist for a long time i know you've been out on
[2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:57.880]  trips with alex before with myself you've been camera crew you know
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:01.560]  driving us around part of the action that's right it's uh been a few years
[2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:05.800]  now first in alex in 97 but going back even further than that i remember as a
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:10.200]  young kid uh in a single digits of age playing dominoes and
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:13.800]  polyanna with my grandmother and at that time one of the best resources
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:15.960]  ironically enough was one of these tabloids like the
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:18.120]  inquirer and things like that at that time
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:20.680]  that's how you got a lot of this information about the new world order
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:25.000]  and how ultimately the plan was to take america over from within
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:28.680]  and even then as a six seven eight year old playing
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:31.880]  these board games with my grandmother she was telling me about that how that we
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:35.000]  were destined to be destroyed from within and so that was really my first
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:38.600]  heads up as a young boy even back then and my dad he kind of knew what was
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:42.360]  going on but you know it wasn't till around 1992
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:45.640]  that the puzzles started getting put together for me more
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:49.160]  and that was from listening to a radio talk show host named chuck harder
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:52.360]  i don't know if you ever heard of chuck harder but he was back in 92
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:56.200]  and he was uh definitely at that time exposing
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:34:59.640]  the left right paradigm and how that you know the left sides phony the
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:03.480]  democrats are run by these uh fraudsters and the bankster gangsters and then
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:06.600]  you've got the right side run by the fraudster bankster gangsters
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:09.560]  and he was really starting to demonstrate that back in 92
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:14.360]  but then in 97 driving through austin texas as a truck driver i was going
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:17.960]  through austin texas on a regular basis about twice a week
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:21.720]  if not even more frequently and at that time alex jones was
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:26.520]  he'd gotten on a blow torch of a radio fm station 98.9 fm
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:30.760]  and he was doing a great job back then i didn't have any idea he was only
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:35.080]  in his early 20s back in 90s he has that gravelly voice so you know it's very
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:38.760]  hard to distinguish exactly and so uh i didn't have any
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:42.360]  idea he was that young of a man i thought he's in his 30s 40s something
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:45.240]  like that but then 36th birthday today happy
[2:35:45.240 --> 2:35:47.960]  birthday alex jones out there i want to throw that out there
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:51.640]  well that's right happy birthday alex and wherever you are i hope you're having
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:56.360]  a good time but the thing that really got me in 97
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:00.920]  listen alex was that he really had the ability to articulate
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:04.920]  the new world order and how they operate which that's been one of the
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:08.520]  the shortages that we've had for so many years and he was able to articulate
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:12.040]  that and he really got me on board he was at that time
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:15.480]  really really bashing bill clinton at that time in 97
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:18.600]  and of course who did we have in the governor's mansion during that time
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:23.480]  none other than george w bush and so it was somewhere i guess in 1998 or
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:27.880]  1999 that they literally changed the format on 98.9 fm
[2:36:27.880 --> 2:36:33.160]  it went to all spanish radio and all of a sudden that talk radio station was gone
[2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:36.840]  and uh frankly i i lost track of alex there briefly
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:40.120]  but when i saw 9 11 i was when i saw those events
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:44.520]  of 9 11 uh i remember uh that uh i worked night shift
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:47.640]  you know for many many years and at that time during 9 11 i was working night
[2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:52.200]  shift as well but on that particular day my phone would not quit ringing it
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:54.760]  would not quit ringing so i finally asked the man i got to answer this call
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:58.200]  must be important and it's none other than my mother calling me i'm saying you
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:00.520]  need to turn on the tv and see what's going on
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:04.920]  and so for the rest of the day i did basically nothing but watch the events
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:09.960]  on 9 11 and i saw building seven come down live on tv that day
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:13.240]  and from there on i said man i got to find alex jones again
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:16.840]  because this guy i'm sure he knows what's up he knows what's going on
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:20.840]  i knew that when i saw building seven that the official so-called story that
[2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:25.640]  they were feeding us was a lie and from there on it's like
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:29.960]  uh as far as activism goes it's like how do you go back to non-activism after
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:34.360]  seeing that and realizing that the nwo is that criminal and that crazy
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:41.320]  after 3 000 people are killed on live television and i you know this is why i
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:46.680]  keep harkening back to 9 11 i think it's very important we do so and why
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:52.280]  because number one it's their command and control operation when they want to go
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:55.640]  into a nation when they want to justify body scanners
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:59.640]  what do they say 9 11 right 9 11 we're going to post
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:03.400]  9 11 world and this continues to this day right
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:09.080]  eight plus years later and fortunately with guys like alex jones and you jason
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:13.160]  and all the work that's been done is you hear less of that imagine
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:17.080]  where we would be imagine where we would be if we didn't have
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:20.120]  all these activists out there exposing 9 11 truth
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:24.040]  i think we're not that far from a day when they're going to be
[2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:28.040]  the powers that be in the mainstream media are going to be afraid
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:31.640]  to talk about 9 11 because the overwhelming numbers of us are going
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:35.880]  to be 9 11 truthers i've seen this from being to tea party events before
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:40.840]  where one of the things is see i'm a grassroots ground warfare i'm a grunt
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:43.960]  on the ground is what i am in this in this info war
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:47.720]  i'm one of the grunts on the ground i go to tea party events in san tonio
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:50.440]  i've done a little bit of tea party events here in austin and then i'm
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:53.640]  always going to the different city council county commissioners hearing
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:38:57.400]  camp aboard here is all these different you know legislating hearings etc
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:00.920]  so that gives me a different perspective being boots on the ground and what's
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:06.440]  going on in the tea parties is that you can picture a scene out of brave heart
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:09.720]  and that's why i like to kind of describe it is that what you got in the tea
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:14.360]  parties is you got liberty minded people patriots 9 11 truthers on one side
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:17.480]  you picture one of those battlefield scenes where they show the camera and
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:21.800]  they show that divide that's a like a grassy field between these two armed
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:25.400]  forces that are about to just head on towards each other and clash
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:28.440]  and you know they're going to be clanging of swords and spears being
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:32.440]  chunked and you know horses running over people and people getting stabbed
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:36.360]  etc crossbows being fired and that is exactly what's going on in these
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:39.640]  tea parties is you've got liberty and patriot minded people
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:45.000]  encountering establishment republican rhinos the republicans in name only the
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:48.040]  neocons and then you've got the a lot of the
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:51.960]  globalists involved too but the overwhelming number of people
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:55.880]  is going to be end up going to be patriots we're going to win this battle
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.480]  i think that the republican party is the low hanging fruit still
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:02.600]  but i'm it as a matter of fact now on that program frontline text that you
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:06.200]  mentioned earlier what i talk about is that we need to get big enough in
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.640]  bad enough with 911 truth and all these
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:13.640]  nw o exposing issues to where we literally take over
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:18.440]  all the political system left right uh libertarian party we've got patriots
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.000]  involved in the libertarian party i say to the libertarians man your battle
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:26.120]  stations keep your post don't let the nw o come
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:30.680]  back in and corrupt any of the parties libertarian party is basically
[2:40:30.680 --> 2:40:35.880]  run by patriots and in constitutionalist and now i think what we're going to see
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:40.280]  is the republican party become patriot and we're starting to see people get
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:43.640]  involved in the democrat party you can see that right here in travis county
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:47.160]  and i know it's a national show but i want to emphasize that
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:50.760]  these little things that are happening all over the different places are just
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.080]  a microcosm view of the overall that's going
[2:40:55.080 --> 2:40:59.640]  to where 911 truthers patriots etc keep getting bigger and bigger
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:03.880]  and we end up being the majority well you know i've noticed that these events
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:07.160]  like these tea party events that even the guys that
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:11.480]  maybe don't know about 911 truth that are the mainline republicans if you
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:14.440]  give them an obama deception or a fall of the republic
[2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:18.040]  they are they're just wide awake to that they can see that
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:21.720]  you know what i mean obviously you know 911 isn't dealt with very much in those
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:25.000]  films maybe briefly you know out of a two plus hour movie
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.720]  but they look at that and then all of a sudden they're opened up to hey wait
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:29.880]  him at the federal reserve is a private system
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:34.760]  hey wait him at the builder group does exist hey this isn't just alex jones
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:38.440]  talking about obama standing in front of the united nations
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:41.880]  as their secretary general you know betraying the constitution the bill of
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:44.920]  rights and ultimately the people that are in this country
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:48.120]  so you start them out with something that like that then you give them
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:53.720]  you know a loose change final cut a fabled enemies a 911 truth rising
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:56.760]  you know and you can get those for great deals and we encourage people i
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:42:00.360]  remember the tea party i went to in san antonio in april with glenn back
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:03.640]  there was a group there i believe it was san antonio 911 truth
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:07.880]  and they had uh copied over a thousand obama deceptions
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:11.960]  and i personally witnessed them handing them out to people and i can't tell you
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:15.960]  how many little old ladies you know in their 60s and 70s
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:20.280]  grabbed it and they said you know i got sent this last week i just watched it
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:23.640]  last night this was unbelievable thank you for a hard copy i'm going to give
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:27.400]  this to my son i'm going to give this to my daughter and it was so heartening to
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:31.080]  me that we can have such a big effect with
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:34.440]  what someone perceived our small movies you know we don't get a big theatrical
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:37.480]  release you know miramax isn't backing us right you know
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:41.560]  mainstream hollywood could give a rat's ass about us it's grassroots warfare at
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:44.520]  the best and exactly what you laid out i heard you talk about earlier in the
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:46.600]  show that you went to san antonio that tea party
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:49.640]  and so you got to witness firsthand that it was like that braveheart movie
[2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:52.680]  where you've got these two opposing forces clashing together
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:56.280]  but the truth is going to win out it's just a matter of reinforcing and getting
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:00.040]  it out there and like you said maybe with the neocon you have to start out
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:03.960]  talking about the debauched food the gmo food or maybe it's about the big
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:07.400]  pharma you know or maybe it's about the hpv vaccine that rick perry wanted
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:10.600]  rammed down everybody's throws or maybe it's about the fluoride in the water
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:14.280]  but sooner or later somebody's got an issue that you can touch them on
[2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:17.240]  and it's touching their life maybe they got an autistic kid
[2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:20.680]  who knows what the issue is you can talk about public schools and how the
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:25.000]  continuing dummy down of america just happens over and over and gets
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:28.680]  worse every year so there's some way to approach everybody
[2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:32.440]  and maybe nine eleven truth for some people is kind of the the end of the
[2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.240]  road where they finally get to but they will get to it
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:38.440]  or they'll have to deny it and for those that would deny it
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:41.880]  then i think they're in a heap of trouble because they're going there
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:45.320]  i've seen it happen at these tea party events where you've got one guy that he's
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:48.760]  not he's not a nine eleven truth or well as he's walking around the room he's
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:52.360]  meeting different people or whatever he's running the nine eleven truthers
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:56.040]  yeah so it was like one of these movies like uh you that you see these one of
[2:43:56.040 --> 2:43:58.760]  these zombie movies where every time you go around the corner you run into
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:01.720]  another zombie well it's another nine eleven truth or and so that's what
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:05.400]  we're going to get to is we just need to be so ubiquitous
[2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.840]  so ubiquitous on around every corner that
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:12.840]  there's no denying it and that in 2012
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:17.400]  i personally think i really believe that we are going to field
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:20.360]  a presidential candidate i don't know if it's going to be wrong paul
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:23.400]  could be wrong paul i don't know who it is but this time there's not going to be
[2:44:23.400 --> 2:44:26.280]  any uh pussyfooting around with nine eleven truth
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:28.920]  it's going to be front and center it's going to be on the agenda
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:33.000]  and what we need to do to get there is get everybody to precinct conventions
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.400]  both sides of the aisle democrat republican
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:39.000]  precinct conventions nine eleven truthers infiltrate all of these groups
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:42.840]  and get back our republic that way and then when we go to these conventions
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:47.080]  then we're there and we're ready to select presidential candidates of our own
[2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:50.920]  choosing yeah unless and you know not let the bankers just select who they want
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:53.560]  and i always tell people you know you catch more flies
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:57.080]  with honey so when you're talking to somebody that you know already has some
[2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:00.840]  kind of a different opposing political belief try to bring them in
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:04.680]  with something you can agree on you know like you said the right is more apt to
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:07.240]  know about the climate gait issue you know talk
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:11.080]  about the kopenhagen treaty you know talk about the emails and
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:15.080]  work your way into other aspects of the military
[2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:22.200]  industrial complex and now in texas it really does look like we have a shot
[2:45:22.200 --> 2:45:26.200]  at a governor who actually believes i mean get this folks
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:31.640]  in the constitution and bill of rights oh my god tell us about deborah medina i
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:34.520]  tell you i'm so happy to tell you about that i'm glad you asked jason
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:38.680]  medina for texas dot com that's the website medina for texas dot com
[2:45:38.680 --> 2:45:42.120]  and i got to tell you this latest public policy poll that came out
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:47.800]  showing her 24 really is what's got the the powers to be on the attack now i'm
[2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:50.840]  surprised they waited so long but yes they are on the attack
[2:45:50.840 --> 2:45:53.480]  and we can look for more attacks against them redina
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:57.160]  as this campaign goes forward but you know one thing i like to point out on
[2:45:57.160 --> 2:46:03.560]  my show is that we had 1.3 million voters vote independent in 2006
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:09.880]  1.3 million voters rick perry only had 550 000 votes in that 2006 primary and
[2:46:09.880 --> 2:46:14.120]  now he's looking at splitting that 550 000 vote base
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:17.720]  he's looking at sharing that to some degree with k bailey hutcheson
[2:46:17.720 --> 2:46:23.160]  rick perry may end up with numbers in the 300 000 to 400 000 vote range
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:26.600]  jason can we really think after all these years
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:29.800]  of alex jones right here in austin the hotbed of freedom
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:33.160]  not just of texas not just of the nation but of the world
[2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:36.600]  can we really not believe that we've got a million patriots in texas
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:39.800]  that are ready to hit that black box voting button
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:42.600]  for deborah medina and i know those people out there
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:45.800]  there's got to be a million of us ready to pull that and do that and i'm
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:50.440]  encouraging people to remain organized especially on election day because we
[2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:54.360]  know about the fraud with die bold we've seen hacking democracy
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:57.400]  we've read black box voting by bev harris
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:03.080]  and we need to keep this election as honest as possible we need pollsters
[2:47:03.080 --> 2:47:06.920]  going after the people as they exit because we know they've done it in the
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:10.360]  past where they'll do a 10 of 15 or sometimes
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:13.720]  an even 20 point swing in the other direction
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:17.160]  that's right that's right the uh vote rescue dot org vote rescue dot org
[2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:20.680]  vicki carp's group who uh her and karen renick i believe have been on alex's
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:24.520]  show before and they talk about this issue of black box voting
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:29.080]  and it is a very serious issue as a matter of fact in 2002 i went to work on a
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:31.800]  campaign back in 2002 here in travis county
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.320]  because of that issue i i said man i you know i'm
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:38.840]  i hear alex talking about black box voting but man i'm still having trouble
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:42.360]  with that and i saw the the uh two brothers that put the video together i
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:44.440]  don't recall their name right off the top of my head but
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:47.160]  they put a video together about black box voting
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:50.920]  and i thought man it's just still hard for me to believe but i got involved
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:54.120]  in that election 2002 here in travis county and that made a believer out of
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:56.760]  me that yes black box voting does exist
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:00.600]  and there are fraudulent things going on with our voting but that's where we just
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:04.920]  like i said i need to emphasize that we are need to be big enough and bad enough
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:08.680]  we need to have the numbers out there that we man every poll
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:12.120]  and we do the polling like you're talking about the exit polls of our own
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:15.640]  and vote rescue dot org i will be surprised i'm sure
[2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:19.560]  that they're planning on doing something here in this election to help monitor
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:23.160]  the polls and i think we can just make it to and i think there's good people
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:26.280]  inside the system too not everybody's corrupted completely
[2:48:26.280 --> 2:48:29.320]  i think a lot of the times if we can just nail down
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:32.760]  the vote at the precincts and know those numbers there
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:35.880]  then we just follow up the chain of command and try to verify the votes as
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:39.080]  they go up the chain of command when they bring them into those central
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:42.920]  locations at the county level and that's another way to do it but vote rescue
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:45.480]  dot org those are the folks that are really going to be
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:49.000]  watching this and i have full faith in those people like vicky karp
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:53.640]  karen renick and their organization in helping watch for the vote fraud
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:58.200]  you know we have to shine light on the darkness of corruption wherever it may
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:00.840]  lie so you know we have this election
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:05.240]  it's a close election deborah medina is edged out we have to remain vigilant
[2:49:05.240 --> 2:49:09.960]  i mean we know in 2004 in the fixed presidential election
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:14.440]  of second and eighth cousins on both sides second cousin on one eighth cousin
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:17.480]  on the other both went to Yale together you know two years
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:20.680]  apart both in skull and bones don't mention skull and bones
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:23.960]  i don't know how that doesn't exist either you know it just doesn't exist
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:26.760]  you know it doesn't matter i can't talk about it yeah it's so secret i can't
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:30.760]  talk about it and you look at that election carry
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:33.800]  wins the election let me repeat that folks carry
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:38.360]  wins the election in fact in jesse ventura american conspiracies
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:44.040]  he devotes an entire chapter to 2004 and in 2004
[2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:48.840]  in ohio they rigged the election and jesse ventura goes into it in this book
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:51.400]  you can order it over at info wars dot com
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:54.840]  right now i believe we have alex jones on the line
[2:49:54.840 --> 2:49:59.400]  alex yes i'm driving on the highway here listening to you on the new free
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:02.040]  iphone and uh well then i'll come back over the
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:05.480]  break briefly but i did notice last night
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:10.120]  googling just my own name that they're attacking deborah medina all over the
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:14.120]  place including newsweek using me staying
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:17.480]  over the king of the 9-11 truthers that you know the
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:21.800]  the guru of the tea parties uh you know they use all these
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:25.000]  the profit of the tea party which is actually
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:29.880]  overall the truth that's on ball it's me if you've got to fix somebody out which
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:33.880]  i don't actually like the level of heat scrutiny and disinformation and going
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:37.480]  to elpro that we're getting but the point is never
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:40.760]  ever even gotten into that and and that's fine i've never asked her about
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:43.480]  9-11 truth because i know she's a constitutionalist
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:47.080]  we need to get her into office it's a state position
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:50.280]  and but they're really trying to bring that up they're going after on a lot of
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:53.720]  other issues now they brought paylon in to endorse
[2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:57.960]  uh perry over her because they now know that she can really win they do have
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:01.080]  before but they wanted to ignore her to not give her attention
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:04.120]  i think them attacking her is only going to blow up with Alex will be right
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:08.280]  after this our economy is in great distress
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:11.800]  the financial dominoes can fall at any time
[2:51:11.800 --> 2:51:17.320]  it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does

[2:54:13.720 --> 2:54:18.520]  sitting in alex on the line richard reeves in studio and alex was making the
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:21.720]  point during the break no matter what happens
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:27.880]  medina running for the governorship is a win-win because we are shining light on
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:31.400]  the real issues and we are gearing other people up
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:35.960]  to run in big elections under the constitution
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:39.880]  and the bill of rights which is now a novel idea in this country alex
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:43.720]  well ever medina is the equivalent of george washington winning that first
[2:54:43.720 --> 2:54:47.720]  battle a couple years into the war at trenton new jersey
[2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:51.160]  uh... they lost every battle but they won that small battle and that gave
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:55.560]  people uh... the free to core is that gave them
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:54:59.080]  that why does he have the tunnel it really buoyed them and and we had a big
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:03.240]  victory at trenton two months ago and copenhagen but at the state level with
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:06.840]  a real battle is you look at north gom you look at homeland security look at the
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:10.520]  john warren fence office of china you look at the governor's uh...
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:14.120]  board that obama's created it's all about taking over the states they
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:18.040]  recognize the number one threat is the thirty seven states now moving to
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:21.320]  declare sovereignty that's the session like very says
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:25.000]  demonizing states rights movement while posing as one of us
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.240]  and that's a true benedict Arnold just like back it's very sophisticated
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:35.160]  but but what they're doing here is just by her gaining four or five points every
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:37.880]  week if she had two more months she would be them
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:42.120]  hands down no runoff she may still win everybody's got to act like she could
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:45.240]  win but now people will remember to take
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:49.000]  ron paul uh... campaign for liberty patriot
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:53.880]  you know info warrior type candidates in other states the city council mayor
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:58.440]  state house congress senate governorship a lot more serious
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:02.760]  and they will catch fire a lot faster at the grass roots
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:07.000]  and so people are now lining up the next three elections the next three years
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.760]  and we're going to see other great champions of freedom like deborah medina i
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:13.080]  think people frankly even more impressive
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:16.680]  very well-spoken very smart great person i think you're going to see
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:20.280]  some men step forward they're going to be incredibly dynamite more women
[2:56:20.280 --> 2:56:24.200]  stepping forward so again this is another victory at trend
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:27.640]  we've already won a giant victory that this is now international
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:31.560]  and national news and the system is sending out their biggest guns
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:35.000]  uh... like comrade back and the democratic party and the republican
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.480]  party also the republican party's running
[2:56:37.480 --> 2:56:42.520]  three party neocons against ron paul their true colors are being shown
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:45.560]  this is a big victory i'm gonna throw it back to you and richard rafes
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  a great job gentlemen god bless you thank you so much alex
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:52.280]  and uh... coming up in the next segment richard
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:55.960]  for prison planet dot tv viewers and i want to get your take on this i want to
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:57:00.440]  show the panel of the new captain america comic book i don't know if you've
[2:57:00.440 --> 2:57:04.280]  seen him holding in my hand actually have seen where they portray
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:07.960]  the tea party movement as racist white people
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:11.480]  now you've been to these things i see latinos there
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:14.520]  i see black people there i see non-whites there
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:17.480]  you know a lot of people would say that i'm not white enough you know i i mean
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:21.240]  i'm at these things this is total propaganda
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:25.160]  and it's done through what used to be you know
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:28.680]  an icon of american greatness captain america
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:32.200]  you know he went after red skull and eight off hit i mean this is the comic
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:37.080]  book character that rained in hitler and now you know i read this thing
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:42.680]  and uh... we're gonna put it up on the screen for prison planet dot tv viewers
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:45.640]  basically captain america is doing a little recon he's got a partner
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:50.040]  partners african-american and they're looking into the crowd signs like
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:53.960]  america and americans and then ones you would never see
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:59.320]  at a tea party things like teabag the libs before they teabag you see
[2:57:59.320 --> 2:58:05.000]  the teabag thing is something that the fake left has used to demonize the tea
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:08.040]  parties no one's talking about teabagging
[2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:11.720]  we believe that you know the founding fathers were on to something
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:15.160]  when they took on the british and they had their first boston tea party that's
[2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:17.800]  all this music has nothing to do with teabag
[2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:21.480]  now as the the black gentleman looks into the crowd he says i don't exactly
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:24.920]  see any black people here insinuating like oh
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:28.840]  this is some kind of a racist movement so i want to get into that i want to get
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:31.800]  into the mass mind control i want to get into how they're going after our

[3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:44.040]  socialist teabag the libs again the tea party movement really isn't about right
[3:00:44.040 --> 3:00:48.200]  or left it's about us empowering ourselves through the
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:51.960]  constitution and the bill of rights and those documents are really there to
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:55.560]  empower humanity those documents don't guarantee us
[3:00:55.560 --> 3:01:01.080]  anything okay god our inherent human rights guarantee us the rights to be
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:03.800]  free and these documents just set it in stone
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:07.640]  and now they're being eviscerated on every single
[3:01:07.640 --> 3:01:12.680]  level so when i see captain america again an icon an icon you know my buddy
[3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:16.280]  got the captain america tattoo this year you know i see little kids in the
[3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:20.120]  captain america outfits in one of the story lines
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:23.480]  about two or three years ago because they've had several different
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:27.080]  captain americas you know i think it was steve richards at first but it's
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:29.720]  someone different they actually had a storyline
[3:01:29.720 --> 3:01:33.400]  where all of the heroes were forced by the government
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:36.600]  in the united nations act the actual united nations
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:39.960]  to register they all had to take their masks off and register
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:43.800]  and captain america refused to take his mask off refused to register
[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:48.200]  so he got shot through the head yeah he got he gets sniped out and killed
[3:01:48.200 --> 3:01:52.280]  after a big court proceeding so that to me was actually kind of positive it's
[3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:54.680]  kind of showing hey captain america stood up for
[3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:58.200]  privacy issues he didn't go to the man he gets shot in the head but now
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.840]  they're using captain america as a vehicle to demonize the tea party
[3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:06.760]  movement what's your take well i agree with you exactly because
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:10.440]  traditionally that's the way they demonize the patriot movement in general
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:14.360]  is by colinus racist anti-semites etc like that
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:18.840]  and or just ten full hat wears kooks uh and those things are wearing thin i
[3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:22.360]  mean basically because they've tried this racist thing over and over that's
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:25.240]  just like when you try to try to talk about the illegal invasion the border
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:29.720]  issues etc they have a difficult time moving that
[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:33.080]  forward now with colinus the you know the racist group or whatever because
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:37.720]  this for example down in santonio in the tea party movement down there there
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:42.760]  are plenty of american americans of hispanic descent down there involved
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:46.520]  in that party in the tea party movement itself as a matter of fact my lovely
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:49.560]  wife kathryn she first got introduced into the
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:54.600]  patriot movement via glen back of all sources that got her into this and then
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:59.960]  it was at that very tea party function that you went to on april 15th of 2009
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:04.040]  that she was actually a speaker there at that event and roused the crowd up even
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:07.960]  more than glenn beck did at that event but she didn't know about the full
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:12.680]  spectrum of the new world order until it was the info warriors down there like
[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:15.560]  yourself jason and matthew medina some of the great
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:20.440]  activists down there santonio gave her a dvd and she watched it and and was it
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.440]  obama deception i think it was obama deception that she first saw and that
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:28.040]  really helped wake her up and then she's a quick study gets on the web and then
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:31.880]  all of a sudden she's on board full on and so there's an example of how
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:35.560]  glenn beck we leverage glenn beck to bring in more people into the
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:39.560]  patriot movement so overall it's good that he can at least wake up people to
[3:03:39.560 --> 3:03:42.440]  certain issues it's like now basically when they talk
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:45.560]  about a globalist government wanting to come to power a new world order come to
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:48.200]  power you know used to people like that we were
[3:03:48.200 --> 3:03:51.560]  called kooks back then that's gone almost anymore
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:55.240]  now basically the only ammo they have to fight us with is trying to
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:03:59.080]  name us racist and that's not going to work either because there are great
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:03.720]  activists that are coming on of every color we've got a gentleman called named
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:07.000]  apostle claver out of houston that he's bringing
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:10.040]  fourth constitutionalist he's a black gentleman out of houston
[3:04:10.040 --> 3:04:14.520]  very articulate he's a like an alex jones up there just fiery
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:18.920]  talking about constitution talking about god given rights and so the people of
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:22.040]  color are starting to come on this movement as matter of fact that's part of
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:25.080]  what i've been working on at the grunt grassroots level
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:28.520]  is saying all right look we do need to bring in more
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:31.640]  hispanic people especially here in texas we've got a lot of hispanic people
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:34.200]  here and you know what bottom line is they're
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:37.640]  conservative and they're american and if they just
[3:04:37.640 --> 3:04:41.880]  remind themselves of the constitution they're constitutional and they appreciate
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:44.840]  the god given rights when we come back i want to discuss some of the other
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:47.480]  great candidates that are out there i see that you brought a list with you of

[3:08:31.560 --> 3:08:35.640]  with the info warrior sitting in i get so used to that it's terrible for me
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:39.880]  we were just discussing some of the other candidates out there outside of
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:43.000]  deborah medina obviously everybody who's listening locally we hope that
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.880]  you go out you support medina you get involved like i said
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:49.640]  get involved with the exit polling folks get involved right now with knocking
[3:08:49.640 --> 3:08:52.680]  on your neighbor's doors and saying hey have you heard about this candidate
[3:08:52.680 --> 3:08:56.520]  are you watching this election do you plan to vote and if they don't plan to
[3:08:56.520 --> 3:09:00.840]  vote that's the person to rally on say listen we got some real issues right
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:03.800]  now you need to be voting and you need to be voting for this person
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:07.960]  for these reasons and you just need to step by step it's like i said earlier
[3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:11.560]  you catch a lot more flies with honey you can usually
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:15.400]  a lot you know if you have any kind of discernment
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:18.680]  you walk up to a home you see the home you see the car they're driving
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:21.960]  you see who answers the door right off the bat you should be able to
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:26.280]  intellectually tell how you can at least talk to this person for a little
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:29.080]  bit longer what you need to say to this person to get them
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:34.280]  interested not only in voting but in your candidate and again it comes down
[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:38.440]  to us becoming human beings again that's right you know we're so
[3:09:38.440 --> 3:09:42.600]  detached from society in this text message
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:46.040]  twitter world you know everything's through facebook
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:50.280]  everything's through an im or an email we don't pick up the phone and call our
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:54.040]  parents anymore we email and we don't talk to our
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:09:57.400]  neighbors at all anymore and jason you bring up some great points i tell you
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:00.520]  i could address several issues that you just brought up in the commentary you
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:03.800]  just made but we need to build basically two social
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:06.600]  networks one of them is on the web but you know it's just like you talked about
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:09.960]  earlier in the show the web is subject to being cut off at a moment's notice
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:12.840]  you know we we know that's run through the pentagon they can flip the switches
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:15.640]  and all of a sudden no more web it's going to be a hard one to get over on
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:18.520]  the american public because we're used to the freedom of the internet and the
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:22.360]  free speech that we have on it but the number the second parallel
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:25.880]  social network that we need to build exactly what you're talking about is
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.560]  working within our precincts in our neighborhoods so to speak
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:33.480]  to where we've got people on board that we know what they're thinking about we
[3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:36.520]  know they're constitutionalist we know they're patriots we know they're about
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:41.000]  god-given rights and get them on board and that's what i see happening out there
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:45.080]  is people are getting connected we're going to build the biggest grassroots
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:48.280]  patriot network ever and that's what's happening because
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:52.600]  i can give you an example in an election that i was involved in in 2006 there was
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:55.720]  one lady named susan gary up in a town called
[3:10:55.720 --> 3:10:58.680]  copeland texas that's just south of taylor texas in
[3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:02.760]  williamson county and she knew the people in her precinct in her
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:06.520]  neighborhood so well that our candidate despite the fact
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:09.400]  that barbara samson our patriot candidate in that race
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:12.360]  was poorly funded we had less than ten thousand dollars
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:15.240]  and we were up against one of the juggernauts at the state
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:18.360]  rep you know here in texas that had probably in the neighborhood of a
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:22.920]  hundred thousand dollars for a state race for a state representative seat
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:27.000]  race and this lady susan gary single-handedly
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:31.320]  brought in about 70 percent of the vote and that's the kind of grassroots
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:33.400]  networks that we're going to be able to build
[3:11:33.400 --> 3:11:37.640]  the question is not a matter of if we build it is a question of when we build
[3:11:37.640 --> 3:11:40.760]  it because that's what's happening is that people are getting connected they're
[3:11:40.760 --> 3:11:44.920]  getting out of their neighborhoods and if we have that level of ground troops
[3:11:44.920 --> 3:11:48.520]  so to speak then we can dominate in these elections
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:52.440]  we can dominate on the ballot see another way to get around black box voting
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:56.200]  and this is one of the things i've been talking about on variety programs that i
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:00.440]  get to do is that we can beat black box voting by
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:03.560]  being the grassroots that's so in control that we
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:06.120]  proffer up these candidates look at this slate of candidates i don't know if you
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:09.000]  can zoom in on that and i'm not interested let's get that guys whether
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.960]  or not if people can read that entire slate or not
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:16.040]  because what's important is that list of patriot names that are running in all
[3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:19.480]  these different races you've got people running for the supreme court
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:23.320]  you've got people running for state representative seats i think we've got
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:26.760]  some patriots running for state senate seats we've got people running for
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:29.960]  precinct chairs we have got patriots running for all these
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:32.920]  different offices and it doesn't stop there
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:36.120]  because what you've got to remember is it's like when Debra Medina is going
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:40.360]  out to these town halls or these debates or whatever that's just another
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:43.640]  info warrior out there getting the message of liberty
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:49.800]  constitution freedom property rights etc each one of these is a warrior out
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:12:52.920]  there a soldier if you will in the ground war
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:57.160]  educating the public every town hall they do every time they get to speak with
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:00.440]  their neighbors they are info warrior and
[3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:03.880]  what better way than to multitask you know how the new world order it seems
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:07.000]  like everything they do has a multifaceted approach i mean you look at
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:10.120]  9-11 they destroyed building 7 because it's loaded up with all kinds of
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:12.680]  government secrets that they don't want to get out of the bag
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:17.400]  well here's how we can info warrior in a multifaceted manner is by
[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:21.480]  these candidates stepping up and here i am in just in travis county
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:25.320]  you know jason it's gotten so big that i really feel in my heart that
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:28.600]  this kind of level of activity is going on nationwide now
[3:13:28.600 --> 3:13:31.320]  it's just there's so much of it going on there's no way to keep track of or
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:34.200]  know about it but i'm very encouraged it looks
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:37.160]  like in kentucky rand paul is probably going to win
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:41.240]  his senate primary and most likely go on to win a senate seat
[3:13:41.240 --> 3:13:44.040]  so i'm thinking that what we're going to have
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:48.520]  and success to me in this election coming up would be to see at least a
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:52.280]  hundred incumbents at the us rep level get fired
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:55.720]  whether they're republican democrat i don't care i just want to see a hundred
[3:13:55.720 --> 3:13:59.000]  incumbents lose their seats and a lot of those
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:01.560]  the achilles heel can happen right in the primary
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:05.320]  and if we've got patriots involved in both parties then we can be pulling the
[3:14:05.320 --> 3:14:09.000]  trigger and firing incumbents in these primaries that's the achilles
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:11.960]  heels because once you get to these general elections
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:16.520]  it's harder to fire incumbents because in most gerrymander districts
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:19.480]  you know you've got a bias you throw in any democrat
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:23.480]  and it doesn't matter what his views are then you know he could be patriot he
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:26.600]  could be satan but a democrat's going to win in that district
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:29.640]  same thing in some districts with the republican you've got a republican bias
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:32.920]  so that's why i say the achilles heel to the new world order
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:37.480]  in i mean we've got a variety of achilles heels but in the political process
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.320]  these primaries is the achilles heel well i think if the people that are
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:45.320]  listening to this program or aware of what's going on trade in their apathy
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:49.880]  for action then we can do wonders again people have to
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:53.080]  realize that they have great power themselves that doesn't mean that you
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:58.040]  necessarily have to run for city council or state senate or congress
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:02.440]  but help somebody that you know is going to be for
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:06.360]  the constitution individual rights sovereignty
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:09.880]  the constitutional republic we live in not just democracy
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.360]  democracy is a word that's thrown around to really paralyze us
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:18.360]  and put us in a position where we don't know what to do you know democracy like
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:21.800]  they say is 51 of the population telling the other 49
[3:15:21.800 --> 3:15:24.760]  percent that they have to go to the camps that's not what this
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:27.640]  country was founded on there's a reason we have states rights
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:31.160]  there's a reason we used to have a separation of powers
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:35.400]  three count them one two three branches of government it was called checks and
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:38.040]  balances we no longer have it in the national security
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:41.880]  state but we had an executive branch which is just totally corrupt with power
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:45.720]  right now we added judicial and we had a legislative and they were supposed to
[3:15:45.720 --> 3:15:49.960]  get on one another but what we've seen is this consolidation
[3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:53.000]  of power through the military industrial complex
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:57.400]  and it just keeps growing and growing and growing and growing and getting
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:00.040]  bigger and i had a couple callers earlier if you were listening to the show
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:03.640]  they said you know i'm just so overwhelmed by this information i don't
[3:16:03.640 --> 3:16:06.920]  know what to do so we've already traded in their apathy
[3:16:06.920 --> 3:16:11.400]  you know they've gone away from well there's you know no big deal we're in
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:14.760]  afghanistan we're in iraq i see people people don't even realize we're still
[3:16:14.760 --> 3:16:19.320]  in two wars it's just like every day i mean when bush was in it was a big deal
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:23.960]  we had anti-war demonstrations all the time but the savior comes in
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:27.800]  and the left code pink all the frauds refuse
[3:16:27.800 --> 3:16:31.800]  refuse to step out into the streets and then the real deal
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:36.040]  cindy sheehan rises above it all she's out in dc right now
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:39.880]  trying to get a tent city going of protesters
[3:16:39.880 --> 3:16:43.480]  and now the left hates her they refuse to talk about her the mainstream media
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:47.240]  won't even cover her people need to realize that this is a system
[3:16:47.240 --> 3:16:53.480]  of command and control and they will use and have used and continue to use
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:58.280]  well meaning good people to continue their agenda so we have to be aware of
[3:16:58.280 --> 3:17:02.520]  that and again let's just trade in the apathy for action knock on doors make
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:06.760]  phone calls get out there make posters i know there's a lot of talented artists
[3:17:06.760 --> 3:17:10.440]  out there you know make some posters get out in the streets i know there's a lot
[3:17:10.440 --> 3:17:15.160]  of uh talented graffiti artists out there you know i've heard more and more
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:19.800]  lately in you know the city of london and the city of new york and chicago
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:24.280]  people are spray painting info wars dot com prison planet dot tv
[3:17:24.280 --> 3:17:29.400]  and getting people aware i mean there's gorilla activism there's so much each
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:32.840]  and every one of us can do that's right if we just step up to the plate that's
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.840]  when we start to win and you made some great points by saying
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:40.920]  that the people just need to get off their apathy i think we really are as
[3:17:40.920 --> 3:17:44.840]  i had a caller one day saying that the independence in connecticut
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:49.240]  are at about the 50 threshold that independence patriot minded people
[3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:53.240]  constitutionally minded people are at the 50 threshold i think that's a
[3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:57.160]  nationwide phenomenon and what ends up controlling
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:00.680]  the republican party and the democrat party are only about
[3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:04.440]  two or three percent of the people end up controlling those so if these
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:07.400]  patriots just divvied them up the amongst themselves
[3:18:07.400 --> 3:18:11.000]  and got into the democrat republican parties libertarians keep your
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:13.800]  positions in the libertarian party don't let
[3:18:13.800 --> 3:18:18.040]  these neocons and new world order folks get back into power there
[3:18:18.040 --> 3:18:21.800]  then the activism that you're talking about will work and that's just it we
[3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:25.000]  are big enough to do that i'm convinced of that fact
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:28.680]  because i've seen the numbers continue to grow i've watched these elections
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:32.600]  continue to grow our numbers and there's just no stopping us the question is
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:35.080]  will be a we'd be allowed to have time
[3:18:35.080 --> 3:18:39.320]  and for the folks that don't want to get involved there is nowhere to run or
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:41.960]  nowhere to hide alex says this on the show frequently
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:44.760]  that he would go off to some other country if there were another place to go
[3:18:44.760 --> 3:18:48.120]  to nowhere to go but there's nowhere to go this is it this is the time to make
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:50.840]  your stand and the time to make your stand is not
[3:18:50.840 --> 3:18:53.880]  when the bullets start to fly it is too late at that point in that
[3:18:53.880 --> 3:18:57.640]  in that point from that point of view i think that the war has been lost by us
[3:18:57.640 --> 3:19:01.560]  if we see bullets start flying that's where we got an opportunity right now
[3:19:01.560 --> 3:19:04.520]  and this is it we need to take it we need to move forward
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:08.920]  and keep people activated and and they're coming they're they're coming that way
[3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:13.240]  uh... the tea party movement like said uh... despite the fact that
[3:19:13.240 --> 3:19:16.760]  glen back and others that shan had a these they try to co-opt it you see
[3:19:16.760 --> 3:19:20.280]  rick perry try to co-opt it trying to get ron paul out of office through the
[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:23.240]  tea party right now i mean that is unbelievable to me
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:26.520]  they are literally running candidates against ron paul
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:30.600]  as tea party tickets these people aren't for the constitution and bill of
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:33.800]  rights that we have to redouble our efforts to make sure that ron paul is

[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:25.640]  assignment we are joined by richard reeves
[3:24:25.640 --> 3:24:30.440]  in studio i just wanted to hit a couple of the other big stories that we
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:33.080]  haven't covered yet today repossessions at highest level since
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:38.360]  1995 in the uk uh they're saying it rose by 15
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:41.240]  percent in 2009 but the final quarter figures
[3:24:41.240 --> 3:24:46.920]  were uh 13 percent that's still over one out of every 10 people in the uk
[3:24:46.920 --> 3:24:49.880]  losing their house i mean they're just repossessing everything
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:53.720]  this is a global issue this is a global
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:57.240]  economic crisis and it's been construed
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:03.160]  in a way for them to bring in a new currency that's why you saw the
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:06.600]  consolidation of power in the g20 when they said well
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:09.080]  Gordon Brown got up and said it's a new world order
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:13.560]  and then they start announcing well you know the sec is going to be absorbed
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:17.000]  by the federal reserve and the imf and they're all going to start working
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.240]  together and we're not going to be issuing
[3:25:19.240 --> 3:25:22.440]  dollars anymore to third world nations we're going to be issuing
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:29.240]  sd r's that special drawing rights units it is the global
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:35.480]  currency you can type in sd r conversion rate you go to the imf's own
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:41.400]  website and it is top dog the sd r is the top and
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:44.520]  out of the uh the big currencies the dollar ain't looking so good
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:49.720]  you know the pounds above it the euros above it the barring denar is above it
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:53.720]  and it just keeps sinking and sinking and sinking that's why it's important
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:57.640]  to you know reiterate things are bad all over and they're going to offer us the
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:01.000]  solution like they're the savior whether that be in a marrow
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:05.080]  or a global currency court like the one that medvedev
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:09.080]  showed people after the g8 i mean this is really happening richard
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:12.920]  it is absolutely really happening and it is the slow demise of the dollar
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:16.200]  but it's a double-edged sword because it's at one point you know they could
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:18.680]  pull the plug on the dollar anytime they could just
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:22.120]  call up all the banks one day or email them or whatever they do and say hey
[3:26:22.120 --> 3:26:25.960]  banks no more cash goes out today atm's frozen
[3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:28.600]  can't get your money out and they could do that so
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:31.960]  we're blessed in that at least we've got more time to react
[3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:35.640]  uh that 13 percent number that you put out about the uk of those folks
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:39.720]  their homes being repossessed imagine if that were in the 20 or 30 percent range
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:43.720]  and the outrage i mean 13 percent you know their outrage those folks are
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:46.840]  and here in the united states i think that number of repossessions is probably
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:49.400]  eight or 10 percent it's a pretty high number
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.760]  but uh at least they're measured the new world order is measuring
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:55.800]  how fast they can move forward with their agenda and of course the listeners to
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:58.600]  this show already know that the ultimate goal is
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:02.840]  the cashless society and everybody putting on the mark of the beast and the
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:06.120]  you know everybody having to thumb print and
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:10.600]  thumb scan and who knows who knows what else and they beta test these things
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:14.040]  in different parts of the globe and right now they're getting to
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:18.040]  beta test army on the streets to confront
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:21.880]  terror threats where in the united kingdom and it has
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:25.560]  nothing to do with terrorism it is to acclimate the public
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:29.240]  to get used to the military on the streets like they have
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:33.080]  in china where the military is the police the police
[3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:38.360]  are the military you are guilty until proven innocent this is out of the
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:43.160]  independent britain's armed forces could be used on a regular basis on the
[3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:45.640]  streets of britain to confront the threat of terrorism
[3:27:45.640 --> 3:27:49.080]  even though the last big terror attack was carried out by their own people the
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:53.560]  seven seven bombings of 2004 it's been proven time and time again
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:28:01.160]  we had the head of visor consultants go on sky news and the bbc that day
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:04.360]  that day and admit they were running a drill
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:07.000]  for people he didn't want to name he didn't want to name the people he was
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:12.680]  running the drill for a blowing up the same three train stations at the same
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:15.800]  exact time and when he was confronted about it
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:21.080]  by we are change ireland last year he walked into a closet and closed the door
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:26.760]  instead of actually answering the questions these are he knows what happened
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:29.720]  he knows damn well what happened and he knows he better keep
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:33.960]  his mouth shut and they are beta testing all sorts of things in the united
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:37.800]  kingdom cctv cameras in homes for the worst families
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:41.560]  sinbin families internet eyes is about to launch
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:45.480]  where they're going to pay you for good tips as you watch

[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:54.120]  creating this tattletale nightmare society that we've only read about
[3:28:54.120 --> 3:28:59.640]  in books like 1984 well 1984 appears to be trying to come to fruition there in
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:02.680]  england and at least we've got that luxury being able to
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:05.960]  watch it happening across across the pond but folks
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:09.880]  do not wait to get active as jason said earlier because that will be coming
[3:29:09.880 --> 3:29:13.720]  here and the new world order does go country by
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:16.760]  country and have different levels of new world or activity but they're
[3:29:16.760 --> 3:29:19.800]  everywhere so there let's go to another beta test okay
[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:23.320]  let's let's look at afghanistan what are they beta testing in afghanistan

[3:33:55.160 --> 3:33:58.760]  couple of weeks but it's another way for us to reach an even larger audience
[3:33:58.760 --> 3:34:02.440]  richard absolutely i'm really excited about that too i
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:07.000]  came onto the ipod downloading the ipod the podcast etc
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:10.440]  two three years ago and it's a great thing i remember i can't tell you how
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:14.600]  many shortwave radios that i used to use out of my car and damage the antenna
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:17.320]  because i hit my power window button and it get
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:21.800]  bent up and as the power windows going up so those days of having to
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:26.120]  struggle to get truth and freedom oriented broadcast like alex jones gcm
[3:34:26.120 --> 3:34:29.320]  live.com etc that was very difficult and now it's just
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:33.000]  keep it keeps getting easier and easier but we've got to use this while we've
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.560]  got it because as you stated earlier in this program
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:39.400]  the internet is subject to being cut off anytime that's just like our banking
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:43.000]  system the powers would be the new world order they can flip a few switches
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.160]  and all of a sudden no cash at the atms we've seen things like that happen in
[3:34:47.160 --> 3:34:50.440]  iceland that you were talking about the biometric scanning going on in
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:55.560]  afghanistan we saw back i guess around 2001 era that argentina
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:34:58.600]  basically going belly up and all the things that happened there
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:02.120]  we cannot continue to wait any longer because pretty soon
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:05.800]  that front page news around the world that there's just destitution and
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:09.720]  poverty everywhere will be the story about here right here in the usa right
[3:35:09.720 --> 3:35:13.560]  here in austin texas and this audience though i've got to say
[3:35:13.560 --> 3:35:18.040]  congratulations that you're listening this is the most important political
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:21.720]  audience on the face of the earth if there's another one i want to know
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:25.560]  about it because there cannot be i've been a talk radio junkie
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:29.800]  for many years because of my career as a driver and this is it this is the
[3:35:29.800 --> 3:35:32.680]  audience that's going to make the difference i want to congratulate the
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:35.640]  folks that are out there and download the podcast
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:40.040]  get that iphone app etc they really are the most read the most learned and the
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:43.720]  most active of any audience out there this is the largest
[3:35:43.720 --> 3:35:48.840]  organic intelligence agency on the planet the cia the massage all these
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:53.320]  different mi 5 mi 6 they only wish they could have the assets that we have
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:56.280]  because the information that flows right through here
[3:35:56.280 --> 3:35:59.560]  through that chair with alex jones and you and that microphone
[3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:03.640]  is incredible and amazing to say the least well thank you so much man
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:07.480]  uh you just mentioned the mi 5 i thought i'd uh hit this headline top judge
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:13.000]  vinyan mohammed case shows mi 5 to be devious dishonest and get this
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:17.720]  complicitant torture who knew we did we've been telling you that the mi 5 mi
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:23.320]  6 cia isi all part of the same anglo-american
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:28.200]  establishment all part of the international intelligence organization
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:31.480]  that will work hook or buy crook with terrorists
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:34.760]  murderers killers they like these sycophants
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:39.400]  i mean they let they recruit them oh absolutely absolutely they they proffer
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:41.880]  their uh military industrial complex this way
[3:36:41.880 --> 3:36:45.080]  i mean we've seen that the problem reaction solution over and over it's
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:48.680]  been discussed the gaelian dialectic where
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:51.480]  if they create the crisis they can come in with a solution
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:56.120]  and these intelligence agencies over and over and over are right there
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:36:59.800]  in the midst of these false flag operations and that's one reason you know
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:03.880]  you can harken back to jfk that one of the big toes that he stepped on
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:08.120]  right before his assassination was that he wanted to do away with the cia and
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:10.840]  the intelligence break it into a thousand different pieces richard
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:14.200]  right and so you know you step on some big toes when you start stepping on the
[3:37:14.200 --> 3:37:17.640]  federal reserve boys that they're connected with the intelligence agencies
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:20.360]  you stepped on some of the oil boys down here in texas
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:23.320]  you step on all those toes and all of a sudden look what happened so
[3:37:23.320 --> 3:37:26.920]  but the thing of it is now with so many more people getting wise to the
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:30.360]  situation there are too many of us to put it away
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:33.880]  uh to put away the truth there are too many of so what we need to do now is
[3:37:33.880 --> 3:37:37.000]  just keep charging forward keep info warrior like you were
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:40.200]  talking about earlier going down to santonia at the tea parties there
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:44.440]  we just keep on pressing and we will be victorious
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:47.960]  uh if we just keep moving forward on that absolutely let's take some callers
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:52.520]  let's go to karen and origan karen you're online
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:38:00.600]  yes karen what we're calling for at taxfree15.com is a national strike
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:05.400]  for four days april 15th through april 18th with those of us who can on the
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:08.920]  19th presenting assigned articles of freedom
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:13.000]  with bob shelter's group or signed petitions for state sovereignty
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:18.680]  to our state officials we feel that so many things out there have gone so
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.480]  poorly and as long as we keep going about our lives as regular and normal
[3:38:23.480 --> 3:38:27.080]  pretending somebody else will save us it's not going to happen so we're
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:31.800]  calling for a complete and total withdrawal of support and finances for
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:36.600]  four consecutive days at taxfree15.com well i like how
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:39.800]  you've done that on april 15th you definitely picked a great day to do
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.000]  that and i wish you all the best what do you think richard april 15th is
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:46.600]  absolutely the perfect day uh i used to be a truck driver
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:51.000]  and truck drivers basically uh you get treated like a second class citizen
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.640]  right there because you're really kind of at the forefront of the new world
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:57.000]  order and their operations with their commercial drivers license their cdls
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:01.160]  their documentation uh they want a 10-year work history if you get a job
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:05.720]  they really and that was back in 97 when i got out i got out of that industry
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:09.560]  but i tell you you really got a taste of being a second class citizen
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:13.720]  as a truck driver and one thing i want to caution people is yes we need to do
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:17.240]  some kind of general strike like that or whatever but i think we need to limit
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:20.680]  it to maybe a day like april 15th is the ideal day
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:24.200]  because it was so hard to wrangle those independent cats
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:27.720]  so many of them are just over broke uh in the trucking industry that
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:31.560]  despite the fact that they were all going broke to get them organized
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:35.400]  to do a week long event or anything like that was just oh yeah they would sign
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:38.600]  on for it but then they wouldn't do it when it comes time to do it because hey
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:41.160]  they got to put bread on the table they got to feed their family and we're a
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:44.040]  deader nation now i mean we are a deader nation we're a deader nation
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:49.400]  so i think great idea limit it to one day to where you really pound on it
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:53.480]  and don't do business like uh she was saying i think something like that's
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:39:57.000]  going to really happen that idea has been talked about many times and it's
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:00.360]  building up to that and if we could do it for four days or a week it would be
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:05.000]  outstanding but people aren't i just don't know if we're ready for that
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:08.600]  quite yet but the one day thing on april 15th i think a lot of people would
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:11.720]  get down with that program well people need to realize you know our grandparents
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:14.920]  and some of our parents depending on how old you are out there they saved
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:18.840]  they bought things when they could afford things they didn't just
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:23.160]  get a credit card or get a mortgage and then all of a sudden they're in debt
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:30.040]  we as a people no longer have any wealth to ourselves very few of us save very
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:33.240]  few of us have a savings account there are so many people out there that are on
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:37.960]  you know check to check check that they're living paycheck to paycheck to
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:41.480]  paycheck and you're seeing it more and more in families with two or three
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:44.200]  children where they would have been middle class
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:49.640]  10 20 30 years ago you know they're destitute they're almost broke they're
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:54.520]  about to have their home repossessed so it's time to really rethink how we're
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:58.280]  living as a society it's not time to go out and get that new
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:01.320]  credit card so you can afford the ipad when it launches
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:05.400]  you know it's time to put that money away and maybe invest in some gold
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:10.280]  or silver or storeable foods you know or maybe a solar panel
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:13.480]  and a cola blue something to make yourself
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:16.680]  a little more independent and a little more off the grid
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:20.440]  that's right i mean we see the centralization going on all around us on
[3:41:20.440 --> 3:41:24.120]  everything whether it's energy whether it's fuel whether it's food
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:27.800]  whether it's you name it housing it's like they try to put us in the compact
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:31.240]  cities so it just never ends on the avenues of
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:35.320]  attack that we're being confronted with so that's exactly right we need to do as
[3:41:35.320 --> 3:41:39.400]  much as we can to be more independent we need to push back on that to where we
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:42.600]  are more independent growing our own food having our own place to live out in
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:46.280]  the country but at the same time they make it harder and harder because
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:49.240]  they've run this money system on us for so long
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:52.200]  and like you said gotten so many people into the trap
[3:41:52.200 --> 3:41:56.920]  of being debtors because that's how they enslave so many people not just
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:00.600]  here in the united states but around the world not just people too but
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:03.720]  entire countries as well well i remember being blown away
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.240]  as a seventeen-year-old kid graduating high school
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:10.680]  and i went to you know like the open house for my college
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:16.040]  the summer before and right there as i'm you know signing up for my meal card
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:20.040]  and or my identification card you know so that you go to the meal hall and
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:23.320]  swipe for your things and what was the other thing on my email
[3:42:23.320 --> 3:42:27.400]  account there are sign-ups for credit cards right i mean
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:31.160]  as you're going there to go to school they're trying to sign up
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:33.960]  seventeen and eighteen-year-olds to get their first
[3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:38.200]  credit card i don't know about you richard but i wasn't the most responsible
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:42.440]  uh fiscally at seventeen and eighteen years old and they bank the system
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:46.280]  banks on that sort of attitude that's right they love the college graduates
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:50.520]  by design coming out fifty sixty seventy eighty thousand dollars in debt
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:55.000]  with student loans credit card loans etc that enslave them that disempowers them
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:58.040]  from being active it means that they've got to get their nose to the
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:01.080]  grindstone to feed themselves to clothe and house
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:04.760]  their themselves and their families that limits the
[3:43:04.760 --> 3:43:09.080]  ability to be out there and be active because let me tell you being politically
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:11.960]  active takes a toll on you it takes the time it takes the effort
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:15.640]  i know you've done it you've been out there and so folks i just have to say
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:19.240]  you've got to make that sacrifice now you've got a lot sometime
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:22.440]  i know uh most people if you got a couple of kids or whatever that's like two
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:25.480]  full-time jobs full-time job per kid
[3:43:25.480 --> 3:43:28.760]  and then you've got a full-time job to work to put bread on the table
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:31.960]  that's like three full-time jobs well i'll tell you what there's a fourth
[3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:35.800]  part-time job or fifth part-time there's a part-time job you need to take on and
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:39.560]  that's bringing back and saving this republic here in texas and the country
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:43.640]  i agree with you a hundred percent let's go to another caller jim and virginia
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:44.840]  jim you're online
[3:43:44.840 --> 3:43:50.440]  hey good afternoon jason and richard uh i wanted to kind of get into a little
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:53.880]  bit about the glenn beck uh it was not too sure about
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:56.680]  what to make of him then i heard this interview he did with
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:44:00.120]  deborah medina and there's no question that he's just a complete
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:03.480]  phony and he had only one purpose and that was to knock her down
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:07.080]  well let me give you my glenn beck story okay i was supposed to be on glenn
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:10.360]  beck on the fifth anniversary of nine eleven back in the day when he was
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:13.480]  still on cnn and he wasn't being given all this attention
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:18.040]  he wasn't copying info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:23.640]  he was keeping it extremely mainline now i had been booked on this show
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:26.200]  for over a month over a month we've been booked
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:30.280]  uh dylan and i were supposed to go on that show now we were supposed to oppose
[3:44:30.280 --> 3:44:33.160]  popular mechanics james mags and david dunbar
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:36.200]  they were the ones that wrote this article that turned into a book they're
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:39.800]  the main debunkers now earlier in the day
[3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:44.120]  i go on live television and radio to debate these same two people
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:47.960]  on uh amy goodman's democracy now and she's actually pretty fair pretty fair

[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:55.640]  anybody out there type in loose change popular mechanics debate
[3:44:55.640 --> 3:44:59.400]  to watch the whole thing i i mean i'm inches away from megs and he's
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:04.600]  stuttering stammering he can't get out a full sentence he looks guilty as sin
[3:45:04.600 --> 3:45:09.160]  we were immediately canceled on glenn beck james mags was able to propagate
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:13.720]  his lies over some video uh or some tapes of our movie
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:17.240]  you know and i right there i knew the guy was completely
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:22.280]  illegitimate let's fast forward now to the georgia conflict now
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:26.520]  if you're new to the program you may not know what happened in georgia
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:31.000]  uh a little under two years ago the the mainline story
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:36.280]  was the evil russians had gone into south osetia and just started murdering
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:40.600]  people and they were going after georgia and georgia was defending itself it
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:44.360]  was this great republic and sakas vealy their leader was
[3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:48.040]  so for freedom and justice he's just the greatest
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:52.760]  so he goes on glenn beck sakas vealy and starts talking to glenn
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:45:57.400]  about how this isn't about him this is about a new world order
[3:45:57.400 --> 3:46:02.200]  literally says new world order on the air do you think glenn beck called him on
[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:06.920]  it do you think glenn beck said something glenn beck called him a great
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:11.720]  person and humanitarian and said god be with you to this man
[3:46:11.720 --> 3:46:16.520]  i am throwing up in my mouth when i watch this let me tell you what happened
[3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:20.280]  in georgia and south osetia the georgians
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:23.320]  were running drills on the border of south osetia
[3:46:23.320 --> 3:46:27.560]  with israeli special forces and blackwater
[3:46:27.560 --> 3:46:30.840]  us military privatized groups running these drills
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:34.600]  okay so russia sees this and they say well we better start running our own
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:37.480]  drills because what if these things go live all the
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:40.760]  sudden they go live georgia goes and sneaks attack
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:46.360]  sneak attacks south osetia murdering people and russia goes in to stop it
[3:46:46.360 --> 3:46:50.040]  and they're demonized in the press for over a year the only mainline guy
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:53.720]  that i know of that told the truth was pat you can and richard

[3:55:55.880 --> 3:55:58.360]  time but you know i just got to finish up with
[3:55:58.360 --> 3:56:02.120]  going back to this debba deena thing glenn beck you have single-handedly
[3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:06.760]  made yourself the leader of 9 11 liar glenn beck is not
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:10.200]  going to go well for you the info warriors and the 9 11 truthers
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:14.520]  are going to count you from now on we actually stopped rudy juliani
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:17.720]  from becoming the presidential selected candidate
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:22.760]  for the oate election in that election rudolf juliani was the
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:26.200]  the uh air apparent for the republican nomination
[3:56:26.200 --> 3:56:29.960]  it was 9 11 truthers that dogged him everywhere he went
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:33.960]  he could not show up in any public venue and not get away from 9 11 truthers
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:36.520]  i predict that that's what's going to happen to glenn beck you're going to
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:40.760]  rue the day that you came out and made yourself the leader of 9 11 liars group
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:44.280]  you're going to be exposed and sarah palin the same thing for you
[3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:47.560]  that you're trying to hijack the tea party move you're trying to hijack the
