[00:00.000 --> 00:12.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.180 --> 00:36.900]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.900 --> 00:44.060]  ladies and gentlemen to this Monday October 24 2011 Info Wars transmission Alex
[00:44.060 --> 00:47.900]  is out on assignment he's been working on a television show but he will be
[00:47.900 --> 00:52.180]  popping in on the other side of this break Alex Jones will be joining us
[00:52.180 --> 00:56.860]  shortly we also have Wayne Madsen investigative journalists joining us to
[00:56.860 --> 01:02.540]  talk about all the developments with Syria with Libya instituting Islamic law
[01:02.540 --> 01:08.700]  with the new one Treasury for Europe and so much more then later in the
[01:08.700 --> 01:12.020]  broadcast we're going to have Info Wars contributor and writer Patrick
[01:12.020 --> 01:18.860]  Henningson and we'll discuss all things Syria Iran the conclusion of Libya with
[01:18.860 --> 01:23.660]  the death of Gaddafi and a whole lot more coming up later and I really want
[01:23.660 --> 01:29.180]  to try to break down the geopolitical background behind that rimland where
[01:29.180 --> 01:34.100]  really the whole region is set on fire I want to talk about clips where people
[01:34.100 --> 01:39.500]  like Wesley Clark blew the whistle on how they had a plan for seven wars in
[01:39.500 --> 01:44.300]  five years at the time in the region list of very familiar countries from Iraq
[01:44.300 --> 01:49.940]  on down now we've been through Libya and we're approaching Syria and the end game
[01:49.940 --> 01:55.700]  of Iran all that is coming up in the broadcast I wanted to cover in detail
[01:55.700 --> 02:00.900]  New Euro Empire plot by Brussels European Union chiefs are drawing up
[02:00.900 --> 02:05.580]  plans for a single Treasury to oversee tax and spending across 17 Eurozone
[02:05.580 --> 02:10.460]  nations and that is in the London Telegraph today the proposal brought
[02:10.460 --> 02:14.780]  forward by Herman von Roompi the EU Council President would be the clearest
[02:14.780 --> 02:18.420]  sign yet of a United States of Europe quote-unquote with Britain on the
[02:18.420 --> 02:23.300]  sidelines the plan comes as European governments desperately try to save the
[02:23.300 --> 02:28.340]  Euro from collapse last night with a new bombshell with the IMF saying it
[02:28.340 --> 02:32.100]  would not pay for a second Greek bailout so you've got all this economic
[02:32.100 --> 02:36.180]  collapse and you have the solution ready to go for the Hegelian like problem
[02:36.180 --> 02:41.500]  reaction solution scenario that's been set up ready to go with a solution that
[02:41.500 --> 02:46.060]  empowers the European Union for greater world government for greater regional
[02:46.060 --> 02:52.460]  entity integration even as that whole Eurozone is threatened to collapse but
[02:52.460 --> 03:00.660]  I would imagine it would not we also have all kinds of articles on Syria
[03:00.660 --> 03:06.500]  McCain John McCain former vice-former presidential candidate has called for
[03:06.500 --> 03:11.780]  military options in Syria US senator John McCain raised the prospect Sunday of
[03:11.780 --> 03:16.580]  possible armed intervention to protect civilians in Syria were cracked down on
[03:16.580 --> 03:21.860]  pro-democracy protests has killed more than 3,000 people of course that is a
[03:21.860 --> 03:26.540]  hoax it's all been Western backed part of the Arab Spring revolutions it's
[03:26.540 --> 03:30.580]  obviously no coincidence that all these things are happening at the same time
[03:30.580 --> 03:35.860]  it's just a sneak attack and the Arab Spring excuse is just sort of meant to
[03:35.860 --> 03:40.740]  put us off guard to defuse us a little bit so they can get things done Madison
[03:40.740 --> 03:46.700]  Rupert writes about how Syria is it next for Libya style humanitarian
[03:46.700 --> 03:51.740]  intervention again on the humanitarian pretext we are looking for yet
[03:51.740 --> 03:57.820]  another front in the war even as things have not quite winded down in Libya with
[03:57.820 --> 04:00.980]  the destruction of Libya winding down the Western imperialist machine is
[04:00.980 --> 04:05.540]  looking for the next target for destabilization and exploitation and he
[04:05.540 --> 04:09.620]  goes on to talk about John McCain and all the others calling for military
[04:09.620 --> 04:14.460]  options and even though people like Obama and Hillary have back sanctions and
[04:14.460 --> 04:19.020]  obviously would support the war they're playing into the left-right paradigm not
[04:19.020 --> 04:23.820]  really admitting they want military action in Syria perhaps there's another
[04:23.820 --> 04:27.900]  phase before that as they continue to heat things up with Iran as tensions
[04:27.900 --> 04:33.620]  continue we also have Obama ending the war with Iraq as he begins war with
[04:33.620 --> 04:37.660]  Persia and Pakistan stay tuned there's so much more going on geopolitically
[04:37.660 --> 04:42.380]  everything going on in Europe I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in but Alex Jones is on

[06:06.740 --> 06:10.540]  truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to

[07:09.540 --> 07:13.420]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[07:13.420 --> 07:18.500]  turned in its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[07:18.500 --> 07:23.780]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[07:23.780 --> 07:28.300]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[07:28.300 --> 07:33.020]  off-shore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[07:33.020 --> 07:37.060]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[07:37.060 --> 07:40.740]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[07:40.740 --> 07:45.820]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[08:00.540 --> 08:08.860]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.860 --> 08:18.460]  music
[08:18.460 --> 08:26.340]  Ladies and gentlemen it is October 24th 2011 on this Monday edition I am in
[08:26.340 --> 08:34.220]  Las Vegas, Nevada I am your beautiful host here joining you now from Las Vegas
[08:34.220 --> 08:38.980]  Nevada Jesse Ventura the former Minnesota governor is now shooting the third
[08:38.980 --> 08:44.300]  season of his hit TV show that's woken a lot of people up and even been censored
[08:44.300 --> 08:49.500]  with threats by Congress over the FEMA camp special that I basically
[08:49.500 --> 08:54.020]  engineered and wrote most of and researched most of again I'm proud of
[08:54.020 --> 08:57.580]  the episode that I had my biggest stamp on is the one that caused the
[08:57.580 --> 09:02.940]  government to go into a complete and total hissy fit I am here with Jesse
[09:02.940 --> 09:09.580]  Ventura Tyrell Ventura his son is now in the third season actually phasing in to
[09:09.580 --> 09:14.820]  be the host of the show and of course another second generation individual
[09:14.820 --> 09:19.060]  we've got Sean Stone who I've really gotten to know well he's a really
[09:19.060 --> 09:22.940]  interesting person and accomplished director and actor in his own right
[09:22.940 --> 09:27.220]  obviously the son of Oliver Stone so people have asked I've seen one of
[09:27.220 --> 09:33.220]  the comments on him for wars and prison planet hey Alex what why aren't you in town because I'm
[09:33.220 --> 09:38.940]  here as I do once a year on the road shooting episodes of conspiracy theory
[09:38.940 --> 09:44.260]  with Jesse Ventura Jesse refuses we have a huge show today and Aaron Dyches is the
[09:44.260 --> 09:48.700]  main host he's waiting on the wings we have a raft of guests coming up but I
[09:48.700 --> 09:53.140]  just wanted to point out that I am here in Las Vegas and that ties into the big
[09:53.140 --> 10:00.460]  TSA criminal activity news I'll be breaking down here in just a moment but
[10:00.460 --> 10:05.380]  Ventura still hasn't gotten a word on his lawsuit whether or not it's going to
[10:05.380 --> 10:10.660]  be thrown out of court or not his lawyer he's had several big successful cases
[10:10.660 --> 10:15.340]  within the past as a top constitutional lawyer and knows the merits are
[10:15.340 --> 10:20.420]  absolutely strong and the case is sound and Jesse basically is saying he may
[10:20.420 --> 10:26.820]  just leave the country if the court doesn't at least hear his case so they
[10:26.820 --> 10:31.220]  just throw it outright without a jury of his peers Jesse's got some big
[10:31.220 --> 10:38.060]  announcements to make and perhaps I just gave a prelude to it here but the point
[10:38.060 --> 10:43.660]  is is that Jesse is driving around the United States in a bus slash I guess RV
[10:43.660 --> 10:50.060]  to avoid the TSA just as I am doing you know we're so busy with the nightly
[10:50.060 --> 10:54.700]  news TV show and we're so busy with the radio show I got the bus a few months
[10:54.700 --> 11:00.500]  ago 11-year-old used bus but it really is a whipper snapper we love it it's a
[11:00.500 --> 11:07.180]  great bus and I am soon going to put out a new website section on info wars dot
[11:07.180 --> 11:10.460]  com and we're going to put the announcements out to radio stations
[11:10.460 --> 11:14.740]  across the country who want to contact us or affiliates who want us to come to
[11:14.740 --> 11:19.980]  their city to broadcast from their city or their town and then also speak at in
[11:19.980 --> 11:24.100]  the event that evening and I'm already lining up some trips I was going to do
[11:24.100 --> 11:27.140]  on this fall but I think I'm going to nail down the TV show and some other
[11:27.140 --> 11:33.420]  some other things first and finish some other loose ends around the office in
[11:33.420 --> 11:39.500]  our expansion against the globalist and then next year starting in January at
[11:39.500 --> 11:44.900]  least once a month I will go on three or four day trips in the bus where I can
[11:44.900 --> 11:50.060]  lance out in one direction in the country and speak at two radio stations
[11:50.060 --> 11:55.940]  and two events and then come back and speak at another station and come back
[11:55.940 --> 11:59.740]  home we may also just go out every two months for a whole week on the road and
[11:59.740 --> 12:05.220]  hit five or six or seven local affiliates so very very exciting things on
[12:05.220 --> 12:10.820]  that front and I am again sometimes they get started really early in the morning
[12:10.820 --> 12:13.380]  sometimes they get started in the afternoon they work here about quote
[12:13.380 --> 12:17.020]  call time so we're going out in the desert and things to investigate stuff
[12:17.020 --> 12:21.460]  and do interviews and so I'm actually gonna probably have time here today to
[12:21.460 --> 12:26.380]  be popping in throughout the broadcast I couldn't do that yesterday or I would
[12:26.380 --> 12:32.380]  have done the Sunday radio show now all of that said ladies and gentlemen we
[12:32.380 --> 12:40.180]  have obviously huge news for you here today we've got Wayne Madsen of the Wayne
[12:40.180 --> 12:43.660]  Madsen report always extremely informative former NSA officer who's
[12:43.660 --> 12:48.420]  been in Libya just in the last year who predicted much of what's now happened
[12:48.420 --> 12:53.660]  he is going to be joining Aaron Dykes Aaron Dykes is the Grand Conductor here
[12:53.660 --> 12:58.180]  today running the overall transmission and then we have several other guests
[12:58.180 --> 13:04.500]  coming on as well like Patrick Henningson who is a writer for info wars.com
[13:04.500 --> 13:09.820]  joining us from London as well I believe that's going to be a video skype for
[13:09.820 --> 13:14.500]  prisonplanet.tv viewers also obviously better audio for radio listeners than
[13:14.500 --> 13:23.420]  phone now continuing here this is the basic top news that I have here for you
[13:23.420 --> 13:29.380]  and I know Aaron throughout the day is gonna be breaking this down more and
[13:29.380 --> 13:35.700]  that is the fact that it has now been officially announced it is all over the
[13:35.700 --> 13:44.020]  Sunday news shows that I watched in my hotel room yesterday it is a huge huge
[13:44.020 --> 13:53.220]  in-ear face globalist slap in the face that the new leaders publicly in these
[13:53.220 --> 13:59.940]  articles are up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it is admitted that the
[13:59.940 --> 14:07.620]  new government will be a Wahhabist basically Saudi Arabian run hardcore
[14:07.620 --> 14:17.860]  Islamist women you know will have to cover their faces family members can be
[14:17.860 --> 14:24.500]  killed for no reason they are putting in a super hardcore interpretation of
[14:24.500 --> 14:32.260]  Sharia law I guess this is a media equivalent of like a Puritan situation
[14:32.260 --> 14:37.140]  in 1680 or something in Boston where if you came out of your house on Sunday
[14:37.140 --> 14:41.180]  they'd lock you in the stocks for a week so they stick your head in your arms
[14:41.180 --> 14:44.620]  through the stocks and hold you in one position for a week while the worst
[14:44.620 --> 14:49.180]  forms of torture there is I mean I'm not even bashing Islam itself I'm not
[14:49.180 --> 14:53.020]  bashing Christianity I'm a Christian but there's always these extreme forms of
[14:53.020 --> 14:58.300]  things but that's not even the issue we're told that we're all over the
[14:58.300 --> 15:01.420]  Middle East all over North Africa trying to overthrow these governments to
[15:01.420 --> 15:06.260]  bring in democracy to bring in freedom and all this talk they don't ever
[15:06.260 --> 15:11.060]  discuss a republic where everybody's rights are protected no in Egypt they
[15:11.060 --> 15:15.660]  kick out the 31-year dictator Hossan Mubarak and it is admittedly about 10
[15:15.660 --> 15:20.420]  times worse now they shoot protesters on site they arrest the bloggers now they
[15:20.420 --> 15:25.380]  torture people for political speech that was previously tolerated in Egypt
[15:25.380 --> 15:30.860]  well now if you go to info wars.com or Prismana.com or Drudgereport.com or any
[15:30.860 --> 15:38.500]  of the big sites it's literally a cornucopia a veritable cornucopia of
[15:38.500 --> 15:42.860]  confirmation where they openly are saying that Islamists are being put into
[15:42.860 --> 15:49.540]  power meanwhile no discussion it's now gone off the radar pun intended of
[15:49.540 --> 15:58.140]  where the 10 to 15,000 different types of missiles have gone missing different
[15:58.140 --> 16:02.340]  numbers are two three four five thousand we're still not sure they admit it's
[16:02.340 --> 16:08.100]  over two thousand and some estimates are as high as five of high-tech different
[16:08.100 --> 16:13.540]  variants of French British you name it shoulder launch oh I'm sorry rushing as
[16:13.540 --> 16:19.060]  well shoulder launch surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles and well you're
[16:19.060 --> 16:24.780]  taking off say from Los Angeles or Dallas Texas or somewhere and somebody's
[16:24.780 --> 16:29.260]  got one of these they just set out you know a mile from the airport we were
[16:29.260 --> 16:34.780]  planes at about three thousand feet and zap it goes right into the engine heat
[16:34.780 --> 16:41.340]  seeking missile and that'll end your in your holiday real real quick but see a
[16:41.340 --> 16:44.980]  real threat it's not a big deal with the global effect they hope this happens
[16:44.980 --> 16:50.860]  just take more of our rights and as we reported last week now in Tennessee
[16:50.860 --> 16:56.740]  Michigan all over the country the TSA is setting up checkpoints openly searching
[16:56.740 --> 17:02.020]  families vehicles trucks shutting down highways and that leads me to my next
[17:02.020 --> 17:06.540]  piece of news here today again if you're just now tuning in this is Alex Jones
[17:06.540 --> 17:11.220]  here with Aaron Dykes I am on the road with the governor Jesse Ventura shooting
[17:11.220 --> 17:14.140]  more episodes I think I'm in four or five of them I've already shot a couple
[17:14.140 --> 17:18.860]  yesterday we're shooting a couple more today my my contributions to it I'm here
[17:18.860 --> 17:24.140]  in Las Vegas and I've shot a lot of video here while I'm here of the grave in
[17:24.140 --> 17:29.300]  the desert other than against the great people of Las Vegas it's very beautiful
[17:29.300 --> 17:32.820]  here I love the high desert and you know I'm sure some of the shows and things
[17:32.820 --> 17:36.540]  are interesting but there's no doubt that this culture is becoming the
[17:36.540 --> 17:44.340]  American culture kind of this cruise ship Las Vegas Gulag economy the casino
[17:44.340 --> 17:48.460]  Gulag economy that Max Kaiser has coined that that's really what it is and the
[17:48.460 --> 17:51.700]  restaurants most of them are kiosks even though it's a big restaurant you've got
[17:51.700 --> 17:56.140]  to pay up front even with cash it wants your data or won't let you in you can

[18:45.500 --> 18:49.620]  fighting the clothes u.s. trips really globalist trips our military is good
[18:49.620 --> 18:53.540]  people but our military is run by the new world order and so basically it's just
[18:53.540 --> 18:57.660]  two different armies that are fighting each other run by the same people and
[18:57.660 --> 19:01.580]  people say well why would the globalist fight themselves that's how they have
[19:01.580 --> 19:08.180]  the excuse to be in Iraq you have to have any enemy to have an occupation this
[19:08.180 --> 19:12.820]  is full spectrum dominance and then you can bring about the system you want out
[19:12.820 --> 19:18.020]  of that dialectic clash out of that controlled collision it's like you

[24:27.140 --> 24:33.260]  on Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we are here live I'm joining you
[24:33.260 --> 24:37.900]  from the road in Las Vegas I'm here working in Sin City with Jesse Ventura
[24:37.900 --> 24:41.820]  because a lot of the people he needed to interview were in this area of the
[24:41.820 --> 24:45.300]  Southwest so folks have been driving in and flying in from all over the country
[24:45.300 --> 24:50.020]  while he shoots several of the episodes or part of the episodes he's been
[24:50.020 --> 24:54.340]  traveling all over the United States they told me some information last night
[24:54.340 --> 25:01.460]  that I that that I was told off the record concerning what the show went
[25:01.460 --> 25:08.860]  through last year that I didn't even know and and and I just can't believe I'm
[25:08.860 --> 25:12.180]  told this stuff in confidence and now I've got a shut up about it in fact I
[25:12.180 --> 25:16.820]  shouldn't even be saying I was told something in confidence but it's dangerous
[25:16.820 --> 25:21.820]  ladies and gentlemen doing this that's all I can tell you and they have been
[25:21.820 --> 25:27.340]  getting people tailing them and you're coming up and doing things but that's
[25:27.340 --> 25:33.540]  nothing compared to what has happened last season let me just say this this
[25:33.540 --> 25:37.500]  situation is life and death I'm just gonna leave it that believe me the New
[25:37.500 --> 25:41.860]  World Order does not like what happened last season that's why Homeland
[25:41.860 --> 25:46.580]  Security and Congress put pressure to have that FEMA camp specialed by the
[25:46.580 --> 25:50.660]  threat fusion centers and the TSA takeover and the total police state
[25:50.660 --> 25:56.460]  grid that's why they had it taken down now Wayne Madsen's coming up with Aaron
[25:56.460 --> 26:03.460]  Dyches and then I'm gonna be back for the entire next hour because that's how
[26:03.460 --> 26:05.900]  this works sometimes they shoot in the morning and they don't need me till the
[26:05.900 --> 26:11.940]  evening so I'm gonna be and I was flying out tonight now they want me to stay
[26:11.940 --> 26:17.580]  another day so I haven't figured that out yet folks but don't flog me I'm
[26:17.580 --> 26:22.780]  getting good at the computers and skyping things because I'm not very
[26:22.780 --> 26:28.540]  technical and I just I didn't bring a Skype computer and the microphone
[26:28.540 --> 26:32.020]  and stuff I should have or I would just be doing the whole show today and then
[26:32.020 --> 26:35.940]  Aaron can be getting ready for the nightly news and doing all the news
[26:35.940 --> 26:40.620]  site stuff that he does so well but I am here via phone joining you but in the
[26:40.620 --> 26:47.500]  future while I'm on the road I will be skyping in now continuing with the news
[26:47.500 --> 26:52.980]  if you go to drugreport.com right now they've got Paul Watson's article up
[26:52.980 --> 26:59.020]  and this isn't the first time this has happened where a woman's sexual aid
[26:59.020 --> 27:05.140]  device was in her bag and they opened it up and put a note in it saying get your
[27:05.140 --> 27:11.420]  freak on girl that makes me think of a Doug Stanhope piece he does where he
[27:11.420 --> 27:18.300]  says he's sick of the TSA and what he's gonna put in his bag I'm not even gonna say it on Aaron
[27:18.300 --> 27:25.420]  he's very crude the point is that that this is the humiliation that people go
[27:25.420 --> 27:30.860]  through and when I was flying out of Austin a couple things happen
[27:30.860 --> 27:35.100]  generally the TSA is really nice in Austin and ask for my autograph and
[27:35.100 --> 27:39.740]  things and again most of them aren't evil they just want a job but the fact is
[27:39.740 --> 27:47.020]  that they will do things like this shows that their elevator doesn't go all the
[27:47.020 --> 27:51.620]  way to the top you'll violate the fourth amendment live in and around x-ray
[27:51.620 --> 27:56.340]  machines without shielding all day and so I'm going through the the checkout in
[27:56.340 --> 28:06.340]  Austin or the check in the checkpoint and there you know is the first TSA guy
[28:06.340 --> 28:10.140]  and he says hey Alex Jones how you doing I shake his hand and then the older
[28:10.140 --> 28:17.140]  gray hair ball a balding gentleman says this one's a troublemaker and it was
[28:17.140 --> 28:21.100]  out of central casting like out of a movie or something so I thought the guy
[28:21.100 --> 28:25.660]  was joking and I went oh yeah I'm a troublemaker and he goes where are you
[28:25.660 --> 28:33.740]  going I started realizing he was trying to intimidate me but I'm a Texan and I
[28:33.740 --> 28:39.660]  tend to answer people's questions I like to talk I'm like a you know crazy parrot
[28:39.660 --> 28:44.980]  or something as everyone knows and I said I'm going to Vegas you know Vegas
[28:44.980 --> 28:49.620]  you're going to Vegas and I went yeah to shoot Jesse Ventura's TV show he's
[28:49.620 --> 28:54.580]  like oh yeah right then I went okay well I guess because I'm a liar you know
[28:54.580 --> 28:59.700]  an evil citizen and so that goes on and he goes no what are you really going to
[28:59.700 --> 29:03.780]  Vegas for and I said I just told you I'm going to shoot Jesse Ventura's TV show
[29:03.780 --> 29:08.380]  you know the guy suing the TSA for grabbing his genitals the guy who won't
[29:08.380 --> 29:12.420]  fly now and may leave the country because of you people you know the Navy
[29:12.420 --> 29:19.740]  veteran the governor you know that one and he was like I can go and then I'm
[29:19.740 --> 29:24.460]  going to and I'm kind of late because I was at the office shooting this special
[29:24.460 --> 29:30.020]  report on GMOs Aaron's getting ready for the next few days I'm gonna come back and finish up
[29:30.020 --> 29:33.700]  we'll get Wayne Madsen on but I'm gonna finish what happened and then I'm
[29:33.700 --> 29:37.780]  sitting there putting my belt back on and things being trained as a prisoner
[29:37.780 --> 29:41.340]  and then I watch him go after this guy for silver coins wait till we come back
[29:41.340 --> 29:44.020]  I'll tell you about this

[32:03.540 --> 32:07.460]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[32:07.460 --> 32:11.700]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[32:11.700 --> 32:15.980]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[32:15.980 --> 32:20.340]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.340 --> 32:24.420]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.420 --> 32:28.980]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:28.980 --> 32:33.100]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[32:33.100 --> 32:37.060]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[32:37.060 --> 32:40.900]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[32:40.900 --> 32:43.620]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[32:43.620 --> 32:49.620]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[33:10.100 --> 33:14.820]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here joining you from the road I'm about to
[33:14.820 --> 33:17.860]  hand the baton to Aaron and Dyches for the rest of the hour that I'll be riding
[33:17.860 --> 33:23.300]  shotgun with you again for the entire next hour via the telephone with Aaron
[33:23.300 --> 33:28.020]  Dyches there in studio and we have a Patrick Hinnickson also joining us on
[33:28.020 --> 33:36.820]  geopolitical and economic developments now when I get on next hour I have over
[33:36.820 --> 33:41.460]  the weekend literally read hundreds of articles because as I began to research
[33:41.460 --> 33:47.900]  this I realized how close we are to the global financial implosion and the role
[33:47.900 --> 33:53.260]  out of the cashless society and I want to break down for people what this cashless
[33:53.260 --> 33:58.540]  society means but I have confirmed and I've seen tons of reports where people
[33:58.540 --> 34:03.420]  are not being allowed to get their money out of major banks even five six
[34:03.420 --> 34:09.820]  thousand dollars almost everyone's being refused if they want ten thousand it
[34:09.820 --> 34:12.140]  doesn't matter if you have a million dollars in the bank or ten thousand they
[34:12.140 --> 34:16.180]  won't give it to you they're trying to give it to you as as as checks and
[34:16.180 --> 34:21.780]  things as if you can do something with that to only deposit it in another bank
[34:21.780 --> 34:26.140]  and under this cashless society they can't just track everything they can
[34:26.140 --> 34:31.140]  also manipulate the economy by having all this data and they can also put
[34:31.140 --> 34:36.060]  fines and fees on every action you engage in and every financial transaction
[34:36.060 --> 34:42.580]  I've warned you forever that's all coming and for the first time in my 16 almost
[34:42.580 --> 34:47.780]  17 years on air maybe Wayne Madsen can speak to this I know he's an expert on
[34:47.780 --> 34:53.260]  all the whole wireless banking system it looks like they may go ahead and try to
[34:53.260 --> 34:57.500]  engineer some type of run-on banks and then phase in the new cashless society
[34:57.500 --> 35:00.900]  because they got billboards up demonizing cash they're passing laws you
[35:00.900 --> 35:05.540]  can't use cash secondhand sales places like Louisiana and they've got to get
[35:05.540 --> 35:11.020]  other legislatures around the country this is big now after I cover that next
[35:11.020 --> 35:15.020]  hour and get Aaron's take on it we'll get more into the TSA and these domestic
[35:15.020 --> 35:21.300]  checkpoints which are putting in capital controls and all over the country now you
[35:21.300 --> 35:25.380]  pull up to checkpoints the TSA is there with local police being trained under
[35:25.380 --> 35:32.100]  them who become an auxiliary federal police total federal power grab and they
[35:32.100 --> 35:39.460]  tell the families or truck drivers it doesn't matter whoever's on the road do
[35:39.460 --> 35:44.100]  you have drugs do you have guns do you have cash do you have gold do you have
[35:44.100 --> 35:49.980]  silver so this is called capital controls or currency controls and this is
[35:49.980 --> 35:55.020]  what goes on in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela this is what goes on in the old Soviet
[35:55.020 --> 35:58.500]  Russia and I know Wayne who fought the Soviets in the Cold War he can break
[35:58.500 --> 36:02.500]  down what capital controls mean for you so perhaps Aaron after he gets into
[36:02.500 --> 36:06.300]  Libya and what's happening over there we'll we'll bring that up to him now
[36:06.300 --> 36:09.860]  just finishing my story I'll get more into it the next hour as well because it
[36:09.860 --> 36:15.300]  all ties into these capital controls the TSA interrogates me so so they've now
[36:15.300 --> 36:20.300]  begun they've now begun not just in Boston but all over the country they've
[36:20.300 --> 36:24.660]  now begun the Israeli style interrogations but that's not even really
[36:24.660 --> 36:28.500]  what it is it's just they're getting in your business they're gonna force their
[36:28.500 --> 36:32.140]  way into your life they're gonna treat you like you're a criminal and my answer
[36:32.140 --> 36:36.580]  is have you read the Constitution today my answer is are you worried about the
[36:36.580 --> 36:41.220]  body scanners frying you and giving you cancer you know if you're treating me
[36:41.220 --> 36:44.820]  like I'm guilty how do I know you're not a criminal you TSA people been caught
[36:44.820 --> 36:50.260]  statistically creating crimes at many times the rate of police officers look
[36:50.260 --> 36:54.380]  up the Justice Department numbers on this the group with the most criminal
[36:54.380 --> 36:58.180]  strikes against them of any law enforcement type group and by the way
[36:58.180 --> 37:02.900]  TSA isn't law enforcement is the TSA they've got beyond law enforcement
[37:02.900 --> 37:07.500]  powers beyond the Constitution but they're running around playing God so I
[37:07.500 --> 37:12.140]  go through the line I'm putting my shoes back on I sit down and I'm looking
[37:12.140 --> 37:16.540]  back down through the line and because I'm wanting to see if they're doing
[37:16.540 --> 37:20.620]  behavioral questioning where these guys literally have power trips when they ask
[37:20.620 --> 37:24.260]  you questions like they took some you know 20-hour course and now they think
[37:24.260 --> 37:29.020]  they're mind readers you know what I've been working with people and researching
[37:29.020 --> 37:33.300]  for decades and I can't even do that yet when I'm talking to somebody I've got a
[37:33.300 --> 37:39.740]  good sense but it isn't near 100% well these idiots now automatically think
[37:39.740 --> 37:44.380]  you're guilty automatically think you're bad so I want to know was that guy just
[37:44.380 --> 37:48.540]  asking me questions or trying to intimidate me or are they doing
[37:48.540 --> 37:52.780]  behavioral stuff at Austin and I can announce to everyone they're doing it
[37:52.780 --> 37:57.900]  at Austin so then I I leave that checkpoint and I walk on down towards
[37:57.900 --> 38:02.580]  my gate because the Southwest check-in was right there you know further down
[38:02.580 --> 38:08.100]  and I walk back past two checkpoints to the final one and I watch another guy
[38:08.100 --> 38:12.900]  nicely arguing with them and I see him holding something up in his hand like a
[38:12.900 --> 38:17.100]  silver coin and I think oh my god are they harassing him for some silver
[38:17.100 --> 38:21.820]  coins well then fate would have it this guy comes and sits down right next to me
[38:21.820 --> 38:26.420]  on the Southwest flight he barely makes it as they're closing the door he runs
[38:26.420 --> 38:30.940]  in sweating panning I was almost late so about 15 minutes after I get on the
[38:30.940 --> 38:35.220]  plane they're about to close the door here comes this guy and I'm gonna throw
[38:35.220 --> 38:38.380]  it to Wayne match and he'll be with us till eight after so for the next 25
[38:38.380 --> 38:42.620]  minutes or so it's just I'll tell you the rest of the story of what happened
[38:42.620 --> 38:47.620]  to this guy for eight eight seven silver coins one ounce coins and one
[38:47.620 --> 38:55.060]  10th ounce gold coin less than $600 worth total he estimated and this is
[38:55.060 --> 38:58.380]  definitely bought when silver was I think he said $10 an ounce so he wanted
[38:58.380 --> 39:02.300]  to cash it in while he was here on business and then you go to a little
[39:02.300 --> 39:06.260]  bit I think he said blackjack or no it was poker so he was just gonna cash in
[39:06.260 --> 39:10.020]  some silver he had because it was fun he was doing a well-to-do software
[39:10.020 --> 39:15.580]  engineer he owns a company in Austin that I'll tell the story next hour I'm
[39:15.580 --> 39:19.180]  gonna get to Wayne who I appreciate joining us he actually has a company
[39:19.180 --> 39:22.660]  where he restores old guitars he put worker for Heeler Packard and he makes
[39:22.660 --> 39:28.140]  the the old tubes for amplifiers and stuff he has a company that does that
[39:28.140 --> 39:31.420]  start to grow here's this really nice guys I talked to him for two and a half
[39:31.420 --> 39:34.860]  hours and on the flight out here and then after we got off I interviewed him
[39:34.860 --> 39:38.660]  about it but I witnessed them going through his stuff for those coins now
[39:38.660 --> 39:43.180]  I'm gonna throw it back to Aaron Dykes so he can go to Wayne match them but I do
[39:43.180 --> 39:46.900]  want to bring up after Madsen gets into Libya and the fact that they're putting
[39:46.900 --> 39:51.300]  the known Wahhabian jihadis in who said they're putting Sharia Law in I do want
[39:51.300 --> 39:55.260]  to ask Wayne because after I hang up I'm gonna get on my iPhone app and listen to
[39:55.260 --> 40:01.220]  the free iPhone app I want to ask Wayne why are they putting Islamists in in
[40:01.220 --> 40:06.020]  Egypt and and living in other countries clearly now they're wanting to do this
[40:06.020 --> 40:09.860]  what is the larger geopolitical goal well I'm gonna hand it over to Aaron and
[40:09.860 --> 40:13.860]  Wayne Madsen the Wayne Madsen report com and I'll see you back for the full
[40:13.860 --> 40:19.020]  next hour or we'll wait after God bless you all here's Aaron Dykes and Wayne
[40:19.020 --> 40:23.580]  Madsen thanks Alex and again Alex we'll be back really not that long from now
[40:23.580 --> 40:27.900]  but right now we go to investigative journalist really a muckraker Wayne
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.820]  Madsen thanks for joining us Wayne hi good to be with you yeah it's great to
[40:32.820 --> 40:37.740]  have you so first off we have the news we have the confession of the rebel who
[40:37.740 --> 40:43.260]  says he killed Gaddafi we have Hillary Clinton saying it was the work of
[40:43.260 --> 40:47.740]  ordinary Libyans who ousted Gaddafi and now we have the implementation of Sharia
[40:47.740 --> 40:52.220]  Law Wayne what's going on in Libya well I think what we're seeing is the
[40:52.220 --> 40:58.700]  extension of a strategy of tensions what what the net result of this change of
[40:58.700 --> 41:03.780]  government which would let's call it for what it is it's a coup d'etat will be
[41:03.780 --> 41:11.420]  civil war Liby is a nation of tribes I have now found out and I'm writing this
[41:11.420 --> 41:18.700]  story right now but I'll give you a heads up on it on October 19th at 8 o'clock
[41:18.700 --> 41:27.860]  between 60 and 70 cars left cert there were reports of white flags all around
[41:27.860 --> 41:34.740]  cert also white flags on these vehicles 8 o'clock the sun's up the white flag is
[41:34.740 --> 41:40.500]  internationally recognized as a flag of truce or a flag of surrender or a flag
[41:40.500 --> 41:45.940]  to negotiate surrender terms you're not supposed to fire any weapons if you're
[41:45.940 --> 41:52.620]  behind a white flag and the convoy did not this was the convoy carrying Gaddafi
[41:52.620 --> 41:59.460]  when it was two miles west of cert after a predator CIA drone had spotted the
[41:59.460 --> 42:05.860]  convoy some French planes came in and started firing at the convoy other
[42:05.860 --> 42:11.100]  NATO planes came in and successive waves many of the people were incinerated
[42:11.100 --> 42:17.540]  drivers passengers others were cut in half by machine gun fire there are now
[42:17.540 --> 42:23.540]  reports of many many members of the Kaddafi tribe that is the Kaddafi
[42:23.540 --> 42:29.980]  tribe that lives in cert scores of people being found in mass graves the
[42:29.980 --> 42:38.380]  Kaddafi tribal elder who was negotiating a possible surrender last month back in
[42:38.380 --> 42:45.340]  September his home was entered by rebels and he was shot to death so here we
[42:45.340 --> 42:51.980]  have a possible war crime committed by NATO and just to give you an idea how
[42:51.980 --> 42:56.660]  long the white flag of surrender and truce has been recognized although it's
[42:56.660 --> 43:03.380]  recognized in the hate convention conventions of 1899 and 1907 the use of
[43:03.380 --> 43:09.300]  the white flag goes back to the eastern Han Chinese dynasty of 25 AD it was
[43:09.300 --> 43:17.980]  recognized by the Roman Empire and every major and minor army since since
[43:17.980 --> 43:26.540]  probably October 19th when the barbaric forces of NATO may have violated
[43:26.540 --> 43:35.420]  the white flag of truce the white flag of surrender by Kaddafi's convoy and set
[43:35.420 --> 43:42.780]  upon that convoy and of course we know that Kaddafi was shot in the head by
[43:42.780 --> 43:47.900]  one of the rebels and that in itself would be a violation of international
[43:47.900 --> 43:53.180]  law but when we hear Washington and London and Brussels NATO headquarters
[43:53.180 --> 43:56.620]  Brian and the rebel leadership saying well we'll investigate we'll
[43:56.620 --> 44:04.740]  investigate the big story is here not so much the the extra judicial execute
[44:04.740 --> 44:10.100]  execution of Mohamed Kaddafi but the fact that NATO for the first time since
[44:10.100 --> 44:18.260]  25 AD violated in a major way the white flag of truce the white flag of
[44:18.260 --> 44:22.100]  surrender and what do we know about Hillary's role her trip overlapped in
[44:22.100 --> 44:26.100]  Libya with his death and she kind of joked about it on air and said we came
[44:26.100 --> 44:30.340]  we saw he died and then said no we didn't have a role well we probably did
[44:30.340 --> 44:35.860]  have a role in it well I think this just shows that Hillary like Barack Obama
[44:35.860 --> 44:41.460]  they base that and you know the last administration George W. Bush Dick Cheney
[44:41.460 --> 44:47.860]  Rumsfeld these individuals seem to revel in the macabre and you know maybe
[44:47.860 --> 44:52.980]  it's at the timing a few weeks before Halloween is good because what we have
[44:52.980 --> 44:59.540]  is a ghoulish a bunch of leaders who it's sort of sort of like some sort of
[44:59.540 --> 45:04.180]  pornography now there's a video circulating showing that Gaddafi was
[45:04.180 --> 45:11.660]  being sodomized by a rifle barrel before he was killed and now this brings up
[45:11.660 --> 45:17.020]  the all that remember Abu Ghraib the sodomizing of the detainees there the
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.380]  the executions of the detainees at Abu Ghraib and all the other heinous war
[45:22.380 --> 45:27.100]  crimes committed by the United States and its allies and here we have what
[45:27.100 --> 45:32.380]  seems to be a continuation of this policy I have to wonder what kind of
[45:32.380 --> 45:38.860]  people are in our CIA and military that would countenance this type of say no
[45:38.860 --> 45:48.860]  masochistic bizarre pornographic death which you know I mean we know that
[45:48.860 --> 45:54.300]  bin Laden was codenamed Geronimo and you know that brings up the whole story
[45:54.300 --> 45:59.580]  about Geronimo's skull being stolen from Fort Silva by Prescott Bush the
[45:59.580 --> 46:06.620]  grandfather George W. Bush and spirited away to the skull and bones compound in
[46:06.620 --> 46:13.060]  the in the Yale at Yale University it just goes to show I think that we are a
[46:13.060 --> 46:18.860]  pretty depraved country and have pretty depraved leaders and pretty depraved
[46:18.860 --> 46:23.780]  people in the military that goes along with this type of thing but to ignore
[46:23.780 --> 46:29.100]  the white flag of surrender the white flag of truth I think is a a major major
[46:29.100 --> 46:34.460]  war crime and one that NATO will try to cover up with all of its resources
[46:34.460 --> 46:40.460]  because everyone recognizes that that is way beyond the pale when it comes to a
[46:40.460 --> 46:45.460]  war crime to recognize the white flag of truth but then we have even before they
[46:45.460 --> 46:49.540]  can launch the supposed burial at sea we're told about we have the talking
[46:49.540 --> 46:54.340]  point coming out that Syria is next the CNN headlines Syria Yemen opposition
[46:54.340 --> 46:58.660]  warned dictators you're next McCain's talking about military options in Syria
[46:58.660 --> 47:03.740]  you have people like senator well that other senator who says that Assad's
[47:03.740 --> 47:08.620]  basically next what's going on with that Wayne Manson well we had McCain not
[47:08.620 --> 47:13.500]  only talking about if he were Assad he'd be it'd be you know if he were Assad he'd
[47:13.500 --> 47:18.820]  be nervous he also added Vladimir Putin who will be the next president Russia and
[47:18.820 --> 47:24.140]  the leadership of China I mean what I mean it be you know it's clear that John
[47:24.140 --> 47:29.020]  McCain is insane they don't call him insane McCain here in this city for
[47:29.020 --> 47:33.980]  nothing but it's it's quite clear that you know this this guy has has no business
[47:33.980 --> 47:38.580]  opening his mouth because he's a basically a mental patient and he's
[47:38.580 --> 47:45.460]  talking about you know if this and I do believe that the CIA now was involved in
[47:45.460 --> 47:51.620]  allowing Qaddafi to be executed but is he suggesting that it's open season on
[47:51.620 --> 47:59.220]  Assad and then Putin and whoever is going to be the the future leadership of
[47:59.220 --> 48:07.820]  China the Hu Jintao and his successors this is this is irrational dangerous
[48:07.820 --> 48:13.100]  talk and it should not be allowed and I you know we didn't hear anything from
[48:13.100 --> 48:17.460]  Hillary Clinton or the White House condemning McCain's remarks and I have
[48:17.460 --> 48:21.980]  to assume that they pretty much agree with McCain or at least allow him to go
[48:21.980 --> 48:27.420]  out there and make these irresponsible statements because the United States has
[48:27.420 --> 48:32.940]  designs you know today it's Tripoli what are they saying tomorrow will be US tanks
[48:32.940 --> 48:39.900]  and troops and Damascus and Moscow and then in Beijing I don't think so LA
[48:39.900 --> 48:43.980]  Washington in New York will be a heaping pile radioactive rubble before
[48:43.980 --> 48:47.780]  that happens yeah but it's queued up without even missing a beat as if it's
[48:47.780 --> 48:51.180]  a symphony orchestrated completely I mean what's really going on with this
[48:51.180 --> 48:57.780]  Arab Spring well the Arab Spring I think I maintain that the Arab Spring started
[48:57.780 --> 49:03.420]  for economic reasons I mean you know remember Tip O'Neill said all politics
[49:03.420 --> 49:08.620]  is local when you you see the price of bread and other staples go sky-high what
[49:08.620 --> 49:12.780]  happened in Cairo and Tunis was really very similar what was happening in
[49:12.780 --> 49:18.940]  Athens in Madrid in Rome because Tunisia and Egypt were dictatorships they
[49:18.940 --> 49:24.220]  didn't have that you know safety valve to let off the steam as they did in
[49:24.220 --> 49:28.340]  Greece and Italy although the police let's face it I'm pretty brutal in both
[49:28.340 --> 49:33.060]  Italy and Greece but in Egypt and Tunisia they didn't have so what turned out to be
[49:33.060 --> 49:39.060]  a popular uprising of course Soros tried it and his gang of NGOs try to glom
[49:39.060 --> 49:43.940]  onto it by using the Twitters and the Facebooks to try to engineer one of
[49:43.940 --> 49:48.420]  these themed revolutions but what what happened there was that it was the
[49:48.420 --> 49:52.980]  entire population arose up people who didn't know what Facebook was and never
[49:52.980 --> 49:56.500]  used Twitter they may have had cell phones but they certainly weren't these
[49:56.500 --> 50:01.180]  you know Twitter people but they hit the streets and and forced the
[50:01.180 --> 50:05.340]  government's out and so the thing that things got out of control so now in each
[50:05.340 --> 50:10.500]  if you have the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Tunisia there's an
[50:10.500 --> 50:15.060]  Islamist party that's done quite well apparently in the elections held yesterday
[50:15.060 --> 50:24.900]  but but even that party aligns itself more to the Turkish Islamist party which
[50:24.900 --> 50:30.100]  is not radical by any stretch it's actually very pro-business and pro-
[50:30.100 --> 50:37.620]  democracy but be that as it may I think the fact is that the Arab Spring it was
[50:37.620 --> 50:42.580]  not in did not have the intention of some of the globalist thought it would
[50:42.580 --> 50:47.380]  have okay Wayne Matz and we will be back on the other side of this break with

[54:06.140 --> 54:11.420]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[54:21.780 --> 54:26.180]  we are back with investigative journalist Wayne Mattson talking about
[54:26.180 --> 54:29.900]  what's going on in the Middle East what's going on financially Alex will be
[54:29.900 --> 54:34.700]  back on the other side of this break but Wayne right now I want to get into some
[54:34.700 --> 54:38.740]  of the stuff that's happening in Europe the London Telegraph headline New
[54:38.740 --> 54:43.820]  Euro Empire Plot by Brussels for a single Treasury you also have the Vatican
[54:43.820 --> 54:47.740]  coming out today calling for a World Central Bank what do you see on that
[54:47.740 --> 54:52.500]  front sir well anytime I hear anything coming out of the Vatican I think of the
[54:52.500 --> 54:58.900]  immortal words of Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference where it's FDR Churchill
[54:58.900 --> 55:04.260]  and Stalin's sitting around and they're dividing up Europe after for after the
[55:04.260 --> 55:09.220]  war and the Churchill pipes up and says something well what about the Pope and
[55:09.220 --> 55:14.380]  Stalin says how many divisions does he have you know I mean you know who cares
[55:14.380 --> 55:18.460]  with the Vatican things I mean they've got 50 Swiss guards and that's their
[55:18.460 --> 55:27.140]  military force and they're enmeshed in scandals with the pedophilia in almost
[55:27.140 --> 55:32.500]  every country they they have a presence so I wouldn't put any any stock in
[55:32.500 --> 55:37.620]  anything the Vatican says I mean it's they use it at that language Latin and
[55:37.620 --> 55:43.980]  pretty much I think their their their influence is much overstated but as far
[55:43.980 --> 55:48.580]  as the euro is concerned we now have this food fight that broke out apparently
[55:48.580 --> 55:53.140]  between Nicholas Sarkozy the French president and David Cameron the British
[55:53.140 --> 55:57.900]  Prime Minister now Britain's not a member of the eurozone it doesn't use the
[55:57.900 --> 56:03.700]  euro but Sarkozy apparently told Cameron you know mind your own business
[56:03.700 --> 56:08.660]  you're not in the eurozone I think what we're seeing down seeing happening here
[56:08.660 --> 56:13.740]  is it's it's the collapse of the euro though they'll try every which way to
[56:13.740 --> 56:18.940]  try to preserve this but we already know that the the Germans are printing up the
[56:18.940 --> 56:22.900]  Deutschmark and and have every intention of bringing back the
[56:22.900 --> 56:28.260]  Deutschmark and once that happens you'll have a two-tier system of the
[56:28.260 --> 56:34.020]  countries in Europe will either pay their currencies to the D mark the new D mark
[56:34.020 --> 56:41.660]  or they will be using this very much deflated euro which this will be the
[56:41.660 --> 56:47.460]  situation of course in countries like Italy and Spain and and Greece even in
[56:47.460 --> 56:53.020]  Greece we see it a move to bring back the drachma the problem with Greece is
[56:53.020 --> 56:57.540]  it's broke so what would the drachma be worth if it was brought back it would be
[56:57.540 --> 57:02.740]  a totally deflated currency in it it would be the situation you had in Weimar
[57:02.740 --> 57:07.020]  Germany before World War two you'd probably take millions and millions of
[57:07.020 --> 57:15.020]  drachma to buy you know one one loaf of bread so I what I see happening in
[57:15.020 --> 57:18.860]  Europe is what's eventually going to happen in the United States only you've
[57:18.860 --> 57:24.140]  got the problem with these rising nationalism amongst the EU members so
[57:24.140 --> 57:29.140]  you get into the the food fight between Sarkozy and Cameron let's face it the
[57:29.140 --> 57:34.940]  French and the British have never liked one another and the EU or anything else
[57:34.940 --> 57:39.900]  isn't going to change that fact yeah but at the same time you have von Rumpoy
[57:39.900 --> 57:44.980]  trying to seize greater power on the back of this wider economic crisis when
[57:44.980 --> 57:49.260]  all right right now here's another interesting case von Rumpoy
[57:49.260 --> 57:55.940]  Belgium Belgium itself itself is a collapsing country Belgium hasn't had a
[57:55.940 --> 58:01.820]  workable government in well over a year almost two years I think and and so what
[58:01.820 --> 58:07.260]  what is that what is Belgium it's Brussels where you've got NATO and the
[58:07.260 --> 58:13.980]  EU headquartered the rest of Belgium is split between Flanders which is but
[58:13.980 --> 58:18.460]  which wants to become independent as a republic ditching the ties of the
[58:18.460 --> 58:23.660]  Belgian monarchy and Wallonia which intends to look up with France so
[58:23.660 --> 58:29.660]  Belgium itself the headquarters for the EU is a dying country it's going to
[58:29.660 --> 58:33.100]  split apart right and we'll be back on the other side in the second hour with
[58:33.100 --> 58:44.700]  more from Wayne Matson and Alex Jones will be back stay tuned info wars.com this is GCN the

[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:19.740]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:34.180]  Alex Jones we are back live here in the second hour in this jam-pack broadcast
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:39.500]  we have Alex Jones joining us again on the other side of this break and we are
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.060]  still with investigative journalist Wayne Mattson and we've been covering the
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.180]  spectrum here he's got breaking news on Libya information about the white flags
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:55.180]  that were flown in the convoy which he believes to be Gaddafi's convoy and but
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.340]  at the same time we see here domestically in the US TSA ramping up its
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.740]  checkpoints Tennessee among other places is now doing highway checkpoints Wayne
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.540]  and we've also had reports and eyewitness accounts of people being asked
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:12.980]  questions about carrying gold and silver coins to the airport and so forth and so
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:20.460]  on where where's that front going Wayne well I think where this is the slippery
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.860]  slope is no longer a slope it's a it's a cascade and I've been going back and
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.900]  looking at what what was playing back in the 70s and late 60s with Operation
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:39.940]  Garden plot and lantern spike the military had similar plans to impose
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:45.460]  martial law because of the anti mostly because of the anti-vietnam war
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:50.340]  protests now we see these Occupy Wall Street protests expanding across the
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:56.980]  country and we have an increase in this TSA activity but going back and looking
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.340]  at what was going on in the late 60s early 70s we saw the same thing where
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:06.340]  the the the president was given the authority to call up the National Guard
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.060]  and federal troops to basically put down an insurrection an insurrection that
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:17.980]  was be deemed an insurrection by the president alone and I think what we may
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:24.980]  be seeing here is is that the powers are now afraid and we're seeing this increase
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:31.300]  TSA activity because it's one thing to control travel at the airports and
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.580]  train stations and the bus stations and even rental car facilities but but what
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.860]  how do you deal with the highways well you deal with the highways by putting up
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.260]  checkpoints as apparently they're doing in Tennessee at various truck way
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:54.820]  stations but I see possibly this expanding to toll toll booths on toll
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:03:01.140]  roads and highways bridges and and and as we've already seen with them with way
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.860]  stations but there's definitely a sense they're getting ready for unrest whether
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:09.780]  economic or otherwise I mean things are really coming to a boil with Europe
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.900]  putting everything going on domestically here in check who knows what will
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:18.420]  become of Occupy Wall Street but but you could see the energy there Wayne well
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.580]  absolutely the last thing and the last thing they want to see is like large
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:28.060]  crowds converge on either New York or Washington I have to say that the the
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:34.540]  the demonstrations here in Washington have been kind of a you know a fizzle but
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.420]  not so in New York and not so in some other cities so what what better way to
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:44.900]  prevent the influx of large groups of people than to put TSA security
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.260]  checkpoints that's on you know for example the New Jersey Pennsylvania
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.660]  turnpikes you know the various toll roads in upstate New York and New
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:58.060]  England and then even into the on the bridges and the tunnels into Manhattan
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.500]  itself that's a point in itself Wayne I mean why isn't there more anger directed
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:06.820]  at Washington itself with protests when we know it's not an issue of just
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:10.820]  capitalism it's not an issue of just Washington it's this evil marriage of
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.740]  croning capitalism why aren't people getting more sophisticated it's
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:19.260]  targeting that is the real issue behind these economic problems when well because
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:25.100]  Washington itself is not being affected so much by this economic mess that we
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:30.260]  see in the rest of the country most people here in this town are here be one
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.980]  way or another they're they're feeding off the government you know the trough
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.740]  they're feeding out of the trough and and and so while you get people
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:44.140]  sympathetic to some of the protesters let's face it I've been down to the
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.660]  protests and I see the same faces as I saw are some of the same things that all
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.900]  the anti-war protests going back stay with us Wayne we're gonna be back on the

[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.660]  and WayneMadsenreport.com for staying into the second hour I was going to get
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:03.460]  into the design to financial implosion and the fact that banks it's confirmed
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:08.420]  now but not just in the newspapers I'm getting this from chatter online people
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.860]  I know are now trying to restrict people getting their own money out of banks
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:18.420]  this is a very very dangerous sign I'm gonna be getting into that the TSA I'm
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:23.500]  gonna be getting into a host of other important issues here today but ladies
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.980]  and gentlemen I want you to understand Wayne Madsen has traveled the entire
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:32.940]  world he has recently been in Libya so has Webster Tarpley while it was being
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:40.660]  bombarded Wayne is an impeccable impeccable force he brought us the DC
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:45.740]  madam you name it he has broken so many stories for major publications when I'm
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:49.100]  watching congressional testimony on national security you can almost always
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.700]  see Wayne Madsen you know they're in the second row reporting and what he broke
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.660]  last hour as I was sitting here in my hotel room getting ready to go out and
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:06.860]  shoot some interviews with Jesse Ventura later this afternoon absolutely
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.940]  crystallized everything and makes total sense but when Wayne says he has sources
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:17.940]  you better believe he has them and I've got Kirk Nemo right now doing a blurb on
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:23.380]  this that again will point to Wayne Madsen report.com that he's gonna have
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:31.020]  the full scoop because this is big news this is huge international news what
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:37.100]  you just heard it makes perfect sense if you just joined us Wayne Madsen anti
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:42.100]  submarine warfare you know expert then work for the NSA RCA you name it helps
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:48.100]  set up you know some of the major pro internet freedom organizations that are
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.140]  out there the reason I'm building him up is you can understand he's a really good
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.660]  source and he wouldn't come on air and say he's getting ready to break it with
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:02.820]  proof and the sources that Taddafi was under white flag when he was leaving his
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:08.740]  tribal hometown now why does this make perfect sense
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:15.100]  Hillary Clinton flies in that's a new she's there she's the head of the State
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.700]  Department she's the type of leading envoy that someone would turn themselves
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.620]  over to we know the head of the tribal council where Gaddafi was at a month
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:28.660]  ago was publicly trying to make deals and he just wanted promises Gaddafi did
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:34.100]  regardless what you think of him that there wouldn't be a civil war in fact
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:39.180]  he was saying that previously and so was his son the shield of Islam translated
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:44.340]  and the only way the desert foxes he's known he has the same nickname as
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:50.580]  Rommel who was in Libya obviously during World War two the desert fox would not
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:57.540]  just drive out onto a highway with a big long motorcade while he was inside a
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.300]  city under siege knowing there were drones and all this of course and that's
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.900]  what I thought when this happened a week ago why would he drive out in the convoy
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:15.300]  and you know it in front of the whole world obviously he was surrendering we
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.060]  know these negotiations have been going on but treacherously they didn't want it
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.500]  to come out that the West told tens of millions of dollars he invested in US
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:27.380]  banks or that he made all these deals with the West and hugged Obama and
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:32.900]  hugged Tony Blair and Sarkozy and finance some of their campaigns they
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.380]  wanted to double cross this guy and so they had to get rid of him and what adds
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.260]  credibility to this and we're going to Wayne here I want people to realize the
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.300]  magnitude of this what adds credibility to this is not just his record Wayne's
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:50.620]  record but the fact that a week ago Wayne said no they did executing this is a
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:55.620]  lie that crossfire killed Gaddafi that's ridiculous he was paraded around before
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:59.140]  the all the videos came out and tortured and then shot and then that was
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:03.620]  confirmed Wayne has been Olivia repeatedly Wayne has met with the
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:07.380]  leadership Wayne has the sources and everything he said has been confirmed
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:13.380]  now think about this Gaddafi comes out the motorcade clearly believes he'd be a
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:18.340]  madman like a sitting duck driving out in a motorcade you know into the middle of
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:24.340]  the rebels that have surrounded the town of course he had a white flag of course
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:30.060]  I mean that's a no-brainer and now they've been caught lying and said oh he
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:34.300]  got killed in crossfire even when there were videos and photos of him being
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.180]  dragged around they still said oh no he got killed in crossfire and now no
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:43.260]  everybody they released the video of the rebels shooting execution style as they
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.220]  were ordered to do they were told we're handing them over to you we're going to
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.300]  bomb out this motorcade you get the body make sure he never comes back and they
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.540]  did that those rebels are going to follow those globalist orders this and for
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.180]  those that don't know Wayne is absolutely right as a historian this goes
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.900]  back to China and the Romans it is close to two thousand years old in the
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:08.580]  history books probably 2,500 years old the previous dynasty in China the white
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:14.820]  flag means I am giving up and it is an incredible from my historical research
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.100]  one of the biggest war crimes you can commit is when somebody runs up a white
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.740]  flag or says quarter going after him it is against the law it is a chivalrous it
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:29.220]  is the most dastardly because this is what happens needlessly whole armies
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.460]  then get killed if somebody tries to give up but you learn that that an enemy
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.820]  won't won't let you give up you're going to fight to the end and that will
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.140]  cause the other army to have greater casualties this has all been figured out
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.900]  thousands of years ago and it means that the other side will do even more
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:50.500]  desperate things and it escalates into total barbarism so I've got Kurt
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.020]  Nemo listening right now he's going to get a blurb out on this
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.620]  A. Wayne those are what holds you to the bottom of the hour this is so important
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:01.340]  but I had to preface all of this when you've got before but I want to go to
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.900]  these questions with you specifically what can you tell us about the sources
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.580]  I mean how you're confirming the white flag was there obviously it had to be it
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:16.180]  makes perfect sense a b the government's been caught lying and saying he wasn't
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:21.260]  shot when now it's confirmed they were lying see am I right in saying clearly
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:26.300]  Hillary's there as the signal to him okay have Hillary come I will meet with her
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:31.820]  you know I will turn myself in I mean clearly all this makes perfect sense but
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:37.580]  you say you have the sources this is huge news this is unbelievable so break it
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:43.460]  down Wayne okay on the morning on the morning of October 19th that was last
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:49.940]  Thursday right as as a sudden broke there were reports that I was getting
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:58.500]  Twitter messages coming out of cert coming from vantage points where the
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.820]  rebels were where neutral parties were saying there are white flags being seen
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:10.700]  in the city of cert now we were told several things in the news reports one
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:17.180]  that there were plans made by Gaddafi to leave cert before morning prayers
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:24.420]  morning prayers the first call to prayer is around five o'clock a.m. that's
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:30.940]  usually before you have the sun up so it's still pretty dark you really can't
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:37.660]  see a white flag in darkness or before the sun is up so you're gonna wait till
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:44.740]  the sun is pretty high up in the sky before you try to leave under a flag
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:50.420]  of truth so here the Sun comes up and white flags are seen all over cert seen
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:55.260]  from various buildings now this city's been obliterated so you're seeing white
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:59.540]  flags white flags from the vehicles now they're cobbling together this motor
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:04.140]  cave I'm not saying that every vehicle had a white flag but you know what do you
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:11.020]  use use a sheet use a pillowcase use whatever you can as a white flag if
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:17.180]  Gaddafi if they wanted to try to sneak out why would they have not done it at
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:24.940]  night why did they wait till it was the Sun was up to try to leave cert because
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:29.700]  you want to wait till the Sun is up so you can clearly see the white flag of
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:34.740]  truth the white flag is surrender that's why they waited that long that's why
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:38.980]  they didn't get out at night but that made them sitting ducks of course for
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.380]  the predators which you know the predator locked on to their to them
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.900]  immediately it was probably all on a live video feedback the Langley and General
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:53.260]  Petraeus kindly old General Petraeus who loves using drones to kill people he's
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:58.020]  done it in Iraq and he's done it in Afghanistan so here we have this
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:02.260]  situation now as far as Hillary's presence there I don't know if she was
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.420]  involved with that certainly her shortling before the interview saying
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:12.260]  you know we came we saw he died you know if he was involved in any kind of
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.100]  negotiations and still said that I mean the woman the woman is obviously mentally
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:23.060]  ill or she's so evil that you know the words can't describe it but anyway
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:28.900]  that's that's the situation that the and also I'll add that the chief tribal
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.780]  elder of the Qaddaqa tribe and cert who you had mentioned had been in
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:39.500]  negotiations last month on a surrender he was obviously involved in this and
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.220]  and the rebels went into his home unarmed old man and shot and killed him
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.300]  that was my next question to you yes that it's been confirmed that there were
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:51.420]  massacres in the town and the mass graves and now people are calling for an
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.220]  investigation but nature runs it so how do you investigate when the foxes run
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:19:00.420]  the henhouse but that would show a cover up the fact that they ran in and tried
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.900]  to execute the constabulary instead of trying or whatever that has rebels would
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:08.380]  normally do taking over they showed there was an attempt to cover something up
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.820]  and the way the White House jumped on it and said no we didn't execute him
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.780]  nobody did he died in crossfire the way that they were so ready with those
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:22.300]  cover stories that shows the spinning and scripting that this whole thing was a
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:27.180]  complete setup yeah Gaddafi drives out in broad daylight of course he's in a
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.860]  city's encircled there's predator drones in the sky it's rubble he would know
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:37.260]  that would be suicide to drive out in broad daylight unless he had an
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:40.940]  agreement was coming in we know that was being negotiated Hillary lands it's
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:46.620]  announced Gaddafi then is gonna come in boom this happens stay there wait let's

[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:11.340]  ladies and gentlemen we are back on the Alex Jones show I'm Aaron Dyke sitting
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:16.580]  in as Alex calls and reports from the road and we still have Wayne Madsen with
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:22.660]  us for one more segment Alex well it's just insane to see how decadent our
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:27.460]  culture's gotten there are children all over this casino and they've got in the
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:35.140]  elevators ads for bars here where it shows young women who basically grabbing
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:39.900]  on each other sexually and again that that's this is advertised as a family
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.220]  casino where they put me up here where we're doing interviews and stuff around
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:49.820]  town and it just shows how far we've fallen as a society torture secret
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:55.780]  arrest secret execution killing of US citizens and as Ron Paul said to the
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:59.180]  moderators at a debate he said you're all in danger too I mean this is
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.580]  fundamental stuff that bad guys do you know Hitler Stalin Mao secret police
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:10.220]  secret arrest but America's been sold that it's sexy it's tough it's cool you
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:15.260]  know people run up white flags you kill them it's so dangerous and they say well
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:20.420]  could not be the bad guy so he deserves it and now they're putting al-Qaeda groups
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.540]  in charge and you and they've got shoulder-fired watchers I mean for those
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:32.700]  that aren't into history like you and I are Wayne Madsen for those that don't
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:39.100]  know I mean the magnitude of a white flag obviously he had a white flag coming
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.980]  out broad daylight in the middle of all that the magnitude of the treachery the
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:47.620]  magnitude of killing people with white flags I don't think I guess people don't
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:54.100]  understand that is the ultimate treachery is it not in warfare went back to try to
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:26:00.580]  find in recent history whether there were any abuses even you know by the
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:07.500]  the German Nazis the Japanese Imperial Army and I couldn't find any major
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:13.260]  examples of a white flag of truce or surrender being ignored certainly even
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:18.660]  in the battle of the bulge there was a white flag there was an attempt of a
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:25.860]  negotiation and it was honored but whatever was worked out insert that was
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:31.180]  done so rapidly I don't think there was a lot of planning because some reports
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:35.900]  when the white flags were first seen some people outside of cert who were still
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:42.540]  hoping the Gaddafi would be triumphant were actually tweeting the message that
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:46.980]  the rebels are surrendering so that's how much confusion there was even on the
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:51.820]  Gaddafi side about the appearance of the white flag so I would say that whatever
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:59.060]  was done was done at the last minute probably in haste but certainly was not
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:04.300]  now one thing NATO could say and they may try to spin this when we start
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:08.420]  hearing more reports about the white flag oh well it wasn't coordinated we
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.820]  didn't know about it and then the rebels we know they don't even they can't even
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:16.620]  decide on what to do with the body over there it's rotting in this meat for a
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:25.140]  refrigeration unit and it's long since the Islamic you know religious burial
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:30.700]  stricture it has to be buried before sundown the next day so that's it was
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:35.900]  way beyond that but I think this goes to show what kind of people as you say are
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:40.140]  are involved with the rebels people that don't even honor a white flag of truth
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.980]  the white flag of surrender and we know the drone certainly didn't do that and
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.420]  they could clearly see flags either there in broad daylight and they can zoom in
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:52.060]  on a penny on the ground and read the date absolutely now now now wait let's
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:57.340]  expand on this just briefly because I've got Kurt Nemedon report you're saying
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:05.580]  you're compiling but the the the tweets things that are out there reports but I
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.780]  know you've also had a lot of sources in Libya what other documentation do you
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:13.700]  have for this other than those tweets and the common sense that he wouldn't
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:17.380]  wouldn't drive on broad daylight under predator drones and out to rebels if he
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:21.460]  wasn't believing it was part of a surrender deal well there is also
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.780]  witnesses on the scene who didn't tweet but I've stated that there were white
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:33.100]  flags seen all over cert that morning
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.980]  repeatedly and we need to get partly on about this as well but you're saying
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:42.340]  that you have sources in Libya that are saying this yes okay good when is your
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.140]  report coming up so in our report we can tell folks what I look forward to that
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.780]  well I'm still working on it I wanted to give you a heads up it should be out no
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:56.740]  later than tomorrow okay we'll tell folks to look for that report tomorrow and
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.580]  that you've got sources on the ground but also you've got the tweets and that's
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:03.340]  and more and also the tribal leader a month ago we know we're trying to
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.540]  negotiate that and the fact that they went in and executed him in his house I
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:11.540]  mean this is just incredible level from your research you think they gave them
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:16.420]  the order to make sure Gaddafi didn't make it out of there and executing well
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:23.380]  even even though the logistics may have been last minute obviously this had to
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:29.100]  have been improved by high higher levels so yes I would say that this had been
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:34.020]  worked out that Obama must have known about it Hillary Cameron Sarkozy the
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.420]  NATO Secretary General all the key players must have known about it in
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:51.500]  addition obviously to the to the rebel leadership we're on the March the

[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:42.260]  reporting that the US Declaration of Independence is somehow illegal perhaps
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.460]  we'll get into that later we still have Alex Jones on with this reporting live
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:52.180]  from Las Vegas writing shotgun Alex what are we getting into right now yeah I'm
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:56.420]  glad you brought that up I actually have a little list here of things I wanted to
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:00.540]  get into and that's one of them so I'm glad you reminded me so make sure before
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:08.380]  this hour ends and Mr. Henningson joins you that we talk about that some the
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:12.020]  first thing is I'm gonna get into this whole casual society how close we are
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:16.060]  to it what's happening with the banks could there be an engineered run-on
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.580]  banks or will it happen regardless I want to break that down with some big
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.500]  developments they're taking place also states to limit hospital stays some to
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:29.460]  cut Medicare coverage to 10 days so the real unraveling and collapse of
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.380]  society is accelerating we're gonna get into that I'm gonna finish up with a
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:39.580]  gentleman flying with seven silver coins one little bitty gold coin tent of an
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:43.460]  ounce that we're talking less than $600 worth of stuff that I saw being
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:47.060]  interrogated and then I had a chance to interview him after our plane got to
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:50.740]  Las Vegas he happened to be on the same plane that I was on so I'm gonna tell
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:54.380]  that story that I've already alluded to and the fact that they're now doing
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:00.500]  behavioral screening at the Austin Airport it's just incredible let me they
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:05.180]  take these people that don't even have basic law enforcement training and
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:09.900]  teach him that they can come you know portend like soothsayers exactly
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:14.620]  psychically by asking questions my answer is hey let me ask you questions you
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:20.260]  gonna steal from my bag you gonna plant drugs on me you gonna you gonna are you
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.620]  a pedophile I mean statistically you guys have a lot of criminals in your
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.940]  midst a lot of control free criminals get into this position how about put you
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.940]  on the hot seat how about your guilty and deliberate innocent punk okay I'm
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.020]  already digressing but we get so focused on the news here that we tend to not
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:43.460]  even promote everything else we're doing the nightly news ladies and gentlemen
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:50.380]  has a six-person team on it we put a ton of time energy and money incredible
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:55.620]  special reports incredible reports on the ground incredible interviews I mean I
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:36:02.060]  am really proud of the news we're doing if there's any weak link it's Alex Jones
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.940]  because we are teleprompter free and some nights is dynamite spot on other
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.860]  nights the news turns into two hours because I just start pontificating on
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.700]  everything as I'm known to do but overall it is a revolution in media
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:20.700]  teleprompter free real analysis real information we wear our bias for
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:25.220]  liberty and freedom on our sleeve where everybody can see it and this is
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:29.140]  revolutionary and I'm very excited that we've got a lot of new prison planet
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:34.620]  TV members we're adding more and more functions all my films the books the
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:39.940]  nightly news the on the road special reports the live reports when I start
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:46.020]  giving speeches in other cities we're going to stream those speeches there on
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:51.460]  the site as well but we need the capital and it is those of you that become
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:55.660]  members that fund our operation so if you were a prison planet TV member years
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:00.420]  ago and let it elapsed we've got I mean it's a hundred times better than it was
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:05.100]  before works so much better a lot of better servers some nights the different
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:09.260]  browsers or whatever the audio gets off the video if there's any glitches in the
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:12.540]  streaming we just bought a bunch of expensive equipment I say expensive
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:17.060]  like you know $20,000 pieces of equipment a lot of the streaming stuff to
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:22.060]  make sure your show streams out live properly is like $20,000 $30,000 $100,000
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:26.100]  but we've been trying to do it with you know cheaper equipment and we're having
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:30.020]  to buy a bunch of equipment right now so your prison planet dot it doesn't matter
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:35.620]  for the MP4s and MP5s different video postings that we put up those are
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:39.660]  super crisp and that's all synced up but that's after the show some nights it's
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.620]  live other nights it's tape right before it goes live but it tends to
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:49.420]  stream better when it is live and it's sometimes when we like have the you know
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:54.700]  like an hour before it goes live you know I finished the report and sometimes
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:58.140]  it's part live and then part tape reports we've done the point is we're
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:03.700]  really beta testing this this is a new way to do the news and it's
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:06.980]  revolutionary so I want to thank everybody that have become prison planet
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:11.820]  dot TV members you know with every username and passcode we have it set
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.380]  where you can share it with six people six people can be simultaneously
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:20.180]  long in under the same username and passcode so really when you get one
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:25.140]  membership you get five free now don't use a username and passcode that's on
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:29.020]  your bank account folks I've tried to that's a little added point we have in
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.980]  there if you're gonna share your passcode make sure it's you know something
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:38.420]  like a you know ridiculous or or simple but something that isn't what you use
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:44.460]  on your other passcodes but we may just start you know we're having a grand
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.580]  randomly generate codes for people you know so they can share it with other
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:51.500]  folks we're gonna try to have some events where you know it's totally free for a
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:57.060]  week so folks can test it out my plan is to add more shows I mean I've got a I
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:00.860]  want to do a second amendment show I want to do a land ride show I want to have
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:05.260]  our reporters I want to expand this and then we're we're we're we're right at
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:11.100]  goal in fact we're in danger of slipping beneath goal for getting members to be
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.100]  able to finance all this so if you're not a member become one of your
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:18.380]  already a member go buy another membership give it to people this is how
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:25.020]  we get the word out also we have the fourth annual moneybomb and we raised
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.940]  four hundred and thirty something thousand dollars last year that sounds
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:32.020]  like a lot when you got 35 employees and four or five contractors that's
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:37.780]  that's that's really nothing but it turns out to be about 20% of of our
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:44.020]  operating capital and we've gotten to where we need that we've gotten to where
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:47.540]  we depend on it but never mind it have a moneybomb listeners started it four
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:52.260]  years ago you notice we're doing this in November not in October I was looking
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:57.060]  at not even doing one this year but I want to hire a couple more reporters I
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.500]  want to hire another director on top of do so that he's not up there every night
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:07.740]  till nine o'clock at night I'm I want to the point is I want to beef up what

[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:28.460]  so I need to develop at least a few some depth I need depth in my player roster

[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:16.260]  starting way late this year with like 15 days of promotion I think total and you

[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:32.740]  that's not even the best time to have the moneybomb I know it's in October so
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:38.140]  that's a good time for the whole holiday diversion begins so we need your help
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:42.700]  we need your help because I don't want them I'm spending a lot of our reserve
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:48.220]  capital right now I don't like to spend it all but I will I've decided to these
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:51.700]  banks can't be trusted anyway so I try to always have four or five months of
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:57.700]  operating capital you know like a quarter tank basically in the in the
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:01.860]  offices gas tank but I'm just gonna spend it all and then if we ever get to
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:04.980]  where we're out of money and come entirely I'll just say please folks buy a

[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:30.380]  to not let the United States go the way of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia and
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:37.940]  China that said I don't even feel up right now to trying to describe the full
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:45.980]  spectrum situation that we are dealing with with the cashless society Aaron
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:48.980]  while I get my notes out I actually wrote some notes up over the last few
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:54.820]  days with the cashless society and give me your take going back to overall on
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:59.740]  what info wars has built what we're doing and our team well it's been
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:03.860]  incredible Alex I've helped Rob Jacobson some of the other editors review the
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.940]  footage just from building this new studio and it's been several years in
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.700]  the making as you know and it's just it was totally from the ground up they
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.180]  didn't even have the walls in that building they had to put in the glass
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:18.700]  for the studio they had to bring in all the furniture they had to put in the
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.740]  soundproofing all the cabling and wiring the lighting systems that's why we were
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:29.820]  full-time working 15 hours a day making films doing radio shows researching
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:34.220]  news articles we're such a small team you know you've got four or five people
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:37.780]  in the shipping department a couple customer service three or four IT
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:44.700]  people three or four editors couple TV people you know a couple people a
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:48.380]  couple sales guys couple people in accounting the other great folks that
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:52.940]  run the radio TV show three people there I mean we're a very small team and
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:57.620]  that's why we need these donations we need to create at least some depth I
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:02.180]  mean imagine a football team with a starting lineup and that's it it's
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:05.900]  crazy Alex but somehow we get it done and that was even at the same time you
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:09.860]  had expanded the show to four hours and and then we added the nightly news that
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:13.820]  takes a lot of work to do as you know I'm about to go cover the Info Wars
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:17.340]  nightly news we have a whole package coming up tonight even as we do the
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:20.780]  radio show we're getting ready for that now I just got to say we've got
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.100]  dedicated people what's great is I can even hire folks that aren't into this
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.940]  stuff you know with ads on Craig list people don't know what job they're
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:31.500]  getting and I and I've hired people who don't even know about this stuff in a
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.980]  few months into it you can't even get them to go home because they're
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:38.140]  discovering more and I think that's what's gonna defeat the globalist if we
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:42.620]  can just get people out of their trance their literal trance like zombies and
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.580]  get them to look into the real world once they discover this stuff's going on
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:51.580]  it's interesting it's horrifying but it's also addicting to learn about it
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:58.580]  and then fight it I mean there's a whole real world going on right around us and
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:02.900]  it's like do you want to wake up from the matrix or do you want to stay in it
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:08.140]  hmm I think the problem is it seems almost like entertainment sometimes
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:12.540]  because it's so fascinating so much like all these scientific dystopic films I
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:16.860]  don't want to get blunted by all that propaganda that's out there because this
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:21.500]  stuff is happening it's very real all the sterilization all this eugenics plots
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.220]  all the world government stuff has been creeping in for decades and decades Alex
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:32.140]  and it's just getting worse yeah I wrote all these notes on the little free pad of
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:38.220]  paper they give you because I write faster than I type and I mean I can't
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:43.980]  even describe the capital controls I mean it is just mentally and
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:48.980]  psychically exhausting because you have these realizations as information
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.820]  connects and crystallizes and of course you already inherently know it but then
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:58.620]  to see it actually manifesting I mean imagine in America if you told people
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:04.260]  20 years ago that you go to the airport and a guy says we got a troublemaker
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:14.780]  here where are you going and then and then really Jesse Ventura right and then
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:19.020]  you go through the line you're walking by another checkpoint you know if you go
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:22.420]  to your gate you see another guy with silver in his hand and the TSA asking
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:27.060]  what it is and then you say oh my god I got to get to my flight I could see the
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:31.500]  gate down there it was it was almost completely boarded and I go I sit down
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:36.140]  and 15 minutes later as the plane's about to close the door the guy comes and
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:45.500]  sits next to me or the last seats full and I'm so well anyway side issue the
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.300]  point is it was like fate that he'd be on my plane and then sit right next to me
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.220]  because it was like two seats left one guy got on a black guy got on real late
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.700]  and got the seat behind me and then this guy got on last but at the very last
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:02.180]  seat on the plane totally full and then it's the guy I see being searched for
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:07.780]  the silver and on a busy you know Saturday at the Austin Airport and then
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:13.180]  he sits down and then I'm not even gonna say anything to him because I don't want
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:17.940]  to bug him and then he's he I'm talking he goes aren't you Alex Jones and it
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:22.540]  turns out he's a listener and then he describes what he went through for like
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:26.300]  six minutes he said at least they asked him why do you have the silver where are
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:32.980]  you going what's it for we're talking seven silver coins us be a man one
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:37.580]  ounces and one tenth of an ounce a little gold coin I forgot to ask him
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:40.980]  what type it was he was trying to show it to me in the airport but I was too
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:45.220]  busy talking and then we got off the airplane I interviewed him there in
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:49.820]  Las Vegas with them with a slot machine show in the background at the airport
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:55.900]  only in Vegas and again we just tuned in I'm here to be interviewed for the TV
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:58.060]  show by just Victor I was interviewed some yesterday I'll be interviewed this
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.740]  afternoon people are asking what are you doing in Vegas believe me folks I
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:04.300]  wouldn't be here wouldn't for work because that's where Ventura's meet a
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:09.660]  bunch of people because he won't fly now because the TSA and then you're like
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:12.500]  you're always criticizing Vegas and now you're there duh this is where they're
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:17.020]  doing the interviews but it doesn't matter it's always crucified Alex Jones
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:21.540]  the point is is that I'm here and I'm watching this guy go through these
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:26.820]  capital controls that they always put on countries right as the nation collapses
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.460]  right as they're getting ready to devalue the currency right as they're
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:33.340]  getting ready to freeze how much money you can get out and under a cashless
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:38.100]  society if you think Bank of America and other banks announcing $5 every time
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:42.220]  you use your own debit card not only you know is it banks aren't going to give
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:46.100]  you much interest on only not even 1% on money you have with their bank now
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.380]  they're starting to say they're going to charge you to keep your money in the
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.420]  bank and they're going to charge you every time you use it and then when they
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.940]  do automatic deposits from work they're saying they're going to take a piece when
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.540]  you use it to pay a bill they're saying they're going to take a piece this is the
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:05.220]  debt bondage it doesn't just track everything you do and it just doesn't
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:10.540]  let the global technicians manipulate the economy and exempt themselves you
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:14.340]  know like like Goldman Sachs and has been caught with that computer system
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:19.140]  they've got they could log into the stock market and siphon off you know a tent
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:23.780]  of a percent hundreds of billions a week shooting everyone that's what this
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:28.060]  whole game to grid is it's turning the whole world into a rigged slot machine
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:35.460]  and then Sunday morning I get up real early and I'm hungry and all the shops
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:39.660]  in the casino are closed I want to eat and they say well you've got you go to
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:44.300]  the buffet so I'll tell you the cashless society buffet story when we come back

[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:54.100]  hotel and I was buying some shaving cream and there was a lady in front of me
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.420]  buying a six pack of beer she looked like she was about 80 years old I mean she
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:03.020]  was on a cane whole nine yards I guess going up to her hotel room and the lady
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:10.940]  carded her and then I was sitting there eating at a hotel bar for lunch and I
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:15.100]  saw him carding people who looked like they were 55 you know 60 years old
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:19.980]  couples and I said to the lady I said you know they're taking your humanity out
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:25.700]  of the equation they're training you to show an ID but then yesterday morning

[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:50.740]  card and have an ID to eat on that or go through this if you have cash or credit
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:57.700]  card so the buffet is $25 I'm not gonna pig out but I gotta eat so I I go over
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:03.100]  and I stick a $20 bill and a $10 bill he asked me where I'm from it starts to
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:07.460]  ask me questions I'm sitting there trying to even when I'm paying with cash it

[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:32.260]  we are back in the third hour this is Aaron Dyke sitting in but we still have
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:36.780]  Alex Jones on the line joining us now and you heard him before talking about
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:41.780]  all the cashless checkpoints all the secret spy questions you get asked at
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:45.740]  car rental places I've seen the same thing and I told him the last time I was
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:48.940]  in Denver when I had to wait an hour because the line was totally long and
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:52.580]  they asked 10 or 20 questions of you where you going what are you doing is
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:55.660]  this business or pleasure I said I'm not going to participate in your database
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:00.380]  and the guy tried to tell me it was required by law and I just refused to
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:04.820]  answer his questions I still got the rental car of course that's a
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:08.140]  Patriot that compliance that's totally unconstitutional it's know your
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:13.540]  customer for banking and now they say it's for hotels rental cars businesses
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:17.020]  and that's why they admit this going back a decade the reason they card
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:20.940]  everybody for tobacco beer now gas anything they're now saying gas could be
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:24.660]  used as a weapon it's guilty until proven innocent they're training you for
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:28.820]  the cash flow society where you have to do everything on a card even if you pay
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:34.740]  cash you're gonna have to swipe the card to prove the chain of that cash was it
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:38.460]  involved in money laundering or drugs or black market economy that's why a
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:43.380]  bunch of states are moving to ban cash and secondhand sales I want people to
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:50.900]  realize the magnitude of this I mean the literal 20 questions but because a
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:57.020]  major corporation with his TV network was in a database because it's time
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:03.500]  Warner then oh I was VIP they were waiting kissing my hand in down there
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:10.380]  when I came with the keys they were all there because I was VIP everybody else
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:13.860]  though had me put into the database but I was trusted because I was part of the
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:18.260]  big corporate structure I mean this is the new world order system this is where
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.860]  this is going with the trusted traveler and it's all about them being able to
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:26.180]  turn your accounts off once it's cash was you combine or sell without it and
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:29.620]  these ideas are like oh shut up Christian even if you don't believe in the Bible
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:33.940]  what a horrible idea to give a corrupt state this power and no after the
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:37.500]  breaker to get to this Atlantic article where they say yes domestic checkpoints
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:41.780]  are coming to highways and shopping malls and football stadiums near you
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:47.220]  what's you know what's wrong with that it's a wonderful good idea these people
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:51.580]  are giving people attitude at the checkpoints folks it's and they say
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:57.540]  it's a privilege to drive it's not a privilege under commerce in the 1920s
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:02.620]  they made it a privilege under county laws to drive large trucks they sold the
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:06.020]  public on they're making money on roads you're paying for make them pay a
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:11.220]  percentage they use class envy it is not a privilege to travel and have
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:14.700]  mobility now they're trying to make Amish not be able to use the shoulder
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:18.740]  with their horses under common law they're turning the whole country into a
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:24.660]  taxed and polled and controlled a giant prison you are in a prison you were
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:29.300]  treated like a five-year-old child whose door to the planetarium when you try
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:33.940]  to get a rental car when you check into a hotel when you go to restaurants they
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:37.540]  ask you 20 questions when you go anywhere they ask for your zip code when
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:41.420]  you pay with cash now they ask you why you're paying with cash they've got
[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:46.260]  billboards up saying cash is bad listen most of these they don't even have
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:51.060]  people actually dealing with cards now they have they have a projection and
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:55.720]  and and and and like a hologram on one on another it looks like a real woman
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:02.500]  dealing the cards for people humans are completely being phased out the only
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:09.420]  growth sector is quasi police security guards who are knighted by the TSA to
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:14.700]  have this power to wave a wand and be outside the Constitution Aaron yeah and
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:18.180]  you see the lure of all this high-tech stuff as though we're supposed to just
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:22.620]  all lap it up and enjoy it when it's meant there to control as you remember
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:27.620]  the Army War College preparing for economic unrest and riots in Arizona
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:32.220]  I believe back in 2008 they knew all this stuff was coming down and they know
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:36.260]  what the public does or would do that they might fight back against the system
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:39.940]  when this comes down that's why you see the police state the checkpoints going
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:43.980]  with the currency controls as you talk about the cash for society and all the
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.820]  database questions we're going to be back on the other side Alex will be with

[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:17.420]  the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:22.260]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:27.260]  of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:31.860]  the enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore cartel held bent on
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.900]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:39.860]  Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:43.540]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:49.540]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.860]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:08:03.180]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV from his central
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:09.100]  Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:34.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:59.300]  society grid there is no doubt that our republic is falling right now and that
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:04.660]  means your bank accounts your liberty your freedom your your your freedom of
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:10.180]  mobility it's all being butchered Time Magazine Newsweek Washington Post are
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:14.940]  writing endless articles about the Constitution being mad and evil mainstream
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:20.740]  newspapers across the US and England actually heralded a debate that they
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:27.740]  had last week where they said the Declaration of Independence was
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:34.380]  terrorists and evil and that inherently we do not have a right to say that a
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:38.620]  government isn't over us they're actually teaching tyranny now that
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:44.060]  government is God and fundamentally no one has a right to rebel and the BBC
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:49.220]  ran the headline is the Constitution illegal and then it had a serious
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:55.540]  discussion and tried to discredit the idea of natural law now under under
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:59.980]  their system they're saying that of a black person is is is chained up in your
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:06.140]  backyard a hundred and eighty years ago and as a slave because you have the
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.140]  power of the gun and you say that you know that you have the power of
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:13.900]  government that might make right and so that that person is not a human and has
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:19.980]  to pull a plow for you it actually says there is no natural rights government
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:25.140]  is God the Queen of England is God I know Aaron has the article and that they
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:29.340]  have a right as a sovereign and our founding fathers were bad and they came
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:35.140]  to the US and had a debate about this and sold this idea even though in England
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:40.740]  they had overthrown the power of the monarch many times I mean this is just
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:46.700]  so asinine and when you go across this country you see these little children
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:52.900]  with their parents being inducted being groped being microwaved oven being
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:56.860]  questioned by the TSA and the whole idea is you're being taught that you're bad
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:02.940]  you're being taught you're a prisoner in a free society no one has run-ins with
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:08.820]  police no one gets interrogated every tyranny always has these quasi fake
[02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:15.180]  police these minders these these commas ours that are part of the whole
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:22.660]  aporachic that's what they're doing this is absolute text book like a duck in
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:26.420]  your backyard if you've got a pond and the ducks out there it's a duck this is
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:36.340]  a tyranny this is 100% diabolical transpartisan the entire government
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:43.860]  structure is now absolute scientific dog training evil phasing out cash bring
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:50.780]  in a total system of control where they can tax regulate control abuse the
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:55.580]  living daylights out of you as Aaron mentioned earlier the military admits
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:00.140]  2008 they're training for martial law total financial collapse I told you
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:03.900]  that years ago I went to urban warfare drills and witnessed this 12 years ago
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:07.820]  they've been getting ready for this worldwide so was the British government
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:12.540]  so have other governments even the one in telegraph said the EU dictatorship
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:16.940]  plan revealed and it shows that it's a private banking group secretly
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:20.980]  engineering the collapse in the takeover I mean Von Rupe admits this is
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:26.020]  hailing it as the birth of world government run by private banks that
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:33.500]  literally financially rape you seven waves to sunday and then Aaron was
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:39.340]  mentioning to me an Atlantic article and I pulled it up here and it's like how
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:43.940]  dare the American people have to give attitude to the new domestic checkpoints
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:48.580]  TSA is going to set up on the highways and search your car for your safety it's
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:52.620]  a privilege to drive it's a privilege and we're going to search you at shopping
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:56.260]  malls and sports stadiums and everywhere well I guess you can say it's a
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:00.100]  privilege on private property to go to a football game the problem is they always
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:03.300]  have government backing and funding to build the stadiums so courts of rule
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:06.340]  they can't really do what they're doing folks aren't even aware of that little
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:12.180]  wrinkle there but the point is is that you have these modern public comments
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:14.940]  where they're getting rid of the bill of rights and say they're going to grow
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:18.980]  people now and have x-ray machines and this is the new industry for America
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:24.460]  this is the military national complex absorbing and taking over our Republic
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:28.860]  okay again this is Alex Jones from Las Vegas here with Jesse Ventura shooting
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:32.620]  episodes of his TV show and so I'm here via phone I should have brought a Skype
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:39.180]  system Aaron Dyches the main host there in the studio in Austin Texas and we're
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.060]  breaking this down ladies and gentlemen it is known in every society that
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:49.060]  internal checkpoints are the hallmark of the tyranny now it's been ruled hundreds
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:53.220]  and hundreds of times federal thousands of times at the state level that war
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:58.180]  was checkpoints are illegal and now as we told you they would the TSA is
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:01.660]  starting checkpoints all over the country and what does the quote liberal
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:07.340]  Atlantic monthly come out and say oh it's wonderful hey let's get used to it
[02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:11.860]  it's his Andy Rooney on 60 minutes said we should get a microchip under our skin
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:16.060]  to prove we're good so we can go to a football game and let me tell you something
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:20.620]  these zombies that only care about football they do it we are living in a
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:25.300]  dystopic nightmare system and it's fixing to get a hundred times worse and
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:30.340]  that's not a figure of speech everything we've seen is only the preparatory
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:35.260]  phase of the dominoes being set up now a lot of us foresaw this so we warned
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:39.340]  people and that's why we've got a chance here but if you're not getting
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:43.100]  chills right now folks we're not just going into some corrupt system this is
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:48.260]  a scientific murder machine that openly states once world government is
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:53.700]  established it is going to start soft killing people even faster the cancer is
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:58.660]  triple the diabetes is doubling and tripling the the all these new diseases
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.140]  are exploding diseases of the gut are exploding deformities are exploding we
[02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:07.060]  know when all the studies the GMO transgenetic systems within three
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:13.980]  generations render on end-of-days children of men in virtual deformity in
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:19.900]  99% of the rats and guinea pigs made a made a emergency global transmission
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:23.660]  break out of your trance now you are being incrementally murdered by the
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:27.820]  globalist their control grid is going into place I am here in Las Vegas almost
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:32.620]  everything is cashless they've got virtual dealers that I've shot video of
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:38.260]  they make you give ID when you pay for cash for eggs for for a buffet for
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:44.340]  pancakes ladies and gentlemen we are in an emergency they are passing laws all
[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:48.860]  over the world including Louisiana other states have it introduced to not let
[02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:52.940]  you use cash in second-hand transactions because you're guilty until
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:58.100]  proven innocent the total system is upon you whether you're a cop or a military
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:02.780]  or a bureaucrat you were under attack as well you were under high-tech mind
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:06.980]  control you're under chemical attack in the food water biological attack in the
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:12.020]  food you are with us the people you were being killed as well I looked at those
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:16.500]  TSA guys in Austin the last thing I said I said you know the body scanners are
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:22.140]  coming here you know those things fry you and they laugh the guy laughed it's
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:27.260]  funny he thinks if he laughs it doesn't matter if they have a seven plus fold
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:30.940]  increase in cancer is it Boston Logan because they've had a scanner for eight
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:37.260]  years he thinks if he laughs it it defends me it is a delusional insane
[02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:40.740]  out-of-control view 20 years ago they wouldn't let the troops use the
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:43.860]  pleaded uranium they wouldn't let the troops use the pleaded uranium in the
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:47.580]  combat because they knew it was a blowback soft-kill weapon where it
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:51.260]  ignited even it was a small round or a large and then you would breathe it and
[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:56.260]  then it would reduce your life expectancy by decades they don't care now now they
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:00.660]  just use it they repeat psychopaths are running things I've analyzed the
[02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:04.740]  globalist they are destroying their own future in their own system they're into
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:09.820]  death everybody I know where skulls I see old ladies with handbags now with
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:16.180]  skulls all over them I see every I see children in the elevators with with

[02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:33.500]  become a huge giant demonic cancer bubbling and pussing in and scroculating
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:38.220]  in the hell itself we are in a total emergency the people have literally been
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:44.140]  put into a trance everybody in this hotel is wearing football jerseys the

[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:23.660]  we are back again on the Alex Jones show this is Aaron Dykes Alex is still
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:27.260]  riding shotgun with us Patrick Henningson coming up to discuss Syria and
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:32.100]  other extremely important geopolitical issues but we're talking about natural
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:35.980]  rights we're talking about this terrible police state coming down and just at a
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.980]  glance what I took from my personal readings of the Enlightenment and
[02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:43.060]  Renaissance was this whole concept that it's always a corrupt man who tries to
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:46.780]  put himself at the top of the system and that's why you have to leave open that
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:49.460]  the rights come from God even if you don't believe in God you want to leave
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:53.300]  that concept open otherwise you're absolutely guaranteed a dictatorship
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:58.820]  last forward to 1776 that is a new concept as Alex Ron Paul and so many
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:02.820]  others bring up all the time and now you have them trying to eradicate that with
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:07.980]  the TSA with all these checkpoints with the cash controls I've seen an A&E
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:12.140]  history channel American Revolution special from the 90s that is overtly
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:16.100]  Marxist that tries to discredit and call the Founding Fathers terrorists Alex
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:20.700]  but I've got this Atlantic article Connor Friedersdorf mission creep this
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:25.580]  Tennessee highway is now patrolled by TSA and opens with quotes from John
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:31.100]  Pistole TSA administration boss talking about how traveling is a privilege and
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:35.580]  anyone who doesn't go along with the screenings has no right to fly and they
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:39.020]  go on to analyze how far does that attitude go does that mean you it's a
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:43.300]  privilege to attend the Super Bowl a privilege to ride the metro system the
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:47.340]  Amtrak train a boat other forms of transportation and now they have these
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:51.780]  highway checkpoints Alex they've already said it no judge no jury you
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:55.460]  can't find out why I can't buy a gun can't travel can't have a job
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:58.900]  TSA has said they're gonna be over every job the unions have already signed
[02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:02.540]  their employees on to have to go through TSA screening that's why when the
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:05.780]  firefighters and police finally we're gonna get healthcare for 9-11 they to
[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:10.060]  go through a terror database but listen here's what's sick I get the emails I
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:15.300]  see the comments some of our paid trolls still calling us coops the mainstream

[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:34.940]  happening faster and faster and this is why it's happening the bankers knew when
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:38.620]  they created the derivative bubble 12 years ago this is gonna happen they
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:42.540]  planned it they have been training to take us down and have a cashless grid
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:48.540]  for decades they've been doing in earnest since 1998 so 13 years it's on this

[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:50.860]  it was a 6 o'clock news on Friday and there was an aerial shot of the charred
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:56.860]  remains of Gaddafi's convoy which was hit I believe by a French tornado in a
[02:34:56.860 --> 02:35:01.460]  NATO airstrike and you can just see burnt out cars and there were some
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:07.340]  rebels there one rebel in particular and it was a very quick shot and I was
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:13.020]  shocked to see this on the back of his camo kind of flakjack flakjacket he had
[02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:18.900]  on in red letters and I called to any viewers out there who can track down
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:24.180]  this clip to try to find it I haven't had any luck of finding it but back of
[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:30.300]  the size jacket in red letters said Syria here we come okay so that is an
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:36.580]  absolute in-your-face admission really on the part of this transnational council
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:43.020]  and it also it never dawned on me to even pay attention but I was looking at the
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:47.860]  interviews with these so-called rebel fighters and I've lived I've lived and
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:52.300]  worked in the Middle East I've lived and worked in Saudi Arabia in the past and
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:57.320]  also in Lebanon and I'm very familiar with the different types of Arab facial
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:02.300]  features and backgrounds and even accents and a lot of these guys there's no way
[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:08.060]  they're from Libya they look like they're a lot of them are from Saudi a few
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:16.620]  Pakistani Afghanistan and Iraq possibly in Egypt and stuff like that so many of
[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:21.620]  these rebel fighters they're not even from Libya so try to explain that I asked
[02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:26.780]  David Cameron and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton try to explain to me how
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:31.860]  all these non-libyan rebels have ended up in Libya and we know there are a lot of
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:36.900]  al-Qaeda fighters that have been been flown in for this for this job the same
[02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:43.580]  guys they're going to fly in to finish off Syria the groundwork for Syria has
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:49.620]  already been laid by the Syrian ambassador US ambassador in Damascus
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:54.860]  his name's Robert Ford and if you're not familiar with Robert Ford Robert Ford
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:37:01.380]  was John Negroponte's number two guy in Baghdad under the Provisional Coalition
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:07.660]  Authority now right about the time Negroponte dropped in his ambassador in
[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:12.860]  Iraq you started having all these death squads popping up Shi'ite death squads
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:19.380]  and things like this kidnapping people shooting people all around Iraq
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:23.940]  marauding gangs of course John Negroponte is the architect of the Central
[02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:29.100]  American death squads and the school for the Americas based in Georgia and all
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:34.980]  the operations that came out of out of that kind of quasi-military intelligence
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:38.780]  university in America they used to train Central American South American
[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:44.300]  terrorists now Negroponte's number two guy is Ford he's he was the man right
[02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:48.420]  man for the job obviously as soon as he arrived in Syria we started seeing armed
[02:37:48.420 --> 02:37:53.100]  insurrection in different parts of Syria it doesn't take a genius to figure out
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:58.820]  what's going on there and these are this is not a grassroots hippie peace movement
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:03.220]  in Syria by any means exactly like it wasn't in Libya this is planned these
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:12.540]  are times the Arab Spring from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya and next to Syria these
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:16.540]  are all carefully coordinated and planned years in advance that's what I
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:21.060]  mean Patrick I mean they try to tell us that this is 1776 when it's nothing of
[02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:24.740]  the kind we were just talking earlier with Alex about the demonization of
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:29.900]  1776 trying to say Thomas Jefferson's Constitution his declaration of
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:33.380]  independence was illegal somehow and yet we're supposed to go along and
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:37.420]  happily support supposed democracy movements in the Middle East that are
[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:41.580]  just smoke screens for this aggressive US foreign policy this is not our
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:46.860]  country it may be under the name of US Patrick and we know they've just brought
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:53.180]  in Islamic Sharia law in Libya even as they use this propaganda to say what
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:57.140]  they need to have women's liberation over there and you know the women don't
[02:38:57.140 --> 02:39:04.020]  want to have the things on the faces and so forth yeah I mean look you've got
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:09.860]  you've got of course you're going to get a pro Sharia law government installed
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:16.060]  in in Libya this is this is always the way it goes any time and probably
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:23.580]  throughout history okay anytime the US gets involved either by applying external
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:29.140]  pressure on a country and I got many examples that I can tell you for that
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:36.140]  or is involved you know militarily or aiding or giving aid to some side of
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:41.780]  some kind of rebellion you almost always get an extremist a more extreme
[02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:47.660]  culture wake of that now Iran is a perfect example your viewers know and
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:55.100]  it's been documented in in Alex's films Mohammed Mosaddek Iran in 19 in the
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:59.780]  50s this was a this was a country where you go out into the streets of Tehran
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:07.100]  and you see most guys wearing gray suits trill be hats carrying briefcases very
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:11.740]  secular society you know on its way to becoming an advanced secular society
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:15.980]  and of course any time you see this and this is the same throughout Africa in
[02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:20.900]  the 50s and 60s you look at some of these cities that really had their glory
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:27.100]  days in the 50s and 60s a lot newly won independence and so forth and then
[02:40:27.100 --> 02:40:33.500]  comes then comes the West then comes the CIA who want to basically smash these
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:38.700]  countries into submission and prepare them to become debt slaves to the IMF
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:43.980]  and that cartel of banks that that gives out you know foreign aid to these
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:49.220]  kind of sort of countries Gaddafi was off the reservation completely he was
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:55.260]  running a completely solvent country had you know spending money on
[02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:59.020]  everything from health care they had the lowest infant mortality rate in Africa
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:06.740]  longest life expectancy in Africa had a British style NHS health care system you
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:12.980]  get interest free loan if you want to buy a house if you get married they give
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:17.380]  you ten thousand dollars or something like that and you know five thousand for
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:21.860]  each kid I can't remember the exact statistics but you think that the people
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:26.260]  of Libya are going to get that standard of living back do you think that they're
[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:31.140]  going to have a stability within their country domestic stability we're talking
[02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:36.100]  about in the national interests of Libyans not in the United States as
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:40.220]  national interest but Patrick we know this global empire is about disrupting
[02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:44.540]  stability it's about undermining that controlling through chaos and it's about
[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:48.340]  the grand chess board as Brzezinski calls it and the rest of it yes but I
[02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:51.300]  want to make sure people know that this is a talking point that has been
[02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:55.540]  orchestrated as if in a symphony without missing a beat immediately on the
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:42:01.580]  heels of Gaddafi's debt death CNN headline Syria Yemen opposition warned
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:06.420]  their dictators you are next you also have Senator Mark Rubio of Florida
[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:10.820]  mouthing off that hey you're next buddy to Assad we have McCain talking about
[02:42:10.820 --> 02:42:14.820]  military options in Syria whatever you think about these people individually
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:18.660]  this is a coordinated message that they're going to just move on down the
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:25.180]  map Patrick absolutely I mean look General West Wesley Clark gave an
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:32.460]  interview a few years ago I believe it's in 2009 or 2008 he was actually in in
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:37.500]  the in the Pentagon or in the State Department and he saw the memo back in
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:45.060]  in 2002 and it was a four or five step plan they're going to take down Iraq
[02:42:45.060 --> 02:42:52.380]  first then they're going to take down a series of countries which included
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:43:01.900]  Syria and Lebanon and finishing off with Iran okay so this is obviously been on
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:07.860]  the on the board for a long time they're getting a bit and Patrick I know a lot
[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:10.420]  of the listeners know what you're talking about long-time listeners but new
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:13.580]  listeners won't believe it we have that clip ready to go right now I had the
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:17.660]  same thing in my stack and curtain Emma wrote about it back in September 211
[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:22.740]  Libyan Syria the neocon plan to attack seven countries in five years obviously
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:27.420]  the timetable is not accurate but let's give that clip now Wesley Clark and then
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:31.860]  we attacked Afghanistan I was pretty happy about that we should have and then
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:34.700]  I came back to the Pentagon about six weeks later I saw the same officer I
[02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:38.980]  said why why haven't we attacked Iraq we still gonna attack Iraq he said all
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:45.860]  sorry he says it's worse than that he said he pulled up a piece of paper off
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:48.900]  his desk I just got this memo from the Secretary of Defense's office it says
[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:53.140]  we're gonna attack and destroy the governments in seven countries in five
[02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:57.740]  years we're gonna start with Iraq and then we're gonna move to Syria Lebanon
[02:43:57.740 --> 02:44:04.980]  Libya Somalia Sudan and Iran I seven seven countries in five years I said
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:10.700]  is that a classified memo he said yes sir I said well don't show it to me he was
[02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:15.660]  about to show it to me because I want to talk about it and I I sat on this
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:19.980]  information I for a long time for about six or eight months I was so stunned by
[02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:24.380]  this I couldn't begin to talk about it and I couldn't believe it would really
[02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:29.020]  be true but that's actually what happened these people took control of the
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:36.060]  policy in the United States and I realized then it came back to me a 1991
[02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:40.180]  meeting I had with Paul Wolfowitz you know in 2001 he was deputy Secretary
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:44.380]  Defense but in 1991 he was the undersecretary defense for policy it's a
[02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:48.260]  number three position in the Pentagon and I had gone to see him when I was a one
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:51.660]  star general I was commanding the National Training Center I had met him
[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:54.300]  one time he said if you ever get to Washington come look me up they always
[02:44:54.300 --> 02:44:57.460]  say that while I was there in Washington it was a Friday afternoon I'd visited
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:45:01.460]  Colombelle he'd give me five minutes of his precious time and sent me on my way
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:05.260]  and I was bored in the Pentagon and and I thought I'll just go who can I see I
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:09.820]  think I'll see Wolfowitz so I called and up there he was available scooter Libby
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:14.020]  came to the door I met scooter for the first time and he brought me in and I
[02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:19.500]  said to Paul I said and this is 1991 I said Mr. Secretary you must be pretty
[02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:24.540]  happy with the performance of the troops and in Desert Storm and he said well
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:28.980]  yeah he said but but not really he said because the truth is we should have
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:35.460]  gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and we didn't and this was just enough there's
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:39.220]  more of the clip of course and he goes on to say how Paul Wolfowitz told him
[02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:43.700]  they were gonna go to war with Iraq only 10 days after 9-11 for no good
[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:48.420]  reason and obviously Wolfowitz was part of so much from project for a new
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:53.220]  America since for a new American Century on down and they are seeking a global
[02:45:53.220 --> 02:45:56.860]  Empire Patrick I just want to bring into the conversation something called
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:02.420]  Spikeman's Rimblin and that is a grand chessboard style plan I don't know if we
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:06.180]  can show that on screen right now I know we have the graphic and there is a
[02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:11.180]  crescent for radio listeners there's a red breakdown throughout the map all the
[02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:16.260]  way from Eastern Europe through the Middle East on through Central Asia and
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:20.940]  over through China up through Japan and the rest of it and what this is is a
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:25.420]  tension zone it's a Hegelian dialectic plan to keep most of that region in
[02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:29.700]  turmoil in order to establish really what amounts to a global government
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:34.860]  Empire based on US imperialism and the reason that's important is because it
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:38.460]  clearly ties into everything we've seen with the Arab Spring even the stuff
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:42.540]  going in Africa how closely does that match all these hot zones and what they
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:47.460]  want to do is partition all these world powers China Russia the Africans fear
[02:46:47.460 --> 02:46:51.420]  they want to partition it so their powers can be as limited as possible so
[02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:55.860]  they can consolidate those regions into economic blocks later political blocks
[02:46:55.860 --> 02:47:00.540]  as they've done over the past 50 years it's all about global integration
[02:47:00.540 --> 02:47:05.860]  Patrick Enningson your response yeah I mean that that's absolutely correct and
[02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:09.740]  that this is the long this is a long-range plan is the with the long
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:15.780]  range goals and you know a lot of people that might be listening to this or
[02:47:15.780 --> 02:47:20.020]  watching this clip that are always skeptical about oh can use this
[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:24.740]  conspiracy theory it's another new world order conspiracy theory listen you can
[02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:30.100]  go into each and every think tank like the Rand Corporation or a dozens of
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:34.060]  others the ones who write these theoretical papers and the theoretical
[02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:38.020]  stages and then they advanced through the think tank system and sooner or
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:44.340]  later they're going to make it on to foreign policy table okay now the there's
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:48.660]  a kind of a Psyop as well in order to achieve this crest with all these
[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:55.900]  tension zones over Eurasia and Africa there's one of them a powerful Psyop
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:48:01.020]  that that is probably is no doubt I'm sure been written about in one of the
[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:06.060]  think tanks like the Rand Corporation or something like this is the Psyop is to
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:12.060]  create a Berlin Wall moment okay and this is what they're they've tried to
[02:48:12.060 --> 02:48:18.220]  achieve with the Arab Spring is to create this Berlin Wall moment for the
[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:24.460]  Middle East whereby all these dictators have been toppled one by one and it
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:28.620]  looks like this kind of organic phenomenon but you know you have to
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:33.300]  remind everybody out there that and this is a good quote from I believe from
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:37.740]  Michelle Chawwodowski from Global Research he said dictators do not
[02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:43.780]  dictate they follow orders okay and you have that across the board with
[02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:49.260]  everybody from Idi Amin right to the present day if there's any real genuine
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:54.180]  dictators out there there's a 99.9% chance that they're in the pay of the
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:49:00.300]  US government and are receiving foreign aid or buying arms from America or
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:07.060]  receiving big loans from the IMF those type of dictators or normally allied
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:11.980]  with Washington okay now you have these people they're calling dictators and you
[02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:17.420]  really can't be sure that they actually are look the Bathis Party which is the
[02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:24.060]  party that they obliterated in Iraq when they when they invaded Iraq in 2003
[02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:29.580]  they smashed the Bathis Party they took out and imprisoned anybody who was in
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:34.580]  the Bath Party this is just a typical kind of mafia intimidation like the
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:38.060]  Libyan rebels have done the first thing they did when they went out was just
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:43.260]  start terrorizing people any pro-Qadhafi supporters or people who worked for the
[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:46.700]  Qadhafi government they just go out and start terrorizing them they'd either go
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:51.940]  and loot their flats or they shoot them in cold blood or much worse reports have
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:56.540]  been made and what that does it achieves a kind of reign of terror and this is
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:01.660]  this is the kind of system that John Negroponte pioneered in places like
[02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:07.700]  El Salvador and Nicaragua and and that's what his protégé Robert Ford has
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:15.340]  rolled out ever since the last US ambassador that was pulled from Damascus
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:22.660]  was in 2005 right after the assassination of Rafiq Harari who was the
[02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:27.380]  Lebanese Prime Minister at the time was a very good guy by all accounts he was
[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:33.060]  assassinated by a massive car bomb on the Corniche down in on the coast in
[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:37.180]  near the water in the city of Beirut. Patrick we're coming up on the break

[02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:18.940]  but this is not the end of the story these globalists are not going to stop
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:23.740]  with their imperial overreach obviously Syria will just be the next
[02:54:23.740 --> 02:54:29.100]  domino or whatever country they choose to invade next on the path to Persia we
[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:33.820]  have reports about all the different ways they've planned to circumvent Iran
[02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:37.780]  rather than going to war with it directly obviously they want key allies
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:42.780]  like Syria and Hezbollah to be under bay or a check one way or another before
[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:47.820]  they take the big apple the bite of the big apple they have a hit list we know
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:51.060]  that we just played the Wesley Clark clip where they talk about the seven
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.220]  countries they plan to invade we know there's an IMF and central bank strategy
[02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:59.620]  and we are on with Patrick Henningson info wars com reporter and we are
[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:04.740]  breaking down these lies now Patrick we know there were deceptions about the
[02:55:04.740 --> 02:55:08.540]  Libyan rebels being ordinary people Hillary just last week said it was the
[02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:13.340]  work of ordinary Libyans that killed Gaddafi and and there's lies to about
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:17.380]  Syria help us break those down because I've got a Tony Carter Lucci report where
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:21.380]  it breaks down repeatedly the use of the Orwellian term that the Syrian
[02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:27.220]  protesters were quote mostly unarmed when in fact they were armed by the West to
[02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:32.780]  challenge Assad yeah I you know I'll comment on that but it's very important
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:38.260]  that you listeners understand and the Americans who have brains pay
[02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:44.780]  attention and understand how and when this whole operation began in 2005 the
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:50.420]  US recalled its ambassador in Damascus immediately after the assassination in
[02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:55.380]  Beirut of the Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Harari okay which was blamed with
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:56:01.340]  no evidence purely on like a hearsay and a talking point that that the Syrian the
[02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:06.380]  Assad government was responsible for Harari's assassination which there's no
[02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:11.700]  grounds and no proof at all now if we look now in 2011 we look back at that
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:20.580]  situation in 2005 and it's quite clear that the motive and the ability was by
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:26.060]  the United States the United States is documented is known to be funding that
[02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:35.060]  from the State Department anti Assad anti Assad political groups and okay
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:39.860]  we've been meddling in their affairs their domestic affairs for a few years
[02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:44.860]  now okay this is the climax of it now we're coming into the
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:49.660]  coming people gave version now we're coming to the actual game and you see a
[02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:53.580]  lot of talking points a big one that's been pushed all over the media worldwide
[02:56:53.580 --> 02:57:00.220]  is this term a dissent dissident soldiers who are apparently allegedly
[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:05.940]  soldiers who have turned coat away from the Syrian ruling government and have
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:12.620]  joined these rebel groups now I have yet to to to see really compelling
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:16.500]  evidence that this is actually the case what you do have and what you did have
[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:22.860]  in places like Iraq and places like Central America is you have proof of the
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:28.780]  US backing these bogus gorillas who are basically dressed in military uniforms
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:33.940]  and go out shooting people and that's a that's a clear false flag technique
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:38.500]  that's used to create internal strife and to get people fighting against each
[02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:43.740]  other that look just like when the US entered Iraq in 2003 there were no
[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:50.860]  natural divisions and warring factions that had Sunnis and Shiites shooting up
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:55.140]  each other it didn't exist what the US did was they came in they put in the
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:59.700]  powerful talking point in their sort of divide and rule strategy which is that
[02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:04.740]  Shia's and Sunnis don't get along and there's you know there's Iraq had more
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:09.780]  tribal rivalries than religious so there's one thing Saddam Hussein did is
[02:58:09.780 --> 02:58:15.140]  he kept the place he kept his house in order with regards to a rival
[02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:17.860]  we had to cut it there Patrick because we're coming up on the end of the
[02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:21.580]  broadcast but it's true anyways slice it they have ousted the secular
[02:58:21.580 --> 02:58:25.140]  governments and increasingly brought in the radical you have to assume there's
[02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:29.420]  a strategy in the region a region for that stay tuned tonight's the Info Wars
