[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:14.160 --> 00:16.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:16.760 --> 00:22.760]  I'm going to talk about the 18 seconds loss on escalating trade war with China.
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.760]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.760]  Why not?
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.760]  Second loss.
[00:25.760 --> 00:26.760]  Minus what?
[00:26.760 --> 00:27.760]  Minus what?
[00:27.760 --> 00:28.760]  You have second thoughts about escalating war.
[00:28.760 --> 00:29.760]  Second thoughts about everything.
[00:29.760 --> 00:30.760]  Are you going to declare a national emergency on the planet?
[00:30.760 --> 00:31.760]  Well, I have the right to if I want.
[00:31.760 --> 00:32.760]  I could declare a national emergency.
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.760]  I think when they steal and take out intellectual property theft anywhere from $300 billion to
[00:34.760 --> 00:39.760]  $500 billion a year, and we have a total loss of almost $1 trillion a year, for many years
[00:39.760 --> 00:40.760]  this has been going on.
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.760]  In many ways it's an emergency.
[00:41.760 --> 00:42.760]  I have no plan right now.
[00:42.760 --> 00:43.760]  Actually, we're getting along very well with China right now.
[00:43.760 --> 00:44.760]  We're talking.
[00:44.760 --> 01:00.760]  I think they want to make a deal much more than I do.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.760]  I'm getting a lot of money in tariffs.
[01:02.760 --> 01:04.760]  It's coming in by the billions.
[01:04.760 --> 01:06.760]  We never got 10 cents from China.
[01:06.760 --> 01:32.760]  So we'll see what happens, but we are talking to China very seriously.
[01:32.760 --> 01:34.760]  Well, I didn't used to have this problem.
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.760]  20 years ago, 25 years ago on air, I had plenty to cover.
[01:40.760 --> 01:44.760]  But my head wasn't spinning at the start of each broadcast like it is right now.
[01:44.760 --> 01:46.760]  Where to start?
[01:46.760 --> 01:48.760]  Where to begin?
[01:48.760 --> 01:55.760]  I think the biggest thing we're looking at right now is just the abject absurdity.
[01:55.760 --> 01:58.760]  Really, the word is absurd.
[01:58.760 --> 02:07.760]  That the corporate media in this country and around the world is openly citing against
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.760]  capitalism and against our own nations and against our president and with the communist
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.760]  Chinese.
[02:14.760 --> 02:26.760]  And to add insult to injury are running around trying to dynamite our economy publicly and
[02:26.760 --> 02:36.760]  admitting they are and saying that they're doing it to punish us for supporting Trump.
[02:36.760 --> 02:39.760]  That's called economic terrorism.
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.760]  So I was trying to come up with a headline just minutes ago as we were going live.
[02:44.760 --> 02:50.760]  We always put an article out that has the live audio and video feed in it that kind of states
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.760]  what the main focus.
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.760]  How like Drudge will have a big banner headline about what he thinks is most important.
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.760]  I usually agree with you folks like Drudge.
[03:01.760 --> 03:07.760]  But if you just pull back from all of this, how do you come up with a headline strong enough?
[03:07.760 --> 03:10.760]  Economic terrorism.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.760]  Exclamation point.
[03:12.760 --> 03:21.760]  MSM sides with China against America at G7.
[03:21.760 --> 03:28.760]  But then that's not even strong enough because then they're also running around trying to
[03:28.760 --> 03:31.760]  plunge the economy while they're doing that.
[03:31.760 --> 03:39.760]  Siding with the foreign power, most authoritarian country in world history, doubling the highest
[03:39.760 --> 03:41.760]  kill rates of anybody else.
[03:41.760 --> 03:43.760]  At least double.
[03:43.760 --> 03:47.760]  Tripling or quadrupling or what Hitler killed.
[03:47.760 --> 03:51.760]  Doubling what all the other Soviets killed, conservatively.
[03:51.760 --> 03:52.760]  It's not debated.
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.760]  The Chai comms admit it.
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.760]  They call this 80 million killed under Mao a mistake.
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.760]  Oh, we went a little too far.
[04:03.760 --> 04:06.760]  Most of them just innocent farmers.
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.760]  There was a big dream.
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.760]  David Rockefeller was working with Mao on it.
[04:11.760 --> 04:15.760]  Wrote articles in the New York Times bragging how he helped put Mao to tongue in power.
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.760]  So I just sit back and I see all the stacks of news bashing Christians, bashing conservatives,
[04:21.760 --> 04:28.760]  bashing veterans, bashing capitalism, bashing America, bashing Jesus Christ.
[04:28.760 --> 04:31.760]  And it's really all just par for the course, isn't it?
[04:31.760 --> 04:38.760]  It's really all of this because you got all these corporate interests out of China that
[04:38.760 --> 04:41.760]  thought they had America that thought we were captured.
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.760]  Now we're coming back from the dead and they're crapping all over themselves.
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.760]  That's why it's hard for me to criticize Trump even though he's got some big problems.
[04:49.760 --> 04:54.760]  Because he's for real and his enemies are real and they're your enemies.
[04:54.760 --> 04:55.760]  They're my enemies.
[04:55.760 --> 05:22.760]  They're my enemies.
[05:22.760 --> 05:47.760]  Thank you.
[05:47.760 --> 06:13.760]  Thank you.
[06:17.760 --> 06:30.760]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.760 --> 06:36.760]  And despite all the globalist's best actions, we are still on air in defiance to their tyranny.
[06:36.760 --> 06:47.760]  It is, Monday, August 26, 2019, our very existence is an outrage to tyrants and criminals and child molesters everywhere.
[06:47.760 --> 06:57.760]  We believe in a pro-human future, but I've got a whole flotilla of mainstream news saying the human era is over.
[06:57.760 --> 07:06.760]  Well, the very same globalist, the CFR, said that the Chinese century, the communist century, was here.
[07:06.760 --> 07:12.760]  That America was done, but not so fast, my friends.
[07:12.760 --> 07:15.760]  Okay.
[07:15.760 --> 07:16.760]  Here's the big takeaway.
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.760]  And Trump's out there saying the truth, telling it like it is.
[07:21.760 --> 07:22.760]  It's treason.
[07:22.760 --> 07:23.760]  But it's more than that.
[07:23.760 --> 07:24.760]  It's economic terrorism.
[07:24.760 --> 07:37.760]  We have the entire corporate media and their cheerleaders in late night so-called comedy that poses newsmen from Stephen Colbert to Bill Maher,
[07:37.760 --> 07:43.760]  running around foaming at the mouth saying, we're going into recession.
[07:43.760 --> 07:44.760]  It's all over.
[07:44.760 --> 07:45.760]  Run for the hill.
[07:45.760 --> 07:47.760]  Slitch your wrist and jump off a cliff.
[07:47.760 --> 07:48.760]  The bubble's too big.
[07:48.760 --> 07:54.760]  Look at the size of that thing.
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.760]  And then you pull back and really assess what's going on.
[07:58.760 --> 08:13.760]  And then you see MSM, the fake news, the enemy of the people at the G7 in France, openly shiting with all these foreign governments and the Chai comms
[08:13.760 --> 08:21.760]  and Iran against the United States.
[08:21.760 --> 08:30.760]  So they're not just cheerleading and running around creating hysteria to try to crash the stock market.
[08:30.760 --> 08:33.760]  That's economic terrorism.
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.760]  They're doing it with a foreign government and a combine of corporations in coordination.
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.760]  That's called economic warfare.
[08:41.760 --> 08:46.760]  So they're using economic terrorism for foreign powers in economic warfare.
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.760]  That's not hyperbole.
[08:48.760 --> 08:50.760]  That is the definition.
[08:50.760 --> 09:00.760]  Then they've got political terrorism going on saying that if you don't vote Democrat and if you don't vote Trump out, we're going to bully you.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.760]  We're going to physically attack you.
[09:02.760 --> 09:04.760]  We're not going to let you sit in a restaurant.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.760]  We're not going to let you drive down the street.
[09:06.760 --> 09:07.760]  We're going to key your car.
[09:07.760 --> 09:10.760]  We're going to fire you from your job.
[09:10.760 --> 09:13.760]  We're going to hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.760]  And the rhetoric is only getting more insane.
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.760]  So Trump has come out and tweeted about this.
[09:22.760 --> 09:24.760]  He's talked about this.
[09:24.760 --> 09:32.760]  And then real clear politics and others ask, well, can the mainstream media crash the economy?
[09:32.760 --> 09:34.760]  Well, they're sure as hell trying.
[09:34.760 --> 09:37.760]  Now, let's explain something.
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.760]  It's true that we're on top of bubble.
[09:39.760 --> 09:45.760]  Our bubble is about one-tenth, depending on what the angles you look at, that of the chicoms.
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.760]  The chicoms totally rigged our economy.
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.760]  They totally devalue their currency.
[09:49.760 --> 09:53.760]  Ten times worse than us, like Mexico did back in the 1980s.
[09:53.760 --> 09:56.760]  And then you know what happened to Peso.
[09:56.760 --> 09:58.760]  It's about at a Mexican level of devaluation.
[09:58.760 --> 10:02.760]  It's not as bad as Zimbabwe or the Germans with my republic.
[10:02.760 --> 10:04.760]  It's about what the Mexicans did.
[10:04.760 --> 10:09.760]  Now, the difference is the Mexicans didn't have a giant military and 1.5 billion people
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.760]  and didn't own our debt and didn't own Hollywood.
[10:13.760 --> 10:14.760]  You don't believe that.
[10:14.760 --> 10:15.760]  Just look up.
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.760]  China now owns the controlling interest in all the big six production companies.
[10:19.760 --> 10:28.760]  And of course, the Mexicans weren't waging an open war with us and they weren't anti-Western
[10:28.760 --> 10:31.760]  because there's a Spanish ethos that's European and Mexico.
[10:31.760 --> 10:39.760]  But when you have China, you have formidable power that's the biggest mass murderer in history.
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.760]  But because they have a devalued currency, they're very weak.
[10:44.760 --> 10:50.760]  But they still have all this military prowess and we're dependent on all their slave goods.
[10:50.760 --> 10:59.760]  But as soon as Trump calls that card, as soon as he calls that bluff, as soon as he exposes
[10:59.760 --> 11:04.760]  that the emperor is not wearing any clothes, as soon as he calls them out, it's over.
[11:04.760 --> 11:05.760]  And he's doing it.
[11:05.760 --> 11:08.760]  We hold all the cards as President Trump has said over and over again.
[11:08.760 --> 11:09.760]  And it's true.
[11:09.760 --> 11:15.760]  Except we have a dumbed-down, decadent, snot-nosed population, at least 30 percent in the studies,
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.760]  the real numbers, 30 percent are foaming at the mouth Democrat crazies.
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.760]  Another 35, 40 percent aren't politically involved and are just kind of in la-la land
[11:24.760 --> 11:29.760]  and he got another 30 percent fighting for our lives and winning.
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.760]  But I want everybody just to pull back.
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.760]  If you're a radio listener, especially while I'm talking, they're putting up The Economist,
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.760]  oh, Mother of the Rothschilds, they're putting up The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
[11:42.760 --> 11:47.760]  talking about how America sucks and it's all over for us and how we need to totally not
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.760]  invest in America and invest in China.
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.760]  And that same thing comes out of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, and all these globalist
[11:55.760 --> 11:56.760]  publications.
[11:56.760 --> 11:58.760]  And it's not true.
[11:58.760 --> 12:01.760]  China has tens of thousands of riots a year.
[12:01.760 --> 12:03.760]  China is oppressing its people.
[12:03.760 --> 12:06.760]  China doesn't have any raw resources inside their country.
[12:06.760 --> 12:12.760]  China is trying to expand and is surrounded by enemies, India and South Korea and Japan,
[12:12.760 --> 12:15.760]  who aren't going to put up with their crap.
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.760]  Philippines is going to put up with it.
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.760]  And so China is trying to be expansionist because their empire is failing.
[12:22.760 --> 12:26.760]  Just like the Japanese, this is all a repeat of the beginning of World War II, was expanding
[12:26.760 --> 12:33.760]  because they had a bunch of hubris and wanted to dominate, but they didn't have the resources.
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.760]  China has been given the resources.
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.760]  They've been given a global monopoly on the extraction of rarest minerals by global corporate
[12:43.760 --> 12:44.760]  boards, the WTO.
[12:44.760 --> 12:48.760]  They have been spoon fed.
[12:48.760 --> 12:49.760]  They have been built up.
[12:49.760 --> 13:02.760]  They have been developed as the supposed champion of the world.
[13:02.760 --> 13:03.760]  And they're not.
[13:03.760 --> 13:04.760]  They are a paper dragon.
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.760]  They have a lot of really great, hardworking people that are enslaved by it.
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.760]  But you look at the Taiwanese and the folks in Hong Kong, beautiful, smart, informed, dynamic
[13:14.760 --> 13:20.760]  people amongst the per capita most successful people in the world when they're turned loose
[13:20.760 --> 13:27.760]  and given some basic freedom.
[13:27.760 --> 13:30.760]  You look at the demeanor of the people in the mainland versus the demeanor of the people
[13:30.760 --> 13:32.760]  in Hong Kong or Taiwan each night and day.
[13:32.760 --> 13:38.760]  And so their grandparents and parents were run out of China by a dictator, by a murdering
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.760]  red terror that took over in 1949, but then killed 115 million mainline Chinese.
[13:44.760 --> 13:49.760]  You better believe they've got a reason to be standing up and tearing down surveillance
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.760]  light poles and fighting the police and taking over government buildings effectively because
[13:54.760 --> 14:02.760]  they're passing laws to secretly arrest them and to get rid of their representative republic.
[14:02.760 --> 14:07.760]  And I see some of the establishment lefties commenting on infowars.com and newswars.com
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.760]  and prisonplanet.com are saying, oh, Jones claims he's anti-war.
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.760]  But look, he's backing regime change in Hong Kong.
[14:14.760 --> 14:16.760]  I'm not backing regime change.
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.760]  The chai comms are overthrowing the government and the system and have already put their
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.760]  government in that's now dissolving the freedoms those people fought for.
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.760]  And I won't stand here and watch another 7 million people turned over to the chai comms
[14:31.760 --> 14:35.760]  to be rendered down and robbed.
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.760]  And God bless our president for running a pincer attack against the chai comms because they
[14:40.760 --> 14:44.760]  started all this South China Sea and taking over all these islands and attacking Vietnam
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.760]  and all this crap show the Indians have been turned loose to take back 20% of their country
[14:50.760 --> 14:53.760]  that the Pakistan and the chai comms are taking over.
[14:53.760 --> 14:55.760]  That's theirs.
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.760]  The chai comms made them pass laws along with the UN that Hindus can't immigrate back to
[15:00.760 --> 15:03.760]  where they were run out of by the Muslims.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.760]  Imagine that.
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.760]  They had a UN agreement that Indians that were indigenous basically had to leave and couldn't
[15:11.760 --> 15:12.760]  come back.
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.760]  So Trump's turned Modi loose and now he's turning Hong Kong and Taiwan loose and selling
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.760]  weapons to Taiwan and selling weapons to Japan and weapons to South Korea and telling the
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.760]  chai comms and the CFR and the globalists that thought the American century was over
[15:26.760 --> 15:32.760]  that you miscalculated and that's not happening.
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.760]  So in response the traitorous global media, foreign owned, chai comm owned is flooding
[15:38.760 --> 15:42.760]  in trying to cause race wars, death destruction, imploding our economy and everyone remember
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.760]  that the people that sided with this are openly working with foreign enemies.
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.760]  CNN now says Trump has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[15:52.760 --> 15:55.760]  That is the moon is made of green cheese level live.
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.760]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[15:57.760 --> 16:01.760]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.760]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:06.760 --> 16:08.760]  at heart and body extract.
[16:08.760 --> 16:11.760]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:11.760 --> 16:12.760]  Don't just take my word for it.

[18:58.760 --> 19:04.760]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic was in trouble in the future,
[19:04.760 --> 19:08.760]  it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[19:08.760 --> 19:11.760]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.760]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.760]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[19:20.760 --> 19:25.760]  And what he's doing in this trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers, that's beautiful.
[19:25.760 --> 19:29.760]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.760]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate people
[19:34.760 --> 19:37.760]  and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[19:37.760 --> 19:39.760]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.760]  The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[19:43.760 --> 19:46.760]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links,
[19:46.760 --> 19:52.760]  because we are the light, the dark of the night, we are the resistance, we are 1776 worldwide.
[20:47.760 --> 20:54.760]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this Monday edition of The Transmission.
[20:54.760 --> 20:58.760]  Now, we played this clip yesterday on the Sunday Transmission,
[20:58.760 --> 21:04.760]  but I'm going to play it again right now because it illustrates everything insane that we're dealing with.
[21:04.760 --> 21:12.760]  And then if you think that this is an insane clip, we're going to play an even bigger live,
[21:12.760 --> 21:21.760]  because I was sitting back yesterday thinking, is this the biggest lie CNN has ever told?
[21:21.760 --> 21:35.760]  Yes, it probably is, but it's only rivaled by one other lie that the same show told Brian Stelter last year.
[21:35.760 --> 21:41.760]  And that was that ratings don't matter.
[21:41.760 --> 21:44.760]  So we're going to be playing that secondarily, but listen to this.
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.760]  It's on infowars.com.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.760]  It's on newswars.com.
[21:48.760 --> 22:01.760]  Wow. CNN guest says Trump murdered many more millions of people than Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[22:01.760 --> 22:09.760]  He had a truly insane lying guest on psychiatrist Alan Francis.
[22:09.760 --> 22:16.760]  And he said Hitler has not even as bad as Trump, not other dictators throughout history.
[22:16.760 --> 22:22.760]  Trump may have killed more.
[22:22.760 --> 22:26.760]  Now, Trump is trying to pull us out of Afghanistan.
[22:26.760 --> 22:28.760]  He's pulled us out of Syria.
[22:28.760 --> 22:30.760]  He's trying to pull troops back to the U.S.
[22:30.760 --> 22:33.760]  He's trying to increase their pay, which he has.
[22:33.760 --> 22:40.760]  He's trying to end the 70-year, almost 70-year conflict with North Korea.
[22:40.760 --> 22:49.760]  And he's done a way better job than Barack Obama or anybody for 50 years has done trying to de-escalate things.
[22:49.760 --> 22:55.760]  So for this statement to be made, it is a total inversion of reality.
[22:55.760 --> 23:01.760]  But we've been asking how much worse is the rhetoric going to get that he's a Nazi, that he's killing kids at the border?
[23:01.760 --> 23:03.760]  None of that's true.
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.760]  They're drinking out of toilets.
[23:05.760 --> 23:08.760]  He says all Mexicans are criminals.
[23:08.760 --> 23:10.760]  Never said any of that.
[23:10.760 --> 23:18.760]  And so now the new whopper, you know it's a talking point, because they've already been saying Trump's a dictator.
[23:18.760 --> 23:24.760]  No, it's Hillary that ignored the primaries when Bernie was winning.
[23:24.760 --> 23:26.760]  It's the superdelegates that did that.
[23:26.760 --> 23:29.760]  If she would have won, she would have gotten there by dictatorial aims.
[23:29.760 --> 23:36.760]  So again, they continue to project what they are on to everyone else.
[23:36.760 --> 23:39.760]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[23:39.760 --> 23:45.760]  Well, I think that medicalizing politics has three very dire consequences.
[23:45.760 --> 23:49.760]  The first is that it stigmatizes the mentally ill.
[23:49.760 --> 23:55.760]  I've known thousands of patients, almost all of them, have been well-behaved, well-mannered, good people.
[23:55.760 --> 23:57.760]  Trump is none of these.
[23:57.760 --> 24:02.760]  Lumping the mentally ill with Trump is a terrible insult to the mentally ill,
[24:02.760 --> 24:05.760]  and they have enough problems in Sigma as it is.
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.760]  The second issue is that calling Trump crazy hides the fact that we're crazy for having elected him,
[24:11.760 --> 24:16.760]  and even crazier for allowing his crazy policies to persist.
[24:16.760 --> 24:23.760]  Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century.
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.760]  He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.
[24:27.760 --> 24:34.760]  He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person.
[24:34.760 --> 24:41.760]  So they tried to get a psychiatrist on, a leftist, to violate their own policies, their own rules.
[24:41.760 --> 24:45.760]  They can be removed by the medical board from their quack position.
[24:45.760 --> 24:53.760]  If they engage in diagnosing from afar, without at least three consultations, testing, and meetings,
[24:53.760 --> 24:58.760]  and of course, that is the Goldwater rule, but instead he just veered off and said,
[24:58.760 --> 25:05.760]  no, no, no, this individual, ladies and gentlemen, is worse than mass murdering dictators.
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.760]  In fact, he's killed more people.
[25:07.760 --> 25:10.760]  That's quite a whopper, but I've got one even bigger.
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.760]  Jimmy Dorp, who's a liberal, but really smart guy, and if more leftists were like that guy,
[25:16.760 --> 25:18.760]  they might actually get people elected.
[25:18.760 --> 25:20.760]  He made some great points, the comedian did.
[25:20.760 --> 25:23.760]  He's also spit on me before in public, but that's okay.
[25:23.760 --> 25:30.760]  Here's Jimmy Dorp pointing out that Brian Stelter is the biggest fraud the planet's ever seen.
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.760]  This was Brian Stelter's show, where this was just being said that Trump has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[25:36.760 --> 25:37.760]  Here it is.
[25:37.760 --> 25:40.760]  Hang on, I want to show you this.
[25:40.760 --> 25:42.760]  Oh, I don't know.
[25:46.760 --> 25:53.760]  So this guy's talking with Ted Koppel, and Ted Koppel tells him because they all try to pretend they hate Trump,
[25:53.760 --> 25:57.760]  but they love Trump because he gives them a lot more money and they all make it.
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.760]  And remember the comedian that the correspondent center said,
[26:01.760 --> 26:06.760]  you guys should give him some of your money that you're making off of him because Trump doesn't have any money.
[26:06.760 --> 26:08.760]  He's broke. Remember when she said that?
[26:08.760 --> 26:10.760]  So Ted Koppel is going to say that to Brian Stelter.
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.760]  By the way, he hosts that show Reliable Sources, in case you didn't know who that was.
[26:14.760 --> 26:17.760]  And so here, let's watch this.
[26:17.760 --> 26:19.760]  Money, money, money.
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.760]  Donald Trump has been very, very good for baseball.
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.760]  He has been wonderful for the industry.
[26:27.760 --> 26:33.760]  Your boss acknowledged as much a number of months ago during the campaign.
[26:33.760 --> 26:36.760]  It was Les Mondevans who acknowledged it.
[26:36.760 --> 26:40.760]  Les Mondevans also acknowledged it, but so did the head of CNN.
[26:40.760 --> 26:42.760]  But that means what?
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.760]  If ratings are up, that means what?
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.760]  If ratings are up, Brian Stelter gets his get a box to get educated on how media works. Here we go.
[26:55.760 --> 26:59.760]  Oh, the ratings are up. It means you can't do without Donald Trump.
[26:59.760 --> 27:02.760]  You would be lost without Donald Trump.
[27:02.760 --> 27:05.760]  Ted, you know that's not true.
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.760]  Reliable sources. Just told you.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.760]  Here we go.
[27:17.760 --> 27:19.760]  Here we go. Watch it. Play dumb.
[27:19.760 --> 27:21.760]  It's not true. You're playing for laughs.
[27:21.760 --> 27:23.760]  You've lived through enough presidencies to know.
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.760]  Hold on a second, Brian.
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.760]  What were the ratings before Trump and what are the ratings now?
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.760]  I would say we might be up 20. We might be up 30%. We might be up 40%.
[27:33.760 --> 27:35.760]  We might be up 30, 40, 50.
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.760]  I don't know. I don't know.
[27:37.760 --> 27:39.760]  Specifics aren't important to me. I'm a journalist.
[27:39.760 --> 27:42.760]  Maybe the numbers I don't know about that are higher.
[27:42.760 --> 27:45.760]  Maybe 40, 50, 60. It doesn't matter. It's a media company.
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.760]  We don't care about money.
[27:50.760 --> 27:53.760]  If we go back down 40%, that's okay too.
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.760]  Oh!
[27:55.760 --> 27:59.760]  Look at how officious he is. How into himself.
[27:59.760 --> 28:01.760]  How self-satisfied.
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.760]  And Brian Stelter tries to act like he's this big powerful man.
[28:04.760 --> 28:06.760]  He puts on this fake demeanor.
[28:06.760 --> 28:11.760]  I mean, say one about Ted Koppel. He's got a lot of presence.
[28:11.760 --> 28:14.760]  Brian Stelter is no Ted Koppel.
[28:14.760 --> 28:16.760]  It's pathetic.
[28:16.760 --> 28:19.760]  But again, he's the little media analyst from the New York Times.
[28:19.760 --> 28:21.760]  All these know-it-alls.
[28:21.760 --> 28:25.760]  You ever seen that particular New York Times reporter?
[28:25.760 --> 28:27.760]  I forget her name.
[28:27.760 --> 28:29.760]  When she was on Joe Rogan last year.
[28:29.760 --> 28:31.760]  And Joe just starts asking her questions.
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.760]  When she calls one of the Democrat candidates a toadie of Assad.
[28:36.760 --> 28:38.760]  And then he just, well, what's a toadie?
[28:38.760 --> 28:40.760]  I don't know what that word means.
[28:40.760 --> 28:43.760]  These people are, again, paper tigers.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.760]  Paper dragons, allies of the Chai Khoms.
[28:46.760 --> 28:50.760]  We'll break more of that down and hit a ton of other critical news.
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.760]  There's not much to tell you right now on the other side.
[28:53.760 --> 28:55.760]  Whatever you do, spread the links.
[28:55.760 --> 29:21.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[29:21.760 --> 29:47.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[29:47.760 --> 29:57.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[30:17.760 --> 30:45.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[30:45.760 --> 30:57.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[31:15.760 --> 31:44.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[31:44.760 --> 31:54.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[32:14.760 --> 32:43.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[32:43.760 --> 33:08.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[33:08.760 --> 33:23.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[33:23.760 --> 33:49.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[33:49.760 --> 33:59.760]  I'm Brian Stelter.
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.760]  Hong Kong protesters wave the American flag in their marches.
[34:03.760 --> 34:26.760]  Why are you all holding the American flag today for this protest?
[34:26.760 --> 34:36.760]  Saturday's protests in Hong Kong was about standing against Chai Khoms facial recognition and the social credit score system.
[34:36.760 --> 34:40.760]  And they used the Pepe the Frog meme as a symbol of freedom.
[34:40.760 --> 34:42.760]  What does Pepe the Frog mean to your movement?
[34:42.760 --> 34:53.760]  Actually, we think that it is a kind of sticker that is well known and easy to spread for people to know more about what this protest means and what we are doing now.
[34:53.760 --> 35:00.760]  Have you heard that in America, a lot of the mainstream media in the left are actually saying that this is a racist symbol for some reason?
[35:00.760 --> 35:17.760]  Yeah, I know this in the recent days, but I think that the creator of the Pepe has come out and speak for us that we are not representing the left society but represent the Hong Kong people.
[35:17.760 --> 35:20.760]  Yeah, and freedom I would say too. It's almost the exact opposite.
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.760]  Thank you for talking to me. Do you have anything else you'd like to say to our audience in America in the world?
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.760]  Hong Kong people never give up.
[35:28.760 --> 35:38.760]  After the march officially ended, police in riot gear began clearing the streets and many Hong Kongers stayed to provoke them.
[35:38.760 --> 35:54.760]  What do you want to say to our audience in America?
[36:08.760 --> 36:18.760]  Again, this is just some of the dramatic footage that is posted on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[36:18.760 --> 36:33.760]  It's not really for radio, but I wanted to play a few minutes of this because it just shows the dramatic fight for people that don't want to be taken over by the communist Chinese and have their elected government removed by them and have laws passed where they can be extradited.
[36:33.760 --> 36:43.760]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to get into a really important story dealing with another false flag that's been committed in this country and that should admit it false flag.
[36:43.760 --> 36:53.760]  They're not denying that this is a false flag. They're not denying that this has been done, though they're trying to keep it under wraps like Jesse Smollett.
[36:53.760 --> 37:07.760]  In this whole culture of victimization, people are more and more and more obsessed with playing the part of victims. It's the basic breakdown of society.
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.760]  I wanted to get to some really important reports that illustrate what we were talking about earlier.
[37:13.760 --> 37:17.760]  That's the clip we're going to go to in a moment. That's clip number seven.
[37:17.760 --> 37:28.760]  Trump uses G7 to take care of business, a John Bowne report, because that ties into what I was detailing earlier.
[37:28.760 --> 37:36.760]  And that deals with the fact that our media is not our media. It's owned by multinational corporations.
[37:36.760 --> 37:47.760]  The Chai Coms, a consortium of very ruthless corporations that see their fellow humans as unconscious animals that are being rendered down and removed and made obsolete.
[37:47.760 --> 37:55.760]  Here's a headline out of NBC News today. Chai Borgs will replace humans and remake the world. That's what they're saying everywhere.
[37:55.760 --> 38:05.760]  That's the message, lay down, give up, die. It's all over. A lot of folks are receiving that message, at least subconsciously, and deciding to do just that.
[38:05.760 --> 38:12.760]  Now, continuing here, it's not just that the media is siding against the U.S. with the Chai Coms.
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.760]  They're openly cheerleading again to plunge the U.S. economy.
[38:16.760 --> 38:26.760]  So here's that report. Trump uses G7 to take care of business, and our own media says that he's doing a bad job, that he's going to kill the economy, that everything's falling apart.
[38:26.760 --> 38:36.760]  It just shows how much our basic instinct to defend our country, especially when we have a president that's clearly working in our interest against authoritarian groups that have used us.
[38:36.760 --> 38:46.760]  The fact that we won't even fight against that, a large portion of us won't fight against that, really shows that we've had our basic instincts turned off.
[38:46.760 --> 38:56.760]  They met in Bajard, France, an ancient southwestern French Basque whaling town just 22 miles across the Bay of Biscay from Spain.
[38:56.760 --> 39:10.760]  Or at least that's what the massively unpopular French President Emmanuel Macron was diligently distracting the world leaders with at the beginning of the G7 while his police swept the quiet coastline for mines.
[39:10.760 --> 39:17.760]  Macron didn't want to mention his 32% approval rating or the G7 protests within miles of the summit.
[39:17.760 --> 39:28.760]  No mention of the now 11 months of yellow vest protests that have turned the country upside down, but that didn't stop Russian President Putin from reminding Macron.
[39:28.760 --> 39:39.760]  The events linked to the so-called yellow vests, during which, according to our calculations, 11 people were killed and 2,500 injured, including 2,000 police officers.
[39:39.760 --> 39:49.760]  We wouldn't want such events to take place in the Russian capital, and we'll do all we can to ensure our domestic political situation evolves strictly in the framework of the law.
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.760]  Macron said the comparison with France was inaccurate.
[39:53.760 --> 40:04.760]  And as Macron blathered on about his own vulgar incompetence, back at the adult table, President Trump and English Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked about the future of Brexit.
[40:04.760 --> 40:11.760]  How bad do you think you can only make a radio? Pretty quickly. We're not anticipating the problems.
[40:11.760 --> 40:20.760]  Before we were sort of stymied, well, I was stymied by the other side because nothing got done on the other side of you, as you've seen from Brexit.
[40:20.760 --> 40:26.760]  This is a different person, and this is a person that's going to be a great Prime Minister in my opinion.
[40:26.760 --> 40:43.760]  Boris Johnson, in my opinion. I have memories of American trade negotiations in the past that have incredible respect for U.S. trade conditions.
[40:43.760 --> 40:52.760]  And then President Trump unleashed the undeniable truth of China's economic stranglehold on the United States and drew a line in the sand.
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.760]  Do you have second thoughts about that radio? I have second thoughts about everything.
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.760]  Are you going to declare a national emergency on China?
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.760]  Well, I have the right to, if I want, I could declare a national emergency.
[41:02.760 --> 41:12.760]  I think when they steal and take out intellectual property theft anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion dollars a year,
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.760]  and when we have a total loss of almost a trillion dollars a year, for many years this would be going on.
[41:17.760 --> 41:22.760]  Thank you very much. We've been working on a deal with Japan for a long time.
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.760]  It involves agricultural and it involves e-commerce and many other things.
[41:27.760 --> 41:36.760]  It's a very big transaction, and we've agreed in principle. It's billions and billions of dollars. Tremendous for the farmers.
[41:36.760 --> 41:40.760]  Quite frankly, around the table, there's a lot of people wanting to make trade deals with each other.
[41:40.760 --> 41:47.760]  We have a deal that we were able to negotiate this good for our workers, for our citizens, good for the middle class.
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.760]  Macron proved he could be a good host and pointed the coast of Spain for all of his guests.
[41:52.760 --> 42:01.760]  But more importantly, Macron solidified his utter failure as a global leader and a historically detested president of France.
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.760]  John Bowne reporting.
[42:06.760 --> 42:14.760]  Now, there are many other very important, informative reports on newswars.com and infowars.com, just like that one.
[42:14.760 --> 42:24.760]  So many by Millie Weaver and by Harrison Smith and people like Caitlin Bennett and Paul Joseph Watson,
[42:24.760 --> 42:27.760]  that it does, again, boggle the mind.
[42:27.760 --> 42:33.760]  And when you go out and you get those clips and you email those and you text message those and you hand share those,
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.760]  that's how you change the world. That's how you override the censors and big tech and all the things they're doing.
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.760]  We're very, very close to action against big tech. I've got some news on that next hour.
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.760]  Also, Count Dankula from Scotland, very interesting fellow.
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.760]  He's going to be in studio as well to get into some stuff that, well, you're going to have to hear it from him.
[42:54.760 --> 42:57.760]  It's so, so over the top. Stay with us.

[43:48.760 --> 43:57.760]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[43:57.760 --> 44:03.760]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements.
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.760]  In that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[44:08.760 --> 44:12.760]  I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were.
[44:12.760 --> 44:14.760]  And I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[44:14.760 --> 44:18.760]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.760]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[44:22.760 --> 44:24.760]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.760]  Joan sells unapproved supplements and he claims are supplements.
[44:28.760 --> 44:36.760]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[44:36.760 --> 44:39.760]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.760]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[44:44.760 --> 44:45.760]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[44:45.760 --> 44:47.760]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[44:47.760 --> 44:51.760]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.760]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[44:58.760 --> 45:05.760]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[45:05.760 --> 45:11.760]  we'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[45:11.760 --> 45:16.760]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[45:16.760 --> 45:22.760]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war,
[45:22.760 --> 45:25.760]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[45:25.760 --> 45:26.760]  That's beautiful.
[45:26.760 --> 45:29.760]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[45:29.760 --> 45:35.760]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down,
[45:35.760 --> 45:37.760]  we're never going to give up.
[45:37.760 --> 45:39.760]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[45:39.760 --> 45:43.760]  The human spirit lives at Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[45:43.760 --> 45:49.760]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[45:49.760 --> 45:50.760]  We are the resistance.
[45:50.760 --> 46:01.760]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[46:01.760 --> 46:04.760]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[46:04.760 --> 46:08.760]  Make no mistake, it's, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.760]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[46:12.760 --> 46:17.760]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.760]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam because it's a form of fascism.
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.760]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[46:26.760 --> 46:33.760]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and Infowars.
[46:33.760 --> 46:49.760]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[46:49.760 --> 46:53.760]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[46:53.760 --> 47:00.760]  You can watch this, the movie, available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[47:00.760 --> 47:09.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.760 --> 47:33.760]  People ask me if I'm worried about getting put in prison or getting killed.
[47:33.760 --> 47:36.760]  The truth is, no, I'm not.
[47:36.760 --> 47:41.760]  I've had four children and I love them more than life.
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.760]  At certain levels I'm guilty that I had them, but I have an instinct to have children and I love my children.
[47:47.760 --> 47:52.760]  And so I'm on a suicide mission.
[47:52.760 --> 47:54.760]  Suicide mission doesn't mean you want to die.
[47:54.760 --> 47:59.760]  This means there's a 50% chance you're going to die on the mission.
[47:59.760 --> 48:06.760]  It's a real pleasure and an honor to be here and to be up against these evil people to defend innocence.
[48:06.760 --> 48:08.760]  Because that's my instinct.
[48:08.760 --> 48:10.760]  That's not what a hero does.
[48:10.760 --> 48:14.760]  That's what somebody does who's got their instincts lined up and who is dialed in.
[48:14.760 --> 48:15.760]  That's what a man does.
[48:15.760 --> 48:17.760]  That's what a woman does.
[48:17.760 --> 48:20.760]  That's what a free person does who's dialed in to God.
[48:20.760 --> 48:29.760]  Now, I get frustrated because I'm so on fire to fight these people that I'm angry at myself actually every minute that I'm not doing a good enough job.
[48:29.760 --> 48:35.760]  And I think about that mindset versus people that don't give a damn and who aren't alive and it upsets me.
[48:35.760 --> 48:39.760]  But this audience and this crew are amazing and you do care.
[48:39.760 --> 48:42.760]  And so that's why I salute you and I always thank you.
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.760]  But I know this about other people that care.
[48:45.760 --> 48:47.760]  They're always overplanning things.
[48:47.760 --> 48:49.760]  They're always trying to get it just right.
[48:49.760 --> 48:56.760]  And when we don't do things just right, we get really mad at ourselves because we feel like a lot of people are counting on us.
[48:56.760 --> 49:05.760]  But remember sociopaths and psychopaths and mercenaries and control freaks, they have very little or no emotion.
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.760]  All they have is a feeling of power and triumph.
[49:08.760 --> 49:11.760]  They're very one dimensional, very, very shallow.
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.760]  Even if they have a high IQ, they're spiritually and emotionally deaf dumb and blind.
[49:17.760 --> 49:24.760]  And so we need to stop over worrying how we've got to carry things out perfectly.
[49:24.760 --> 49:29.760]  We've just got to swing for the fences and do the best job we can.
[49:29.760 --> 49:36.760]  I was thinking about this last night when I first heard about it and then this morning when I was exercising like 830 in the morning,
[49:36.760 --> 49:39.760]  I was watching Fox News and we're going to play a clip of that right now.
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.760]  I was able to call the office and actually grab the very clip I was watching.
[49:43.760 --> 49:52.760]  When I heard this last week, I thought, I bet that's a false lie because the way they were acting and there was something strange about it
[49:52.760 --> 50:04.760]  and the way the press conferences were and then the way it totally disappeared and just the way the 911 and radio tape sounded.
[50:04.760 --> 50:07.760]  It just, the guy sounded too rehearsed.
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.760]  It sounded too calm.
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.760]  And then they tried to sweep it under the rug, but it didn't work.
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.760]  So I'll give this clip in a moment of the latest false flag that's been exposed,
[50:20.760 --> 50:29.760]  but it made me think of the hundreds and hundreds of admitted false flags that Breitbart.com has done the best job of
[50:29.760 --> 50:38.760]  writing articles and compilations about over 100 confirmed staged events a year in the U.S. alone.
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.760]  I mean, people really don't go draw the N word at the Air Force Academy all over the vending machines.
[50:44.760 --> 50:47.760]  People don't do that at West Point.
[50:47.760 --> 50:55.760]  No one's doing that at the Naval Academy, but all of them have it happen because the leftist professors tell people to do it,
[50:55.760 --> 50:58.760]  to create a culture where the left can take over.
[50:58.760 --> 51:07.760]  People are trying to get perfect scores at the Air Force Academy and at West Point and all these other systems.
[51:07.760 --> 51:16.760]  They are not trying to run around drawing inwards and poop swastikas and one foot tall crosses and churches being burned
[51:16.760 --> 51:22.760]  and synagogues being attacked 99% of the time.
[51:22.760 --> 51:23.760]  It's a staged event.
[51:23.760 --> 51:26.760]  Remember when Trump was first getting into office, he had to do a special state of the union.
[51:26.760 --> 51:29.760]  They were saying he was anti-Semitic because he said,
[51:29.760 --> 51:40.760]  well, I'm hearing from investigators in New Jersey that it's a leftist attacking the synagogues and knocking over the gravestones at Jewish Cemetery.
[51:40.760 --> 51:41.760]  And it was a big crisis.
[51:41.760 --> 51:42.760]  He's anti-Semitic.
[51:42.760 --> 51:43.760]  He says there's not anti-Semitism.
[51:43.760 --> 51:49.760]  It turned out it was a leftist Jew doing it to blame Trump.
[51:49.760 --> 51:55.760]  So I almost want to make a documentary, but I never had the time and energy or the crew to do it.
[51:55.760 --> 51:58.760]  But just about all the little false flags.
[51:58.760 --> 52:06.760]  I mean, I was in Lucy's chicken this year because my wife wanted some oysters and they walked by my table three times and they're going to kill me.
[52:06.760 --> 52:09.760]  I need to eat crap and all this stuff trying to make me blow up.
[52:09.760 --> 52:12.760]  The second time I call the manager over, they catch him again.
[52:12.760 --> 52:14.760]  They go, tell him, don't do it again.
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.760]  They're waiting for me outside the door.
[52:16.760 --> 52:17.760]  There's an outside eating area.
[52:17.760 --> 52:21.760]  They got the seats right where I'd come out videotaping when I walk out.
[52:21.760 --> 52:22.760]  I pull my camera.
[52:22.760 --> 52:23.760]  I start taping.
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.760]  It's on national news that I just walk over to tables and start screaming at people.
[52:29.760 --> 52:31.760]  No, they're saying we're going to kill you.
[52:31.760 --> 52:32.760]  Eat crap.
[52:32.760 --> 52:37.760]  We hate you.
[52:37.760 --> 52:39.760]  We're going to get you.
[52:39.760 --> 52:42.760]  I finally, as you said, well, come on in.
[52:42.760 --> 52:45.760]  But again, the statesman went over there and found out it was fake.
[52:45.760 --> 52:50.760]  That indeed the manager said, no, they messed with him three times.
[52:50.760 --> 52:52.760]  We caught him the second and third time.
[52:52.760 --> 52:54.760]  We kicked them out.
[52:54.760 --> 52:56.760]  And it's not about me.
[52:56.760 --> 53:02.760]  The left at the lowest levels now are a pack of lying scum who will set you up.
[53:02.760 --> 53:04.760]  Their religion is false flag.
[53:04.760 --> 53:08.760]  And Antifa in Ohio and Antifa in Texas, both of them were Antifa.
[53:08.760 --> 53:12.760]  They covered up the guy's page in Texas.
[53:12.760 --> 53:21.760]  Antifa is now going to stage terror attacks to blame us, period.
[53:21.760 --> 53:23.760]  And Trump needs to cover it and talk about it.
[53:23.760 --> 53:25.760]  So here's the latest.
[53:25.760 --> 53:32.760]  This sheriff's cadet or just become a sheriff's deputy, he's in trouble.
[53:32.760 --> 53:35.760]  He's about to get kicked off the force.
[53:35.760 --> 53:39.760]  So he claims he's been shot by a sniper.
[53:39.760 --> 53:42.760]  And then I guess he just poked some little knife hole in himself.
[53:42.760 --> 53:44.760]  Like people think that's a bullet hole.
[53:44.760 --> 53:45.760]  No son.
[53:45.760 --> 53:46.760]  That's a millimeter deep.
[53:46.760 --> 53:47.760]  That's not a rifle.
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.760]  I'll be right through you.
[53:48.760 --> 53:49.760]  You jackass.
[53:49.760 --> 53:55.760]  That shows who they're recruiting and hiring in police forces in some areas.
[53:55.760 --> 53:58.760]  So most of this is made up, folks.
[53:58.760 --> 54:00.760]  And now they want to sweep it under the rug.
[54:00.760 --> 54:05.760]  Here's the Fox News report on L.A. Sheriff's Deputy completely fabricated sniper story has been fired.
[54:05.760 --> 54:09.760]  Authorities say here it is.
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.760]  Take a shot from the north of the right hand side of the pack.
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.760]  They might have killed it. They might have got killed it.
[54:19.760 --> 54:24.760]  Authorities saying the Los Angeles County deputy in that frantic radio call lied about the whole thing.
[54:24.760 --> 54:33.760]  Last week, the 21-year-old claimed he was shot by a sniper while walking to his car, prompting a huge police response.
[54:33.760 --> 54:35.760]  He now faces a criminal investigation.
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.760]  William Lajanes is live in Los Angeles with the latest, William.
[54:40.760 --> 54:44.760]  Well, Sandra, you remember this shooting happened last Wednesday, around three in the afternoon,
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.760]  and only on Saturday night did the Sheriff's Department admit this entire story was a hoax,
[54:49.760 --> 54:53.760]  and now that ex-deputy is in big trouble.
[54:53.760 --> 54:59.760]  The investigation is ongoing, and a criminal investigation has been launched.
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.760]  We intend on relieving Deputy Angel Reynoso of his duties.
[55:04.760 --> 55:10.760]  So all last week, the Department acted as if this massive manhunt was still underway when, in fact,
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.760]  detectives working the case suspected this was a lie about six hours after it happened. Why?
[55:15.760 --> 55:18.760]  One, you had a crowd in parking lot, but not a single witness.
[55:18.760 --> 55:23.760]  Reynoso claimed two shots were fired, but detectives found no bullets, no casings, no ricochets.
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.760]  No one heard in the apartment complex or anywhere else a shot.
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.760]  Reynoso admitted on Saturday using a knife to cut holes in his shirt to look like a bullet hole,
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.760]  but investigators say the rips were too big for an entry wound,
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.760]  and finally, detectives said Reynoso sounded too normal.
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.760]  In that 911 call, they expected to hear more adrenaline in his voice.
[55:46.760 --> 55:53.760]  There was no sniper, no shots fired, and no gunshot injuries sustained to his shoulder.
[55:53.760 --> 55:59.760]  Okay, let's stop there, and again, earlier reports was he had a little cut on him, but even that wasn't true.
[55:59.760 --> 56:05.760]  Now, here's the key. This happened a long time ago, over a week ago.
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.760]  They knew immediately it was fake.
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.760]  Oh, where's the bullet hole? Where's the witnesses?
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.760]  But everyone played along with it saying, see, there's snipers now,
[56:15.760 --> 56:18.760]  and we need to take your guns and all the rest of it.
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.760]  And so that just shows how they always believe right away all this.
[56:21.760 --> 56:25.760]  That's why I questioned Sandy Hook,
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.760]  because I saw them lie to get us into the First Iraq War saying they were killing hundreds of babies and incubators.
[56:30.760 --> 56:34.760]  It turned out it was totally fake.
[56:34.760 --> 56:37.760]  And so the public questions things, I questioned things. We have a right.
[56:37.760 --> 56:44.760]  Look at Jesse Smollett. Look at any of this stuff, but they don't want you to have the capability or the ability to ask questions.
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.760]  They want to shut that down. They want to end the First Amendment, and that is insanely dangerous.
[56:49.760 --> 56:53.760]  Okay, there's a ton of other news that I'm not going to mention now
[56:53.760 --> 56:55.760]  that I'm going to hit in the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[56:55.760 --> 57:01.760]  Then we have a special guest, Count Dankula, who was arrested for a Hitler dog joke.
[57:01.760 --> 57:04.760]  Wait till you hear about all the other arrests.
[57:04.760 --> 57:07.760]  A man put on the side of his house.
[57:07.760 --> 57:10.760]  Islam is questionable. He's been arrested.
[57:10.760 --> 57:19.760]  A woman that's a vegan said, hello, butchering of animals is inhumane,
[57:19.760 --> 57:21.760]  and she's been kicked out of college.
[57:21.760 --> 57:26.760]  This is just the latest thousands of arrests a year for saying that Islam is violent
[57:26.760 --> 57:33.760]  or exposing that they're running racially focused right gangs against British girls and others.
[57:33.760 --> 57:35.760]  It's all coming up.
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.760]  Hour number two is only minutes away, and the only way we crush the globalist
[57:39.760 --> 57:41.760]  is when you spread the live links and spread the word.
[57:41.760 --> 57:45.760]  Your word of mouth is cheap, and it is unstoppable.
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.760]  We've had this in for two weeks. I've been so busy.
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.760]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.

[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up next segment,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:30.760]  it's all over mainstream news that Silicon Valley is building a social credit score
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.760]  to punish you for things you do outside of the platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.760]  Of course, they've been billeted for the ChaiComs and now they're building it for you.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.760]  InfoWars first told you in 2015.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.760]  Next year's news today, indeed.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.760]  Because we're all in this together, ladies and gentlemen, and we can beat them.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.760]  We know their battle plans. We know how to stop them.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.760]  I'd be covering it this segment, but I have so many stacks of news
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.760]  that I can't find the articles that the crew brought me,
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.760]  where it's all admitted that Silicon Valley is building this.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.760]  I'm going to see if I can find that.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.760]  And then there's a bunch of new Epstein news.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.760]  There is a bunch of new. Joe Biden says, I want to be clear. I'm not going nuts.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760]  That's an actual quote.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.760]  We have that video. We've got a bunch of stuff out of Hong Kong.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.760]  We haven't gotten to and so much more and some good news.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.760]  Cities are saying no to 5G health.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.760]  That's the Wall Street Journal. That was a direct counter.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.760]  The day after Drudge promoted that I was live on air covering the dangers of 5G.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760]  They came out with this.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  So that's going to be coming up next.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.760]  Plus this great ad from Merv's guns were actually coming with that first
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.760]  at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.760]  Separately here, there's just so much that I need to get to.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.760]  But I think we should play clip number five because it's such a good report.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.760]  I don't normally air reports once or more than once.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.760]  I normally air them. They're really, really, really, really good twice.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.760]  But I've heard this already twice.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.760]  I want to air Chi Com's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed because our report,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.760]  Greg Rees and of course Savannah Hernandez and others are there inside Hong Kong right now
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.760]  filing amazing reports.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.760]  But this boils down why it's so incredibly important.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760]  Here it is.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.760]  This is Greg Rees reporting from mainland China for infowars.com.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.760]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM bridge.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.760]  Opened less than one year ago, the Hong Kong Zuhai Macau Bridge is 34 miles long,
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:48.760]  consisting of three cable state bridges, an undersea tunnel and four artificial islands.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.760]  It is the longest open sea fixed link on earth.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.760]  The bridge links the mainland to Hong Kong.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.760]  This is the bridge the Chi Com's are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.760]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.760]  where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:17.760]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the breach.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.760]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.760]  and in the People's Republic of China.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:32.760]  In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Tse Tung,
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:38.760]  was responsible for the murder of over 100 million Chinese.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.760]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong,
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.760]  which as a result grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.760]  2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution,
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  and despite its horrors, communism continues to spread.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.760]  The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance,
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:12.760]  and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:21.760]  100,000 troops of the Chi Com's paramilitary PAF are now training on the border of these autonomous cities,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.760]  preparing for an invasion.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:34.760]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.760]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway,
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:45.760]  with over 100,000 troops already amassed set to invade only a fraction of the people's armed force.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.760]  The Chi Com's are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.760]  Reporting from mainland China for Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:01.760]  An Info Warrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2,

[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.760]  Contributor Marci Bianco, a self-described writer, editor, cultural critic,
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.760]  and your favorite lesbian feminist, recently wrote this in her piece titled
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:12.760]  Miley Cyrus' Split with Liam Hemsworth Isn't Just Celebrity Gossip, It's a Blow to the Patriarchy.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.760]  Quote, men need heterosexuality to maintain their societal dominance over women.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:24.760]  Women, on the other hand, are increasingly realizing not only that they don't need heterosexuality,
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.760]  but that it also is often the bedrock of their global oppression.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.760]  It's an insensical, radical idea that women are increasingly realizing
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.760]  that they don't need healthy heterosexual relationships based on the lifestyle of Miley Cyrus,
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.760]  whose divorce was inevitable, wasn't because Miley was victimized by global oppression,
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.760]  it was due to her inability to maintain a healthy heterosexual relationship.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.760]  Some women just aren't ready or willing to take on the raw reality required
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.760]  of a partner in a caring, monogamous relationship emboldened by the synthesis
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.760]  of matriarchal and patriarchal norms in the Western world.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.760]  Bianco was echoing a message bubbling amongst feminists for years.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.760]  We need to kill all men.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:20.760]  I am sick of being a baby factory that produces more men that will just, in the future, subjugate me.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:30.760]  So the only answer to that is to kill male babies and just kill any man that you see, like in the streets,
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:39.760]  like any swing, just kill him, because we want the species to go on,
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:46.760]  but we want it only to go on with women in it, so that's what we have to do.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.760]  The only way to keep the human race going is with just women.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.760]  This is the rabid underbelly of the diatribe among the left,
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:59.760]  and if heterosexuality is on a sharp decline, as Marci Bianco claims,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.760]  wouldn't a straight, pride parade make sense and draw support?
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.760]  A large crowd forms on McHenry Street in Modesto,
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.760]  people holding signs, making noise and speaking out against this man, Don Grundman.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.760]  He's advertised having a straight pride event.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.760]  This is an example of free speech in our country. It's a one-way street.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.760]  They want free speech, but they won't give us free speech.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:30.760]  When he showed up this afternoon, people against his message say they wanted to outnumber him,
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.760]  surrounding his sign, promoting the straight pride coalition.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:41.760]  Apathy and not confronting fascists when they come into society, into the public space, into our communities,
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.760]  it makes it unsafe for queer people, people of color.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:53.760]  The actual reality is that 2.2% of the American male population identifies as gay,
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.760]  while 1.1% identifies lesbian.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.760]  And it's not because the LGBT community is oppressed,
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.760]  as 63% of Americans believe homosexuality is morally acceptable.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.760]  But what is actually increasing is an epidemic trend of loneliness
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:18.760]  as a general social survey discovered that the number of Americans with no close friends has tripled since 1985.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.760]  In fact, a study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:30.760]  revealed that characteristics of socially isolated patients with coronary artery disease
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.760]  are at an elevated risk for mortality.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.760]  Simply put, loneliness is killing us, and as those numbers skyrocket.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:45.760]  Mockingbird mainstream media outlets irresponsibly seed the mental illness of pseudo-racism,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.760]  nationalized self-loathing, and radical feminism, compounding the isolation,
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  echoing the projection of the fears of the LGBT community,
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.760]  a minority community otherwise overwhelmingly accepted by Americans,
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.760]  fomenting a leftist echo chamber hell-bent on forcing the majority of us
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:10.760]  just trying to live our short natural lives to all choke on fantastical notions
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.760]  of guilt and oppressive propaganda.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.760]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.760]  Now, there's some big new developments taking place on a lot of different fronts
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.760]  with the attacks on free speech, and we're going to have Count Dankula in studio
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.760]  who they tried to put in prison if he wouldn't renounce himself
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.760]  and say he was a bad person for doing a Hitler dog joke.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.760]  I did a Hitler dog joke with my late French bulldog,
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.760]  but now people putting signs on their barns that say questioning Islam is okay,
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.760]  are being arrested, prosecuted, thrown in jail, thrown in prison,
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:57.760]  and men and women that criticize hell all slaughter are being kicked out of college,
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  they're being arrested, Islam is the absolutely protected class
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  being brought in to engage in predator activity against the population.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:16.760]  Now, I was at dinner last night with Sargon and, of course, with Count Dankula,
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.760]  and both of them were basically afraid to be on camera talking about all the people
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.760]  they know that are arrested because they will be arrested.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.760]  So, Tommy Robinson's in jail for exposing child kidnapping ranks
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.760]  that target white girls, mainly by Pakistani men.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.760]  They don't do it to the Pakistani girls.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.760]  They kill many of them.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.760]  We're talking seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven-year-old,
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.760]  and they're supplying them to men like Jimmy Savelle.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.760]  And so it's a very ghoulish relationship with the globalist ruling class in the UK
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.760]  and the Islamist who agree with all of this culture.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  That's the bottom of the arm.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.760]  I'll hit the Merv's Guns ad that I mentioned earlier when we start the next segment.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.760]  Just briefly, people are really excited about this because they know what a great product it is.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.760]  We have the Super Silver Woon Gel that's patented, FDA approved,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.760]  strongest silver you can get over the counter.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.760]  We're the only company that's allowed to private label it as our brand, Super Silver.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.760]  It's made in the US, in Colorado.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.760]  It's the highest quality.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.760]  It's 25% off right now.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  It's an introductory deal.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.760]  All of these new products that we've come out with, with them that are proprietary,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.760]  have the same silver, but they don't have all the jump through the hoop stuff to have that FDA label on them
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.760]  so we can get a better price on them as we can lower the price, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:45.760]  We're talking $7 for the small tube, $14 for the big tube, two different designs,
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  two different variants of it.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]  It's amazing.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:54.760]  And it just doesn't have the patented nano-silver, silver-sol technology that recognizes the best.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.760]  With just 20 ppm silver, it's up to 10 times more effective in major studies and similar products,
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760]  This stuff is the real deal.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.760]  Get the Super Silver Skin Cream, 25% off at introductoryspecialinfoorstore.com.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.760]  And again, it also helps reduce wrinkles and keeps the skin healthy.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.760]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick on contact.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  It's best of both worlds.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.760]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented silver-sol technology.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  It also is loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil and vitamin E.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:38.760]  Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives and sulfates.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.760]  Independent studies have proven that silver-sol technology, the Super Silver Skin Cream,
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.760]  which is 20 ppm again, blows away all the competition.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.760]  This is the real deal. I hope you get yours today.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760]  People are very, very excited.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.760]  This is an introductory run.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  The current rates, it's going to sell out in about a week to a week and a half.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.760]  We're going to go back to regular price in a few days.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.760]  Just like the Super Crilla Oil, highest quality, ultimate Crilla Oil, this baby,
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.760]  we're doubling the reorder of this.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  People are learning how incredible Crilla Oil is.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.760]  And it's back at infoorstore.com.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.760]  It's still discounted as well. We've got it in that discount.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.760]  Okay, stay weathers. The transmission has just begun.

[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.760]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:36.760]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:44.760]  It's supported by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush. The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:55.760]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved and turned key equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:19.760]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.760]  We've had this in for two weeks. I've been so busy. I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:33.760]  It's super silver skin cream. It's got all of these benefits. Too many to mention, but it's revolutionary. It's brand new. People are going to love it.

[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:58.760]  Almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression. The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.760]  To make real the actions of independent free speech. To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:10.760]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.760]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.760]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:59.760]  There's nothing like having people on the ground to verify. But even mainstream media got it right.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:11.760]  The millions of protesters that have been out in the streets last week in Hong Kong are mainly mad about the face scanning cameras and the Chinese social score
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:18.760]  that tracks every movement they make and then gives orders to government councils and to corporations to not let you have jobs,
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:24.760]  not let you have credit cards, not let you ride trains, not let you get on airplanes, not let you leave your house.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.760]  That's a statement by the Communist Party that if you don't do what we say, you will not set foot two feet outside your door.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:37.760]  A total global electronic straightjacket hooked over everyone.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:48.760]  And now today, there's a whole group of mainstream news articles introducing this to everyone,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:59.760]  getting everyone ready for it, preparing everyone for it, telling people that the Chinese social score is here.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:09.760]  Here's a couple articles on it right now. Uh-oh, Silicon Valley is building a Chinese-style social credit score.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.760]  That's FastCompany.com, and it links to all these mainstream articles.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  And then it goes on to other articles. The Observer, America Isn't Far From China's Social Credit Score.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:29.760]  I have another article here in my stack where Silicon Valley is meeting to develop a social credit score. It's already here.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.760]  Alex Jones is right again, Big Tech Building Chinese-style social credit score. I wasn't right again.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.760]  Everyone keeps thinking, oh, he was right about Epstein.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:45.760]  He envisioned it with a crystal ball, or he was right about fluoride causing IQ reduction,
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.760]  or he was right about the runoff making the frogs attracted to the same sex and killing them. They never had babies.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  That means end of species. And he was right about this, because it's already admitted.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.760]  There were already thousands of studies that fluoride lowers IQ and hurts fertility.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:11.760]  There were already hundreds of studies that the runoff is making the frogs attracted to the same sex and not females anymore.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:18.760]  There's even mainstream headlines where I ever said turn the frogs gay that said it's making them homosexual.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:23.760]  And then, of course, Facebook was not going to let you use keywords.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:32.760]  First, it's Alex Jones. Then it's, what is it next? It's Info Wars. Then it's Paul Watson.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:38.760]  Then it's even Donald Trump if they want. And people are finally getting this.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  When I saw this over the weekend or on Friday, I thought that it was a joke.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.760]  But it turns out that there is a gun store in Oklahoma that's been around for decades.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.760]  Murph's guns. That's very, very popular. And it turns out it's even got Murph in it.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.760]  Well, I want to have this guy on the show. I want to, this guy's got a lot of energy and a lot of pizzazz.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:03.760]  But he turns it around on him. But here's the thing, it's good to adapt and overcome censorship.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:08.760]  But if we just adapt to it with jokes, it's only a short term issue.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.760]  Because they're just going to change it to say, well, you're still promoting guns.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  Imagine Facebook saying you can't promote anything with the name gun in it or shotgun or handgun.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:26.760]  And AI is blocking it. And then AI with photos of guns is blurring it out.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.760]  Just like they blur my face out.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.760]  So this is the total nightmare system. And it's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.760]  So here's the ad for the guns. And again, for radio, it won't be as cute.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.760]  But for TV, they've blurted all the guns out. And it says it all. Here it is.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.760]  Hi, folks. I'm here to tell you all about Murph's.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.760]  You see, Facebook won't let us use the word guns in any advertisements.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.760]  They also won't let us show gun shots or hippies.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.760]  Here, Murph, we got tons of stuff for all your outdoor and self-protection needs.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:12.760]  So much so that this is one of the only camera angles in the store that we can show you without violating Facebook's rules.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:19.760]  We got it all. And in real life, none of the stuff in the store is covered up or blurry.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.760]  We got a great selection of s**t, s**t, s**t, s**t.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.760]  S**t f*****, and water bottles.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:46.160]  So whether you're trying to stock up for a great pheasant,
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:52.600]  I would definitely shop if the Murph guns, I want to get that guy on.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.600]  Now that's people fighting back, but we can't put up with this to have our utilities and
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.600]  under section 230, big tech is all the utility.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.120]  That's how they're able to have third party comments or third party articles and things
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.560]  and have billions of members.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.320]  It's almost up to three billion now on Facebook because you're not liable for what they're
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320]  posting.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:18.120]  If it relates to law, then you take it down or there's a court order or someone's indicted.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:27.800]  You have policies, no child endangerment stuff, porn, you can say gambling, you can say hacking.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:37.440]  But then, oh, we choose to say that the Republican Party putting out on Facebook a little photographic
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.760]  saying we're looking for strong women to join the campaign and help get Trump reelected.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.480]  They said, well, that's misgendering saying we're looking for strong women.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.320]  You can't say the word woman.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320]  That's not a mistake.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.240]  That's a battle plan system.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.920]  I first started learning 10 years ago out of Canada.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.640]  They were trying to ban on entrance exams or interest forms for public schools and colleges,
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:05.640]  the word mother and father or he or she, well, now they've done that.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.120]  They're not just saying there's 500 genders.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:16.000]  They're saying you can't send an ad out that says strong women because it might hurt someone
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.440]  that sees the word woman because they're not a woman.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.680]  You're like, well, that just sounds like total mental illness.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.440]  Well, they're creating basket cases that are offended by anything and everything, then
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.160]  run back to mommy and the police are all told be politically correct and go out and throw
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:35.360]  the book at everybody that puts up a sign on their bar and saying Islam is questionable
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:42.120]  or hey, torturing animals to death for you, eat them, you know, how all slaughter is abusive.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.960]  Even if that's not true, which I think it is a pretty torturous form of trying how I'd
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.240]  butcher an animal and I'd shoot them right between the eyes and with a tractor over a
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.160]  beam, haul them up by their legs and butcher them.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]  That's how you do it.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]  There's no pain.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.160]  They never knew what hit them.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.400]  A lot of guys, you know, shoot the cow and the way it's butchered the barn is, you know,
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  with a 22.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.000]  Sometimes that doesn't get them right away.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.440]  You shoot them and they have the, you know, 308 that gets them problem is the 308 bullet
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.080]  might go out of the barn.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.520]  That's why I use a 22 couple pop pop pop.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.920]  It's done, haul them up, got them couple three, four guys can butcher it in an hour.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.880]  It takes more time to cut it into stakes and things, but that's not how they do it.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.720]  I'm not going to go into graphics here, but again, whether it's right to say it's torturing
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.720]  an animal or not, you have a right to say that and the left that thinks you shouldn't
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.760]  be able to eat meat and all this stuff and, you know, the things your children should
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.960]  be taught how to put on dresses and give a fellatio when they're, you know, six years
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.040]  old, all over the US and all over Europe, the Islamists is that we ought to find those
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040]  videos.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:49.160]  I haven't played those in a while, type it like Islamists blow up on gay pride parade
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.760]  or blow up at leftist and man, they come in and start attacking the gay pride parade
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.760]  and the gay pride parade.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.960]  It's like, what do you mean you're anti Western, you're anti American, you're anti Christian,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.600]  you're our savior and they're like, no, we're coming for you.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.400]  We're going to throw your ass off a building, but it shows the left is a bunch of mad dog
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.720]  programmed enemies of the West because they're trying to conquer it.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.280]  They're not for everybody's rights and stuff.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.800]  They're authoritarians using our openness to press the attack.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.800]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate.com.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.760]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  my family to freedom.

[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.680]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.960]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:38.080]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.760]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam because it's a form
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.760]  of fascism.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.040]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.280]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and Info
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.320]  Wars.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.520]  First they come around with Jones.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:10.040]  Everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.960]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:19.520]  You can watch this, the movie, available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:26.040]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.080]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.840]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:41.760]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.960]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.520]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:53.480]  Gravity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.560]  next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.160]  dying system.

[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:25.200]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.600]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.480]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:37.680]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago and we've
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.200]  seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's doing in this
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.040]  trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040]  That's beautiful.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.520]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.560]  So to the walking cruisers and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.320]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.320]  the human spirit.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:06.520]  The human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and I'm asking listeners, whatever
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.440]  you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.520]  We are the resistance.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:38.840]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.720]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein, that is a f***ing fact.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.320]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.440]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.520]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.840]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.160]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:08.240]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.720]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.280]  Right wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.960]  Conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.760]  Alex Jones has been behind several right wing conspiracy theories.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:27.120]  Right wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:32.720]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:38.000]  Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  reporting.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.360]  The government's poisoning the water.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.360]  Absolutely.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:44.960]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:49.200]  think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make it more
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.200]  easily manageable.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.080]  Oh, dear, the floor, I didn't work on this one.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.080]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.080]  Hurry.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.080]  Chemtrail him immediately.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.880]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.720]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.280]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.640]  your sexuality.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.760]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.480]  Jones says there's a world government.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.440]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:15.440]  It is.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]  On and on and on.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:19.040]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.040]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040]  in 2016.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:31.520]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Ferule, developed brain cancer.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.240]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.320]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radio
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.800]  frequency or RF waves coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:52.200]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:57.400]  of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:01.960]  30 years and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.640]  waves, cell phones operate as microwaves, transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.640]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.520]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules, and 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.840]  that even rattles it faster, that's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules,
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.600]  and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  You heard me right.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.400]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.920]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.920]  deal.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.680]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.480]  in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:44.760]  girls, who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.280]  What may have happened here?
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.920]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.920]  it.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.240]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.640]  and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.040]  Young guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.720]  to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein when they were in fact not.
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.240]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:12.360]  People won't listen to me, because I got too much data, and imagine what this is like.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.600]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.560]  Years ago, he was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.760]  have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.080]  He was talking about this years ago.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.520]  Now it is mainstream news.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:46.360]  Well, Count Dankula is in studio where this had a great time hanging out with him.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.520]  Carl also known as Sargon.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.960]  And they were talking about a lot of stuff there at the steakhouse with me in Austin,
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.760]  that they don't want to say on air, even though it's extremely mild, because they'll be put
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.360]  in prison in the United Kingdom.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:10.320]  And so as we go to my guest, I'd like to have a camera shot right here, so I can show TV
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:17.560]  viewers just a few of the latest headlines in the last week.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:23.080]  Video from the UK, Scottish police arrest man for painting Islam is questionable on
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.080]  his house.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.760]  Anyway, talk about the Magna Carta and freedom.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:36.480]  Student kicked out of UNI after branding Halal meet barbaric and inhumane in an essay.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.480]  This is Breitbart.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:45.000]  British police arrested at least 3,395 people for offensive online comments in one year.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.320]  Foreign policy, that's the Washington Post.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.960]  Europe's free speech apocalypse is already here.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.160]  That was three years ago.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.840]  Oh, but now the left supports it.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:02.240]  Europe's free speech crackdown, punish anti-Muslims, ignore terrorists, national review.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.160]  But the right wing supports, the right wing establishments supports all this.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.040]  It's the neocons running.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.760]  Most of it is I'm going to show you coming up next segment inside the Atlantic Council
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.400]  with folks in the NSA and CIA that Trump hasn't gotten rid of that work for Obama.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.120]  Obama and Hillary still run big tech.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.120]  They take orders.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.200]  I'm going to show you their quotes coming up.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.920]  Crackdown on free speech rise across Europe.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.760]  So that's just some of it right there.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.560]  Count Dankula, it's great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.880]  You're going to ride shotgun the rest of the hour and 20 minutes with us or so into the
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.040]  fourth hour with Gerald Salente taking over.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.480]  What do you want to cover while you're here?
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.760]  I mean, I have to tell you, it was frightening last night.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.800]  Everything to you guys and what you were discussing and just incredible iron curtain
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.280]  of tyranny and how many people are in prison or have been sent to prison like yourself
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.200]  and how many are facing more prison and then Tommy Robinson talking to Julian Assange in
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.160]  jail and all these exclusives you've got.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.720]  In regards to freedom of speech in the UK, what you said there, the over 3000 people
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.960]  that have been arrested for things that they have posted online, that is a true statement.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:18.680]  But the funny thing is in Russia last year, it was only 300.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.280]  So we are, in fact, arresting more people than Russia for things that they have said
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.280]  online.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.680]  Well, the truth is, I've looked up Russia.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.880]  They only arrest you if you're like a foreign agent working for an open NGO for Soros.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.400]  And when you work for Soros and you come in to go into a church and piss on the sacraments,
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.400]  they arrest you.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400]  Really?
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.400]  That's disorderly conduct.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.400]  Yeah.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.320]  But that's something, obviously, if you're going in and causing damage.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.640]  And then they pose as if, oh, look, Russia is a police state.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:50.680]  And no, when Pussy Riot, that's the name of it, funded by the CIA, goes in and tries
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.640]  to piss literally in the church, physically urinate, then they get arrested.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:56.640]  I didn't know anything about that.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.640]  I've seen them getting beaten in the streets.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.640]  Yeah.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.640]  Pussy Riot.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.640]  I didn't know anything about pissing in the church.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.640]  That's what they did.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.640]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:04.640]  Right.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]  I didn't know.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  Bunch of stuff in the church.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.640]  Yeah.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:13.520]  That's something I could understand why you would be arrested for that.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.760]  Exactly what I'm saying is you just pointed out 300 people arrested for supposed speech
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.600]  in Russia, meanwhile, 3000 plus in the UK.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  Yeah.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.000]  We've even got some of the instances as well are absolutely ridiculous.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.080]  One of the most well-known ones is a girl called Chelsea Russell.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.080]  She's a young girl.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.080]  She's still a teenager.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.080]  And in her estate where she lives, a young boy got knocked down.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.800]  He was killed in a car accident and a lot of people from the estate were posting tributes
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.640]  and things like that to him online.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.120]  She posted lyrics from his favorite rap song onto her Instagram and because the rap lyrics
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.440]  contained the N-word, she was arrested and charged for that and she was found guilty.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.360]  She was given a fine and she was also given a curfew and had to wear a GPS ankle bracelet.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.480]  So his favorite rap song has those words with the black guy saying it, but then when you
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.120]  post the lyrics, you go to jail.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.120]  Yeah.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.440]  Even though they play these songs on the radio.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.360]  So this is the opposite of the UK and where supposed free speech got enshrined?
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  Yeah.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.240]  Free speech in the UK is in deep trouble.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.520]  We're getting lots of people, especially one of the main things as well that the police
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:17.720]  very often use is it something called the hate crime operational guidance handbook and
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.480]  you can look this up.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  You can look this up.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.360]  It actually does say several times in the handbook itself that it all comes down to the
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.920]  not the matter of fact, the black and white of what actually happened in the situation.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.480]  It comes down to the perception of the people involved.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.080]  So the perception of the victim, the perception of the police or even the perception of a
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.000]  bystander. So if you're having an argument in the street with someone who might be a
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.520]  Muslim Jewish or any of these other protected classes, you might not even have to utter
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.520]  a slur.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.360]  You've not said anything homophobic or racist or anything like that at all.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.880]  You might have just yelled at them because you.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.560]  So what's happening is God like powers being given to protected classes to wave magic wands
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.880]  and if they feel offended, you've got to tell them no matter what you did.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  Yeah.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.640]  Because it comes down to their perception, even though you didn't say any slurs or anything
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  at all.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640]  See if they are a bystander.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.600]  Well, let's see how we gave the left the power in Europe and now in UK and now here to decide,
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.880]  oh, you can't say something hurtful.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.960]  Well, now everything's hurtful and now there's no free speech.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:15.160]  Now we have real tyrants ruling over us and our children.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.960]  We've got a very interesting guest in studio, ladies and gentlemen, we've had this in for

[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:12.800]  YouTube Count Dancula reaches hundreds of millions of people.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:18.920]  He got first, of course, arrested a few years ago for doing a joke video of Hitler dog.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:24.280]  Very similar to bits that John Cleese has done, similar to bits that I had done.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.840]  And you know, clearly, this is the police state Europe the last 20 years starting in
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  Germany outlawed the Nazi party.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.880]  And then they outlawed anything nationalist or right wing, then they invaded the country
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:36.880]  with Islam.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.000]  This is all part of a larger admitted you in plan.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.920]  And so every time I had dinner with some great person like you who's been put in jail or
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:46.720]  attacked or demonetized, they're always explaining, hey, I'm not a Nazi.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:47.720]  Hey, I'm not racist.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.680]  Hey, it's just up to the eye of the beholder and then the Islam is running, you know, child
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.920]  kidnapping rings and you can't even cover the trials or even say it's happening or that
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.880]  they're racially, you know, targeting white people or you get arrested even though they
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:03.160]  say they are because it's it's it's it's racially stoking flames.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.160]  The police say if you admit that they're being racial, but then they're allowed to
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.200]  operate and rape whoever they want and be racial and be hateful, you import a third
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:14.640]  world very tribal population that was taken over by the Muslims in the last 500 years
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.400]  that's invaded India killed 140 million Hindus.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.520]  You bring in a bunch of these guys and they take over and drive everybody out of the neighborhoods
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.760]  around them because Islam has been invading like a cancer for 1400 years.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.520]  And so I sit there and you know, we try to explain to the police that we try to explain
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.680]  it's our free speech and then and then you then got into how you said, fine, I'll go
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:37.680]  to jail.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:39.720]  I'm not going to plead guilty.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.040]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.080]  They just took the money out of your bank account.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.080]  It's the social score.
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:48.000]  It's the global social score.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.520]  And so to see this happening, this is a premeditated plan.
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.640]  The low level leftist love the power they have to say that you've done something wrong
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  so you get arrested, but up on top, the big mega corporations and others want to end Western
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.760]  freedom because it doesn't work with their authoritarianism.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:05.920]  They love China.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:06.920]  China's authoritarian.
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:07.920]  China dehumanizes.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:10.560]  China just says you're anti-communist and arrest you.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.280]  So they're using our classical liberalism as our Achilles heel.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.360]  And we have to stop it and realize this is incredible tyranny and that the police in
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.600]  these courts are tyrants and are incredibly dangerous.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.480]  So tell people about your story and you've got the floor to really get into what's happening
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:30.360]  in Europe and how it's coming here and the progression of this cancer.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.400]  The main problem is the people that want to secretly run everything and control everything
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.080]  are authoritarians and the biggest threat to authoritarians is freedom of speech.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:43.160]  If people are able to speak freely and they're able to convince other people that obviously
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.320]  authoritarians are bad, they're showing people the bad things the authoritarians are doing.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:52.800]  Like see, for example, right now, the situation in Hong Kong, you know, this is a soft invasion
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.360]  by China, right now, it's a soft invasion by China, but soon I've got a feeling it's
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360]  going to become a hard one.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.600]  The people in Hong Kong are doing what Antifa and America think they're doing, like the
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.960]  people in Hong Kong are actually truly resisting against a brutal authoritarian regime.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.120]  They're waving American flags.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  They love democracy.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  They love freedom.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:12.120]  They love liberty.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.920]  And when you speak to the people on the ground there in Hong Kong, they'll tell you exactly
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:15.920]  that.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.080]  But for some reason, people are now trying to paint the Hong Kong protesters as far right
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.920]  because they've decided to use the Pepe symbol as a mark of their freedom and it just goes
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.040]  to show you the way that these people think that people fighting for their freedom, for
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.120]  their liberty and in Hong Kong's case, probably most likely their lives, they're being branded
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  as fascists.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.400]  I can't understand how these people have actually tried to make that connection that people
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.960]  who love and want freedom are somehow Nazis fascist bigots and white supremacists.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.920]  I can't, I can't understand it.
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.760]  I think it's just because these people truly have run out of arguments because at most
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:53.400]  of the time whenever you come up against someone and the first thing they do is call
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.720]  you a Nazi or a bigot, racist, et cetera, without evidence, without any sort of support,
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.920]  you've won the argument.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:01.000]  You've already won the argument.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.200]  This person has nothing on you, like you've already come out on top.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.760]  This person is an authoritarian.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  They just won't admit it.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.720]  They just want you to shut up and stop talking about freedom because the biggest threat to
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.680]  the type of government and control that they want is freedom.
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.680]  Understand what it's like.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:22.720]  Describe the type of things people have been arrested for and of course it's always expanding.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:30.360]  Earlier folks just joined us, a person died, I think he said a car wreck accident and then
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  his favorite rap song, his girlfriend or a friend put a quote online that had the n-word
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:41.480]  in it and you know, I mean if a music group is putting something out and that's what they
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.520]  believe, you should be able to say it and not be seen as offensive.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.640]  But regardless, you shouldn't be arrested for it and that's where this is all going.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:55.160]  Yeah, it's basically, we're now at the point where hurting people's feelings has become
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.160]  a crime.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.880]  Hurting a person's feelings has actually become a crime.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.120]  And there was another example as well, that was the Chelsea Russell case, a hard case
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:07.160]  eventually got overturned on appeal but it took a lot of time and a lot of public support
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160]  for that to actually happen.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.920]  Yeah, so they're still going to make you go through all the trouble and all of it.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.480]  Yeah, they're basically wasting police time, wasting courts time, wasting taxpayers' money
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.600]  on absolute nonsense cases like this.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.480]  There was even another one which was quite recent was a year of the Grenfell Tower fire
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480]  that happened in London.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:27.560]  It's a huge tower block that went on fire, hundreds of people died, it was very tragic.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.680]  There was people who actually made an effigy of Grenfell and actually set it on fire in
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:36.960]  their back garden, very, very mean spirited as far as jokes go, it's not something that
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:41.560]  I would do but these people were actually arrested and investigated by the police for
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:42.560]  what they did.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.920]  They ended up going to court, they even got the police were searching through their bins,
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.880]  searching through their entire house, you know, over just hurting people's feelings
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.160]  which I thought was a hell of a reaction from the police.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]  But I think because...
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.160]  Well, it's not their right and it's a power grab and it's the stuff that nightmares are
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:01.160]  made of.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.120]  But speaking of that, firefighters in Sweden and Germany and everywhere, remember three
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:09.640]  years ago, oh, no-go zones aren't real, that's a right wing lie.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.640]  Everybody's known that they're expanding, our crews have run into it, you've run into
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.360]  it and now the no-go zones are there.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:19.320]  Firefighters are getting attacked, they're getting shot at, Molov cocktails, that's part
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.400]  of the reason the firefighters and police can't get into areas when there's a fire and predominantly
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.800]  Muslim buildings burned down is because they're no-go zones.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:29.760]  I think it's just because of this rejection of...
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.440]  I think they see that obviously at any type of authority, even if it's like the firefighters
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:36.400]  or the police are incidentally that, they are seen as a representation of the state
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.680]  of the West and they hate it.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.360]  They don't want it, they want to have their own community.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.160]  And isn't it funny, the police then kiss their ass, but then the very docile UK people on
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:49.720]  average that are very subservient to government on average, you're very polite, they are overrun
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.920]  and bossed around.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.400]  Like the guy that saved dozens of people, the lion of...
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.000]  Oh, the London Bridge, I think it was...
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.960]  The lion of London Bridge, and they stabbed him over and over again because he told the
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:08.240]  media they were Muslims screaming Allah Akbar and he saved a bunch of people, got stabbed
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.640]  dozens of times, he was put in a re-education camp just so he wouldn't hate Muslims after
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:14.640]  that.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:18.120]  It was put on, I think it was a right-wing terror watch list that he was put on, even
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120]  though...
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.120]  He had to go to re-education.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.120]  Yeah, the man's a national hero.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:24.920]  The man's a national hero and he stopped, he saved people's lives, he gets stabbed
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.680]  up a bunch himself, he made a huge sacrifice to protect the lives of others, to protect
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.680]  the lives of others.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.840]  The lion of London Bridge, and there's too many of these, I mean, Tommy Robinson right
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.960]  now, we'll talk about it next hour, but I mean, he's in a high security prison, I say
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.840]  it's one of the worst in the UK, with Julian Assange.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:45.720]  Yeah, from what I have heard from people who have gone to visit Tommy, he is Tommy's
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:50.160]  downstairs and in the cell above him is Julian Assange, and they've been talking to each
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.360]  other by shouting through the windows of their cells.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.280]  So I'm interested to hear what type of conversations they've been having.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.560]  You're just like me, I said we'll cover it next hour, you get right to it, but I like
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560]  putting them all up front.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.920]  Here's the thing, I can get up here all day and talk about this.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:10.040]  You're a really funny comedian, I went back and looked at your work, and I would call
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:14.080]  it libertarian, I would call it kind of edgy, I call it kind of classical liberal.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.520]  But even if you were a Nazi, you have a right to make a Hitler dog video.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:24.000]  But briefly, tell me what happened to you?
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.720]  My girlfriend was always constantly going on about our pet pug, Pudda, and constantly
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.680]  going on about how cute, adorable and lovely he was, even in some instances picking the
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.400]  dog up and shoving him in my face, going, look how cute he is, which was kind of annoying
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.520]  when you're trying to watch TV, and I ended up getting so annoyed by it that I decided
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:48.560]  to turn the pug into the worst thing that I could think of, which was a Nazi.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:52.800]  And so I decided to teach him to lift his paw whenever I said, seek out, and react to
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.720]  a few phrases that the Nazis might themselves say.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:02.240]  And I decided to record it, I posted it on YouTube, it ended up going viral, the press
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.200]  immediately leapt on to that, and we're basically trying to say that I was the second coming
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:09.920]  of Hitler and saying I was a Nazi and I was a white supremacist in all manner of things.
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.720]  And then eventually I was arrested by the police.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.240]  And I went through a two year trial, I was ultimately found guilty and fined £800.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.680]  But the £800 I refused to pay, even at my sentence, and I got my lawyer to actually
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.360]  read a statement to the judge saying that any community service you give me, I'm going
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.720]  to refuse to do it, any fine you give me, I'm going to refuse to pay it, but the judge
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.200]  decided to give me the fine anyway.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:35.280]  I refused to pay it, and because I refused to pay it, instead of the police coming to
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.880]  get me, they just seized the money from my account without telling me.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.400]  Unbelievable, and Paul Watson did a great report on this free show, John Cleese and others,
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.600]  Highling Hitler doing all this, and obviously he's not supporting Hitler, but even if John
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.280]  Cleese did support Hitler, it's his right to do it, it's your right to boycott it.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.600]  And that's why John Cleese has left the UK, he says to the Caribbean, he says it's no
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.600]  longer a free country.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.000]  And he's moved to an island that's 90% black, he says he's really happy to be with the black
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.400]  folks, he says he doesn't want to be around all the authoritarian's in the UK.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.960]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.840]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.280]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.160]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:26.360]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago, and we've
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.880]  seen massive increases in polls, support for the president, and what he's doing in this
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:34.720]  trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.120]  That's beautiful.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.200]  Americans aren't going to be bullied, and we aren't going to back down.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.240]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.480]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up, and all you've done is
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.840]  awaken the human spirit.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:55.120]  And the human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com, and I'm asking listeners,
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.120]  whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light and the dark of the night.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.200]  We are the resistance.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:10.160]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:17.520]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:31.160]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones, or infowars.com.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.840]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.080]  This is racketeering.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.080]  This is cartels.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:37.560]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.440]  We need it now.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:41.120]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.760]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.760]  populist organization.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.840]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.120]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.000]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.840]  of freedom and free speech.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.000]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:36.600]  They'll take everybody else down.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:43.160]  You've been de-platformed some, but I've been watching Sargon of Akkad for years, but I
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:48.320]  always butcher how you say it, but meeting him in person, he's a larger-than-life character,
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.320]  and so are you.
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:50.320]  Thanks very much.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.640]  Too bad he had to get back to Florida, the families they're visiting.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.760]  He kind of ran off for the day to come see us.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:59.960]  Yeah, he snuck away from his family to come and hang out, and unfortunately had to go
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:00.960]  back.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:04.240]  That's crazy how he used to work at the big think tanks and for the government doing
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:08.920]  big demographic studies and stuff, and he's a smart guy, and he's a liberal, and he thinks
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.680]  that the leftist are the number one threat.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:15.240]  Well, that's the thing is, it's not the entirety of the left, it is the far left, but the problem
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.880]  is you're getting the sensible people on the left who are the true liberals who are fine
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.240]  with other people having opinions.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:24.880]  They want to have discussions, debates, they want to do things sensibly, but they're getting
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.560]  attacked by their own far lefties.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:29.720]  This is the thing is we'll get de-platformed from universities all the time, but you'll
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:34.560]  get actual left-wingers who are true liberals who are actually getting de-platformed as well,
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.800]  because they are far left enough.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.480]  Basically, you're not a communist, so you're not allowed free speech, just standard typical
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:45.760]  authoritarian stuff, just like you've seen with Stalin, Pol Pot, you know, all that type
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.760]  of stuff.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:50.520]  And it's getting more and more radical now, like a black hole, because everyone's trying
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:56.400]  to outstage the other person to where now I've seen videos in San Francisco all over
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:01.240]  where the black students now will come up and just beat up white students, or they're
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:05.360]  listening to rap music or they have dreadlocks, saying you're not allowed to culturally appropriate,
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:07.520]  and the schools are like, well, they probably need to be beaten.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:12.680]  You know, it's like the so-called training, you know, a guy in a dress in Australia, attacking
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:17.320]  people with axes, for no reason, and the judge said, you only get six years because you're
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.320]  a victim.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:21.720]  Well, now the higher court came and said, no, you're getting 40-something years.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  I didn't know that.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.240]  I knew the person, good Charles, I never knew they only get six, but then the high
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.800]  court said, you're a victim.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:32.400]  So you need to go, you know, you were upset because some girl online turned you down and
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.400]  you're a victim.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:36.880]  So because you're a higher class person, other people will get, you know, life in prison
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.880]  for an axe attack.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.880]  You only get six years.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.000]  I thought countries were supposed to operate on the ethos of everyone is equal under the
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  law.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  They want everyone to want to sterilize themselves to get up some free goodies.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  It's about the population.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  Really?
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Jesus Christ.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:58.040]  I think I have noticed that as well, that a lot of people now aren't very family focused.
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:00:59.040]  Nobody is child focused.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:02.640]  Nobody wants to actually get married, have children and settle down.
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:03.640]  I have noticed that.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.760]  Like I got a bunch of people that were giving me, giving me a little bit of cheek because
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:10.920]  I'm married now and I plan on having kids.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.480]  People give you problems.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.080]  But oh, if people from India have 10 kids, it's great.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.200]  Bring them in and give them all welfare.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.240]  People from, you know, from, from, from Pakistan or people from wherever.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:20.240]  That's great.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.920]  So, oh, if the Europeans having children, you know, back, my ex-wife, I had three children
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.280]  with her and I saw this once, but she would tell me that whole foods people would come
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:32.880]  up and say rude things to her because we had three good looking kids.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:33.880]  Well, why?
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:34.880]  Why would why not?
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.280]  Because you're not, it's hurting the earth, man.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.560]  You heard Prince Harry and his wife said they're only having two kids.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.560]  Yeah.
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.560]  They'd say the earth.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.080]  So what type of problems do you get because you're married now?
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.080]  That's not.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:46.080]  It was just the type of thing.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.600]  Even when I was mentioning it, a few people, I'm getting married and it's like, really,
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:49.600]  you're doing that.
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.120]  I was like, yeah, well, I'm 30 now, I kind of want to, you know, your, your, your 20s
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.920]  are for having fun and messing around.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:56.920]  My 20s are over now.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:00.920]  It's, you know, time to be a man, you know, you get, that's my 10 year window for drinking
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  and partying.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:02.920]  It's over now.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:03.920]  I'm going to settle down and have kids now.
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:12.160]  She added that 12 to 18, but yeah, I did that too, yeah, I was really bad anyway.
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.160]  I'm not knocking.
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.160]  Yeah, but that's good.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:15.160]  That's good.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:16.160]  Have some kids.
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.160]  Yeah.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.160]  How many do you want to have?
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.160]  Three.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.160]  Yeah.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.160]  We'll get going.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.520]  That's what, that's what we're, that's what we're in the process of doing just now.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.720]  You know, by being out here, you're actually kind of holding me back.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.600]  You know, could be, could be out saving the earth right now, but you know, you had to,
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:31.600]  you had to come out.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:32.600]  You got to save the earth of more humans.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:36.520]  It's kind of being more carbon dioxide that helps the plants grow faster and help.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:37.520]  They don't want that.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.520]  Yeah.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.240]  That's, that's the one thing that I don't understand as well is everyone is knocking
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.080]  the climate change stuff.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:47.480]  Now I do agree that pollution absolutely is a huge problem, but the reason that the first
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:51.200]  world is so developed is because we had an industrial revolution, right?
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.680]  We had an industrial revolution.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.000]  We had factories, we had production, we had jobs, we had this huge economic boom.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.760]  Third world countries aren't going to be able to achieve that if we don't do that.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:04.520]  Let's talk about, and Prager U has the best breakdown of this.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:05.520]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.520]  About demographics.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  Let's talk about that.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:08.520]  Give the number up.
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:09.520]  We'll come back with Count Dankula.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  He's a dank gentleman.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:17.760]  He's a lot, a lot of fun to hang out with, take with us.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.800]  One half of the incredible eight pack power stack, the AM wake up and work package is
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:24.320]  exactly what you need to start your day right.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.880]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.360]  individual needs in the morning, targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  and more.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:39.480]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, neutropic brain
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:42.000]  and greens detox formula.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.760]  With the PM pack in the eight pack power stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.200]  Containing four original formulas, the PM rest and recover pack will build up your body's
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.800]  defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:00.840]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep and immune support formulas.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  The PM packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system all while
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:07.560]  you rest from the day's work.
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.640]  When combined with the AM wake up and work packet, it makes the eight pack power stack
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:36.040]  the new can't miss info wars life product.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:50.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:57.640]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen we have Count Dankula here in studio with us and again
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:02.160]  describe yourself your history you've reached I mean I'd say billions of people probably
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.280]  I mean I've had over five billion views on YouTube till they banned me just the ones
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:11.200]  on our own channels a lot more than that there's people like PewDiePie that you know people
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:15.360]  over 25 probably don't know who PewDiePie is but he's got over a hundred billion views
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:20.720]  on YouTube alone there's nothing even close to that in the world but you never hear about
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:24.560]  it because the corporate media wants to ignore what it doesn't control.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:28.440]  This is the thing is they come after PewDiePie all the time because the media don't like
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:33.720]  the fact that someone operating from their bedroom can gather just as much power as them
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:36.440]  and I think it's with younger people a lot of people are looking at the media they're
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.520]  getting bored they're catching the media lying all the time.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:43.400]  A lot of young people find the mainstream media actually quite cringy and embarrassing
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:47.080]  to be a part of and they don't want anything to do with it so they turn to the YouTubers
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:50.640]  they turn to the internet to get their news and get their information which is why which
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.560]  is why that people like PewDiePie are so popular like which is why the Wall Street Journal
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:06:00.760]  tried to burn PewDiePie down they came after him because he made a few edgy jokes and everything
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:05.240]  but it was the same and since we made it 100% clear that these were intended as jokes they
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:08.800]  were intended as comedy they weren't racist he's not an ass he's not a white suit.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.880]  But even here's the problem yeah every time somebody gets censored Joe Rogan or people
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.520]  that are really smart though that wasn't racist what the professor said or that wasn't racist
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:22.160]  when the community said that since when if you don't like somebody don't go watch their
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.440]  comedy show or don't watch their show or boycott if you want but it doesn't mean you get arrested
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:31.560]  and that's the laws are trying to pass here they have said in the news Georgetown University
[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:36.120]  suing me over made up stuff at Charlottesville I never said the whole Sandy Hook thing they
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.360]  say they want to kill the First Amendment they want to set a precedent that if somebody
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:45.800]  says their feelings are hurt you get sued you lose or you get arrested this is what
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:49.880]  they say when the left walks by me in public they go aren't you supposed to be in prison
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:58.480]  by now that's the thing is it's it's an example of just the peak narcissism of them like say
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:02.280]  for example if I'm at a comedy club I'm there with a hundred other people the comedians
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:05.440]  telling jokes I don't like I'll just walk out and leave I'll just say this isn't for
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:11.480]  me by but these people will be the ones to stand up demand that the show gets shut down
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:15.680]  demand that this comedian be fired and then demand that this person's life be ruined because
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.360]  they don't think that they should alter themselves to fit into the world they think that the whole
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:24.000]  world should change to suit them it's absolute narcissism if there is someone that you don't
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.200]  like just don't watch it and the argument that they usually make against that is oh
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:31.720]  but if this person is sketch to speak and gets to say all these racist and edgy jokes
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:36.200]  then other people might become racist well from the thing from what I've gathered in
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:40.600]  my discussions with actual genuine Nazis and actual genuine white supremacists because
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.880]  the only way you're going to be able to understand them is to actually speak to them is the main
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.720]  reason that they have become the way that they are is because of their demonization
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:52.440]  by the media and also the treatment by the left they're basically being formed as a counter
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:56.920]  to the things that to the basically the far lefts authoritarianism they are the biggest
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:01.520]  cause for the rise in the far right because young people are being radicalized into it
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:06.960]  because of the way that they are being treated by authoritarian left wing militant groups
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:15.040]  primarily Antifa and of course Antifa is this protected group worldwide funded by the
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:19.960]  big banks by the big foundations calling for communism but financed by billionaires
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:24.840]  the authoritarians that have resorted to violence because they've lost the argument they won't
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:28.920]  meet in debate because they know that they'll lose because basically if you go into a debate
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:32.440]  hall and you are advocating for taking away a person's right to speak a person's right
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.240]  to produce any type of art or media that they would wish to produce and just overall advocating
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.560]  for taking away the freedoms and individual liberties of people just so that you can force
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:50.480]  in your demonstrably bad poor and ill thought out political ideology then you know they've
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:55.080]  lost they've lost the argument that all this is is the equivalent of a child having a tantrum
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.720]  right Antifa are a child having a tantrum because they've been told no you can't get
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.200]  what you want because it is a bad idea like look at Venezuela look at North Korea look
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:09.000]  at Soviet Russia look at China right now you're even getting people in Antifa that are being
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.680]  trying to be apologetic for China they're trying to make excuses for China invading Hong Kong
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:17.800]  they're basically like what was some of the things that they were going oh well Hong Kong
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:25.560]  technically did belong to China in the first place just last week there was sprayed all over
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:33.400]  Austin China is good and communism is coming in hammers and sickles and Antifa rise up overthrow
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:43.040]  America and so one of my crew members that's been here 15 16 years longer I see 17 his
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:47.720]  sister barely talks to him won't talk to his mom won't let her see the grandkids because
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:52.200]  she voted for Trump and she had a great relationship with her mom and she said I just hope China
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:56.480]  can take out Trump so the average Democrat now it was been the Washington Post New York
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.760]  Times is now seeing China as the savior I was telling people this two and a half years ago
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:08.520]  when the dictator Xi went to Davos and there was headlines and Reuters you know G G 20
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:14.920]  and Davos looks to China to stop Trump and America and it was it's just it's crazy that
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:20.520]  the instincts of America to hate their own country is to support a mass murdering regime
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:25.360]  who is unelected took over China killed 150 million people the people that ran to Hong
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:31.000]  Kong and Taiwan have been there for 70 years and now China builds a huge bridge to Hong
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.520]  Kong takes over the government announces they're going to start secretly arresting
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:39.440]  everybody the people start tearing down light poles that have face-cannon cameras and battling
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.480]  back and the left is like get those people how dare they wave American flags they're
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:48.280]  also trying to brand them as fascists and far right it's the fact is like that's that's
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:53.400]  the point that they've arrived at now where if you want freedom individual liberty small
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:58.200]  government you are somehow a far right fascist what they small government is the opposite
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:03.200]  of fascism like people on the far like used to get the classic liberals that were just
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.240]  like you know peace and love everyone can do what they want as long as you're not messing
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:11.200]  with me I'm not going to mess with you but they've now morphed into people that I remember
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.080]  being left-wing when I was a teenager the last thing that we would ever have wanted
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:20.120]  is to give the government more power but now nowadays the modern left love that they want
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.440]  by government they want people's rights being taken away and they're entitled they're naive
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:28.040]  but on average they come for middle-class or upper-class families and they've been told
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:32.440]  by the professors you're going to rule when we overthrow and take over you're going to
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.600]  go right to being a commander in a black uniform you know literally in camps beating Christians
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:42.440]  brains out that I got an article here with us for what cover when we come back this professor
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:47.760]  was just removed here in the US because he said I want to kill Christians I want to go
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:52.400]  out and attack I want to kill Trump I want to overthrow America so at least there's pushback
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:58.160]  now that no Antifa just because you're a protected method government employee or professor movement
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.760]  or journalists so-called journalists that put on black mask at night just because you're
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:06.200]  supposed to rule you ain't going to do it because we're going to intellectually beat
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:11.040]  you we're going to economically beat you we're going to culturally beat you and your chai
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.240]  comms are now in a pincer grip and we're going to free China so get ready for that little
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.200]  slime bags you will never get all the power you think you're going to get even if your
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.520]  controllers got control you're the first group that they'll wipe off their shoes that's how
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:27.760]  history works dumbasses not talking to the audience talking to the Antifa that works for

[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:05.480]  nothing like a pootie pie or probably even a Count Denkula when it comes to the young

[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:30.040]  to Walmart I don't want to give that money to people going to donate it to causes I

[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.520]  pays my son used to get these little sore throat and he puts x2 in water and drinks
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:50.640]  it and it gets rid of his sore throat let me break this down for you I want high quality
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.000]  stuff in there I want a good price but I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.600]  buys when it's 50% off I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:03.800]  like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:08.120]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss leader because
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:12.120]  if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship then we're doing 50% off
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:15.680]  and then you do something like that we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:22.280]  thanks for the support Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:27.240]  was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.120]  who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:36.800]  Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:42.040]  in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:47.040]  pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.800]  to back down so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:56.240]  to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:01.320]  done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:06.800]  wars dot com and I'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those links because we are the
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:20.840]  light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:47.320]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:19:07.400]  on
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:16.840]  Democrats introducing legislation saying if someone creates discord, they should be arrested.
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:22.160]  That's a mazy in a way or whatever name is from Hawaii.
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.640]  And then we've also got the Congresswoman from Florida that we played the clips of over
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.720]  and over again saying if somebody makes fun of us, we're going to indict you.
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:34.440]  They mean it.
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:36.800]  This is what they're talking about.
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:39.360]  This is what they're doing.
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:43.200]  But if you're committing real crimes in these leftist-controlled blue cities, they're not
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:44.200]  coming.
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:45.200]  Now, why is that?
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:50.440]  The Austin mayor was on KLBJ about a month ago, and I happened to be taking that day off
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:55.200]  to fish with my kids, and they were getting ready with the fishing poles out of the lake.
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:01.080]  And I put on 590 a.m. local talk station, and there was the mayor saying, oh, we've
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:05.480]  passed an ordinance that the homeless can camp on anywhere in your front yard so you
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:09.000]  know that there's a problem so the city will vote for more money.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.680]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:15.760]  They say come here, use drugs, be homeless, and then the problem increases because it's
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.480]  a lifestyle catering to people who are given money to buy drugs and alcohol, and the left
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:23.560]  gives them money on top of it to defecate all over the streets.
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:26.640]  And now Austin looks like San Francisco 10 years ago.
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:27.640]  It's horrible.
[02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:29.160]  But San Francisco is collapsing.
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:30.160]  No tourism, no anything.
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.000]  Same thing with Portland.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.120]  Washington has big problems up in Seattle.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.840]  Baltimore, D.C., the list goes on and on.
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:39.840]  Why?
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:43.960]  It's the same reason they want to federalize the police and cause crises to bring in control.
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:44.960]  Same reason.
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:50.080]  When the left gets full control, they want to collapse our major cities and declare a
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.520]  national emergency to fully federalize them.
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:21:01.360]  They want to do it under Trump, but they want to do it once the Democrats get back in.
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:07.040]  The report, Baltimore police afraid to arrest anyone out of fear of political backlash.
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:09.200]  There's a video of it.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:14.760]  And that's why you see in Baltimore a whole bunch of cops getting shot two weeks ago.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:19.720]  And when they're going in with the ambulances, when they got shot, the people are hitting
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:24.240]  them, screaming at them, throwing water bottles at them, and calling them the N-word.
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:28.200]  Other blacks are calling black officers that because they're the enemy.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:31.760]  And so they're saying, okay, we can't come into your areas then.
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:35.280]  And then the crime rate explodes like south side Chicago.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:37.320]  So these are no-go zones we're talking about.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.720]  The left's creating them on purpose, bringing in the Islamics, knowing they'll do it.
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:42.760]  Here's another one, because I mentioned it in the last segment.
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:46.400]  Iowa College removes professor who declared I'm anti-fuck.
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:50.000]  He also reportedly shared shockingly violent Facebook posts about how much he wanted to
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.920]  kill Christians, kill Trump, and kill others.
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:59.640]  Well, he's now been removed, or in a campus reform report, Kleisman announced last week
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:02.760]  that he supported the movement which drew immediate backlash.
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:06.280]  He called for anti-fuck, again, to kill Christians and more.
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:09.520]  And he's now been removed from the college that he was at.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.520]  I read this this morning.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.840]  I'm looking for what college he was in here.
[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:18.360]  It was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Kirkwood Community College.
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.800]  And so I don't want to just mention things.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:23.680]  I want to show you those, but at least there's some pushback against this.
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:26.880]  I see callers here asking, and we'll go to Wes in a moment.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:32.440]  They want to ask you, Count Dracula, where does it all end?
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:36.640]  I think ultimately what we're just going to result in is we need political candidates
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:40.680]  to actually get up and take the effort to run for government and run for higher positions
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:45.160]  who are freedom-loving people that actually do care about the countries that they are
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:46.160]  a part of.
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:48.360]  For example, you're getting politicians that are going in it now.
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:49.360]  They want the money.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.360]  They want the fame.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:51.360]  They want the power.
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:56.400]  There are very few politicians actually go into politics with the intent of helping people.
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.760]  They use helping people as a facade to get the votes.
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:03.720]  For example, there are very few politicians that I actually respect and I actually would
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:04.720]  vote for.
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:08.760]  For example, I really like Trump because he's brought black unemployment all the way right
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.920]  down, which is fantastic.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:10.920]  That's excellent.
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:11.920]  I want everyone to have jobs.
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:15.600]  I want everyone to be able to afford the family home with the white-pocket fence and the dog
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:16.880]  and the 2.5 kids.
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:20.720]  I want that for absolutely everyone, and Trump is helping people achieve that.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:26.000]  I also am starting to like Tulsi Gabbard because she actually wants to come after big tech
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.200]  censorship as well, and she spoke about this even before personally she was affected by
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:32.200]  it.
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:35.680]  And plus, notice none of the Democrats like her, and they're all rigging Google searches.
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:42.200]  Oh yeah, basically after the Democratic debate where she absolutely bodied Kamala Harris.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.200]  She annihilated Kamala Harris.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:48.560]  She was number three trending on Twitter, Twitter noticed, and she was gone.
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.560]  And by the way...
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.560]  Yeah.
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:54.160]  She could eventually be Trump, young, good-looking, a veteran, well-spoken, a real liberal.
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:57.600]  She has some things I don't like about her, but you're right, she's legitimate and comes
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:01.160]  off as a real person, and they are scared of her.
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:02.160]  And take Trump.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:05.880]  If Trump can be the turnaround guy to save America, his name will be gold.
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.320]  If isn't, he'll be destroyed.
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:09.560]  That's why he's really trying to fix things.
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:13.840]  Yeah, that's why those are two examples of politicians I'm looking at, and they actually
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:15.880]  genuinely seem to want to help people.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.120]  There are a lot of others that don't care.
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.880]  What people at home should do is go out, get involved, join political parties, form your
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.360]  own political party, and go into government with the sole intention of protecting the
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.280]  freedoms and rights of others.
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:30.280]  That's right.
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:32.880]  That's all governments there, is to ensure that people's rights are there.
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:33.960]  They don't give you your rights.
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  It's there to protect them.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.200]  And when governments become destructive of those rights, it is not just our right, it
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:42.600]  is our duty to remove and abolish those governments, and that's the Declaration of Independence.
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:43.600]  Yes.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:47.120]  You're so lucky that you guys have your bill of rights and your constitution, because
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:49.320]  we don't have anything like that.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:53.200]  Our rights are treated more like privileges that the state can take away from you at any
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:54.200]  point.
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:55.200]  Well, they've reversed Magna Carta.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:00.040]  I remember in 1998, Tony Blair said, we're abolishing Magna Carta.
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:01.040]  Yeah.
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.520]  That was in the BBC headline.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.720]  We're abolishing Magna Carta.
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:09.280]  So the beginning of people standing up really is 1215, runny mead in what's the UK today,
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.280]  England.
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.600]  But it's devolved back now.
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:12.600]  Yeah.
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.400]  It's basically, authoritarians are just being authoritarians.
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:18.440]  They're trying to take away all the little freedoms and rights that we have slowly, but
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.360]  surely so that they can have full control over is Jordan, Jordan V Peterson when he was
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.320]  on Joe Rogan actually defined it a really, really good way where the government will
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.360]  push a little tiny bit until people start to scream and then it will stop.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:33.480]  And then when everyone comes down, it will push a little tiny bit again and then stop
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:37.280]  and it will just keep doing this process over and over and over again until you've just
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.440]  walked into all of your rights and privileges and liberties just being completely taken away.
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:42.600]  And that is what the government wants.
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.600]  It doesn't care about you.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:46.640]  It cares about controlling you.
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:49.480]  And it's going to do everything that it can to make sure that that's because there's
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.880]  special interest coming in and using our once free governments to convert us to something
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:54.880]  like China.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.040]  I mean, that's the goal.
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:57.040]  That is the goal.
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.320]  Like even when you look at the freedom of speech laws that we have right now, everyone's
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:01.600]  saying, oh, it's to protect people.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:02.600]  It's to protect their freedoms.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:07.440]  See, if you look at the way China started, China didn't just become China overnight.
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:11.160]  There was a slow process in building all of these laws up until like you addressed it
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.920]  earlier, you know, it starts with these laws are to protect the people, then these laws
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:19.520]  Oh, yeah, it took Mao about 10 years to really get rolling and he used the colleges as the
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:23.160]  first place to say, basically, you know, we're going to kill everybody.
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.560]  And then he used the Mao brigades were like brown shirts to do it.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:27.560]  Yeah.
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.680]  It starts with protecting people.
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.760]  Then it moves on to protecting politicians.
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:35.440]  Like you said earlier, you know, politicians have calling for all of people criticizes.
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.440]  They should be arrested.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.440]  They should be this.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:40.040]  And we have an example of that actually happened in Britain, which I'll get into in a minute.
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:43.800]  But then ultimately, after the politicians, what's next, the government is about criticism
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.600]  of the government itself, because if you can criticize the government and point out the
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:51.160]  sketchy things the government's doing, that will turn the people against the government
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:52.960]  and that puts the government's authority.
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:55.880]  And I see the UK government going, this could undermine the government.
[02:26:55.880 --> 02:26:56.880]  Good.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.040]  They're like, this could just credit us.
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:00.040]  Yeah, because you're able, you deserve to be just credited.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:01.040]  We're going to come back.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:06.920]  I promise to West and Ryan and Rod and Brian and Travis and Tim and Jackson and Joey and
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:09.480]  Doug and everybody straight ahead with Count Dankle.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.200]  I'm Alex Jones, newswars.com, infowars.com.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:16.040]  Only you can share those links, thank you.
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.600]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:22.520]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.200]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:29.680]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.800]  my life.
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:36.040]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:40.640]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.400]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:49.080]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:51.400]  and totally change your life.
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:56.640]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.920]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:00.920]  Get clean.
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:17.000]  Until now and learn more, 800-506-6740, 800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.880]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:27.280]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:30.200]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:35.400]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago and we've
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.840]  seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's doing in
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.760]  this trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:44.760]  That's beautiful.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.240]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:52.280]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:57.040]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:58.040]  the human spirit.

[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:07.480]  This stuff is the real deal.

[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:36.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:41.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:43.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:51.640]  We've really built something amazing here together.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:56.640]  The listeners, the viewers of this show, all the supporters over the years, the great crew
[02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.440]  and all the guests.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:02.720]  And it stands in defiance of the establishment.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:06.840]  I just hope listeners realize that most of these big YouTubers and people that are really
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:11.600]  the vanguard of waking up young people and others have all been demonetized.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:16.120]  But they're still fighting on and they're trying to put a lot of them in prison.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:17.200]  They're suing them as well.
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:22.360]  So just remember that people like Steven Crowder and others, when you buy the mug from him
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:26.400]  as mug club and things like that, that keeps them going.
[02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:30.680]  And a lot of these organizations are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:36.520]  I'm going to cover this tomorrow because it's in all the documents and I covered it
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:41.520]  two and a half years ago, but then even Rolling Stone and a few others actually covered it.
[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:47.000]  It was just shocking to see Matt Taibbi write about it, how Obama and Hillary still run
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.840]  part of the CIA.
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:54.040]  They funded these stay-behind groups and that the Democrats and Congress are commanding
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:58.240]  them in congressional hearings to shut down conservatives.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:04.680]  And these media groups were given $2 billion.
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:05.680]  It's Taibbi.
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:07.480]  Censorship does not end well.
[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:12.920]  Taibbi, beware of the slippery slope of Facebook censorship.
[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:18.520]  And the articles attack me, but they say, hey, he's how they got the left to accept
[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:23.880]  the end of free speech by demonizing Jones, by creating a straw man, and then getting
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:30.480]  people to accept my supposed destruction, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:36.040]  Then the whole door got blown off of the submarine and all the tyranny swatted in.
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:41.560]  So please don't forget, I guess the way that God works or however this happens, we keep
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:46.000]  bringing in just the amount of money we need to operate.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.120]  And I want to expand.
[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:50.040]  I want to launch some new shows, which we're doing next month.
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:55.960]  I want to be able to put reporters in the field, like we've done with overall four reporters
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:57.200]  in Hong Kong.
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:00.240]  I want to be able to do all these things.
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:02.840]  And without you buying the products, we cannot do it.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:05.480]  So just check out infowarstore.com.
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:06.480]  Get a t-shirt.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.480]  Get a book.

[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:11.480]  Get a great water filter you and your family need.
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:17.240]  Get the new nano silver skin cream that we've got from the same great folks that brought
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:22.760]  you the super silver wound gel that's patented and so incredibly popular.
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:24.120]  This is proprietary.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:25.840]  We work with them to develop this.
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.920]  This is a brand new thing that just came out last week.
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.040]  Folks are already getting it in their mail.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:34.640]  They're already giving it five stars.
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.240]  Life.com takes you right to all the supplements and all the other products.
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:42.520]  Again, the super silver wound gel is a drug.
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.080]  It's FDA approved over the counter.
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:46.040]  The strongest available over the counter.
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:47.800]  This company let me private label that.
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:51.320]  I'm the only people that are allowed to do that.
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:53.360]  We then discount it.
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:59.960]  The super silver cream is the same nano silver, but it's just not gone through all the approval
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:04.360]  to say approve for over the counter in the drug section.
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:05.680]  None of it means anything.
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:10.880]  Again, what the FDA does is they got a law passed in 96 trying to outlaw supplements and
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:13.800]  Congress said, and Ron Paul is critical fighting this.
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:17.440]  They said, no, we're not saying we're drugs.
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.080]  You have no jurisdiction.
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:24.280]  So the FDA said, okay, well, you have to say not approved by the FDA.
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:27.120]  So they're always like, Jones sells unapproved things.
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:33.560]  Well, that's because the FDA makes all the supplement companies sit there and say that
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:38.640]  it is not approved by them because by law, they don't have that jurisdiction to be able
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:39.640]  to even do that.
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:43.360]  But then they try to come in and regulate people who are claiming that they're drugs.
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:46.800]  Well, we're not saying these are drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:49.000]  We're not saying that krill oil is a drug.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.920]  We're not saying that clean iodine is a drug.
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.400]  This is all from Mother Nature that God gave us.
[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:56.960]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's our high quality coffee, they even try to say
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:58.480]  my coffee's a scam.
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:04.440]  Good self-coffee and toothpaste, damn bastard, a scam that you need toothpaste.
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:06.440]  He's a toothpaste snake oil salesman.
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:07.600]  Well, guess what?
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.600]  People love super blue.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:11.560]  4 to 5 colloidal silver and iodine, no fluoride is in it.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:17.160]  So again, we are very, very, very excited about all of this.
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.960]  We're energized by it.
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:21.360]  And this new product is really putting wind in our sales.
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:23.760]  The only problem is I put in a medium-sized order for it.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:25.720]  It looks like it's going to sell out the next couple of weeks.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.920]  So I've got it in the 25% off at the end of this week, take advantage of it.
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:34.320]  We have it in the smaller containers and we have it in the larger containers, ladies
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:35.520]  and gentlemen.
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.600]  One of the smaller containers is $7.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:44.840]  The larger container is $14 in FullWarsStore.com or triple 82533139.
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:51.480]  We're going to these phone calls here with Count Dancula, but we're going to take calls.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.800]  What other points after we take calls do you want to get into?
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.800]  Anything, I'm easy.
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:56.800]  You can do whatever you want.
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:58.800]  You wanted to get into Epstein when we talked today.
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:36:59.800]  Yes.
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:03.120]  So we'll also hit some of that after we take some of these calls.
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:04.800]  Let's go ahead and go to Weston, Indiana.
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:06.800]  Weston, thanks for holding your own the year.
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:10.400]  Yeah, I just want to say quickly, I take your H2.
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:12.600]  I've taken it for two years.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:17.480]  I went from 285 pounds to 225 pounds.
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:20.680]  I quit taking it and the weight started coming back on.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:26.040]  I take it again and now it's back down to 225 and I've done nothing else.
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:29.640]  But anyway, I just wanted to stay and ask you.
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:34.440]  You said one time with classic, I don't know where this is going to end, but if you want
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:36.560]  to fight, you got one.
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:43.440]  And considering everything's going on, I just wondered and asked your guest, we're just
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:44.440]  going to end it.
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:49.840]  It has to end somewhere, you know, eventually the fly's got to land.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:50.840]  That's right.
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:54.280]  I mean, something this, look at how all the old timers warned of a world government and
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:57.480]  left this banning speech and killing babies after they're born.
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:58.960]  It's all going on.
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:00.200]  And then what comes next?
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:01.400]  I mean, we were right.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:05.960]  We have real tyranny, not on our doorstep, but up our, you know what?
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.960]  Yeah, we definitely do.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:11.520]  It's going to come to a point where the government is just going to get replaced.
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:12.960]  It's just going to be completely replaced.
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.120]  Like people are very, very unhappy with the stuff they're doing.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:16.120]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:17.920]  I think they're going to be removed.
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:18.920]  Yeah.
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:21.520]  I think they definitely are, hopefully, through a democratic process.
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:24.280]  That's what we're working for, brother.
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:25.280]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:29.680]  It's definitely going to come, basically, career politicians, they're just become absolute
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:31.080]  snakes and they don't care about people.
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:33.680]  And the more and more we can wake people up to that, eventually there's going to come
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.000]  a day where the generation below us are just going to vote all of them out.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.640]  They're all gone and they're going to replace it with people that actually love freedom
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.440]  and actually care about the countries they're supposed to be helping.
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:43.440]  Well, you're right.
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.160]  And plus there's a tipping point historically where you have a good virtuous culture, corruptions
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:49.160]  it put up with.
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  You have a huge expansion, a golden age, and then corruption sets in, takes over, sets
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.160]  up the system.
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:57.680]  In a few generations, everything collapses again.
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:59.400]  It is a cycle.
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:03.160]  And so people that have given up faith that good doesn't exist or that things couldn't
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:05.800]  turn around, no, we're hitting the bottom now.
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:12.880]  And every real historian worked their salt from Camille Paglia to people like, I mean,
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:16.160]  you name it, Pat Buchanan, agrees that we're entering the bottom.
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:22.040]  I think what's the name of the cycle is that good men create great times, great times create
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:27.640]  weak men, weak men create bad times, bad times create good men, like that's, I think I've
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:28.640]  completely butchered that.
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:29.640]  No, you didn't.
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:30.640]  You said it perfectly.
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:37.680]  Victor Hugo, the French philosopher and statesman said, prosperity makes men, prosperity makes
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:38.680]  monsters.
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:39.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:43.760]  I think we're basically approaching the time now where we're going to create good and
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:46.040]  strong men because of the way things are going.
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:49.600]  And I believe that these strong men are going to be the ones that change it against starting
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:50.600]  with the government.
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:54.800]  I totally agree because I'm not and God bless you, West, thanks for the call.
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:58.200]  I'm not saying this act tougher than there's a lot of people can kick my ass, but I was
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:02.760]  a sweet little boy and really nice and into art and I liked fishing and hunting and stuff
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:03.760]  and riding the horses.
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:05.720]  But I was really sweet.
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.320]  And then my parents took me out of private school in sixth grade and put me in a school
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:14.480]  in Dallas and it was so politically correct that the white kids were all out to be beaten
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.240]  up by kids that were black and Hispanic or were three years older.
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:19.240]  And it was just what went on.
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:22.640]  Well, by the time I got in seventh grade, I spent people in the hospital and they could
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:25.160]  never do anything because I'm like, hey, this kid's two years older than me.
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:26.160]  He attacked me.
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.160]  I jumped on top of Islamist head in the ground.
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:28.160]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:29.160]  He's in a coma.
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.160]  They're like, what the hell is this kid?
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:32.360]  And then by high school, I had to fight all their brothers and cousins.
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.480]  And then by the high school, I had to fight their big brothers that were gotten out of
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.280]  a looster for, you know, a tipped murder.
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:42.400]  And so I was in some real fights and I'll leave it at that.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:48.640]  And it unlocked in me this savageness and this crazed viciousness, not in a bad way,
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:53.320]  and just these things that unlocked these weapons systems that made me who I am.
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:54.920]  I would not be who I am.
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:56.320]  And that's why they want to keep you domesticated.
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.800]  I'm not saying go out and get in fights and stuff.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.520]  That's why they don't want rites of passage or really hard competitive sports or boxing
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:04.840]  or jujitsu or mountain climbing or any of that.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:08.680]  Because if you go through pain and go through a lot, you come out a lot stronger.
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:09.680]  And I did.
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:10.680]  No exaggeration.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:15.920]  I probably got in 150 really serious fights and it made me who I am right back.
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:21.880]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:26.280]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.160]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:33.880]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:38.400]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:42.720]  doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:44.160]  That's beautiful.
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:47.200]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:51.240]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world that want to intimidate
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:56.000]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  the human spirit.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:03.120]  And the human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com and I'm asking listeners,
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:07.160]  whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:08.240]  We are the resistance.
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:37.240]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:43:01.120]  We're
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:03.440]  and the M4's audience has broken through that.
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:06.080]  They are the bridge from the EU of founding
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:08.800]  to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:11.280]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:13.120]  of the platforming, defamation,
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:15.200]  lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.560]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:26.640]  Make no mistake, it's, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:30.960]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:36.240]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:37.920]  Because it's a form of fascism.
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:42.000]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.280]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:49.040]  content associated with Alex Jones and Infowars.
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:44:00.000]  First take number Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:09.280]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:16.640]  You can't watch this, the movie available now at InfowarsStore.com
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:21.040]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people,
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:24.000]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.760]  in that if you go back five, six years ago,
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:28.720]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:30.640]  I would talk about how great the products are
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:32.240]  and how they were the best and why they were.
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:34.880]  And I'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:36.480]  And instead the last few years, I'm like,
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:38.960]  hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.640]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:42.640]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:44.480]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:48.720]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:51.280]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:54.640]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:56.640]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:59.280]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:02.480]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:04.240]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:05.440]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:07.280]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature,
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:10.960]  but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:16.160]  Info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:22.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:39.200]  The great Gerald Salente takes over at 15 after,
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.520]  but we're going to all the calls that are on hold.
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:44.560]  It's hard to interrupt this song right here.
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:47.920]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.960]  You were talking about how you've got all metal teeth
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:56.160]  because your profession before you became world famous on YouTube is a bouncer.
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:56.640]  Yeah.
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:59.760]  And I mean, you think that made you a more wary focus,
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:03.120]  a smart guy before you became a media superstar?
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:04.400]  Maybe a lot more stoic.
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:06.080]  You know, can see when you've got some guys,
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.160]  you know, really, really drunk and full of cocaine,
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:10.320]  you know, shouting in your face because you're throwing them out
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:11.840]  or you're telling him he's not getting in.
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:13.920]  And you just have to sit there with a straight face
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:16.000]  and not rise to him baiting you.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.760]  But obviously, if he tries to attack you,
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:19.120]  you are right on top of him.
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:20.560]  He's on the ground, you know,
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.480]  in a second before he knows what's happened.
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:25.200]  I think it developed me a lot as a person
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:27.920]  because I'm very, if I've got someone shouting in my face,
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:29.760]  I'm very good at not reacting to it.
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:33.520]  Like the Covington kids, they're bad for standing their ground.
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:35.920]  Oh, yeah, that kid literally did nothing,
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:37.440]  but stood there and smiled.
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:40.480]  And then suddenly he became the face of white supremacy
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:43.040]  in America, even though he was just a child.
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:45.120]  He was just a child that had no idea what to do.
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:47.760]  So he just stood there smiling awkwardly
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:49.520]  and the media tried to destroy his life
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:52.320]  when he literally didn't do anything.
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:55.840]  Here's an example of going to your calls.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:00.320]  Forced removal of transgender woman from downtown LA Bar
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:02.080]  investigating his possible hate crime.
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.000]  Turns out it's basically a liberal bar.
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:06.640]  Okay, they've never had the problem
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:08.480]  that the two groups were fighting.
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:09.760]  So they threw them all out
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:12.080]  and they've gone and talked to witnesses
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:17.120]  and no one said anything to them about being LBGTQP
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:18.240]  or whatever.
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:19.920]  Again, it's just like the sheriff's deputy
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:21.920]  in the same town said he got shot last week
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:23.680]  and he wasn't shot.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:24.400]  He just made it up.
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:26.480]  It's just making it up.
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.760]  I think it's the fact that they fall on it as an excuse.
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:31.360]  You know, for example, you know, if someone goes,
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:33.520]  oh, I didn't get this job because I'm gay.
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:34.800]  I didn't get this job because of this.
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:35.920]  I didn't get this job because of that.
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:37.840]  And it's always they always try and blame
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:40.560]  some identity politics part of themself
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:42.240]  and try and say the biggest, you know,
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:44.640]  bigotry and racism is the reason that I didn't get this
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:45.680]  and I didn't excel.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.280]  But it's here when you actually speak to these people,
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:48.800]  you kind of realize that they're very annoying.
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:49.760]  They're very arrogant.
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:52.160]  And they're basically that's the reason
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:53.280]  that you aren't getting these things.
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:55.120]  It's not to do with bigotry or racism.
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:57.040]  You're just using that to have something to blame.
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:59.600]  You're actually quite an annoying arrogant person
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.920]  and people don't want to associate with you.
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:03.520]  Like it's not bigotry or anything.
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:06.080]  Wait, have they released footage?
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.280]  Oh.
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:08.320]  Oh my God.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:11.520]  I'm gonna, I think footage may have been released.
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:12.360]  We're gonna find out.
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:15.040]  This does not look like the ladies being too nice.
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.200]  How dare them throw her out?
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:18.040]  Geez, man.
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:19.200]  I don't even like going to bars and stuff.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:22.160]  As most bouncers are nice, but a few times,
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:23.600]  you know, that they can be arrogant or whatever.
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:24.440]  Like, what are you looking at?
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:27.600]  But I mean, I mean, these people should have been thrown out.
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:28.720]  We're gonna review this.
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:30.760]  We're gonna go to calls right now and we'll come back to this.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:32.400]  I gotta get to these calls whenever we get to everybody.
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:33.520]  Who do we have here next?
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:36.120]  I was gonna go to a caller in France.
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:37.680]  Yes, Rob in France.
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:39.080]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:39.920]  You're on the air.
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:41.040]  Welcome.
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:42.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:45.200]  It's always, always good to talk to you.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.720]  Haven't got in for quite a long time.
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.960]  I wanna tell you, you're one of the best.
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:54.280]  Your snake oil products are absolutely fantastic.
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:56.120]  I'm a huge fan of DNA Force.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.600]  I bought a Pro Pure for myself
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:00.320]  and an Alexa Pure for my mom.
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:03.920]  Got a couple of subjects I wanna speak to you about.
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:04.760]  Thank you.
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:05.920]  First of all, I live in France.
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:07.320]  I've been here for about 20 years,
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:09.640]  but I'm originally from Dayton, Ohio.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:15.640]  My daughter was actually at the Oregon district
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.640]  and was giving CPR to one of the victims there.
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.760]  And I also follow Trump and I wrote in an SMS to him,
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:30.760]  on Twitter or whatever, that as bad as that shooting was,
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:37.800]  it's not as scary as what's going on in England right now.
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:42.800]  With the First Amendment being completely put aside,
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:46.600]  it's just awful and it's terrifying.
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:49.880]  And with the immigration problem in Europe,
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:51.120]  it's very widespread.
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:55.040]  You know, it's kind of a scary thing.
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:58.120]  I kind of follow Joel Richardson on Joel's trumpet.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:49:59.960]  I have nothing to do with this site,
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:01.600]  but it talks a lot about, you know,
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.240]  a lot of people have no who Tim LaHaye is
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:06.000]  and you know, a lot of Christian people.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.400]  And they look at the resurgence of the Roman Empire
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:11.400]  as the coming Antichrist.
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.000]  Well, there's another way to look at that as well
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.040]  with Joel Richardson who, like I said,
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.600]  speaks about this and talks about the
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  the Muslims being the resurgence of the Antichrist.
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:27.520]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:28.520]  I mean, here's the deal.
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:30.400]  I was against the First Iraq War,
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.600]  the Second Iraq War because it was wrong.
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:33.440]  It was based on lies.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.120]  It was designed to bring down moderate regimes
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.160]  and put the radicals in.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:39.920]  And that's what Obama phase two did to then flood Europe.
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:42.920]  This is a UN plan replacement population
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:46.360]  and the Islamists do not melting pot.
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:48.800]  They do not come to your country
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:52.040]  and then start integrating and into the system.
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:54.720]  They take over and that's a fact.
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:57.360]  And now it's happening and this is a larger plan.
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:01.200]  And of course, the left has now gotten rid of God
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:03.480]  and all the studies, but their God now is quote,
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:05.040]  equality and it was like,
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:07.040]  we were talking about a dinner last night,
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:10.720]  the temples, the cathedrals are the universities,
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:12.400]  the priests are the professors
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:14.000]  and this is their new religion.
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:15.480]  This is their takeover.
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:17.080]  Like that is very true.
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:19.840]  Like for example, we were making the comparisons last night
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:22.680]  saying that if you are born white and male,
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:25.240]  you're immediately guilty and your reparations for slavery
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:27.280]  and all colonialism and all the horrible things
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:28.760]  that white male just did in the past.
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:31.560]  So that's their version of original sin
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:33.880]  that you have to atone and apologize for.
[02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:35.200]  There's even basically,
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:37.760]  they have their 10 commandments pretty much as well
[02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:40.560]  where if you say absolutely anything about the,
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:42.160]  you know, the charts of social justice,
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:44.400]  you are immediately excommunicated and shunned
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:45.240]  from the community.
[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:46.520]  You can't question the priests.
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:47.920]  No, you're not allowed to question them.
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:50.240]  If you do it means you're a racist Nazi bigot.
[02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:52.120]  So the left needs a reformation.
[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:52.960]  It does.
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.480]  It does silly kid.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:56.680]  I wanted to just go to the classical way it was
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:51:58.480]  where, you know, there was some disagreements
[02:51:58.480 --> 02:51:59.480]  between the left and right,
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:01.680]  but both of them for the most part
[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:03.040]  did not trust big government,
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:04.520]  did not trust big corporations
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.600]  and did not want them to have more power
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:08.360]  to control the overall population
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.120]  and they were united in that.
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:12.680]  But it seems that there's now been this divide
[02:52:12.680 --> 02:52:14.840]  put down the middle where there's some elements now
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:17.720]  that love big government and some that are fighting
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:19.680]  against the big government and big corporations
[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.680]  and tech censorship overall.
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:23.680]  And I think it's because the left have realized
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:25.320]  the big government right now
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:28.400]  and the huge tech and global roots are on their side.
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:31.080]  They are now trying to support them and saying,
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:32.400]  you know, you've heard the argument,
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:33.920]  oh, well Twitter's a private company,
[02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:35.040]  Twitter can do what it wants.
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:37.360]  But the problem is Twitter now has the power
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:40.360]  to influence the outcome of elections.
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:41.720]  As a private company,
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:44.960]  you can now choose what leaders run a country,
[02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:45.920]  no private combination.
[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:47.280]  Absolutely, great points.
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:49.120]  Let's talk to Brad in Boston.
[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:51.120]  Brad, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:53.920]  Hey Alex, I just want to,
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:55.720]  first of all, I want to plug real fast.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:59.920]  I think the APAC PowerStack is absolutely outstanding.
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:01.360]  I've ordered it.
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:04.720]  I've actually, you know, reordered it.
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:07.800]  It's amazing and it's a really awesome product.
[02:53:07.800 --> 02:53:08.680]  So thank you for that.
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:11.040]  It is the best AMPM system
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:12.600]  that gives you everything you need
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:13.560]  with the highest quality.
[02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:15.280]  We put a lot of money into it.
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.080]  And it's not one of our best sellers.
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:18.320]  I thought it would be.
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:21.240]  It is for the amount of product in it.
[02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:22.680]  It's the best deal we've got.
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:24.400]  It's really crazy.
[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:25.440]  Absolutely, it is.
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:28.800]  And but, you know, so what I want to talk about
[02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:31.080]  was that I think that Tulsi Gabbard
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:35.120]  is the most outstanding candidate for president.
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:37.000]  And if you really want to break the back
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.160]  of the military industrial complex,
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.680]  she's the only candidate that's possibly,
[02:53:41.680 --> 02:53:43.440]  that you could possibly vote for.
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:44.920]  She absolutely is.
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:48.120]  Donald Trump is not doing anything
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:51.040]  to break the back of the military industrial complex.
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:52.880]  And you can say whatever you want,
[02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:55.320]  but he's not doing it.
[02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:56.440]  He's not doing it, man.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:57.920]  Sure, I mean, he's had good rhetoric.
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:59.880]  He's tried to pull them out.
[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:01.440]  Of course, the troops want that.
[02:54:01.440 --> 02:54:02.280]  He's a president.
[02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:03.640]  He can, he doesn't have to try.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:04.480]  He can just.
[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:06.000]  No, I agree.
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.120]  All I hear is buzz about Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:12.840]  And I first heard about her years ago on Joe Rogan.
[02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:14.160]  So kudos to him.
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:15.600]  And the left absolutely hates her.
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:16.760]  The New York Times hates her.
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:19.600]  And so I don't agree with some of her, you know,
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:22.880]  gun control things, but I mean, I wish she'd drop that.
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:24.640]  And I think that she'd be,
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:27.360]  look, light years better than the other Democrats.
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:30.440]  Why do you think there's so much buzz about her, Brad?
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:33.600]  Well, I think there's a lot of buzz about her
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:35.640]  because Google is trying to kill her.
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:36.480]  You know what I mean?
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:37.400]  This is ridiculous.
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:41.040]  Like as soon as she's actually suing Google, you know,
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:42.680]  which I think is awesome.
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:43.520]  Exactly.
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:47.960]  She's actually a liberal woman who's good-looking
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:49.560]  and smart and popular.
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:52.400]  So the people want her, you can't have her.
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:55.120]  Yeah, no, that's exactly what it is, man.
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:56.720]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:55:00.080]  Look, you may not agree with all her politics.
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:03.400]  And I do, you know, I'm a liberal and, you know.
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:05.320]  Sure, but we sure know the power structure scared of her,
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:06.840]  which is a good thing.
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.800]  Yeah, well, that exactly is why they're scared of her
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:13.680]  because she's actually a good person, you know.
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:15.920]  Well, they better not try to take her out of the debates
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:18.000]  because I think if she stays in all the way,
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  she'll beat Biden.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.600]  And then Trump's got a big problem.
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:22.440]  Yes, he does.
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:25.760]  Because she's a veteran and he's a draft dodger.
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:30.240]  Well, I don't think getting deferments,
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:32.160]  I mean, he wasn't for the Vietnam War.
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:34.000]  I mean, even back then, so I think getting deferments,
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.520]  if you're not a chicken hawk is,
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:38.280]  I don't want to get into a Trump badging fest,
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:41.440]  but yeah, Tulsi Gabbards, you know, she's very smart,
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:43.680]  very good looking, has a lot of good policies
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.560]  and the left's afraid over the establishment left,
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:46.400]  so I like her.
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.960]  Let's get your take more on her when we come back.
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:49.480]  Thank you, Brad.
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:51.800]  A lot of excitement about Tulsi.
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:54.760]  And then we've got Andre and Ryan and Thomas
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:55.920]  and then everybody else.
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:57.480]  We're getting to everybody.
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.520]  And then Gerald Salente, Loaded for Bears, taking over.
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.320]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:07.400]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:08.240]  Marcus here on the air.
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:09.080]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  Hey, I just want to say, your show's a breath of fresh air.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:14.360]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:17.000]  and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:18.200]  agrees with these wars.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.440]  I think that the New York Times are trying desperately
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:22.760]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:25.200]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.720]  in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:28.560]  That's it.
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:29.640]  I mean, if Trump buys into this,
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:30.880]  it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.440]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:33.640]  other than assassinating him.
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:35.080]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:35.920]  I agree entirely.
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:37.480]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:39.160]  is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:41.240]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:44.200]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:46.160]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:49.480]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:51.400]  You've won a lot of battles.
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.560]  And there are a lot of people like myself
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:55.440]  and many others who are going to continue.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.240]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:56:59.760]  And even if something does happen to you or your show,
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:02.600]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:03.720]  fired up for liberty.
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:04.760]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.800]  An info warrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2,
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:14.360]  continues to lead the way into the next generation
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:17.360]  of super high quality nascent iodine formulas.
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:21.000]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:24.760]  below the Earth's surface, every drop of Survival Shield X2
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:29.240]  contains 650 micrograms to keep you in your prime form.
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:33.000]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem,
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.320]  with the World Health Organization estimating
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:37.640]  that nearly 50 million people still
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:40.280]  suffer from some kind of mental impairment related
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:41.960]  to iodine deficiency.
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:44.840]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield

[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:12.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.560]  And we're back in the fourth hour on your host Alex Jones.
[02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:27.400]  Talking to Count Dankula, a political, former political
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  president in the UK.
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.320]  And we can sit around and joke about this.
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:33.320]  There is massive leftist authoritarianism going on.
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:35.240]  Only really rivaled by the old Soviet Union,
[02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:37.000]  all over the Western world.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.520]  The US is just a few years behind it.
[02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:40.800]  And they've got me in court cases
[02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:43.920]  trying to criminalize my speech as we speak right now.
[02:58:43.920 --> 02:58:47.000]  So this is a serious concerted effort.
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:50.800]  We got callers from Sweden, Canada, New York City,
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:56.200]  everywhere, we're going to go to Ryan and then Andre.
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:58:59.200]  Ryan in Florida, you're on the air with Count Dankula.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:01.880]  Hey, Alex and Count, it's great to talk to you both.
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:04.040]  Alex, I just wanted to thank you real quick for the electro
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:07.560]  pure water filter, the X2, the Super 12, everything, man.
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:09.560]  I've been buying them for years and my wife's pregnant
[02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:11.320]  with her firstborn and she's super healthy
[02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:12.320]  and everything's going great.
[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:14.200]  Brother, it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here.
[02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:15.880]  And we're, I don't want to say we're treading water,
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:19.040]  but we're not, you know, we don't have any fat, OK?
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:22.600]  And so we do need to keep buying the products, thank you.
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:23.480]  I sure will, man, thank you.
[02:59:23.480 --> 02:59:26.560]  And Count, man, you're just a hero, I think,
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:28.600]  and you're a really good example against how
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:30.560]  to stand up against your oppressive government
[02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:31.800]  and, you know, really stick it to them.
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:33.400]  So, you know, kudos to you, man.
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:37.160]  But I think you brought up something really key
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:39.240]  when you spoke about how you spoke to Nazis
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:41.520]  or all, you know, extreme right wing people.
[02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:44.880]  I think the major blind spot of conservatives, libertarians,
[02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:46.720]  right wing, you know, ringwriters,
[02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:49.160]  is that they don't talk to the people
[02:59:49.160 --> 02:59:50.520]  who are the white supremacists
[02:59:50.520 --> 02:59:51.880]  or the white nationalists or anything
[02:59:51.880 --> 02:59:54.920]  because they're afraid to get demonized by the left.
[02:59:54.920 --> 02:59:56.760]  And because they're already characterized as such,
[02:59:56.760 --> 02:59:59.400]  they don't want to host that kind of platform or whatever.
[02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:00.960]  But I think that if you actually listen
[03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:02.240]  to a lot of these extreme people,
[03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:04.160]  even the ones that aren't too extreme,
[03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:07.480]  they make way more sense than even the most centrist
[03:00:07.480 --> 03:00:10.520]  kind of liberal does with the crazy gender studies
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:13.320]  or the tranny stuff or this fake racist stuff
[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:14.160]  that they're just experiencing.
[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:16.800]  Here's the bottom line, the decadence of the 20s
[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:19.560]  in the Versailles Treaty help bring in Hitler.
[03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:20.880]  And so what you're saying is,
[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:23.480]  is that the left is so out of control
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:26.840]  that it's gonna cause kind of a Nazi-like backlash,
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:28.520]  which I was saying during last night.
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:31.320]  I think if we beat this, the long-term danger is
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:33.680]  getting a right wing fascist government,
[03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:35.080]  because that's what big corporations want.
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:36.720]  They want a leftist fascist government
[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:38.000]  or a right wing fascist government.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.200]  According to Carol Quigley,
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:41.920]  who was Bill Clinton's mentor, they designed this plan.
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.640]  And so I think, and I appreciate your call,
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:44.480]  that's a danger.
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:45.320]  I think it's the problem is
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:47.280]  you just need to resist both of the extremes.
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:48.640]  You're gonna get left-wing extremists,
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:50.000]  you're gonna get right-wing extremists.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.560]  And people think that the way to deal with these people
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:54.880]  is just to completely exclude them from society,
[03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:56.480]  exclude them from social media,
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:00:57.920]  make them persona non grata.
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:00:59.960]  But all that does is places them into a bubble
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:02.560]  where they can only speak to other light-minded people,
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.080]  rotating their opinions all over
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:05.240]  and repeating them to the point
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:06.600]  where they become radicalized.
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:07.520]  And that's where you get people
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:09.800]  that end up becoming mass shooters and terrorists
[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:11.360]  and doing all kinds of horrible things.
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:14.000]  But you can't exclude these people from society.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.280]  What you should do is hold out the friendly hand,
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:17.920]  speak to these people and say,
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:19.960]  it's not too late, come back to the light.
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:21.440]  You don't need to go down this path.
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:22.280]  Come back to the light.
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:23.480]  And I've tried to talk to anti-fun people
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:25.280]  and they just won't do it.
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:27.600]  And I've tried to talk to the Nazis and people too.
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:29.080]  And they're either feds or controlled
[03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:31.080]  or they're like just they're mentally ill
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:34.680]  because all they think is everyone that isn't with them
[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:36.960]  is a secret agent of Israel or something.
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:38.440]  I like barely think about Israel.
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:39.720]  I've never been to Israel.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:42.120]  And just because I'm not from getting rid of Israel,
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:44.480]  it's like this fetish of obsessing over it.
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:46.320]  And if you want to get rid of Israel, that's your right.
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:47.160]  It's just that I'm just,
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:48.440]  it's not going to my radar screen.
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:49.880]  It's bizarre.
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:51.680]  No, I get that as well.
[03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:52.640]  I get a lot of it.
[03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:54.480]  Apparently I'm a Mossad show
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:01:56.960]  because I don't speak about it.
[03:01:56.960 --> 03:01:58.720]  And it's like, I don't even talk about it.
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:00.760]  So I'm not sure where that connection came from.
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:02.480]  It's like, I don't talk about Lebanon.
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:06.200]  I mean, I don't talk about Bing Bang Boom Boom.
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:08.720]  I mean, it's literally, I'm like into America
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:11.280]  and the second amendment and unborn babies being killed
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:12.760]  and new babies being killed.
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:15.360]  And, you know, they're trying to sexualize our kids
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:16.200]  and all this.
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:17.640]  And then it's just, it's just like we,
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:19.320]  it's like, you better say it's the Catholics.
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:20.400]  You better say it's the Jews.
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:23.720]  And what it is is it's corruption seeping into everything.
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:24.840]  It's good and evil.
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:25.680]  Yeah.
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:26.720]  I think it's just people that, you know,
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:28.480]  every single side has the boogeyman, you know,
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:30.040]  for feminists, it's the patriarchy.
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:31.480]  For the far right, it's the Jews.
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:33.560]  For the far left, it's the capitalists.
[03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:36.280]  Just every single person has their boogeyman.
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:38.960]  Although the one personally, my boogeyman's authoritarians,
[03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:40.360]  but I think mine's a lot more sensible.
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:41.840]  Which come in a bunch of flavors.
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:42.680]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:44.280]  They'll use any cosmology to do it.
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:45.120]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:45.960]  It doesn't matter.
[03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:47.840]  Authoritarians don't have a color, a race or a gender.
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:49.440]  Authoritarians can be anyone.
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:51.840]  You know, it's not a racial or a gender thing.
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.880]  It's just a greed and corruption thing
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:55.680]  which can affect everyone.
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:58.800]  Now, you know, corruption is actually very diverse.
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:01.280]  Well, I gotta say, we're gonna take this, my friend,
[03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:03.480]  and put this last two minutes right at the front
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:06.360]  for the last hour and a half because you nailed it right

[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:08.600]  Stay with us.

[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:08.800]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:25.360]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:28.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:32.520]  Oh, Willie Nelson, baby.
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:34.440]  And Merle Haggard.
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:38.160]  I tell you, Willie Nelson, folks, is a living legend.
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:43.400]  He wrote back in the 50s, Hatsy Klein crazy.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:47.160]  And he smoked pot with me under the table.
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:48.240]  And I'm not saying I'm that cool.
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:50.160]  I did it only to test it.
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:53.960]  Seriously, I was so stone-spoken pot with him one time.
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:56.160]  I had somebody come pick me up.
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:58.040]  I don't know why I'm telling that story right now.
[03:04:58.040 --> 03:04:59.200]  Here's Merle Haggard.
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:01.320]  He died last year.
[03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:02.800]  And now he's grown.
[03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:04.640]  I got to tell you, kids, don't smoke marijuana.
[03:05:04.640 --> 03:05:06.360]  It's totally weaponized.
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:07.240]  It's out of control.
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:10.040]  I never smoke it, not even maybe once a year.
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:11.240]  And it's just amazing.
[03:05:11.240 --> 03:05:13.920]  And so many people I know here in this office
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:16.560]  have quit smoking marijuana because it messes up your REM
[03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:18.360]  sleep, it messes up your life.
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:20.560]  And it's just as bad as alcohol now.
[03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:22.440]  Back when I was in high school and smoked at some,
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:23.640]  it didn't do what it does now.
[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:27.040]  This stuff is super powerful and will ruin your life.
[03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:29.080]  So I just made my little marijuana statement.
[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:32.680]  It's true, playing chess and smoking pot with Willie Nelson.
[03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:35.480]  We got to be two good friends and his fifth wife,
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:37.880]  big liberal, told us not to hang out with me.
[03:05:37.880 --> 03:05:39.400]  But that didn't even really happen.
[03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:41.040]  But I don't know why I'm talking about Willie Nelson.
[03:05:41.040 --> 03:05:43.040]  I just feel like he's getting really long on the tooth.
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:44.040]  And of course, we're sitting here.
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:46.240]  What's the best place to find your stuff on YouTube?
[03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:47.520]  Count Donkula.
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:49.560]  I mean, that's just all they search, Count Donkula or Count
[03:05:49.560 --> 03:05:50.400]  Dankula.
[03:05:50.400 --> 03:05:52.640]  I'm calling you Count Donkula because I'm
[03:05:52.640 --> 03:05:54.320]  thinking of Carpe Donkton.
[03:05:54.320 --> 03:05:55.320]  And that's what I'm doing.
[03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:58.760]  I'm splicing two words, Count Donkula, Count Dankula.
[03:05:58.760 --> 03:06:02.680]  Yeah, Count Dankula has a Count Donkula.
[03:06:02.680 --> 03:06:05.920]  But you and Carpe Donkton got to hang out.
[03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:07.760]  Oh, no, we haven't actually got to hang out yet.
[03:06:07.760 --> 03:06:08.960]  We're smoking a little bit on 12.
[03:06:08.960 --> 03:06:09.480]  Oh, OK.
[03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:10.480]  Yeah.
[03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:11.480]  I just understood your story.
[03:06:11.480 --> 03:06:12.040]  No, that's cool.
[03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:12.760]  I enjoy him, though.
[03:06:12.760 --> 03:06:14.120]  He's very funny.
[03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:15.240]  I enjoy him.
[03:06:15.240 --> 03:06:17.720]  I just love the fact that he just got famous
[03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:20.840]  through making pro-Trump memes and basically
[03:06:20.840 --> 03:06:22.400]  dunking on the Democrats all the time.
[03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:23.960]  And basically, they hate him.
[03:06:23.960 --> 03:06:27.880]  I think it was Huffington Post actually tried to dox him.
[03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:28.920]  They did dox him.
[03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:29.720]  Yeah.
[03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:30.720]  Just for making use.
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:33.040]  Can you say, I can't do it, Captain.
[03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:35.560]  Don't have the power.
[03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:37.720]  You're going to make me say Shrek quotes next.
[03:06:37.720 --> 03:06:40.320]  Yes, Shrek quotes.
[03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:41.520]  Oh, my love.
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:42.800]  We've got to fight the dragon.
[03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:44.880]  I can't do it right.
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:46.920]  I don't even think Shrek says that.
[03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:49.240]  Because we're like, oh, donkey.
[03:06:49.240 --> 03:06:50.560]  What are you doing, donkeys?
[03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:53.280]  We're like a Mexican accent, or a Spanish.
[03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:55.080]  Right.
[03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:57.520]  Oh.
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:00.160]  I don't want to be an ogre.
[03:07:00.160 --> 03:07:02.880]  I have this donkey.
[03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:05.160]  We're like, pushing boots meets the.
[03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:06.120]  Yeah.
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:07.040]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:07.880]  Give me a Shrek quote.
[03:07:07.880 --> 03:07:09.160]  A Shrek quote.
[03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:10.560]  Guys, put Shrek quotes on the screen.
[03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:11.200]  We got to take it.
[03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:12.480]  Oh, come on.
[03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:13.600]  Wait, OK.
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:17.680]  I know what you're doing in my swamp.
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:18.360]  Like that's what.
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:23.680]  What are you doing in my swamp, donkey?
[03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:25.400]  Yeah.
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:26.920]  I can't even actually remember any other ones.
[03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:29.880]  That's the one that people make me say.
[03:07:29.880 --> 03:07:31.320]  Aye, what are you doing in my swamp?
[03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:33.360]  You don't have the power, captain.
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:34.480]  I can't do it, captain.
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:35.560]  I don't have the power.
[03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:41.520]  Give me a punch in the shoulder.
[03:07:41.520 --> 03:07:45.080]  This is kind of racist.
[03:07:45.080 --> 03:07:45.760]  Oh, exactly.
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:48.120]  We're just joking about Scott's cool accent.
[03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:51.080]  Like, I'll do a few kind of exaggerating Texas accents.
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:52.720]  You're not going to give a 70 Sam.
[03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:54.720]  I hate rabbits.
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:57.280]  Samuel.
[03:07:57.280 --> 03:07:58.360]  That's pretty good, actually.
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:00.400]  I hate rabbits.
[03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:00.960]  I got to get some.
[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:03.040]  Give me some 70 Sam quotes.
[03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:04.680]  You know, we've got Gerald Salante coming up.
[03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:05.480]  I don't want to cut this time.
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:06.120]  He's such a sweetheart.
[03:08:06.120 --> 03:08:07.440]  He knows I do this overdraft thing.
[03:08:07.440 --> 03:08:09.680]  But this is hard to stop this broadcast.
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:11.080]  You're back tomorrow, though.
[03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:11.960]  Yeah.
[03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:12.840]  And Wednesday.
[03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:13.440]  Yeah.
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:16.360]  We're going to make you live here.
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:18.360]  Hey, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:19.800]  Andre, I apologize from Canada.
[03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:22.320]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:24.720]  Why are you my swamp, Andre?
[03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:25.200]  Yes.
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:25.960]  Bonjour, Alex.
[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:27.360]  Bonjour, Count.
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:28.320]  Welcome, my friend.
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:30.480]  La Ponce est ordite le temps.
[03:08:30.480 --> 03:08:32.280]  N'y'a monde n'a ordite le tout pour toi.
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:33.520]  Peu, peu, peu.
[03:08:33.520 --> 03:08:34.120]  Can I speak French?
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:36.000]  Yeah, we don't have that accent over here in Quebec.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:37.760]  Sorry, I apologize.
[03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:39.160]  That's all good, man.
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:43.000]  Y'a Tim Lambreux-Champon.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:48.240]  But it's funny how Americans use a lot of French quotes
[03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:51.360]  like Bon Appetit or Déjà vu.
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:51.960]  I find that.
[03:08:51.960 --> 03:08:52.960]  A menage à toi.
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:53.960]  This is really cool.
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:54.960]  Man, why?
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:57.000]  You've got to love that one.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.240]  Listen, Alex, I got to say that thank you so much
[03:09:00.240 --> 03:09:00.920]  for your products.
[03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:02.560]  I must have $1,000 worth of products.
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:04.840]  My girlfriend was pissed off because I was taking so much
[03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:08.720]  counter that she put it on a three-story shelf.
[03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:10.200]  I have so much of your product.
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:16.480]  And two, three weeks ago, I slipped the back of my head
[03:09:16.480 --> 03:09:17.360]  on the kitchen table.
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:18.000]  Really bad.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.120]  I knocked myself out.
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:22.240]  She found me on the floor.
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:24.520]  Took three beach towels just to clean everything up.
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:26.720]  But you're a super silver wound gel.
[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:28.640]  But help me out.
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:33.760]  It cleared and it's stitched in two days with your product.
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:36.800]  And I could have used at least 10 stitches.
[03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:40.560]  But your products are amazing.
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:42.280]  I can't believe the reports for getting
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:43.800]  on the super silver wound gel.
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:45.800]  I mean, I always knew it was good and hospitals used it.
[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:48.040]  We as private label the top one in the world.
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:49.600]  But we're just blessed that their listeners
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:50.320]  won't let us do this.
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:51.960]  So thank you for that testimonial.
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:53.880]  A lot of folks who do testimonials down the show.
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:55.520]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:09:58.680]  What's your view on speech criticizing Muslims go to jail?
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:04.240]  Well, listen, our Lib Tard prime sinister Trudeau
[03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:07.280]  passed a law, which is the M one or three,
[03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:12.640]  that if you criticize Islam, well, you go to jail.
[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:14.680]  Why are you in my swamp, donkey?
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:18.400]  This is just absolute authoritarianism.
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:19.680]  Everything, absolutely.
[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:21.920]  Oh, they're all passing the same laws everywhere.
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:25.240]  And then the Muslims who aren't radical don't have a voice
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:28.560]  because the radical ones are paying off the government.
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:29.240]  What's happening?
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:31.360]  What do you think is happening, Andre in Canada?
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:34.200]  Well, listen, Alex, just a quick example.
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:37.280]  There was a shooting in a mosque in Quebec
[03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:40.240]  that a Muslim convinced the Quebecer
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:43.720]  to walk in there with a gun and shoot people.
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:46.720]  I mean, the Quebecer had some mental issues.
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:48.320]  But the Muslim was gay.
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:51.040]  He was refused by the mosque.
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:56.280]  So he convinced the Quebecer to go inside and shoot somebody.
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:57.760]  Fair one.
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:00.680]  But the guy's name is Alex Al-Bisanat.
[03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:03.720]  And he's the one who got jailed.
[03:11:03.720 --> 03:11:04.920]  And not the Muslim.
[03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:09.200]  So now, I think it was last week or two weeks ago,
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:12.000]  Muslim acid attacked his girlfriend.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.560]  And they're not talking about it.
[03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:15.960]  There's an incredible blackout.
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:16.560]  God bless you.
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:18.840]  And glad you heard you got better, Andre.
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:23.040]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are with Count Donkula Supreme.
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:23.960]  I did all that on purpose.
[03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:24.720]  I'll tell you, I don't know.
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:27.000]  Make someone know your name even more.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:27.480]  It must.
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:30.240]  It's Count Donkula.
[03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:30.840]  All right.
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:35.320]  Remember, remember, remember the map.
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:38.960]  Remember what I have told you.
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:40.200]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:41.400]  We're having some fun now.
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:42.000]  We are.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:42.400]  We are.
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:42.680]  This is.
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:44.840]  Hey, by the way, you quit smoking pot, you were saying?
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:46.560]  Well, I only smoke it.
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:48.880]  Yeah, no, I don't smoke pot at all.
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:50.400]  Said you cut back on it.
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:51.000]  Let's see.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:52.600]  Yes, 98%.
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:11:53.920]  I cut back.
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:11:56.640]  All right, let's take a ring of dingy here.
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:58.080]  Jackson in Missouri.
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:02.320]  You're on the air worldwide with the Supreme Highness Count
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:04.000]  Donkula.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:05.160]  I really appreciate it.
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:08.520]  I just wanted to get you guys' opinion on this whole censorship
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:12.000]  issue and whether or not you see it as partisan.
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.480]  Because we see most of the censorship, of course,
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:18.280]  coming from groups like Antifa showing up at colleges
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:19.960]  and shutting people down.
[03:12:19.960 --> 03:12:23.400]  But we also see a lot of these YouTube history channels,
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:25.800]  or even most recently, Hassan Piker
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:29.000]  from the Young Turks being taken off of Twitch.
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:32.120]  And so I guess I wanted to hear from you guys about when,
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:34.920]  about basically where that's coming from.
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:37.480]  Well, that one guy, Hassan Piker,
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:40.040]  said that he loved 9-11.
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:42.400]  He said that he wanted to use his, literally.
[03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:44.880]  He said, I want to use my, and his last name,
[03:12:44.880 --> 03:12:47.400]  to rape members of Congress in the eye.
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:49.120]  I'm not going to quote it all, but I mean.
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:50.120]  Yeah, that was the thing.
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:52.160]  It was like, he did end up ultimately getting banned
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:52.600]  from Twitch.
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:54.200]  And I don't think that he should have been.
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:56.360]  I mean, if he wants to say crazy, outrageous stuff,
[03:12:56.360 --> 03:12:57.000]  then that's fine.
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.480]  He can go ahead and say that.
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:00.520]  If it's really a threat, except for the police, I agree.
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:00.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:02.480]  He has the right to say that he wants to,
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:04.800]  he wants somebody to rape the Congressman in his eye hole.
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:08.600]  Yeah, no, it was a, it was about Senator Dan Crenshaw.
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:12.080]  And he says that because Dan lost his eye due to an IED attack,
[03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:14.680]  he says that a brave ISIS soldier,
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:17.360]  he called the soldier brave, a brave soldier,
[03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:19.920]  was the person that did that to Dan Crenshaw's eye.
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:22.080]  I mean, he was basically saying that ISIS were brave.
[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:23.760]  Look at his, I'm not being mean here, but I mean,
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:27.560]  he's got some large breast and big old flabby arms.
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:29.720]  Doesn't look like that guy's going to be carrying anything out.
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.600]  How about him and Dan Crenshaw getting the ring?
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:32.640]  See what happens.
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:34.080]  I'm pretty sure Dan would win.
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:37.120]  Yeah, I have no doubt that Dan would win.
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:39.840]  But I mean, obviously the guy has the right to free speech
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.480]  because he's killed a brave soldier,
[03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:43.600]  raping him in the eye and said he likes 9-11.
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:45.520]  It's horrible it's offensive, but he has a right.
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:46.240]  Yeah, he absolutely has a right.
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:48.960]  But why does the left get away with constantly doing this then?
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:50.600]  Well, I'm not sure why it is.
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:52.040]  I think it's because the right is perceived
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:53.080]  as more of a threat.
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:55.600]  Basically, we actually debate, we actually talk to people,
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:57.920]  we actually can defend our ideas, you know,
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:58.840]  the far left corpus.
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:01.280]  That's right, let's finish up and see how to drill salante.
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:03.920]  Just one more strict quote when we come back.
[03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:05.640]  Fine.
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:07.440]  What are you doing in mass swamp?
[03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:08.240]  Donkey.
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:09.440]  Donkey.
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:12.000]  All right, but I need another one when we come back.
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:17.000]  When you have a pain in the neck,
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:20.360]  a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs,
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:23.920]  you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:25.560]  without taking another pill.

[03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:19.040]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:21.280]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:23.640]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:26.280]  close to reality, who actually worked for a living
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:27.760]  that would end up saving the nation.
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:29.320]  And today the communist Chinese
[03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:32.400]  have banned all US farming goods a week ago.
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:35.120]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:36.760]  support for the president.
[03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:38.400]  And what he's doing in this trade war,
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:41.320]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:42.280]  That's beautiful.
[03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:44.240]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied.
[03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:45.760]  And we aren't gonna back down.
[03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:48.960]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:50.560]  the world that want to intimidate people
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:53.440]  and tell us to back down, we're never gonna give up.
[03:17:53.440 --> 03:17:55.840]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:17:55.840 --> 03:17:59.960]  The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:01.680]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:03.120]  whatever you do, spread those links
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.760]  because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:06.840]  We are the resistance.
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:09.400]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:14.400]  MUSIC
[03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:20.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:25.720]  MUSIC
[03:18:25.720 --> 03:18:34.720]  MUSIC
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:36.320]  Johnny Cash.
[03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:38.640]  MUSIC
[03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:42.560]  I hurt myself today.
[03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:44.640]  All right, this has been a pretty amazing transmission.
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:47.800]  Carol Salente, who I hate to cut into his time, takes over.
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:49.520]  In the war room, Owen Shroyer is back.
[03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:51.720]  And is he firing on all cylinders?
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:53.080]  3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[03:18:53.080 --> 03:18:55.840]  And I'm told that our good guest, Count Dankula,
[03:18:55.840 --> 03:18:56.880]  is gonna be with him as well.
[03:18:56.880 --> 03:18:58.280]  He'll be back with us tomorrow.
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:01.200]  And I promise to all those callers that were there,
[03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:02.680]  we call us back tomorrow, we'll get to you.
[03:19:02.680 --> 03:19:03.680]  We got to a lot of calls today,
[03:19:03.680 --> 03:19:05.400]  but I hate to leave people on hold,
[03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:07.080]  so I apologize again.
[03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:10.160]  But, Count, it's been great having you here.
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:12.240]  You'll be with us through most of the week.
[03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:14.200]  Very, very exciting, so thank you.
[03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:14.880]  No problem.
[03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:16.280]  We'll just go hang out in just a second.
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:22.800]  Now, Carol Salente has fired the bat signal.
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:25.560]  He really wants this message to get to President Trump.
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.840]  And we're live right now, but when we post this later,
[03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:30.880]  to infowars.com and newswars.com,
[03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:32.480]  if you get it and send it to the White House
[03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:34.200]  and they get it a thousand times,
[03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:35.440]  they get that to the President.
[03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:37.920]  I can make a few phone calls, try to get it to him as well.
[03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:43.680]  But Gerald said, listen, Trump's totally right about this.
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:46.880]  And if he just does this and gets this in the people's minds,
[03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:50.080]  we can win this critical trade war that's
[03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:53.000]  the equivalent of the Bretton Woods agreement that
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.840]  set America into the next century of dominance.
[03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:57.760]  So they're saying it's the Chinese century.
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:59.280]  Well, that's the Chai Comm century.
[03:19:59.280 --> 03:20:00.520]  And that's not going to happen.
[03:20:00.520 --> 03:20:03.400]  And to see our own corporations, our own media,
[03:20:03.400 --> 03:20:06.440]  trying to side against America and American workers in Trump
[03:20:06.440 --> 03:20:09.280]  and trying to kill the economy and cheerleading to implode it,
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:10.600]  it's just unspeakable.
[03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:13.400]  But if there's a way to really turn our economy around for real,
[03:20:13.400 --> 03:20:15.240]  it's what Gerald Salente is about to cover.
[03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:18.440]  So here is his emergency message, the top trans forecaster,
[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:21.600]  Gerald Salente to President Trump.
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:25.160]  Yes, President Trump, I don't agree with you
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:28.720]  on a number of issues, particularly your foreign policy.
[03:20:28.720 --> 03:20:33.720]  I support your positions on not bringing in illegal immigrants
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:37.240]  and lowering the amount of immigrants coming into the country
[03:20:37.240 --> 03:20:40.240]  until we get back on our feet.
[03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:44.480]  Your message that we don't need China is one that
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:47.320]  is 100% correct.
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:50.040]  Love Trump, hate Trump has nothing to do with Trump.
[03:20:50.040 --> 03:20:53.480]  It has to do with what he said and the facts behind it.
[03:20:53.480 --> 03:20:57.520]  And the fact is this, you don't have to go very far back
[03:20:57.520 --> 03:20:59.040]  in history.
[03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:04.480]  All you have to do is go back to 1996.
[03:21:04.480 --> 03:21:10.760]  China, 5% of its population back then was about middle class.
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:12.600]  Today, 35%.
[03:21:12.600 --> 03:21:14.320]  Why?
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:19.840]  Now, they didn't steal our technology.
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:26.000]  Now, the manufacturers, Americans and the Europeans
[03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:27.920]  gave it to them.
[03:21:27.920 --> 03:21:29.440]  Here's the deal.
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:30.720]  Yeah, you could come over here.
[03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:31.960]  You could do business with us.
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:34.960]  We've got 1.4 billion people.
[03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:36.400]  But you can't own the company.
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:38.760]  You only can own 49% of it.
[03:21:38.760 --> 03:21:40.440]  And we want all your technology because we
[03:21:40.440 --> 03:21:42.480]  don't have anything.
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:44.560]  We do not need China.
[03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:46.240]  China needs us.
[03:21:46.240 --> 03:21:50.520]  Let's make this 100% clear.
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:55.120]  When we were making clothing, now 96% of it,
[03:21:55.120 --> 03:21:58.400]  everything we wear, from shoes to shirts to pants,
[03:21:58.400 --> 03:22:00.920]  you name it, comes from overseas.
[03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:03.520]  We were making it in America.
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:08.680]  We don't need China to make what we are wearing,
[03:22:08.680 --> 03:22:11.480]  what we are eating as they're bringing in apples
[03:22:11.480 --> 03:22:15.360]  and all other kinds of fruits and vegetables.
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:17.440]  We don't need China.
[03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:22.560]  We didn't need them up until slick, willy, slime,
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:25.040]  bald, murderous Clinton.
[03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:28.200]  And I say that, murderous, because, oh, no,
[03:22:28.200 --> 03:22:32.040]  I'm not conspiracy theory about Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:22:32.040 --> 03:22:33.360]  I'm talking about all the people
[03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:38.000]  he slotted during his time in Iraq and the Kosovo War.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:41.360]  But anyway, before they brought China
[03:22:41.360 --> 03:22:44.800]  into the World Trade Organization,
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:48.160]  we weren't getting all our toys made over there,
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:53.760]  all our parts and for automobiles and all our apples.
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:56.520]  Oh, not only those apples, the one we eat,
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:58.360]  but the other apples.
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:01.320]  They were making it in America.
[03:23:01.320 --> 03:23:04.680]  The only way this country is going to come back
[03:23:04.680 --> 03:23:07.560]  is to be a self-sustaining economy.
[03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:10.520]  President Trump, stay on the one message.
[03:23:10.520 --> 03:23:13.200]  We don't need China.
[03:23:13.200 --> 03:23:16.440]  Matter of fact, we don't even need China, China.
[03:23:16.440 --> 03:23:19.480]  I have a bunch of China that they used to make up here
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:22.440]  just north of me from Syracuse, New York.
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:24.240]  And when I went to school in West Virginia,
[03:23:24.240 --> 03:23:27.640]  beautiful glassware that was made.
[03:23:27.640 --> 03:23:29.560]  We don't need China.
[03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:32.760]  We don't need one foreign country
[03:23:32.760 --> 03:23:36.720]  to make what we are eating, what we are wearing,
[03:23:36.720 --> 03:23:41.120]  what we are watching, and what we are listening to.
[03:23:41.120 --> 03:23:44.360]  We need Americans to make it.
[03:23:44.360 --> 03:23:47.120]  It's very simple.
[03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:50.200]  The only people that are profiting
[03:23:50.200 --> 03:23:54.320]  from using slave labor in China
[03:23:54.320 --> 03:23:57.640]  are the multinational manufacturers.
[03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:00.360]  Oh, Bill Gates doesn't have enough dough yet?
[03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:02.320]  How about Tim Cook?
[03:24:02.320 --> 03:24:05.400]  Yeah, get more stuff made over China
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:08.560]  so you could bring the product back over here,
[03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:11.680]  raise the prices, and make more money.
[03:24:11.680 --> 03:24:13.800]  You're not creating jobs.
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:16.600]  You're only creating wealth for yourself.
[03:24:16.600 --> 03:24:21.600]  Nike, Levi Strauss, Apple, all of the rest.
[03:24:24.200 --> 03:24:29.200]  Trump needs to stay on this one message, one message,
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:32.320]  and he will win again.
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:34.920]  We don't need China.
[03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:37.120]  We don't need anybody.
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:39.520]  We are America.
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:44.160]  We have more human and natural resources
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:47.160]  that are so rich that we have here
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:53.000]  that we could be the perfectly self-sustaining economy
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.960]  and bring the whole system up.
[03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:00.960]  We don't need China for anything, Chinese food, okay?
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:05.920]  If they use better products,
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:08.520]  because I don't need a lot of that Chinese stuff.
[03:25:08.520 --> 03:25:10.800]  How about an MSG fan?
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:15.800]  Yeah, the only thing we need from China is Chinese food.
[03:25:16.520 --> 03:25:18.600]  Period, paragraph.
[03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:21.360]  We don't need anything from any other country,
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:25.760]  unless of course you want a fine French wine,
[03:25:25.760 --> 03:25:28.760]  a great Italian cheese and pasta,
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:31.240]  yeah, that kind of stuff, bring it in.
[03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:34.920]  Different cultures make things better than we do here.
[03:25:34.920 --> 03:25:37.160]  But not on a general level.
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:40.160]  I remember as a kid growing up in New York
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:43.040]  and on 7th Avenue down the city,
[03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:45.760]  people pushing up racks of clothing
[03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:49.640]  in the Garmin District, the Garmin District.
[03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:51.560]  Now it's a gone district,
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:54.920]  just a bunch of ugly glass buildings
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:57.560]  and all multinational shops,
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:25:59.960]  banks on every corner,
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:04.960]  and DeWayne Reed drug stores and CVS and FU Know What.
[03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:07.480]  That's what's taken over.
[03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:11.080]  And the people can't afford to live there anymore.
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:12.560]  They're leaving, they're leaving,
[03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:14.400]  people leaving New York City.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:16.760]  And in fact, they're coming up to Kingston
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:21.000]  and other places with his beauty and lifestyle,
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:22.320]  because it's all gone there.
[03:26:22.320 --> 03:26:27.320]  Trump's one message, we don't need China for anything.
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:33.840]  And stay out of the South China Sea,
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:36.400]  let those people over there solve their own problems.
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:37.760]  Not my business.
[03:26:37.760 --> 03:26:40.640]  I'm worried about securing America the homeland.
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:44.120]  We don't need China.
[03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:46.280]  We don't need China.
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:48.280]  We don't need China.
[03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:53.280]  320 million Americans should be chanting that.
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:55.120]  We don't need China.
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:57.200]  We need America.
[03:26:57.200 --> 03:26:59.240]  Bring back the jobs,
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:01.200]  bring back the riches,
[03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:03.920]  bring back the spirit,
[03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:06.000]  and I'll be back in a little bit.
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:09.520]  And don't forget, support InfoWars.
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:31.520]  I'll put your money where you're hot.
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:40.520]  The Sunnibay Raps,
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:41.520]  heatable neck pillows,
[03:27:41.520 --> 03:27:42.520]  and extra large body wraps
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:45.240]  are designed better for perfect support,
[03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:46.880]  wear and when you need it.
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:47.880]  Even while driving,
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:49.760]  Sunnibay Raps will not burn
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:51.920]  and stay balanced to provide soothing,
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:53.240]  hot or cold therapy
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:55.840]  to help treat temporary or chronic pain.
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:27:56.840]  And the best part,
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:28:00.240]  Sunnibay quality products started under $20.
[03:28:00.240 --> 03:28:01.760]  Join thousands of happy customers

[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:10.480]  Visit Amazon or Walmart
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:15.200]  and search today for Sunnibay.
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:17.400]  As we witness the most disastrous
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:20.680]  geological activity in recorded history,
[03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:23.480]  the globalists are backed into a corner
[03:28:23.480 --> 03:28:26.760]  and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:27.760]  Borders are being broken
[03:28:27.760 --> 03:28:30.520]  and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:33.240]  The world is going to change.
[03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:36.200]  And how it changes will likely be decided
[03:28:36.200 --> 03:28:38.600]  by those who are prepared to stay strong
[03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:40.560]  when the system fails.
[03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:42.560]  The system is vulnerable.
[03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:45.280]  Electricity could be gone in an instant
[03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:48.880]  and grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:50.560]  Having storable foods
[03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:52.800]  and the ability to purify water
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:55.800]  will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:58.680]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others
[03:28:58.680 --> 03:29:01.760]  or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:03.440]  Buy storable foods
[03:29:03.440 --> 03:29:06.920]  and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.

[03:29:14.960 --> 03:29:19.400]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:21.640]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:24.000]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.280]  close to reality,
[03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:26.640]  who actually work for a living
[03:29:26.640 --> 03:29:28.120]  that would end up saving the nation.
[03:29:28.120 --> 03:29:29.680]  And today the communist Chinese
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:32.760]  have banned all US farming goods a week ago.
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:35.480]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[03:29:35.480 --> 03:29:37.120]  support for the president
[03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:38.760]  and what he's doing in this trade war
[03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:41.680]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[03:29:41.680 --> 03:29:42.640]  That's beautiful.
[03:29:42.640 --> 03:29:44.600]  Americans aren't gonna be bullied
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:46.120]  and we aren't gonna back down.
[03:29:46.120 --> 03:29:49.280]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton
[03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:50.920]  is the world that wanna intimidate people
[03:29:50.920 --> 03:29:52.480]  and tell us to back down,
[03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:53.800]  we're never gonna give up.
[03:29:53.800 --> 03:29:56.200]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.

[03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:50.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:31:50.680 --> 03:31:53.960]  Hey, great being here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:31:53.960 --> 03:31:58.920]  Anyway, as I was saying, we don't need China.
[03:31:58.920 --> 03:32:02.160]  The anything, the anything.
[03:32:02.160 --> 03:32:04.120]  Again, you like Chinese food?

[03:32:07.440 --> 03:32:09.280]  We need to make everything here.
[03:32:09.280 --> 03:32:11.120]  Trump's quote last week, this is the way
[03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:14.320]  the Financial Times wrote it.
[03:32:14.320 --> 03:32:17.680]  Trump tirade alarms investors.
[03:32:17.680 --> 03:32:21.720]  Ooh, don't alarm investors.
[03:32:21.720 --> 03:32:24.720]  Don't alarm the multinationals.
[03:32:24.720 --> 03:32:29.160]  They got to make more money.
[03:32:29.160 --> 03:32:31.480]  Our great American companies are hereby
[03:32:31.480 --> 03:32:35.120]  ordered to immediately start looking for alternatives
[03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:39.240]  to China, including bringing your company's home,
[03:32:39.240 --> 03:32:44.840]  all in capital's home, and making your products in the USA.
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:46.800]  You got it.
[03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:49.800]  It is the, I've been saying this, by the way,
[03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:51.760]  long before Trump.
[03:32:51.760 --> 03:32:53.320]  In our Trends Journal, and if you
[03:32:53.320 --> 03:32:57.080]  want to subscribe to the Trends Journal, it's trendsjournal.com.
[03:32:57.080 --> 03:32:59.200]  And we have a discount request page,
[03:32:59.200 --> 03:33:01.800]  because we know a lot of people having a tough time.
[03:33:01.800 --> 03:33:04.480]  It's only $129 a year.
[03:33:04.480 --> 03:33:06.280]  The Trends Journal trend alerts trends
[03:33:06.280 --> 03:33:09.040]  in the news broadcast, et cetera.
[03:33:09.040 --> 03:33:11.280]  I've been talking about a self-sustaining economy
[03:33:11.280 --> 03:33:16.880]  now the last 20 years.
[03:33:16.880 --> 03:33:20.640]  It's the only way we're going to rise to higher levels.
[03:33:20.640 --> 03:33:24.480]  Part of that is occupied peace, bring home all the troops,
[03:33:24.480 --> 03:33:27.400]  stop wasting our money, rebuilding countries
[03:33:27.400 --> 03:33:33.520]  that we destroy, and 800 bases in over 80 countries,
[03:33:33.520 --> 03:33:36.680]  and spend the money here.
[03:33:36.680 --> 03:33:40.680]  And one of the ways to spend the money is on new technology.
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:44.520]  We should have a new alternative energy by now.
[03:33:44.520 --> 03:33:46.320]  Electric cars aren't going to do it.
[03:33:46.320 --> 03:33:47.440]  They're using batteries.
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:50.720]  Batteries are an 1800s invention.
[03:33:50.720 --> 03:33:53.880]  You're going to put so much energy into them.
[03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:56.680]  We need to redirect investments because we're going
[03:33:56.680 --> 03:33:58.960]  into the greatest depression.
[03:33:58.960 --> 03:34:03.000]  And it's time to prepare, to prevail, and prosper.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:08.160]  So when I talk about Trump bringing home the jobs here,
[03:34:08.160 --> 03:34:09.480]  they should have tariffs that they
[03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:12.520]  put back on before they let these countries
[03:34:12.520 --> 03:34:16.200]  and before they invented the World Trade Organization.
[03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:19.120]  It's only helping the rich people.
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:24.720]  Matter of fact, a headline story in today's Wall Street Journal,
[03:34:24.720 --> 03:34:32.120]  Front Page, was about how CEO's are getting much more than they're
[03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:36.480]  saying they're getting, 16% more.
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:40.440]  So all the money is going to the 1%.
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:43.720]  We need to bring back jobs here that
[03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:47.640]  could help us earn livings and have living wages.
[03:34:47.640 --> 03:34:50.520]  And it's only going to happen by bringing manufacturing back,
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:53.800]  not service sector jobs.
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:57.120]  So we don't need China.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:59.680]  The multinationals need them.
[03:34:59.680 --> 03:35:03.200]  The corporations that don't want to pay living wages
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:07.360]  to American workers that want to use slave labor,
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:09.800]  they're the ones that need China.
[03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:12.440]  They're the ones that need Vietnam.
[03:35:12.440 --> 03:35:15.440]  They're the ones that need Bangladesh.
[03:35:15.440 --> 03:35:18.160]  We don't need them.
[03:35:18.160 --> 03:35:21.040]  All these liberals talk about by local.
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:22.480]  And I buy local all the time.
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:25.360]  We have a great farmers market over here.
[03:35:25.360 --> 03:35:28.440]  And boy, I load up on fruit during the season,
[03:35:28.440 --> 03:35:31.520]  try to stay healthy, eat a lot of it.
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:34.760]  Fresh corn, no GMOs.
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:35.960]  Buy local.
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:37.240]  Buy American.
[03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:39.600]  It's buying local.
[03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:43.920]  In Kingston over here, the Gantt Shirt Factory
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:45.000]  used to be here.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:47.360]  This whole Hudson Valley, they're
[03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:52.120]  making stuff for every major company.
[03:35:52.120 --> 03:35:53.680]  Gone.
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:35:55.960]  Northern New York.
[03:35:55.960 --> 03:35:59.480]  It's the Rust Belt, beyond up here.
[03:35:59.480 --> 03:36:02.080]  Places like Orburn and Endicott.
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:03.640]  Endicott.
[03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:08.920]  Endicott Johnson was a shoe manufacturer.
[03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:11.360]  Used to make them there.
[03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:15.040]  Now they're making them in slave labor countries.
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:17.760]  Oh, yeah, but the cost of everything is going to go up.
[03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:20.200]  Oh, yeah, we're going to worry about that.
[03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:22.840]  Hey, if our wages go way up and the cost of everything
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:25.680]  goes up, that's fine with me.
[03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:27.600]  That's fine with you, too.
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:30.760]  The profits will go down for the multinationals.
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:33.400]  That's all they're concerned about.
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:35.160]  How much the CEOs get.
[03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:42.680]  And how many stocks they could buy and drive the price up.
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:36:46.240]  And the story, not helping us.
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:50.680]  So staying on that note, I just totally support Trump
[03:36:50.680 --> 03:36:53.680]  on this issue.
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:56.400]  White House says Trump's only China regret
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:36:59.320]  is not raising tariffs higher.
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:01.600]  No, I could agree with that one as well.
[03:37:04.240 --> 03:37:06.720]  Another story of interest over here,
[03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:10.640]  just to put things in a perspective.
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:14.440]  How they tout the lie.
[03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:19.000]  This is from today's Financial Times.
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:24.520]  Globalization, not to blame for rising inequality, says report.
[03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:27.120]  Globalization has stalled over the past decades
[03:37:27.120 --> 03:37:30.120]  or not be blamed for the rise in inequality,
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:32.920]  seen since the financial crisis, new research
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:38.240]  by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:40.840]  former chief economist said.
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:42.680]  Catherine Mann.
[03:37:42.680 --> 03:37:43.760]  Catherine Mann.
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:45.520]  She transgendered Catherine and Mann.
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:47.240]  All right, take it easy.
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:50.720]  Now global chief economist at Citi
[03:37:50.720 --> 03:37:54.360]  said her research public, all right.
[03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:59.960]  Chief economist for Citi, OECD economist.
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:03.640]  You think you're going to get a straight line from them?
[03:38:03.640 --> 03:38:08.640]  All globalization is done is to help the multinationals,
[03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:10.840]  nobody else.
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:15.840]  And that's all we are, our plantation workers,
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:20.400]  on the multinational plantations of slave landia.
[03:38:20.400 --> 03:38:22.120]  Name the country.
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:25.560]  They call it populist movements, not populist movements.
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:28.600]  People want to maintain their identity.
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:30.680]  The Italians want to be Italians.
[03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:34.400]  The Hungarians want to be Hungarians.
[03:38:34.400 --> 03:38:35.960]  The Germans want to be Germans.
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:38.560]  The French want to be French.
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:40.120]  The Polish want to be Polish.
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:43.720]  The Czechs want to be Czechs.
[03:38:43.720 --> 03:38:45.600]  What's wrong with that?
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:50.760]  What's wrong with appreciating your heritage
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:52.280]  and not wanting it diluted?
[03:38:56.080 --> 03:38:57.880]  What we're going to see right now
[03:38:57.880 --> 03:39:01.720]  in this Great Depression hits, one of our top trends
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:05.560]  is human waves, floods of people.
[03:39:05.560 --> 03:39:11.280]  That's one of our top trends for 2019, leaving their nations,
[03:39:11.280 --> 03:39:18.680]  looking for safety, getting away from corruption and crime
[03:39:18.680 --> 03:39:21.040]  and out of poverty.
[03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:23.560]  When the Great Depression hits, we're
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:28.760]  going to see a tsunami, not a wave.
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:32.320]  Story in today's Financial Times.
[03:39:32.320 --> 03:39:36.560]  Ecuador tightens entry rules as Venezuela exodus intensifies.
[03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:39.000]  Again, I agree with Trump.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:42.120]  I'm totally opposed to what he's doing in Venezuela.
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:44.240]  Totally opposed.
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:47.200]  And that little clown Bolton, our national security advisor,
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:49.600]  he's not my national security advisor.
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:52.320]  He can't advise me on anything.
[03:39:52.320 --> 03:39:55.520]  He's made it clear we put the quote in the Trends Journal.
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:58.000]  American oil companies should be in Venezuela.
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:01.560]  It would be good for the American people.
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:03.400]  That's disgusting.
[03:40:03.400 --> 03:40:06.520]  It's conquering another nation who's sitting on the world's
[03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:08.280]  largest oil reserves.
[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:10.720]  I'm making this point because Ecuador,
[03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:12.880]  do you know the flood of people leaving Ecuador
[03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:15.520]  to come to America already?
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:23.400]  Guatemala, Honduras, Nigeria, excuse me, Nigeria, Nicaragua,
[03:40:23.400 --> 03:40:28.040]  Mexico, they're flooding out to come here already.
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:31.080]  What's going to happen when the Great Depression hits?
[03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:33.680]  By the way, they just killed another reporter over there
[03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:34.680]  in Mexico.
[03:40:34.680 --> 03:40:38.720]  They wipe him out, print anything that they don't like.
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:40.600]  You think censorship is bad here?
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:42.600]  Yeah, debt ship.
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:45.680]  That's the one you get on if you're a reporter in Mexico,
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:47.680]  a debt ship.
[03:40:47.680 --> 03:40:51.000]  So he's staying with us.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.480]  Prepare for the Great Depression.
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:55.160]  It's coming.
[03:40:55.160 --> 03:40:58.760]  Markets, a threat to the world.
[03:40:58.760 --> 03:41:02.800]  Markets, they've peaked as I see it.
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:04.440]  A little more.
[03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:07.720]  Now what's your jet?
[03:41:07.720 --> 03:41:08.480]  We've vacuumed you.
[03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:16.480]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:18.640]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:20.440]  And the way they did so is because they
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:22.600]  face no consequence of social, economic, political,
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:25.080]  or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:27.440]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges,
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:29.680]  the juries, the members of the independent free press
[03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:31.720]  that care about this, the ordinary members of the public
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:33.040]  and the audience that care about this,
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:36.160]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:37.160]  to their course of conduct.
[03:41:37.160 --> 03:41:38.600]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:41.000]  And they will become the big tech Golo Garks, the equivalent
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:42.600]  to the big trust of the 19th century,
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:44.960]  who ran American politics and ran American economy,
[03:41:44.960 --> 03:41:46.600]  almost into the ground until we were
[03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:48.320]  able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:50.000]  The inforward's audience is the fuel
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:53.280]  that flames the light of liberty across the world,
[03:41:53.280 --> 03:41:55.960]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[03:41:55.960 --> 03:41:58.560]  to make real the original promise of an independent free
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:41:58.960]  press.
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:01.120]  Real collusion is big tech and big media
[03:42:01.120 --> 03:42:02.880]  manipulating and working with each other
[03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:05.520]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:06.000]  thoughts.
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:07.920]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time
[03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:08.600]  it's not happening.
[03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:10.360]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:12.280]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.

[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:38.360]  the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:41.960]  at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.

[03:43:15.080 --> 03:43:19.560]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:21.800]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:24.160]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground,
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:26.960]  close to reality, who actually worked for a living that
[03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:28.280]  would end up saving the nation.
[03:43:28.280 --> 03:43:31.560]  And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming
[03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:32.920]  goods a week ago.
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:35.640]  And we've seen massive increases in polls
[03:43:35.640 --> 03:43:37.280]  support for the president.
[03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:38.960]  And what he's doing in this trade war,
[03:43:38.960 --> 03:43:41.840]  once China put pressure on our farmers.
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:42.800]  That's beautiful.
[03:43:42.800 --> 03:43:44.760]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:46.280]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:43:46.280 --> 03:43:49.440]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton
[03:43:49.440 --> 03:43:51.560]  of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:53.920]  to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:56.320]  And all you've done is a wake of the human spirit.
[03:43:56.320 --> 03:44:00.440]  The human spirit lives at infowar.com and newswar.com.

[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:20.960]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:22.160]  But it's very exciting.
[03:44:22.160 --> 03:44:24.520]  It's super silver skin cream.

[03:47:12.240 --> 03:47:13.840]  And I'm going to go get some myself
[03:47:13.840 --> 03:47:16.760]  because I got to get some rid of some of these wrinkles here.
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:20.640]  So I was talking about Ecuador.
[03:47:20.640 --> 03:47:24.560]  Again, this is a big story in the Financial Times today.
[03:47:24.560 --> 03:47:29.320]  Ecuador tightens entry rules as Venezuela exodus intensifies.
[03:47:29.320 --> 03:47:35.480]  Now, how come they're not condemning Venezuela
[03:47:35.480 --> 03:47:37.560]  for not wanting any more people come in?
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:40.560]  But hey, when Americans, like myself,
[03:47:40.560 --> 03:47:43.680]  say we don't need any more people coming in,
[03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:48.480]  well, then I'm racist or some other stupid comment.
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:51.840]  But nobody's going after Venezuela.
[03:47:51.840 --> 03:47:53.720]  Because Venezuela is Venezuela.
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:47:55.400]  Excuse me, Ecuador.
[03:47:55.400 --> 03:47:57.120]  Ecuador could do what they like, even though they're
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:47:58.680]  sending people here like crazy because they
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:00.640]  want to get away from the poverty, the corruption,
[03:48:00.640 --> 03:48:02.680]  the crime.
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:06.080]  But it's OK for Ecuador and other countries
[03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:08.480]  to close borders but not the United States.
[03:48:08.480 --> 03:48:10.400]  And by the way, when people say, well, you know,
[03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:13.480]  we're all immigrants, yes, we are.
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:16.560]  And they brought us here because they needed workers.
[03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:18.400]  End of story.
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:21.600]  As a Napolitano, what they call a Southern Italian,
[03:48:21.600 --> 03:48:24.960]  they didn't like us over here.
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:27.520]  You go back and you look at their records.
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:30.120]  They didn't want, the Northern Italians are OK.
[03:48:30.120 --> 03:48:33.680]  They didn't want the Southern Italians to come in.
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:36.560]  They brought us here because they needed labor.
[03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:39.040]  And the Southern Italians had a lot of skills,
[03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:42.080]  particularly in Masonry.
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:44.920]  Matter of fact, up here in Kingston,
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:47.680]  the Brickyards, up and down the Hudson River, Glasgow,
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:50.840]  north of here, more Italians in Ulster County
[03:48:50.840 --> 03:49:05.600]  than any other nationality, they weren't treated very well.
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:08.320]  Needed workers.
[03:49:08.320 --> 03:49:10.880]  We don't need workers anymore.
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:13.680]  We got more than we need.
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:17.400]  When I talk about the greatest oppression
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:24.840]  and the human waves turning into a tsunami,
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:29.000]  when the economy slows down, there's
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:33.280]  going to be more people in jobs by long shot.
[03:49:33.280 --> 03:49:36.760]  I'm not good at math, but figure this one out.
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:41.280]  1930, great depression hits, right?
[03:49:41.280 --> 03:49:45.080]  How many people were on the planet?
[03:49:45.080 --> 03:49:53.360]  2 billion, 2 billion, less than 100 years later.
[03:49:53.360 --> 03:49:59.560]  We've added, now we're at 7.5 billion.
[03:49:59.560 --> 03:50:06.000]  From 2 billion, we've added 5.5 billion.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:11.120]  Africa, we're at a report that having about seven children
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:15.680]  per family can't take care of one.
[03:50:15.680 --> 03:50:19.080]  Floods of people coming out of Africa into Europe,
[03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:21.160]  by the way, they weren't doing that
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:24.120]  before the murderer, Obama, the Nobel Peace
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:25.680]  and Crab Prize winner.
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:27.240]  I don't like that guy cut off.
[03:50:27.240 --> 03:50:29.200]  Yeah, I want him out of there, all right?
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:30.560]  I want him out of there.
[03:50:30.560 --> 03:50:31.760]  I don't care who you kill.
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:33.960]  I don't care what you destroy, even though it's
[03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:35.800]  the richest country in Africa.
[03:50:35.800 --> 03:50:37.680]  And they treat people better than anywhere else
[03:50:37.680 --> 03:50:39.080]  and give them a lot of benefits.
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:42.200]  I don't like the guy, I want him out of there.
[03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:43.600]  And before they got him out of there,
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:44.960]  Gaddafi won.
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:46.360]  Europe, you get me out here, you're
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:49.960]  going to have a flood of people coming in through Libya
[03:50:49.960 --> 03:50:50.680]  into Europe.
[03:50:50.680 --> 03:50:52.680]  You're not going to be able to stop.
[03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:55.920]  And it was the truth, and that's exactly what happened.
[03:50:55.920 --> 03:50:59.960]  Months after he was killed over 500,000 people,
[03:50:59.960 --> 03:51:02.120]  migrated to Europe.
[03:51:02.120 --> 03:51:05.360]  Now, with the greatest depression coming,
[03:51:05.360 --> 03:51:10.960]  you're going to see a tsunami of people looking for jobs.
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:14.520]  Climate change, I call it planet destruction.
[03:51:14.520 --> 03:51:16.400]  I don't know if there's climate change.
[03:51:16.400 --> 03:51:17.880]  They're poisoning us in every way.
[03:51:17.880 --> 03:51:20.120]  I mean, the products that I'm talking about,
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:24.160]  to buy from InfoWars, they're talking about health,
[03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:28.520]  not having all these phony ingredients in it.
[03:51:28.520 --> 03:51:29.760]  They're poisoning our food.
[03:51:29.760 --> 03:51:30.800]  They're poisoning the air.
[03:51:30.800 --> 03:51:33.240]  They're poisoning the water.
[03:51:33.240 --> 03:51:35.640]  Fracking, yeah, frack you.
[03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:37.320]  Oh, we can't tell you what chemicals
[03:51:37.320 --> 03:51:39.600]  we're pumping into the, because we don't want people
[03:51:39.600 --> 03:51:45.920]  to steal our invention to bring up the water.
[03:51:45.920 --> 03:51:47.280]  That's only one of them.
[03:51:47.280 --> 03:51:50.000]  Oh, over here in Jersey.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:50.800]  Oh, that Booker.
[03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:52.680]  Yeah, Booker the Crooker.
[03:51:52.680 --> 03:51:54.920]  Get a guy running for president?
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:51:58.160]  Oh, yeah, they got lead in the pipes and the water over there,
[03:51:58.160 --> 03:52:01.400]  which they knew about for a long time
[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:03.560]  and been covering it up.
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:06.080]  So when I say planet destruction,
[03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:07.480]  you're worried about climate change.
[03:52:07.480 --> 03:52:10.320]  You're going to be dead by the time climate change is, man,
[03:52:10.320 --> 03:52:12.440]  and women, because they're killing us
[03:52:12.440 --> 03:52:13.600]  on so many different levels.
[03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:16.920]  That's why you need, if you want to stay healthy,
[03:52:16.920 --> 03:52:19.920]  wealthy and wise to consider buying some products
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:24.320]  from InfoWars that will improve your health.
[03:52:24.320 --> 03:52:28.800]  So going back to where it's going with human waves,
[03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:33.080]  too many people, not enough jobs.
[03:52:33.080 --> 03:52:37.720]  That's why we have no inflation, or relatively low inflation.
[03:52:37.720 --> 03:52:39.960]  When you put in the real factors, it's much higher,
[03:52:39.960 --> 03:52:42.760]  but the government numbers.
[03:52:42.760 --> 03:52:45.240]  And the government numbers, inflation is low,
[03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:47.800]  because you don't have to pay people a lot to work
[03:52:47.800 --> 03:52:52.760]  in slave landia, where the multinationals own everything.
[03:52:52.760 --> 03:52:56.800]  Online, get it done cheap with my five O's.
[03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:00.200]  Online, open markets, China.
[03:53:00.200 --> 03:53:01.520]  We don't need China.
[03:53:01.520 --> 03:53:03.720]  China's keeping down the prices.
[03:53:03.720 --> 03:53:05.520]  Bangladesh keeping down the prices.
[03:53:05.520 --> 03:53:10.560]  Online, open markets, overcapacity.
[03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:13.240]  There's more capacity to make what you need.
[03:53:13.240 --> 03:53:16.400]  You name it, all around the world.
[03:53:16.400 --> 03:53:19.080]  Keeps prices down, because we have overproduction,
[03:53:19.080 --> 03:53:22.360]  more stuff than you could buy.
[03:53:22.360 --> 03:53:24.680]  That's why places like the dollar stores and the TJ
[03:53:24.680 --> 03:53:27.120]  maxes and the home goods, selling stuff
[03:53:27.120 --> 03:53:32.120]  that they couldn't sell for full price on doing well.
[03:53:32.120 --> 03:53:37.840]  Online, open markets, overcapacity, overproduction,
[03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:41.520]  and overpopulation.
[03:53:41.520 --> 03:53:53.800]  Again, $2 billion in 1930, $7.5 billion in 2019, $10 billion
[03:53:53.800 --> 03:53:58.320]  by 2050.
[03:53:58.320 --> 03:54:00.840]  That's why you don't have inflation.
[03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:05.120]  You have more slave labor than they could ever want.
[03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:11.040]  Reparations, this is the multinational plantations
[03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:16.000]  owners got it better than the plantation owners had it,
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:18.320]  because the plantation owners were
[03:54:18.320 --> 03:54:21.680]  housing and feeding the slaves, treating them terribly,
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:25.760]  of course, but having to house and feed them.
[03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:28.200]  The multinational plantation owners,
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:30.240]  they figured it out better.
[03:54:30.240 --> 03:54:33.040]  We'll give them just enough money
[03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:35.240]  so they keep coming back to work.
[03:54:35.240 --> 03:54:37.160]  They can live in their cars or live on the streets.
[03:54:37.160 --> 03:54:38.600]  We don't care.
[03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:43.280]  There's slaves on the multinational plantation.
[03:54:43.280 --> 03:54:46.360]  So that's why you're not seeing inflation going up.
[03:54:46.360 --> 03:54:48.440]  But I'm warning you, the greatest depression
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:51.200]  is on the near horizon.
[03:54:51.200 --> 03:54:56.600]  My forecast is that it's going to hit by 2021.
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:54:58.320]  Essential banks are going to do everything
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:03.240]  they can to prop up the economy around the world.
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:06.800]  Trump is going to keep dumping more pressure on Powell
[03:55:06.800 --> 03:55:09.160]  to lower interest rates.
[03:55:09.160 --> 03:55:13.080]  But they don't have a lot of room to lower them.
[03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:18.920]  Back when the last recession hit, they were at 5%, 5.5%.
[03:55:18.920 --> 03:55:20.760]  Now they're at 2%.
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:23.160]  They only could go down 2%.
[03:55:23.160 --> 03:55:25.440]  They'll come up with another scheme.
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:28.640]  They'll push some more liquidity into the markets
[03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:30.600]  to help out the banksters.
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:34.080]  It's not going to work.
[03:55:34.080 --> 03:55:36.360]  And when I come back from the break,
[03:55:36.360 --> 03:55:39.480]  I'm going to talk about some very important issues
[03:55:39.480 --> 03:55:41.280]  that you need to know about.
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:48.680]  And while else they'll take you to war.
[03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:51.000]  Back in the day.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  I'm going to talk about some very important issues that you need to know about.
