[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:41.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  The Guantanamo Five are top Taliban commanders, and the group has tried to free them for more than a decade.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  According to a 2008 Pentagon dossier on Guantanamo Bay inmates, it was disclosed by WikiLeaks.
[00:55.000 --> 01:03.000]  All five men released were considered to be a high risk to launch attacks against the U.S. and its allies if they were liberated.
[01:03.000 --> 01:13.000]  Mula Mohamed Fazal is Taliban's former deputy defense minister and is wanted by the United Nations for his role in massacres targeting Afghans Shiite Muslim population.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  Mula Narula Nori was a senior Taliban military figure directly subordinate to Taliban supreme leader Mula Ammar.
[01:21.000 --> 01:30.000]  Nori led troops against U.S. and coalition forces and is also wanted by the U.N. for possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shiites.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  Abdul Haq Wasik is a former deputy minister of intelligence.
[01:35.000 --> 01:47.000]  At one point, he tried to cooperate with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, asking for a GPS system as well as a special radio to communicate with the U.S. military after the invasion in 2001.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  His dossier says that while he was deputy intelligence minister, he was a crucial liaison between the Taliban and other Islamic fundamentalist groups.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  Mohamed Nabi Omari held several military leadership posts for the Taliban.
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.000]  He helped organize the al-Qaeda and Taliban militias that fought against U.S. and coalition troops in the first year of the war.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  Nabi maintained weapons caches and supported extremist activities by smuggling fighters and weapons.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  Nabi maintains strong ties to active networks.
[02:18.000 --> 02:30.000]  A former Taliban governor of Harat was considered by the Pentagon's 2008 dossier to be a likely heroin trafficker and a major opium drug lord in western Afghanistan.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  And he likely participated in meetings with Iranian officials after 9-11 to help plot attacks on U.S. forces.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  The dossier says the detainee claimed to be a longtime friend of Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  According to Afghanistananalysts.org, Karikwa is the most senior of the five on the list.
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.000]  He is one of the fraternity of original Taliban who launched the movement in 1994.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  In other words, he is someone who will still command a great deal of influence and respect among today's insurgents.
[03:02.000 --> 03:10.000]  This week's secret diplomacy was not the first time the U.S. government has engaged the Taliban in an effort to negotiate a prisoner swap for Bergdoll's release.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  In 2011, State Department officials held a series of meetings with Taliban leaders in Doha.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  At the time, Diane Feinstein opposed the swap, saying,
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  These are major Taliban figures, they are not minor people, and they will not be held in maximum security custody.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Forget that it won't be Guantanamo, just maximum security custody.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  And in my view, there's no way of knowing what they may do and what kind of propaganda they may breed.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  Lawmakers suspected the release Taliban could eventually end up returning to the fight.
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  So what has changed in the last few years?
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  We're live on this June 3, 2014, Tuesday edition.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. I am on the road today.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  I will be riding shotgun with David Knight, co-host of the radio show along with Paul Watson,
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  and also co-host of the radio show, slash TV transmission on a regular basis.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  So Watson will be joining us from England.
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.000]  We're also going to have another guest who has a TV network in England, a host on a TV network
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  that he also helps manage, who's going to be breaking down Bilderberg 2014 and, again, Richie Allen.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  So we're going to have Richie Allen, David Knight, Paul Watson, and Alex Jones here today.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  Huge developments on the rollout of the Homeland Security Grid against domestic groups,
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  breaking at infowars.com. It's all coming up straight ahead on this Tuesday edition.
[04:39.000 --> 05:08.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  It's the 400 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the earth.
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  Experience the new formula.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Experience the ancient purity.

[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  Survival Shield X2, available now at infowarslife.com.

[06:04.000 --> 06:09.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[06:13.000 --> 06:19.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[06:34.000 --> 06:41.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential cordial situation?
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.000]  The police are shoving people.
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  They're shoving Alex.
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.000]  They're shoving the crowd.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  Here we go, folks.
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  I'm being assigned to...
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news,
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  info wars is the tip of the spear.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  Is this another force flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homelands security
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  by sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.000]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  What we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  Visit infowars news.com today.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  We are the resistance. We are the info war.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, June 3rd, 2014.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of South Texas on the road with my family
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  but also working on some stories while I'm at it.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  We're going to have David Knight, host of info wars nightly news and cohost of this radio show
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  along with another host of the nightly news and cohost of this radio transmission.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  Paul Joseph Watson today and we have some other guests as well.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  Everything that we have predicted so far is now unfortunately beginning to unfold.
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.000]  And I say that with heavy heart because we know the globalist, we know their game plan
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  and for those of us that are informed and that read the globalist own statements,
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  it's in plain view, we know the other shoe is about to drop.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  We know their battle plan.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  We don't know exactly when they're going to be executing certain aspects of it but we know their goal
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  and we know that they always try to end up carrying out their goal.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  Even when they don't succeed, they try, try again.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's why the new world order technocrats are in control.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  Now, you've got shows like Homeland where you have U.S. military troops, Marines, Army,
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  you name it, that have been captured by Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the Akhani network.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  That's basically a globalist front group.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  I mean, those Muslim extremists exist but they've been funded and protected and they're doing a double deal
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  with the globalist.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  That's on record now in Libya, Syria, you name it.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  Egypt, the list goes on and on.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  And you have all these shows, movies, dramas, cartoons, comic books,
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  where returning veterans are Al Qaeda.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  We have the Washington Times, we have the Forbes magazine, AP Reuters, Southern Poverty Law Center,
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  all of them in the last two years coming out with countless headlines that the vets are going to team up
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  with Al Qaeda and attack America.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  The vets are going to team up with Al Qaeda and the Tea Party and attack America.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  The vets will attack your police department police.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  This is what the media says.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  You've gotten the internal reports going back six years, been public for two.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  We first broke this.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  But police all know you get these reports that say you will be attacked by veterans with IEDs fighting for Al Qaeda.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  And the number one terror threat is veterans linked up with the Tea Party in Al Qaeda.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's like saying in a comic book fashion that Superman likes kryptonite
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  and puts it on a cereal in the morning.
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  The most is lomaphobic, if you want to use that liberal term, group is the Tea Party.
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  The most pro-war group in the past has been the Tea Party type group.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  The last people, I know so many vets, so many troops.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  I mean, even if they don't like the wars, I know the wars were a fraud.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  They had buddies and people killed in combat.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  I have a lot of family that are active duty.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  I mean, they absolutely hate the jihadis with a passion and want to continue to go re-up just so they can fight them
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  and kill them and settle vendettas and scores.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  It is 180 degrees the opposite of reality, but that's how the Psyop works.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  They found in psych warfare that if you put out a lie so big, as Hitler said, the bigger the lie, the bigger they'll, you know,
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  just repeat it enough, they'll believe it.
[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  To say that the Liberty Movement and the Tea Party and the Anti-Fellow Reserve Movement, the pro-gun movement,
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  the pro-family movement is linking up with the Muslim extremists
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  and that the veterans are linking up with both groups.
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.000]  I first told you this six years ago with articles written by Kurt Nemo with videos embedded with myself breaking it down
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  where I told you they were going to roll out White Al Qaeda
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  because we got internal Justice Department memos when Obama first got in
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  and people saw these memos we put out in the articles and just said, there's no way you're nuts.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  About two years later, starting here in the first reports, White Al Qaeda is going to hit.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Veterans are going to hit.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  Veterans, IEDs, they're going to hit, they're going to hit, they're going to hit.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now you got TV shows, movies, and now you've got Beau Bergdahl.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  And I've really had time to think about this now three or four days.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  Whether he's just a AWOL guy that got picked up and turned or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[12:41.000 --> 12:51.000]  He's being used to sell the narrative now of domestic troops being Al Qaeda.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  While at the same time, Obama doesn't care how much trouble he gets in now because he can pardon himself,
[12:57.000 --> 13:05.000]  it's also part of demoralizing the military on so many fronts and really setting the precedent now to negotiate with Al Qaeda.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  And I've told you there's a reset going with Al Qaeda where they're rehabilitating them in the Washington Post
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  and in foreign affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations publications.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  You can type in the term, we need Al Qaeda.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  You can type in the term, Al Qaeda's doing a great job.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Al Qaeda's going to bring down Assad.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  You'll see CNN stories of, oh, the government is reaching out to Al Qaeda now on social networks.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  Being their friend, that'll reform them.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  That's introducing you to the idea that they're not bad guys anymore,
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  except when we need to have them attack us to then take your liberty.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  No, no, it's the Tea Party and the veterans.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  And again, folks, I'm not tooting my horn.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  I study the globalist.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  We have incredible sources.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  I mean, I have retired three-star general sources.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  I have retired two-star generals, one-star admirals.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  You've heard some of them on the air.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  That former Joint Chiefs on, like Admiral Moore before he died,
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  one of the most famous spies, but not famous because he is a real spy, would be Pachenek,
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  who the Jack Ryan character on record, Clancy said that he was based on.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  And I mean, it's really true, the Justice Department's getting set to indict him
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  for 30 years ago, reportedly not negotiating with the Red Brigade
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  when they killed the prime minister of Italy.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  And Paul Watson has an article out on that today.
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  I mean, I'm here on air interviewing people that only come on this show
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  and break this news.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  And quite frankly, I don't even know why in my life I'm in such a bizarro world.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  I'm not here bragging about all this.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  There's no doubt they're trying to indict Pachenek right now because he comes on this show
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  and blew the secrets of the CFR wide open here.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  There's no doubt.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  So I just want listeners to understand something.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  You're getting real information here, and I'm risking my life and my name and my treasure
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  and my family to bring you this information.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  And I don't want your thanks.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  I want your prayers because we're doing something real here.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  And it's an example of how we can change the world together.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  You go up to infowars.com.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  We have that article dealing with Pachenek.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  I'm going to be covering later.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  But Obama administration pursues ex-State Department official for refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  Steve Pachenek accused of being complicit in the murder of Italian prime minister.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  Folks, Pachenek's been accused of that in the BBC, the London Telegraph,
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  the big Italian papers for years.
[15:37.000 --> 15:46.000]  They're having a parliamentary governmental investigation last year of the CIA and the Army for that.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And I'll tell you a point blank, folks.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  I don't think Pachenek's a bad guy.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  He believes in what he's done.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  And I'll get him back on now that he's willing to talk about this.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  He's never been willing to talk about this before.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  But this is all gladio type stuff.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  I'm not saying Pachenek was involved in that.
[16:01.000 --> 16:02.000]  But then there's the argument.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Well, we stopped the comments from taking over.
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  So we want to let the communists take over Italy, Alex.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  We did what we had to do in combat.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  I mean, this is the attitude of these guys.
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  But now you notice gladio's false flags, folks, if you're a new listener.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  Famous false flags.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  And you would see that as a false flag.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Pachenek, they say, manipulated the Red Brigade into killing him
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  so that they could then turn everybody against the communists for killing the prime minister, who was popular.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  But still, that's not really a false flag in the classical sense.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  If he didn't negotiate and they killed the prime minister, then how are they trying to indict him?
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  He even gave the case number yesterday.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  We looked it up.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  It's a huge story.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  Now, let's shift gears here, folks.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  I just got into that so you understand the level we're at.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  I'm in this way above my head.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  I'm in this 1,000 feet above my head.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  But let's get something clear.
[17:01.000 --> 17:09.000]  Anyone in government, Obama, the Clintons, the globalists, Vladimir Putin, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds,
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  anybody who thinks that they're in control of this and that they're in over their heads are lying to themselves.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  The truth is, we're all in over our heads.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  The establishment is out of control.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  They can't even see the angles anymore because there is no chivalry.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  There is no honor.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  Pachennic was sanctioned on record for operations for the army and the Pentagon and the CIA.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  This has come out in the hearings.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  They declassified it a few years ago in Italy.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  That's when they declassified.
[17:38.000 --> 17:43.000]  The government knew that Gladio was with the U.S. Army staging terror attacks and blaming on the communists.
[17:43.000 --> 17:51.000]  Separate thing, but in the same basket that the Italian government was in on as well.
[17:51.000 --> 18:01.000]  When you look at this, now they're trying to burn Pachennic and opening up this whole can of worms just because he comes on this show.
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.000]  You can guarantee he hardly even, you know, publishes books anymore.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  He coauthored stuff with Clancy, produced movies, you name it.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  That's kind of a shadowy guy.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  Nobody even knows what he really looks like.
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.000]  And then now they're trying to put him in jail.
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  I mean, that shows how reckless they are.
[18:20.000 --> 18:29.000]  And then no one releases somebody like Bergdahl, who's clearly bare minimum AWOL, for five terrorists.
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  Knowing now that even if they're not terrorists, people will start grabbing embassy people, military people, officers.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  Nobody's safe.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  I mean, you don't do things like this.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  You don't negotiate with terrorists.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Their attitude was that the people at Waco were terrorists when they weren't.
[18:45.000 --> 18:58.000]  They were a domestic group attacked premeditatedly, but they burned that place down and sent Delta Force in to blow up the church records vault, the concrete building inside to kill the kids with a shape-charged mine on the roof.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  Because the attitude was we kill everyone we don't negotiate with terrorists.
[19:02.000 --> 19:09.000]  And the Delta Force memo came out that we're going to be pulling triggers, and this is not an arrest situation.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  We have the flare footage of them killing everybody that tries to go out the back.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  So anybody who's done these operations for the globalists now, you can be hung out to dry.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  Don't be involved in stuff like this.
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000]  Don't do immoral stuff where you stage terror attacks, believing you're fighting something even more evil.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  So you do it to blame it on the evil, to bring down the evil.
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  You don't defeat the evil.
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.000]  You become the evil.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  Now, when we come back, we'll talk to David Knight.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  Holder could create homeland security, domestic task force in every town.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  It's coming.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  It's Northcom.
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  Freeze-dry your own fruits, vegetables, meats, and full meals.
[19:50.000 --> 19:57.000]  With Harvest Right, you can prepare foods that last 25 years, preserving its freshness, nutrition, color, and taste.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  All your food can be freeze-dried.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  So don't throw away your leftovers.
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  Freeze-dry them with this incredible in-home money-saving freeze-dryer.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  Go to harvestright.com to see how the Harvest Right freeze-dryer works.
[20:10.000 --> 20:13.000]  That's harvestright.com.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  This is Michael Steger, candidate for Congress in San Francisco.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  There's a vote this Tuesday.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  If you want to send a message to both political parties and their Wall Street backers, here's your chance.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  It's time we impeach Obama.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  He's like Dick Cheney but worse.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  Torture, spying, wars, bailouts.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  He's a disaster.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  He went straight to Wall Street and never turned back.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  Next, pass Glassdeagle just like Franklin Roosevelt and shut down Wall Street.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  It's time to put some bankers in jail.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  Then, go back to the policies of John Kennedy, reignite our space program and fusion research,
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  and initiate big projects like water development to end the drought.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  You want a future?
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  You want a nation you can be proud of?
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  Then it's time to stop complaining and get out and vote.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  Tuesday, June 3rd.
[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's not about you.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  It's about the future and now is the time to fight.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  This is Michael Steger and I have approved this message.
[21:38.000 --> 22:03.000]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[22:08.000 --> 22:37.000]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[22:37.000 --> 23:03.000]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[23:03.000 --> 23:32.000]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[23:33.000 --> 24:00.000]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, riding shotgun today, or David Knight, and Paul Watson,
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  and I'll be handing the baton to them in the second and third hour today.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  I'll be hosting all the shows coming up next week back in studio,
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  but I think it's great to get some of the other hosts in here,
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  because I think they do as good a job as I do, in some cases even better.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  David Knight's got really painful but also powerful news dealing with suffocating babies.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  We're shooting black people up with syphilis.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  It's for research, too.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Then, oh, it's just abortion. It's not killing a baby.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's just infanticide. They can get away with anything.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  You've heard about them heating hospitals with burned babies and killing babies out of the womb.
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  How about suffocating babies? How about cutting off their oxygen?
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  You or I do that. We go to prison and we should, but when the loving government does it,
[24:47.000 --> 25:00.000]  oh, then it's okay. So, again, that is coming up.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Now, getting back to this article on infoawards.com,
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  Holder to Create Homegrown Terrorism Task Force.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  Well, let me give you a newsflash. They've already done it.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  And the Viper teams and the TSA are to be the little federal minors
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  and they're going to arm them now. It's already happened with the Viper teams
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  a decade ago or more.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.000]  And then it's locally trained special units of police who get extra pay.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  So, everyone scrambles want to be part of that.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  These special event police were first just the SWAT teams.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  Now, it's basically half the force in major cities like Boston, New York.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  And this is the federalization of police and the new target,
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  Holder, you can go watch the video reported in infoawards.com.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  Holder says it shouldn't be overseas and shouldn't be al-Qaeda.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  Just what the secret document said six years ago.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  You guessed it, it's who? Veterans? Gun owners? Tea partiers?
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  Because they're with who? Al-Qaeda.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Now, the White House is really with Al-Qaeda.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  60 plus percent of the force attacking Assad for three plus years is Al-Qaeda.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  It's on record, but it's public. It doesn't matter. No, no, no.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  I'm a libertarian constitutionalist gun owner.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  So, see, I'm a suspect now with Al-Qaeda, yes.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  And I've also got Keebler elves in my pocket.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  And I rode to work today on a unicorn.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  And when I go to the bathroom folks, a potpourri comes out.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  I mean, I don't mean to be gross here, but this is pure bitch.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  And everybody knows it, but we need to call the scum out
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  because it's meant to be over the top.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  But the general public goes, well, it's over the top. It must be true.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  And then the cops are just good up against the wall. You might be one of them.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  I mean, it's just, no, I reject it, okay?
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  I don't use the drugs the government ships in on record.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  I'm not involved in all the government corruption, all the corporate corruption.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  I'm not guilty. I'm innocent until proven guilty,
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  not innocent until I'm proven a collectivist progressive slave.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  You people are the ones involved in all the weirdness.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  I mean, look at Acron and all these navigator groups they've got.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  Of course we predicted they'd be engaged in all these new crimes.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  And now it turns out in every major city, the navigators are just stealing money,
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  stealing IDs, stealing, I mean, it's just, it's a criminal group folks.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  And criminals get off on doing bad things.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  They get off on releasing a deserter and releasing five terrorists.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  They get off on teaching kids that, you know,
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  and showing five-year-olds in public schools to men French kissing.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  A normal person just doesn't want to corrupt a kid with heterosexual or homosexual stuff.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  They're deviant ladies and gentlemen.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  I never get sick of camping, never get sick of fishing,
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  never get tired of hanging out with my buddies and laughing,
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  never get tired of, you know, beautiful women, you know, looking at them, admiring them.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  I just like normal stuff, never get tired of the Caribbean,
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  never get tired of the sun, never get tired of enchiladas,
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  never get tired of playing with my children, never get tired of beautiful art,
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  never get tired of great weather, never get tired of being honorable.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  Just, just, I'm not in to screwed up things.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  They are, and they're coming after us.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  And they're saying we're al-Qaeda.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  And if we roll over and let them say we're al-Qaeda when they publicly run al-Qaeda,
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  then we deserve what we get.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  Attorney General Eric Holder unveiled his plan to create a new Justice Department task force this week,
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  which will focus on the threat of homegrown terrorism.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  In the video posted on the department's website Monday, which we have linked,
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  but I want you guys to go get it. I want to play that.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  I don't know why we didn't embed it, but for whatever reason.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  In the video posted on the department's website Monday, Holder,
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  in fact, just call Watson, asked him to link to it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:45.000]  Holder argued that the focus on terrorism should return to the U.S. as opposed to remaining overseas.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  We face an escalating danger from self-radicalized individuals on our own borders,
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  Holder said, as the nature of the threat we face evolves and include the possibility
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  of individual radicalization via the Internet.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  See, the Internet free speech is terrorism now.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  It is critical that we return our focus to potential extremists here at home.
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  We're going to come back and finish this and then get to the special information
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  that's really incredible with babies.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  You know, I say cutting off oxygen to babies in the neonatal unit, I think that's terrorism.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  Promoting George Washington to private property in the family and guns is not terrorism,
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  but to scumbag criminal filth it is.
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.000]  Who wants to indict our guest, Dr. Pachinick, because he comes on the show.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  I don't know what it is. Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  It's like I don't even exist.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  Oh, Betty, that's just awful.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  Does this seem familiar? If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  Look it up.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives,
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  Energize the man in your life with super male vitality from infowarslight.com.

[30:43.000 --> 30:47.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  On average, the county said it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[31:46.000 --> 31:53.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest-purity iodine available.
[31:53.000 --> 32:04.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[32:04.000 --> 32:14.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient, 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the earth.
[32:14.000 --> 32:22.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[32:22.000 --> 32:27.000]  Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.
[32:27.000 --> 32:33.000]  Shield your family. Survival Shield X2. Available now at infowarslight.com.
[32:33.000 --> 32:43.000]  X2 from infowarslight.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[33:03.000 --> 33:18.000]  All right, we're going to David Knight here in just a few minutes to get his take on the dust department's full rollout with local domestic spy units you name it looking for the terrorist.
[33:18.000 --> 33:25.000]  That means the ATF, back to the Clinton days, bearing pipe bombs on your property and saying Alex Jones had pipe bombs.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  That's the standard deal that they did to literally hundreds of people back under Clinton.
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.000]  Or having one of their informants claim, yeah, I heard Alex at the bar.
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.000]  He was claiming he was going to, you know, shoot the governor or something.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  Let's get one thing straight. I don't have any illegal weapons.
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.000]  I don't plan any offensive attacks against government. Never have, never will.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  I'm in the Info War, but I will defend myself of attack by anybody.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  And I have that natural right.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  But just last week, the ATF wants to ban Tannerite. We have a shooting show we do occasionally for Info Wars Nightly News.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  And you can go to the store and buy Tannerite.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  And, you know, might as well ban fireworks if you're going to ban that.
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.000]  I mean, the mortars you shoot out of a firework are probably 20 times more powerful explosively than Tannerite.
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  I know I play around with it, you know, fireworks and Tannerite on the shooting range on TV.
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  And they're now trying to say that's terrorism and ban it.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  They want to make us the bad guys.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  They want to shift this whole bureaucracy onto us.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  That's what always happens in countries.
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.000]  That's what tyranny is, is government decides to just take over via the special interests that are controlling it.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  And you can go to the report on InfoWars.com where we have the quotes from the Justice Department's own website.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  And we have the new Department of Defense Directive saying their main mission is fighting domestic groups, the Tea Party here in America.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  That came out last week in the Washington Times, Bill Gerrits.
[34:52.000 --> 35:04.000]  So we also have Fox News and Napolitano doing a report on the FBI creates in foils 99 out of 100 terror plots.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  Even the New York Times had to admit 99 out of 100.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  And I want to give government credit.
[35:12.000 --> 35:19.000]  This only happens to me maybe once a year now. It used to happen at gas stations, at the shopping mall, at the grocery store,
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  at any video signing event or any event I went to.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  They would have two or three different feds come up and say, hey, Alex, let's start killing feds.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  Let's start blowing stuff up.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  Come out in the parking lot. I've got a rocket launcher.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  And I would just say, you're obviously a Fed or a federal informant.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  Hey, get a camera on this guy.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  And they go, hey, no big deal, Alex. See you later.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  Just making sure you're not playing anything.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  I mean, half the time they would admit they were feds.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  You know, guys would get on both sides of me on an elevator and go, want to attack the State Department today, Alex?
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  We know how to attack it.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  And it's like, you know, six foot four giant Marine Corps colonels.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  And I go, you guys are Marines, aren't you?
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  I know that's who guards the State Department.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  Well, we do know people with the State Department security.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  You better not plan anything.
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  I'm just like, you guys are really a joke.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  I start taking photos of them.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  I mean, you know, that happened at Bilderberg in 2008 because Hillary and Obama were there and they were hopping mad.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  This is at my hotel three miles away.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  I've got Marine Corps office.
[36:21.000 --> 36:27.000]  I mean, it's just, they were driving around flipping us off and stuff that they're underlings days later, following us around.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  So I'd pull over and get out and then they'd drive off.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  I mean, it's like, look, I haven't done anything.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  I'm a good guy just because you say I'm a bad guy and imagine I'm doing something wrong.
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  That's not true.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  The globalists are the ones running this country into the ground that have hijacked it legitimately.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  And I'll use the French analogy of the Vichy French who stood down to Hitler.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  You have to dig into the history books, but that's really a fact.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  The French just stood down, folks, because most of their general staff had been paid off.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  They were then made the oligarchs, the dictators of France.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.000]  And if you guys want to sell out to this, you know, be my guest, you're going to be hung out to dry and we're going to be opposing you.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  Your bosses will hang you out to dry from one angle and we're going to be opposing you from the angle.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Dishonor is not the way to go.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  And I know most people in the military and the police for that matter are not dishonorable.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  You're just compartmentalized.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  So that's why the globalists are having trouble executing all this because they're up there on the news going,
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  our new enemy is the Tea Party.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  And anyone who's an evangelical Christian may be court-martialed.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  That's Fox News with the Army Manual last year saying, don't be part of the Tea Party or the evangelicals.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  You may be court-martialed.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  Obviously, the people saying and doing that are the bad people.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  It's like the Simpsons episode where the aliens land.
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  They have two big heads and they're like, we have taken over your planet.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  Submit and we will treat you nice, you know, like politicians.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  Or you can vote for slur or for gore.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  Or it's something like that.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  And we can find the clip on YouTube.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  But I mean, if aliens landed and came out and said, we're your rulers, arrest Ron Paul, arrest Alex Jones,
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  would you then say, yes, I'm for the aliens?
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  Because the globalists are that alien to America, that alien to freedom, that openly authoritarian.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  Your children belong to us.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  Turn your guns in.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  Raising the debt does not raise the debt.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Two plus two equals five.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  If you have a business, you didn't build it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  We're going to teach your five-year-olds how two men, French kiss, everything is fine.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  You have to vote for one of us.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  This is a two-party system.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  Well, I believe I'll vote for a third-party candidate.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  Go ahead, throw your vote away.
[38:36.000 --> 38:45.000]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  And again, if you're watching on TV, you could see the aliens there.
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  But at the podium and everybody deciding, well, we better vote for one.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.680]  for one. I mean, I actually think if aliens landed had green skin but walked out and said
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.960]  you're racist if you don't give us your children's brains, there would be people that came out
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.000]  with meat cleavers, hacked their kids' heads up and pulled the brains out and would run
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.960]  up under Stockholm syndrome giving the brains to the aliens. I'm not kidding. In fact, if
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.800]  the aliens were scary looking, they would do it even faster because they would, oh, let
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.160]  me appease you. The aliens said good. Your children's brains are delicious. Now we're
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.560]  going to melon ball yours. This is the mind control of the normalcy bias, the man's Stockholm
[39:25.560 --> 39:29.960]  syndrome, the learned helplessness, whatever you want to call it. I personally am done
[39:29.960 --> 39:34.280]  with it. Now David's got some big breaking news. We're getting up at infowars.com. It's
[39:34.280 --> 39:38.000]  only at Drudge right now that I saw it, so we'll show that on screen in a moment when
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.080]  we get to it. But it's just par for the course and we're going to break down the eugenics
[39:42.080 --> 39:48.280]  movement medical experimentation on children currently going on. And this just broke. They've
[39:48.280 --> 39:55.720]  been covering it up since 2006. But before I go any further, the system is flipping everything
[39:55.720 --> 40:00.000]  now onto the American people. It's that simple. And they're announcing, yep, the army's preparing
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.280]  for war against the American people. And it's the Tea Party gun owners veterans. Yes, we're
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.160]  going to set up local rule, homeland security, military units to watch the farmers and to
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.320]  work with farmers to spy on each other. We should be spying on the criminal illegitimate
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.520]  government. But again, people don't know about occupation. They don't know about collaborators.
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.800]  They don't know about infiltration. They don't know about corporate infiltration. They don't
[40:23.800 --> 40:28.960]  know about economic hit men. The third world knows about this. We have been so free here
[40:28.960 --> 40:35.000]  for so long. We literally have no political immune system to this and are wide open.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.800]  And it's happening. The good news is military brass were concerned and leaked this information
[40:40.800 --> 40:44.560]  to the Washington Times last week that we covered so much. And it's just the latest
[40:44.560 --> 40:51.560]  signpost. We already know that here. But the point is, it's a debate is forming. And then
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.320]  now the Justice Department's out today, you know, saying we need to target the American
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.240]  people. We're going to get that video clip and play it coming up in the next hour. So
[40:59.240 --> 41:04.920]  this is the reality. Now, before I shift gears into the culture of total experimentation,
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.800]  the culture of dehumanization with David Knight prepared a hand to baton to him and Paul Watson
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.760]  coming up for the next two hours and a special guest that's also joining us from Europe with
[41:13.760 --> 41:19.600]  some breaking news and Intel on Bilderberg and kind of the condensed final data or datum
[41:19.600 --> 41:25.480]  on that. I want to remind listeners that we have the very best products available in my
[41:25.480 --> 41:32.680]  view available at info wars life dot com. And we have now the super female vitality that
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.160]  sold out, but they had close to 1000 bottles at the laboratory that they'd overrun for
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.400]  us knowing we'd need more. And so after that's gone, we may not have any for upwards of a
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.680]  month. We've only done internal, you know, tests with folks have tried it. It's 10 different
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.200]  known concentrated organic herbs that are known to revitalize women, their glands, you
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.880]  name it, libido energy. We've seen bigger response with women with this than we've seen
[41:57.880 --> 42:01.640]  with men with the super male vitality and the response has been excellent with that.
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.720]  You've heard the reviews from callers unsolicited. And we thought women went bonkers good, you
[42:07.720 --> 42:12.680]  know, happy when they did the male vitality that's got eight herbs. This has two more
[42:12.680 --> 42:17.400]  with the female vitality, super female vitality. It's just that it affects women more. They
[42:17.400 --> 42:24.280]  go even more bonkers in a good way, bouncing off the walls in a good way from what we've
[42:24.280 --> 42:30.480]  seen with energy, you name it, when they do the super female vitality. So try it, ladies
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.680]  and gentlemen, regardless, you're, you're funding the broadcast and what we're doing.
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.960]  And then we've got the new X two super iodine that comes from seven to 10,000 feet in the
[42:39.960 --> 42:48.240]  ground. That's how deep the mine is purple, true iodine crystals. We know of no other
[42:48.240 --> 42:54.440]  supplier or manufacturer that has this source and it took group years to get this source.
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.640]  You had to jump through a lot of DEA hoops to get this source, which can do a lot of
[42:58.640 --> 43:05.640]  stuff, obviously with the raw iodine. And this is now in the glycerin tincture from
[43:05.640 --> 43:14.040]  palm oil of the highest quality, totally organic. And I forgot to bring a bottle with me on
[43:14.040 --> 43:19.800]  this five day trip. And Richard, will you ask them to overnight it to our next destination,
[43:19.800 --> 43:27.520]  a bottle of X two immediately please. I'm literally kicking myself since I left Sunday,
[43:27.520 --> 43:33.760]  running my X two. I brought my super male. I brought my silver bullet. I did not bring,
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.720]  I brought my lung cleanse. I did not bring X two. I thought I brought it from my house.
[43:37.720 --> 43:42.200]  We have X two. It will sell out, but it'll only be a few weeks till we get more X two.
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.800]  If you want the X two, get it. It's available right now at info wars life.com. Now we still
[43:47.800 --> 43:50.960]  got the original survival shield. It's excellent. I think it's great for children, consult your
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.240]  physician beforehand because it's a lot more palatable and not as strong. Regular iodine
[43:55.240 --> 44:00.800]  is bound. It's black. It stays black on paper. It's still something great, you know, something
[44:00.800 --> 44:03.720]  you need obviously in my view and what doctors and others have said and even the government
[44:03.720 --> 44:10.800]  admits you need it. But the issue is we, this, this, this survival shield is more palatable
[44:10.800 --> 44:15.360]  and is not bound and turns blue on paper, not black. Now we have the bright red. You've
[44:15.360 --> 44:21.200]  never seen iodine like this bright red alive X two that then turns electric blue purple
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.200]  on paper. We've got a test of that just showing people just the way it looks to the eye.
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.480]  Why it's so different against leading competitors. I'm not even against leading competitors.
[44:29.480 --> 44:33.240]  I started out a few years ago trying to protect my thyroid and other things and taking the
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.600]  Lugels and stuff and it just hurt my stomach and it didn't feel good and it just didn't
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.000]  have the same effect. Some people, it's fine. Some people like the other type better. I
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.400]  think more power too. You should stock it all because from what I've read, it may last
[44:44.400 --> 44:49.920]  longer than ours. The issue here is that this stuff is bio available right out of the blood
[44:49.920 --> 44:52.920]  from what I've been told. Just find out for yourself regardless. You're supporting the
[44:52.920 --> 45:05.200]  broadcast 888-253-3139 to call and order 888-253-3139. 888-253-3139. I want to thank you all for

[45:36.360 --> 45:42.080]  the report that just went live at infowars.com that I saw on Drudge this morning that made
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.880]  me angry. If the globalist can set the precedent to nerve gas our troops and even kill them
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.520]  in secret tests like Shad and inject black people with syphilis and let them spread it
[45:52.520 --> 45:58.480]  for 50 years and die of it, total torture, microscopic worms that you're bringing. If
[45:58.480 --> 46:04.720]  they can just constantly do all this and burn down Waco and under US code, title, 50 chapter
[46:04.720 --> 46:11.040]  32 sub 61528 paragraph B, say that secret testing is illegal unless it's for law enforcement
[46:11.040 --> 46:16.360]  or research purposes, then it can be lethal. They have it on the books. They can kill us.
[46:16.360 --> 46:22.280]  Well, I say your laws of stinking fraud, but this is the technocratic mad scientist, dialing
[46:22.280 --> 46:28.640]  of Dr. Maru meets Joseph Mingola, angel of death mindset that is about kill babies up
[46:28.640 --> 46:33.480]  to age three, kill the old death panels, don't give the soldiers health care much worse under
[46:33.480 --> 46:38.520]  Obama. It's a plan. It's a plan. And David Knight's got details of the report. We're
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.120]  working on getting the lady on. We've been working on it a few days, but now it's broken
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.800]  and gotten big. David Knight, tell us about this latest horror as we're totally dehumanized
[46:47.800 --> 46:53.080]  and as the government sets the precedent to kill us or bring us close to death and do
[46:53.080 --> 46:57.080]  illegal testing whenever they feel like it, just like they've got caught doing secret
[46:57.080 --> 47:02.320]  lethal testing in New York state on foster kids, New York daily news until the kids die
[47:02.320 --> 47:09.800]  feeding little black kids pesticides. Al Sharpton said nothing. Yeah, absolutely. Alex, this
[47:09.800 --> 47:13.120]  is the story that's being broken by Cheryl Atkinson. And if you remember just before
[47:13.120 --> 47:17.560]  I started info wars, there was a story that info wars broke about experiments that were
[47:17.560 --> 47:25.840]  going on by the government at the University of North Carolina at their hospital. Now this
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.760]  is at the University of Alabama at their hospital. And the parallel in both of these cases is
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.240]  that they're experimenting on people. There is no informed consent in either of these cases,
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.640]  of course, and you cannot even with informed consent do things to people that would threaten
[47:42.640 --> 47:47.800]  their life. Now in the case of North Carolina, they were taking diesel exhaust and feeding
[47:47.800 --> 47:52.080]  that directly into a mask with people who were sitting in an enclosed room. And they
[47:52.080 --> 47:57.240]  had searched for people who had respiratory and heart illnesses because they were trying
[47:57.240 --> 48:03.000]  to bump up this is under Lisa Jackson. To then cook the books. Exactly. Cook the books.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.480]  And wasn't it hundreds of times the safe level? Yes, yes, it was. It was it was like 72,
[48:08.480 --> 48:15.040]  between 70 to 100 times what they said was lethal. And she had gone on into congressional
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.560]  testimony. Lisa Jackson said there's more people dying from fine particulate matter
[48:19.560 --> 48:23.600]  than there are from cancer because what they were trying to do was to increase their bureaucracy.
[48:23.600 --> 48:27.480]  They were trying to increase the regulation. They're trying to shut down traditional power
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.840]  sources. But in this case, you have to understand, have to wonder what in the world is their
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.480]  agenda. And let me read from this report from Cheryl Adkinson because what she points out,
[48:36.480 --> 48:42.800]  this is going back to 2006, a family with a child born at 24 weeks of the pregnancy.
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.840]  It's only one pound, 11 ounces. They say he lays motionless in the incubator. And he's
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.600]  in the neonatal intensive care unit. And so these people from the government, from a National
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.040]  Institute of Health funded study, come to them and she says, I remember them telling
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.760]  me that they were a support group who would be pretty much hold my hand through the development
[49:01.760 --> 49:09.520]  process. Now, we talk about a cynical... These are literal treacherous devil demons, literally
[49:09.520 --> 49:13.680]  praying on someone lying and saying we're going to help your baby while they prepare
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.600]  to suffocate them. Yes. Now, where does a support group come from? Well, they could
[49:18.600 --> 49:22.600]  say, well, no, we told her that we were part of a study called support. And this is an
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.280]  acronym and they choose these acronyms very carefully. It actually stands for surplicant
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.880]  positive airway pressure and pulse oximetry randomized trial. But they can come in and
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.600]  say we're part of a support group. Now, what they're actually doing is a randomly manipulating
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.520]  oxygen. And by the way, it's okay because it's a fancy acronym support. It's okay to
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.080]  turn the oxygen off. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And they presented themselves. This lady understood
[49:46.080 --> 49:52.000]  them presenting themselves as a support group. And no way did they ever tell these parents
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.640]  that they were going to randomly adjust the oxygen to this little premature baby who's
[49:56.640 --> 50:02.080]  struggling with so many health problems. You don't have to be a doctor or rocket scientist
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.920]  to know that if you deprive anyone, especially a premature baby of oxygen, that's going
[50:06.920 --> 50:10.080]  to cause... That's right. And in the study, for those that don't know, with thousands
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.200]  of babies I was reading all over the country, that they would sit there and literally test
[50:14.200 --> 50:19.120]  what would happen when they started turning it off. I mean, this is unbelievable, folks.
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.760]  And this is their attitude that we're animals, and they're doing this to us. We're going
[50:22.760 --> 50:25.640]  to come back. I want you to read through the report and tell them exactly what they were
[50:25.640 --> 50:31.440]  doing straight ahead. This is who run things. But as long as you go, it's liberal, David,
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.480]  we need to stop being racist, criticizing governments racist. We need to take the black
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.400]  children and give them pesticides till they die, or Salon will write a mean article about
[50:41.400 --> 50:47.840]  us, and we're racist. This Hour of GCN Programming proudly sponsored by BlockitPocket.com. You're

[53:56.360 --> 54:02.960]  Oh hi, your baby. It's premature. We're here from the federal government. We've got a group
[54:02.960 --> 54:08.280]  called Support. We're here to support you when you're out of the room and stuff. We turn
[54:08.280 --> 54:13.800]  the oxygen down to watch your baby struggle, see what happens. And of course you'll find
[54:13.800 --> 54:19.720]  out that, I bet money that some of the kids didn't make it, but who knows? And that robs
[54:19.720 --> 54:23.680]  the, you know, the whole hospital in to getting used to the secret testing and the bioethics
[54:23.680 --> 54:29.160]  boards and the attitude, oh, don't help that kid. It's premature. This is the new culture
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.080]  coming into medicine that we've been warning you about. And we could hire more people and
[54:33.080 --> 54:36.760]  we weren't taking care of these lazy vets. All the whistleblowers are, you know, coming
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.920]  out saying, we ought to take these vets out and shoot them. All our money goes to them.
[54:41.920 --> 54:49.480]  And again, used to it was troops, poor Appalachus people, folks in the Appalachians, the Appalachians
[54:49.480 --> 54:55.960]  and black people. I got to say, Hispanics, Mexicans in the Southwest, because I read
[54:55.960 --> 55:00.960]  the studies and looked it up, they run from, run from the quote, free healthcare and the
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.240]  government vans. That's why they had promos in Austin telling the Hispanic immigrant population,
[55:06.240 --> 55:12.440]  trust us, get in the system, come, come. And they're like, no, we don't think so. But
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.280]  down in Mexico too, they're running from the Gardasil shots. They're not stupid, but white
[55:16.280 --> 55:21.080]  people and blacks love it. And I mean, they love it. And the Appalachians, they come grab
[55:21.080 --> 55:23.920]  them even though they don't trust the government. So this is who they've been targeting. But
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.760]  now it's expanded just to anybody premature baby. Well, when you're not looking, we're
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.920]  going to turn the oxygen off. How's that sound? David Knight, go over the report itself and
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.480]  tell us why you're hateful and don't want to support people. I wonder if I come up the
[55:36.480 --> 55:40.200]  street with a bag and say, I like to put this over your head so you can't breathe. It's
[55:40.200 --> 55:44.720]  for support. We ought to go out into a promo like that and just say, can I put this bag
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.320]  over your head and start affixiating you? I mean, it's good for babies. I mean, the
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.800]  feds are doing it. You're not a terrorist are you? Go ahead, David.
[55:51.800 --> 55:58.320]  This is essentially what the Nazis were accused of doing. Don't be racist. Just trying to.
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.920]  We'd like to know exactly what the sweet spot is for the appropriate amount of oxygen for
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.160]  these kids. That's what the National Institute of Health study was ostensibly for. They said
[56:07.160 --> 56:11.920]  that the medical personnel routinely give supplemental oxygen to babies born with immature
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.760]  lungs. Too much oxygen can cause severe eye damage, including a blood vessel disease and
[56:16.760 --> 56:22.120]  blindness called retinopathy. Too little oxygen may lead to brain damage and death. Of course,
[56:22.120 --> 56:27.880]  we know that. So that's why the NIH funded this study. But of course, unless you're
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.360]  Joseph Mingula, you know, you're not allowed to do experiments on people without their
[56:32.360 --> 56:37.040]  consent. Plus, I've already dealt with people. I've already dealt with family in this. They
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.160]  already know the sweet spot for oxygen. Right. It's a little bit higher than they're supposed
[56:41.160 --> 56:45.000]  to normally get and they balance it. If the baby's going to die without oxygen, you give
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.920]  it as much as you need to and that has eye problems. That's better than being brain damaged.
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.560]  They already have it all figured out. The NIH is just running around playing God, breaking
[56:53.560 --> 56:56.840]  the law to set the precedent. Sorry. Go ahead. That's right. Now you said we're going to
[56:56.840 --> 56:59.840]  find out some of these children died. Yes, one of them did. And her story, she's talking
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.760]  about three different families and two of those families, the children are now seven
[57:03.760 --> 57:07.440]  years old. They both struggled. They said with myriad health problems, one of those
[57:07.440 --> 57:13.200]  children died, a third child died within three weeks. So that's the thing. And what really
[57:13.200 --> 57:17.880]  strikes me, Alex, is not just that they would do this type of thing, because we've seen
[57:17.880 --> 57:22.840]  this as we reported on. It's happened over and over again. But just this kind of manipulative
[57:22.840 --> 57:28.640]  Machiavellian way they come in and say, we're support. They force this into an acronym that
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.240]  they can come in and use and make these parents think that they're a support group, that these
[57:32.240 --> 57:35.240]  children are going to get all the normal health care that they normally would. Well, it's
[57:35.240 --> 57:40.760]  like Patriot Act or Homeland Security or New Freedom Initiative or Affordable Care Act
[57:40.760 --> 57:46.240]  that doubles and triples your prices. I mean, it's all a big sick joke on us by these freaks.
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.160]  And that's the realization you got to come to, folks. I've only just now come to it after
[57:50.160 --> 57:55.160]  almost 20 years on air. The globalists really enjoy hurting people. I mean, those of us
[57:55.160 --> 57:58.840]  that aren't evil, we just don't get it. David Knight's coming up. I'm going to be five more
[57:58.840 --> 58:03.040]  minutes with him. We're going to hand the baton to Paul Watson and he, while I spend
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.360]  some good time with my children. But wild horses can't drag me away. So I'm still here.
[58:07.360 --> 58:12.200]  Folks, please spread the word about the broadcast. We have decoded the enemy operation. This show
[58:12.200 --> 58:16.560]  does have the pulse of what's happening worldwide. We need to reach more people. Tell 10 people

[59:18.080 --> 59:21.880]  can say is it's a lot better now. I've just started taking super female vitality from

[59:39.720 --> 01:00:09.040]  GCN Radio Network. Alright folks, into hour number two. We've
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.760]  got so much massive news. So many important things we haven't even gotten to yet. We haven't
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.560]  recapped the final developments at Goldberg 2014 and how important this year's coverage
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.120]  was. I wouldn't say as big as last year, but with thousands of protesters, but it was
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.520]  definitely a big year with a lot of foreign coverage. David Knight is going to be covering
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.240]  that in the third hour with a special guest from England. Paul Watson's coming up in
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.760]  about 20 minutes. He'll be riding shotgun with David Knight as well. But David, getting
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.560]  back into the secret experimentation, this is only the tip of the iceberg. What else
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.400]  is going on? We don't know about. And when the group you're affiliated with and worked
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:52.000]  with, caught them gassing people in hospitals, no one got in trouble this year. And then
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.360]  now will anyone get in trouble killing premies, cutting their oxygen off? I mean, it's just
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.120]  getting incredible. That's right, Alex. I thought one of the interesting things out
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.720]  of this article was it said that nine months after they had a public meeting to examine
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:10.960]  this, NIH and HHS officials have yet to propose a remedy to avoid a repeat of the controversy.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.080]  Well, of course, because when it was exposed about the EPA testing at the University of
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.040]  North Carolina, the group I was involved with filed a restraining order, tried to get a temporary
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.520]  restraining order. The judge turned that down. They've now been rebuffed throughout the
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.760]  different levels. So the government is fine with this kind of stuff. And of course, they're
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:34.000]  not going to get anything from the NIH to keep from having a repeat of this. It keeps ongoing.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.080]  But let me read you this quote from an internationally recognized expert on research ethics. This
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.520]  is a Dr. Michael Karame or Karom. I'm not sure how he pronounces his last name. But
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.800]  he said, the word unethical doesn't even begin to describe the egregious and shocking deficiencies
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.060]  in the informed consent process for the study. He said, parents of the infants who were enrolled
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.120]  in this study were misled about its purpose. They were misled to believe everything was
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.960]  being done in the name of standard care. Therefore, there were no predictable risks to their babies.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.840]  And yet we see they have tremendous risks. Many of them have had serious vision disorders
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.960]  because they got too much oxygen. Many others have been brain damaged because they didn't
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.600]  have sufficient oxygen. At least one of the three that she's talking about specifically
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.920]  in her article died. So that's the situation.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.800]  David, this is too important. Paul Watson's going to be joining you in the next segment.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.880]  I want you to start the next segment. I'm going to hand the baton to you right now.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.040]  I'd like you to go back into these numbers and just boil down this Mengele level stuff
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.120]  for people and put bookends on it for them so they understand the elitist mentality and
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.840]  then get into all the other news you're going to be covering today. What else are you planning
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.320]  to get to? I know Watson's adding a link to the Justice Department video in his article
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.800]  where holders said the main threat is domestic groups. They're setting up domestic task forces
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.600]  to go after anybody that isn't a total criminal and anybody that loves freedom. What else
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.160]  are you going to be covering today, David?
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.120]  Well, you know, Alex, this is a story coming from Cheryl Atkinson, a member of Shew's
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.920]  reporter who left CBS. She was absolutely fed up with the way the news was controlled
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.360]  and censored to promote an agenda. And so we're going to talk about that. We're also
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.040]  going to talk about how we're seeing real journalists stand up like this young teenager,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.720]  Andrew Demeter. Now, he was an entrant into the Paul Revere contest. He had several excellent
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.720]  entries in there. And of course, he really embarrassed Nancy Pelosi just by asking her
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.280]  direct questions about the NSA's activity.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:32.440]  Let's get into that. Absolutely. Because, absolutely, hit, exactly, come back for people.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.400]  Let's hit that story about the kids and then explain how it's a real journalist who did
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.020]  fast and furious, you name it, who left CBS because she was being censored, and now she's
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.880]  exposing this evil. We're the real journalists, ladies like that are the real journalists,
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:51.040]  and we'll end up with the audiences and do the right thing and destroy the globalist
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.800]  just by virtue of truth telling. And that's why they want to censor the web and want to
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.600]  get rid of whistleblower protection because they're scared of the press. They tried to
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.600]  buy off the press. That just discredited the press. Now that the new press has risen with
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.520]  drudge and info wars and rolled net daily and so many others, they now are going to
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.800]  try to shut us down free speech wise. That's why we're going to race listeners to explode
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.240]  in size, to get up on our feet fully and to really give the globalists a run for their
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.360]  money and to stop their censorship. That's why people shouldn't take for granted the
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.520]  fact that we're on air and that we'll be here next week. Only spreading the word and supporting
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.120]  us will do it. So we need that call to arms. David Knight, great job at Bilderberg 2014,

[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.040]  their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a

[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.320]  to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs

[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.800]  and later on in the show we're going to have Richie Allen from the UK give us a British
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.640]  perspective on Bilderberg. He's been watching it very closely as we have. Paul and I were
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.440]  both there in Copenhagen and this year was a bit different in several different ways.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.960]  I guess no two years or alike we learned some things. We're going to be talking about that
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.040]  in the third hour with Richie Allen. We were just talking to Alex about this breaking report
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:33.520]  from Cheryl Atkinson. Now she is a journalist who left CBS and now she's working in an independent
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.800]  mode because she was tired of having her stories controlled. She said that she resigned because
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.360]  she feels like the mainstream media is heading down a dangerous path with attempts to censor
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:49.240]  or block stories that don't align with their preferred agenda. Those are her words. Those
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.800]  are our words as well. That's why we were at Bilderberg. For the longest time that place
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.960]  didn't even exist because the mainstream media heads blocked any information about that and
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:05.760]  then ridiculed anybody who reported on it. Now they're still at the ridicule point. They
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.920]  can no longer credibly say that it doesn't exist because there are too many people out
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.920]  there reporting that it in fact does. Perhaps if people realize that they were lied to the
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.280]  existence about Bilderberg at the same time that heads of major media organizations like
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.920]  the New York Times, like the Washington Post, like the Wall Street Journal were in attendance
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.240]  inside Bilderberg and they were telling people that it didn't exist. Perhaps at that point
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:38.400]  people will start to say, hmm, why is it that 150 of the most powerful people politically,
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.800]  security spies, bankers, multinational corporations, why are they meeting here and they're telling
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.560]  us that they're not meeting here and they've got tremendous amounts of security. Maybe
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.240]  then they'll start to wake up and start to look at what is being done there. And we have
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.320]  a lot of quotes from the people over the years as to what they have produced there.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.840]  But getting back to journalism, I think this week it's a real highlight of what the difference
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:09.960]  is between the fake media and the real media. Now this week marks the 25th anniversary of
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.840]  the crackdown at Tiananmen Square. That'll be tomorrow. That'll be when the government
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.160]  said we've had enough and they finally moved against them. And as I was abroad, there were
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.200]  a lot of articles about what's going on in China and there was a quote from an Army general.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.360]  He said, he went to these meetings and he absolutely refused to use his division against
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.320]  the protesters. He said, I don't want to be on that side of history. I don't want to be
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.640]  remembered as a murderer. Well, they don't remember these people as murderers in China.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.680]  Most of the people there don't know anything about it because for 25 years there's been
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.120]  no news about what happened at Tiananmen Square inside of China. They have taken it out of
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.240]  the textbooks. They've taken it out of the news stories. That's what we don't want to
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.560]  see happen here. So, Cheryl Atkinson's story, not only what happened with the government-backed
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.840]  study and this again, I want to repeat this, this is 1,300 premature babies. People who
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.640]  will do these kind of experiments to babies who are struggling to breathe, babies with
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.960]  tubes all over them to keep them alive. And what did they do? What was the response of
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:26.000]  our government to play games with them, to play God with them, to adjust the level of
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.960]  oxygen? And again, as I mentioned, too much oxygen, the babies go blind. Too little oxygen,
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.520]  they get brain damage or death. And that is what happened. A government that can do this
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.080]  is morally capable of doing anything. And we've seen this over and over again in the
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:45.520]  story that we broke a couple of years ago at Infowars about the medical experimentation
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.240]  at the University of North Carolina where the EPA was trying to make a case for greater
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.080]  regulations. And in order to do that, they were perfectly willing to make people sick
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.640]  or kill them. Lisa Jackson had just testified before Congress that she thought there were
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.880]  more people that were dying of particulate matter than people who were dying of cancer.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.520]  And that was an obvious lie. And Markey, the congressman who worked with that, they had
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.640]  already rehearsed before what they were going to do. And he's coaching her. You can tell
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:22.480]  because he even steps on her lines at one point. It was really an obvious nonsense.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.040]  But people didn't die there, but they were trying to get people who would be sick. They
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:32.160]  were searching for people who already had respiratory illnesses, who already had heart
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.360]  illness. And what they did then was expose them to levels that the EPA already said were
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.000]  fatal. They exposed them to levels that were 70 to 100 times what the EPA was maintaining
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.760]  were already fatal levels. Why? So that they could grow their bureaucracy, so that they
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.240]  could grow the regulation, so that they could shut down coal plants. Now, what is the agenda
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.520]  with the National Institute of Health that would cause them to go in and deprive premature
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.480]  infants of oxygen? Is this just out of intellectual curiosity? Because we already know what that
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.680]  does. They're trying to find a sweet spot. When I got my scuba diving certificate, I
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:14.880]  was told that was the way they had developed the Benz tables for divers was through trial
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.880]  and error. Now, presumably that was done with the consent of the Navy divers, but they do
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.560]  a lot of experiments on military personnel that they never get informed consent from.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.800]  And that's the key. They were not willing to pull that back. They were not willing to
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.760]  put a restraining order on these experiments as they were going on at the University of
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.520]  North Carolina. And they wonder, is there anything that's going to be done to keep our
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.940]  government from doing something like this again? And I think the most cynical thing
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:48.240]  about this entire study is that this first couple that Cheryl Atkinson reports on, they
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.840]  thought they were a support group from the government that was going to help them go
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:59.400]  through the process. Support was the acronym that they used, just like the Patriot Act.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.560]  Support, actually, they were not a support group. Support actually stood for surfactant
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:13.040]  positive airway pressure and pulse oximetry randomized trial. They put this in a constrained
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:20.300]  acronym just so they could come to these people and say we're a support group and not be flat
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.800]  out lying to them with their fingers crossed behind their back. And yet, it was a lie.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.760]  You cannot ethically, you cannot ever get conformed consent for human experimentation
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.760]  that is life threatening, that presents this kind of damage, even if they had gotten the
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.800]  parents consent, they would not have ethically been able to do that. But of course, they're
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.080]  already trying to get parents consent for abortions. And as we covered yesterday, as
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.080]  Jacarie Jackson covered on the nightly news yesterday, and Chris just brought this article
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.960]  in to me, we had this up on Infowars. If you, this is a letter, a pastoral letter that
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.520]  Planned Parenthood was sending out, giving to people who are considering an abortion.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.160]  And they said, if you'd like to speak with a clergy person, your local Planned Parenthood
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.840]  Health Center can refer you to someone who will be supportive of you and your decision,
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.000]  your privacy will be protected. All conversations will be completely confidential. So there
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.920]  you go. I guess if you can, with a parental consent, murder a child, then I guess our
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.360]  government can do that to 1,300 children.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.040]  As I pointed out earlier, this is, I think, a week that we need to think about press freedom.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.540]  We need to think about what real journalism is. You know, earlier at Alex was talking
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:41.480]  about the revelations that Steve Pachinic had about being prosecuted, being pursued
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.680]  by the State Department, by Obama's State Department. We need to remember that under
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:53.160]  the Espionage Act of 1917, there have only been 11 cases since 1917. That means that
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:16:00.240]  in 92 years, there were four prosecutions. Then in Obama's five years, there have been
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.880]  seven prosecutions. Do you understand that? Do you see how that's stepped up? And of course,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:11.000]  one of those people that's being prosecuted is James Ryzen, a New York Times reporter,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.560]  a Pulitzer Prize winner. And he was just rejected from having his case heard before
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.280]  the U.S. Supreme Court because he did not want to give up his journalistic source. Now,
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:28.480]  this is a case where this is part of his book, his 2006 book, State of War, the Secret History
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.400]  of the CIA and the Bush Administration. And in that story, there was a CIA agent, Sterling,
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:43.600]  who told Ryzen about a mismanaged CIA scheme to supply Iran with inaccurate nuclear weapon
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.000]  blueprints. The misinformation ploy fell apart. He said, after the Russian scientists
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.840]  who delivered the plans, noticed that it had design flaws and he tipped off the Iranians.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.880]  So this is something that was in his book. They want to know who the CIA agent was. It
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.800]  did this. He's protecting his source on principle. He says he's ready to go to jail and he may
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:09.640]  very well go to jail because Obama has been aggressively going after journalists while
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.960]  he's releasing Taliban people. But before I get on to that, I want to talk about the
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:24.400]  fact that we had this teenager, Andrew Demeter, who confronted Nancy Pelosi. Now, Andrew Demeter
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.520]  was one of the Paul Revere contestants. He entered several fine documentaries. That was
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.600]  a year ago. We've interviewed him in the past. Leigh Ann McAdoo has interviewed him
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.520]  and you can see that interview in the article that we linked to. But I think it's pretty
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.640]  amazing that he confronts Nancy Pelosi and, again, asks her the obvious questions. He
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:49.520]  says, isn't the NSA program where it's doing dragnet spying of the entire population? Isn't
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:55.080]  that a violation of the Fourth Amendment? It really took her off balance. Do we have
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.080]  a clip of that that we can play, guys? Why do you support the NSA's illegal and ubiquitous
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:07.880]  data collection? Well, I had questions about them. I had a data collection that they were
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:16.040]  collecting unless they had a reason to do so. So I found I was wondering. I didn't support
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:22.120]  a march that resolution. I didn't think that was the appropriate resolution. But I do think
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.760]  that the burden is on the department and I have fought them for years on the community.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.720]  She's just rambling. She's not prepared for this. It's pretty amazing. You need to watch
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.120]  this whole video complete with subtitles. Excellent job, Andrew Demeter. That's real
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.880]  journalism. I liked this quote. But before we go to, I want to ask Paul Joseph Watson
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.400]  about this. He posted the article today and we got Paul joining us from the UK. Hey, Paul,
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.720]  how you doing? Hi, David. Did you get some sleep? A little bit. Not much. Kind of about
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:56.200]  the sleep setting up in an airplane is basically how about you? Well, I got back a lot earlier
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.840]  than you, so I'm lucky. Yeah. Yeah, this is pretty amazing. And as you pointed out in
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.800]  the article here, and this is the thing that I thought was most telling is that he had
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.960]  to fight with C-SPAN in order to get their video footage. And the reason that they gave
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:17.440]  for it, they said, we wouldn't want to damage C-SPAN's relationship with leader Pelosi and
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.240]  her office. So I want to get your comments on that as we come back. That's what it's
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.520]  all about, isn't it, Paul? It's about maintaining their access because here's C-SPAN. You know,
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.320]  they're not like CBS, but they are like CBS because they want, even though they're publicly
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.280]  funded, they want access to those people. We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:43.480]  Watson from the UK. Stay with us.

[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.200]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information. I want to tell you about Matt
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.200]  Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my patriot supply. Several years ago, Matt
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.640]  was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.720]  was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck, deciding to
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:05.440]  take action. A company run by patriots for patriots was born. My patriot supply has never
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.280]  taken a loan or accepted outside funding. They now operate two distribution facilities
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:15.160]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women. It is rare to find companies

[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and I'm joined with Paul Joseph Watson
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:06.160]  from the UK, and I just wanted to get Paul's take on this article that he put up about
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:11.960]  Andrew Demeter, a teenager, confronting Nancy Pelosi about NSA spying. Watson, that was
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.960]  a great article. This guy is really good. We had several entries from him, as I mentioned
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.320]  before, in the Paul Revere contest. I really like what he had to say, and it's just a
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.840]  simple question that he asked her, isn't it?
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.400]  Well, I mean, what we need to remember about Andrew Demeter is the fact that he's only
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:35.080]  16 years old. He's got to be one of the most eloquent 16-year-olds I've ever heard. So
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:41.560]  he's a credit to his generation, and he's an inspiration to others. But the key about
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:46.200]  the article and the key about this confrontation with Pelosi, let's remember, of course, that
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:51.240]  initially he was supposed to meet Harry Reid. This occurred back in April when Harry Reid
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:58.920]  called supporters of Tive and Bundy domestic terrorists. So he was planning to hand a constitution,
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.160]  a copy of the constitution, to Harry Reid. So he had to go through this metal detector
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.000]  there in the capital. They asked him what he had. He said he had a constitution of Harry
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.460]  Reid. That got cancelled. So Pelosi was the poor substitute. And so he had this opportunity
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:19.200]  to confront her about the NSA. But he was only able to whip out his phone after he had
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.600]  already asked the question and begin filming her. That's why he needed the C-span B-roll
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:30.400]  footage, which they were filming from further back to get the whole confrontation. So as
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.320]  he said, he went back and forth with C-span on an email tug of war just to try and get
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:41.400]  this footage. And as he mentioned before the break, they pressed Demeter as to why it mattered
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.640]  that he got the footage. And it turned out that the quote they told him was, we wouldn't
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:52.880]  want to damage C-span's relationship with Leader Pelosi and her office. So that's why
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.440]  they were restrained on giving Demeter the footage in the first place because they didn't
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:04.400]  want to damage their relations with Pelosi. So again, it drills down to this point whereby
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:12.480]  a 16-year-old with a cell phone camera is more hard hitting, more of a muckraking journalist
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:20.080]  than a global brand like C-span backed by billions and billions of dollars of funding.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.760]  And they're representative of the mainstream media. They don't ask hard questions. They're
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:29.480]  getting embarrassed. They're getting put to shame by a 16-year-old with a cell phone
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480]  camera.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.120]  Absolutely. I remember when they were working on Obamacare and somebody yelled to Nancy
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.880]  Pelosi, what's the constitutional basis for that? And she just laughed it off and said,
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.280]  are you serious? Are you serious? And walked off that. That was very telling. But I just
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  loved the way she stammered and stuttered about this. I mean, she clearly wasn't expecting
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.760]  anything like this from some high school students. And he was very self-deprecating. He said,
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:58.560]  if I, a shy, socially inept high school student, I'm reading from your article here, can expose
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.040]  on a global scale the paradox that his politics by asking nothing more than a question, then
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:10.800]  so can you. That's exactly it. I mean, he embodies what we were trying to do with the
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.520]  Paul Revere contest. And that was to get people to realize that they could go out and produce
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:22.000]  their, their own news. They could do their own stories or own films. They could get these
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.120]  people because, and isn't this the case, Paul, that what this really kind of shows us is
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:36.080]  that the real danger of, one of the real dangers of violating everybody's privacy is the self-censorship
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.640]  that comes after that. Now, in the case of the news media, we see this as censoring themselves
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.640]  about what they want to say because they want access. But for us as individuals, once we
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.960]  get intimidated by the fact that the NSA is watching everything that we're doing and
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.120]  listening to everything that we're doing, it really does have a big effect on our actions.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:02.360]  And I was told privately by one of the Danes that we met in Copenhagen that there were
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.760]  a lot of Danish people that were afraid, that were aware of what was going on at Bilderberg.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.280]  But they did not want to show up there. They did not want to get their pictures on camera
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.520]  because they were afraid that that would have real repercussions for them because the government
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:20.440]  is so intertwined with people's jobs in the, in the welfare state there in Copenhagen and
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440]  Denmark.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:28.800]  I think it gets to a point, David, where if you become as public as possible, then it
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.480]  goes beyond the intimidation. And in fact, you end up getting treated better because
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.520]  the establishment is so afraid of mistreating you that you might produce a story about it.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.880]  You might throw the shame back on them. But you actually, the more, the bolder you are,
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.320]  the better you end up being treated. Whether that applies to surveillance or not, I don't
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.840]  know. But exactly, it's an intimidation tactic. And when people say, well, what do you have
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.360]  to hide? You know, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to worry about. Well,
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.800]  then give me your email password, give me your bank account login access. They won't do it.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.600]  But if the government's asking for it, it's all well and good. So again, it's, it's that
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.160]  contradiction. But that's definitely a part of the NSA surveillance. It's about making
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.840]  us believe that we're all under constant watch when in fact, they can't watch what we're
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.120]  doing all the time. It's, it's keywords, it's databases. And that, that prevents people
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.280]  from expressing their freedoms just as we're going to be right. We're going to take a break,
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.720]  Paul. We're going to be right back. And what you said is absolutely true. We've seen that
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.000]  in the case of John Corbett. We'll talk about that as he went with the TSA. What they did
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.160]  was they backed off and said, all right, you got to pass for life. We're not going to
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.760]  invest with the animal. We're right back. The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.520]  GCN radio network,
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:47.840]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties. This year
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.080]  alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated. What
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:56.320]  are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water? It's forced medical
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.280]  treatment without the consent of residents. My friend's water filtration is one of the
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.400]  most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.760]  and heavy metals in your tap water. On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:13.480]  at least once a week. You filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:19.160]  worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:24.160]  hexafluorosilicate. All right, it is in teams and coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.720]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it. It's
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:34.440]  time to take action. It's time to filter our water. Visit infowarsthor.com and use promo

[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:54.480]  replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world. Guess
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.160]  what else is in a halogen family? Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:04.800]  1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:11.040]  iodine. It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:17.280]  documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:23.520]  Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:28.400]  was the answer for myself and my family. You will find survival shield nascent iodine

[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:52.240]  is becoming more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air outside that's
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.120]  toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.960]  than even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.920]  chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.440]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.680]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.560]  to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.760]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back

[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.960]  David Knight and I'm joined with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK. Now we were just together
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.720]  in Copenhagen for the Bilderberg meeting this year and we're going to be joined in the third
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.640]  hour by with Richie Allen and we're going to be talking about his take. He's also
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:33.600]  British we're going to be talking about his take on Bilderberg and how it was different
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:38.200]  this year. We're going to share some of our some of the things that we saw there together.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.520]  But before we get to that we've been talking about journalism and free press and there's
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.480]  a lot of things happening this week you know later this week tomorrow is the 25th anniversary
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.960]  of the Chinese government cracking down at Tiananmen Square pushing back against the
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.800]  people who are demonstrating there the students who are demonstrating for their freedom. The
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.920]  day after that is the one year anniversary of the Snowden leaks and so there are some
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:09.400]  groups on the internet that are going to be holding a rally to try to get people to be
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.280]  aware that they need to do things to protect their own privacy. And as we were talking
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.040]  about this it's not just the Tiananmen Square students we had Andrew Demeter someone who
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:26.440]  has is no stranger to those who watch the Paul Revere contest or follows info wars a 16 year
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:33.400]  old and he was in a position where he was able to directly ask Nancy Pelosi a question
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.240]  and he got to ask her what about the Fourth Amendment and the NSA and she just started
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:44.040]  fumbling all over herself. Paul when we were brought you know looking at the different
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.960]  ways that police interact with people and then going through all the hassles that we
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:52.360]  went through to come back into this country I saw this article today about more US citizens
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.680]  turning in their passports they said a thousand and one US citizens gave up their citizenship
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:02.680]  in just the first quarter of this year more than the total in 2012 and already about a
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:09.480]  third of 2013 is record breaking 3000. Now this article from the Washington examiners
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:16.280]  focusing on the financial aspects of it but I think it has to do with the entire perspective
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:21.920]  the loss of privacy and there's another article that's come out about how this new financial
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:29.400]  database that's in bureaucracy sorry that Dodd Frank created they are now going to start
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.920]  collecting virtually everything in the open from about 227 million Americans looking at
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.960]  every mortgage going back to I believe it was 1998 and every bit of supporting information
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.240]  about you and your household demographic and personal that's what I think a lot of reason
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.160]  a lot of people are leaving America because they're worried about not just the money that's
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:59.120]  being confiscated but the police state. Well the fact that more data is being kept than
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:05.280]  ever before is a given but the ultimate scandal of course with the NSA is going to turn out to be
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:13.200]  that not just metadata but distinct conversation specific details about people's bank accounts
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:21.440]  their online chats every single shred of communication you can imagine is being stored because as former
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:28.400]  NSA whistleblower William Binney said to store the metadata would only require relatively small
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:34.880]  physical storage space the kind of space that the NSA have now gotten at centers like Bluffdale and
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:41.680]  others is so vast that the only explanation possible is that they're storing every phone
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.360]  conversation we're talking audio transcripts we're talking emails we're talking online chats
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.640]  they're storing absolutely everything doesn't mean that they've got the personnel to analyze it
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:57.360]  or indeed the computer algorithms that are strong or quick enough to analyze it all
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:03.120]  but using keyword logging they can begin to do that that is the ultimate scandal and I think
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.360]  eventually the Snowden revelations will start to lean in that direction more and more confirmation
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:15.440]  that each shred of individual communication is being stored by the NSA not just things like
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.760]  metadata yeah and since we haven't done anything about it they're getting even more bold about
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.120]  this and of course we have a new bureaucracy that was created by Dodd Frank that's the and listen to
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.320]  this consumer financial protection bureau that's the same kind of cynical acronym as we're talking
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.720]  about before about the Patriot Act and these people who said that they were going to the support
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:44.160]  acronym that they came up with so they could go in and tell these poor parents that they were
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:50.080]  essentially a support group actually they're going to be depriving their premature babies of
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.840]  oxygen or giving them too much oxygen which creates vision issues we see these kinds of
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.320]  cynical efforts over and over again and I want to we need to play a report here I want to give
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:05.920]  people some information about health issues because as we see over and over again there's
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.600]  there's things that we can't do on a public basis but we can do on a one-to-one basis you know when
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.800]  I was in Copenhagen there was another guy that I talked to and he said he's trying to wake people
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.160]  there up but he said they don't believe me he said I tell them that in America they put fluoride
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.920]  in the water and they think I'm a crazy conspiracist they don't believe that that would happen that
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.000]  anybody would do that because they've never fluoridated the water in Denmark but they do that
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.800]  here and even though we can politically get active and we can try to change things individually
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.840]  we still need to ultimately take responsibility for our own health and for that of our family
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.920]  and so I want to give you this report here that we got in right after it I want to talk with you
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.160]  Paul about what's going to actually be collected upfront on people besides social security number
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.160]  there's a wealth of information that's then going to be track tracking everything about Americans
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.880]  besides just their conversations that the NSA is doing they're going to create a complete financial
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.040]  profile of you and your family what will they use that for we'll talk about that right after this
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:11.440]  report in january of this year I sent jacari jackson and other info wars dot com reporters
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:18.000]  to the west coast of the united states to investigate the reports of massive radiation spikes
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.520]  10 times in some cases what the background radiation is supposed to be professional groups
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:27.760]  private organizations and citizens alike were going out with their field meters and geiger
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:34.480]  counters and picking up huge spikes in san francisco los angeles but as far north as
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:40.320]  seattle jacari and our reporters not only confirmed increased radiation they found it
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.360]  all over the western coastline why is this not a national news story why is this not a
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:51.040]  international news story that these power plants are registry lower radio radiation than what is
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:57.040]  being found in half moon bay we had witnessed a coordinated cover-up by tokyo electric and the
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:03.840]  japanese government of the cancers and deaths and thyroid ailments plugging japan in the first three
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  years after the disaster so the question was is there a cover-up going on in the united states
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.480]  and north america as a whole turns out the epa within just a few months of the fukushima
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:22.400]  disaster with the trade winds and currents coming right into the united states had indeed
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:29.440]  raised the levels of what they claimed was safe for the population in some cases more than a
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:36.800]  thousand times what they had previously claimed was safe so we continued to investigate and
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.000]  noticed that just a few months after fukushima tuna had been caught off the coast of the united
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.040]  states with higher levels of radiation buried in reports that got little or no attention we began
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:54.480]  to discover massive deformities and whales and other sea life seal die-offs starfish die-offs
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.840]  massive fish die-offs and when our reporters went and tested the fish that were being caught
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:06.560]  off the coast of california the radiation levels spiked dramatically there's a reason i sent my
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.920]  reporters to the west coast it's to draw attention to the fact that the nuclear industries in the
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:18.000]  united states and worldwide are out of control more than 75 percent of reactors in north america
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.240]  are currently leaking in the past every one of these leaks would have been a huge issue now
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:29.040]  it's as if radiation is good for us in fact and culture and others have come out and said that
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.160]  we should be thankful for the radiation the japanese should be thankful because after all
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.000]  it's good for them radiation in excess of what the government says is are the minimum amount
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  amounts you should be exposed to were actually good for you in reduced cases of cancer tell that
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.280]  to all the valiant rescue workers who tried to secure the damaged plant who've now succumbed
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:58.640]  from radiation sickness and died and tell that to the sailors and crew of the uss ronald reagan
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:05.360]  many of which are dead and dying now from radiation poisoning and the va will not give them any care
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:11.120]  and basically puts them on a death panel list to wait and die our sources tell us many were placed
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.680]  on a secret list designed by va managers to hide the fact veterans were waiting months to see a
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.800]  doctor bottom line it is important that we draw attention to the fact that this industry is out
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.080]  of control and we also draw attention to the fact that the federal government itself is ordering
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:33.600]  millions and millions of dosages of potassium iodide for federal workers while telling the general
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.320]  population that oh you don't need to have that unless you live right next door to a nuclear power
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:45.040]  plant they're acting like they're preparing for some sort of nuclear emergency right now because
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:50.400]  we now know that the department of health and human services for example they just ordered
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:58.080]  an unprecedented 14 million doses of potassium iodide which you know protects the body in the
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:04.400]  event of radioactive poisoning so the federal government they are already acting as if there's
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:12.240]  been a severe nuclear accident does that concern you as as much as it does me oh yes it concerns me
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.840]  not only as a journalist but as a just general citizen the truth is radiation is an invisible
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:23.760]  poison that's all around us and the levels of it are going up it was in my research to find ways
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:30.240]  to try to shield my family or mitigate the dangers of increased radiation that i discovered that iodine
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:34.800]  was a key component and that the government was hoarding it but the type of iodine they're hoarding
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.440]  is something you only take during a huge disaster not something that you take on a daily basis
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.040]  that from the research helps your glands and body overall to be healthier that's why we develop
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:52.400]  with dr edward group survival shield a proprietary new form of nascent iodine survival shield has been
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.280]  incredibly popular because of the results people have gotten but also because it's more palatable
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.400]  and easier for children to take it's not as harsh as some of the other iodines that are out there
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:07.840]  we innovated with survival shield nascent iodine and it's still available and is excellent but we
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:14.880]  are now very excited to introduce x2 there is no other iodine anywhere near this the other
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:21.760]  so-called nascent iodines are black and turn black on paper the survival shield nascent iodine turns
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:28.320]  electric blue purple because it's from the pure crystal you can literally see these ancient crystals
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:35.520]  seething with the iodine if you think survival shield was powerful x2 is the next level take the
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.640]  info wars challenge regardless you're getting high quality iodine that on record the government
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:46.880]  admits everyone needs it's essential and you're supporting the very tip of the spear in revolutionary
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:57.440]  pro-liberty media x2 from info wars life dot com or call toll free 888 253 3139 there's no other iodine
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:12.000]  like it on earth over and over again i hear people say they would never do anything to willingly
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.080]  harm people and yet the very same people that dare mcbrain was talking about in that report
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.200]  they're the health and human services they were the ones who involved in this experiment on premature
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:29.600]  infants they would do that to them if they would give veterans depleted uranium you know now is it
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.320]  any surprise to people what we see happening at the va when we see that they have exposed their
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:40.240]  troops knowingly to depleted uranium after they had at first banned it because the health consequences
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.200]  the same as they did with fluoride they're not really concerned about the health consequences
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.760]  that's why we've got to take it on our own isn't that correct paul yeah that's right i mean the
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.600]  ultimate tool of self-empowerment is getting control of your health anyone can do it it doesn't take
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:03.680]  some mass organized action to do that so i mean that that is one area where you can achieve complete
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.640]  success on your own if you're knowledgeable knowledgeable about the issues so i mean once
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:13.680]  once you get your health back on track then your mind starts to function better you can think clearer
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:19.520]  you can you can create content easier you can write better so that is the source of everything if
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.840]  you've got a solid basis then you can move forward on to other areas with more gusto and more success
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.680]  and it's really really is an info war just as we're trying to get people educated about the
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.960]  health effects get them to understand that the government is capable of doing things to people
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:40.160]  as we've seen over and over again with the experiments at north carolina university
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.520]  university north carolina with the experiments at university of alabama deliberately doing
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.600]  things that are going to harm people's health not getting informed consent doing things that
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.480]  they would not be ethically or legally allowed to do even if they had informed consent and
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:59.120]  as we see tomorrow is going to be the 25th anniversary of tenement square what are they
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.120]  trying to do they're trying to block information about it we have an article here google is
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.320]  reportedly banned in china ahead of the tenement square anniversary they said they reportedly
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.440]  blocked all google services just for days before the 25th anniversary of the military
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:19.120]  clampdown on student protests centered around Beijing's tenement square they reported blockage
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.720]  which has not been confirmed by the chinese government you think they'll confirm that paul
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.120]  is believed to be a deliberate act of censorship leading up to the university tomorrow on june
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:34.320]  4th they even grabbed a a fellow guo jing as he was taken away from his home in suburban
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:38.560]  beijing he's one of the former protesters that were there he's going to be locked away
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:46.080]  he's now in jail he's going to be locked away until june 15th and then of course later this
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.400]  week the next day is going to be the one-year anniversary of ed snowden's leaks and the feds
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:58.720]  are now cooperating with wikipedia editors to improve wikipedia entries related to government
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.840]  publications paul this sounds very much like what we were seeing happening at bill deberg and we
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:11.120]  talk about how the major media the mainstream media the old media has been complicit in covering up
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:16.080]  information that would be embarrassing to the government now we see that happening here at
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.480]  wikipedia they have the office of the federal register ofr part of the national archives is
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:28.000]  hosting an edathon to focus on improving wikipedia entries related to government publications and
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.680]  the interesting thing paul is that what they single out here in the quote they said specific
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.840]  accomplishments from the event include a new article for cfr sections a new model for future
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:46.240]  articles about the cfr and of course the council on foreign relations has been a large part of
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.440]  the global government a large part of the american government pretty much every president since it was
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:58.240]  created uh up until 2000 every president every presidential candidate except for goldwater
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.480]  and reagan were cfr members and then when reagan got appointed he put in over 300 cfr members into
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.880]  the foreign service into the government bureaucracy there so they're going to work the government's
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.160]  going to work with wikipedia to make sure that they have the accurate information out there in
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.320]  other words information the government wants out there about the cfr and about other government
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:25.040]  agencies so now we see that kind of metastasizing even into the internet going back to the china
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:30.160]  thing to begin with there is another aspect to it which you've got to take into into consideration
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:35.120]  which is the fact that we've seen these attacks of the past few months that are getting more and
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:42.880]  more violent by the Uighurs this is a separatist group in the northwest of china linked to other
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:48.160]  terrorist organizations like the east turkistan islamic movement which came out of afghanistan
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:53.920]  and in the 80s and was cia backed and there's a lot of evidence to suggest that these Uighur attacks
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.480]  are also being cia backed because they want to make china unstable they want to try and create a
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.640]  ukraine style situation which of course would be ukraine on a much bigger scale and eventually
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:12.880]  topple the chinese government with a fake chinese spring so you have to look at who's behind these
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.000]  groups that are behind these increasingly violent attacks in china to know that it's part of the
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:25.200]  agenda regarding obama's pivot to asia it's about destabilizing the chinese government because it's
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.400]  now with this new gas deal joining together with russia and posing a threat to the unipole world
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:37.200]  that the west stands for so we need they're shifting alliances and we're going to talk about

[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:55.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night with paul joseph watson in the uk we were
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:00.240]  talking just before the break about what's going on in china as paul was pointing out there's
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:05.680]  shifting alliances that are happening we've got china and russia working together as well as
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:11.280]  now bill deberg perhaps one of the biggest things that we're talking about there were the transatlantic
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:16.800]  and trans-pacific partnerships these kind of trade agreements that mirror what rockefell and others
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:22.400]  have been trying to create in the trilateral commission for several decades but paul there
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.960]  was an article that was up on prison planet dot com about china sending four more fighter jets to
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.320]  olrig area as vietnam threatens legal action i thought that was pretty amazing so there's not
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:39.520]  just the the tension between the united states in japan the united's i'm sorry between china and the
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:45.760]  united states versus in japan together but also now even china with vietnam and of course the
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.360]  vietnam war was very much a part of my life earlier and to see that vietnam is no domino and really
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:55:02.240]  never was was it well exactly and you know there was also a china vietnam war as well which killed
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.680]  tens and tens of thousands of people yes but this this began on may second when china basically
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:14.080]  just dumped a huge state owned oil rig inside vietnamese territory inside their exclusive
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:21.280]  economic zone so it and it was accompanied by pl a warships at the time so vietnam could do very
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.800]  little to propel to repel it without starting some kind of conflict a couple of weeks ago we had
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:34.640]  reports of pl a troops being sent to the vietnamese border to deal with some kind of conflict so
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:40.560]  people down there are very very concerned people are evacuating in droves now today we've had this
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.920]  new report so again it's it's another flashpoint it shows us that we need to be wary of all these
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.440]  different flashpoints around the world and with obama's pivot to asia they're increasingly going
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:56.800]  to be in that region of the of the world you know i see as we come to the university at tenement
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.680]  tenement square i see that cnn is patting itself on the back for covering it and i'm glad that they
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.600]  cover it and there's kind of a sense of american superiority that we're not censoring the news like
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:12.400]  china is censoring the news of tenement square and yet we really do when i look at the story about
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:18.560]  china and vietnam it reminds me of the documentary the fog of war that's a 2004 film from documentary
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:23.840]  filmmaker aero morris where he interviewed robert macnamara and macnamara said in the it was an
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.160]  extended interview that he turned into a feature length documentary and robert macnamara said in
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.080]  that that he had since gone back to vietnam and when he was talking to the vietnamese general
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:38.560]  about it the vietnamese general one point got up and angly slammed the table and said why did you
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.720]  do this you say that you did this to stop the domino theory we've been fighting china for thousands
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:50.160]  of years for independence don't you know anything about history and yet with the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.760]  and with the complicit media they were able to keep that secret from the american public keep that
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.520]  out of the textbooks in america just like china has been able to keep tenement square out of the news
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:08.560]  out of the textbooks oh no i mean you go to china and nobody knows what tenement square was it's only
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:13.280]  people who've moved out of the country and then gone back again that's the only way that awareness
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.920]  of it is spread because it was a complete lockdown on information obviously but with that i i always
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:23.440]  hark boat hark back to the david rocker fella quote whatever the price of the chinese revolution
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:28.480]  it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:33.200]  but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose the social experiment in china under
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.480]  chairman mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history this
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:45.760]  is a an administration that killed upwards of 30 million people and of course the the tianaman
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.520]  square protesters were anti-communist so that goes to the heart of how the global elite view these
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:56.800]  these different genocides around the world david rocker fella and people say that's a fake quote
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:02.640]  i found the original new york times article from 1973 it's documented it's a real quote a lot of
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:08.320]  these quotes david some you know you do find them to be false but that's a that's a genuine david rocker
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:15.200]  fella quote about a regime that killed upwards of 30 million people he said it was a success and if
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:20.880]  you like mao's social engineering and massive starvation you're going to love what the bill

[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:31.520]  wealthy and powerful multi-national corporation ceo's as well as politicians and spy masters
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:36.720]  going in and uh we were photographing them as they were going in pretty much had unprecedented
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.880]  access in terms of visually seeing these people and we're going to talk a little bit about that
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.840]  the next segment but i was struck with this article that was at info wars dot com for the
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:52.240]  first time ever more than half the members of congress are millionaires now we talk about
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.760]  insider trading we got those pictures of ed ball's the uk shadow chancellor the exchequer
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:03.200]  going in with a suitcase full of papers he's trying to go through these these his suitcase
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:09.840]  trying to find his uh past to get into bill de berg and uh we filmed that and karen got that and
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:15.600]  and it was really a comical video but on one level but the other level it showed just how
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.320]  much information was being brought into the conference he wasn't taking that out that wasn't
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.320]  a handout so they gave him at bill de berg he was taking that in and so one of the aspects
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:29.520]  is very troubling about this or these closed door meetings like this is uh perhaps insider trading
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:37.200]  well we know from the 2006 leak out of canada that they had positioned themselves financially
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.400]  for the economic collapse estuary and got that information out he also predicted from
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.560]  what bill de berg was saying that the housing bubble was going to pop that they were going to
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.920]  get all the suckers to invest their money and that it was to pop in 2007 which is exactly what
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:59.120]  happened so we know that they positioned themselves before financial collapse so to think that insider
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.600]  trading is a part of that is a given because we know they were positioning themselves before it
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.040]  happened in 2008 to prevent them from getting the harm while everybody else lost their jobs
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:13.360]  in their homes absolutely yeah they make a big example out of martha steward and yet when it
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.760]  broke that members of congress were doing insider trading they passed a little bit of superficial
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:22.640]  legislation and then essentially repealed the guts of it before it ever took it took place
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.800]  we've got a special caller on the line before we get to richie allen we've got alex jones
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:32.480]  wanted to pop in with a comment alex i tried gentlemen i am i driving along with you guys
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:38.640]  the free iphone app and i just wanted to back up and watch it said look pay out of hands and i
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.760]  think we're going to close the reel and i'm going to look them up and send my crew over and over again
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:51.680]  to the youtube library and about it wasn't at the time they're real close we went personal

[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:17.680]  killed sixty six billion the chinese government says that now they have only a dollar in their

[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:08.480]  obama said he said it would go up but we got up a damn cliff so it's just this out of hand denial

[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:10.960]  paul joseph watson we were in covenhagen looking for henry kissinger the doctor of our dreams
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:15.920]  actually we're trying to discover as they said in the song his machiavellian schemes
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:21.440]  and also joining us from the uk is richie alan now he's someone who is uh head of news of the
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:26.720]  people's voice it's an internet television channel that was the brainchild of david ike
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:32.960]  he's active in ireland the uk and spain and he's been following the bill de berg situation and i'd
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:38.320]  like to get his take on it along with paul we want to talk to him about his perception of this year's
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:44.080]  bill de berg richie are you there david i am how are you how are you paul nice to be with you
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.360]  good thank you for joining us now this year was a little bit different uh paul and i were there
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:56.640]  and uh we've people that have been there for several of these events like paul said this was
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:01.040]  very unprecedented to uh be this close to them that we could get the kind of photographs that we
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.640]  could in a sense we were kind of like a paparazzi politarazzi but we were there to document that
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.520]  this is really going on that these people are really there and try to get people to the public
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.960]  to understand that this is something that was covered up by the mainstream media for decades
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:23.600]  they denied that this even existed then they attack as conspiracy theorists as loonies anyone who
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:29.920]  talks about its existence so maybe there is something here what do you think well i think it
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.120]  it was notable for the fact of course it was the 60th anniversary it's the very first time
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:42.720]  um bill de berg meeting and i heard um paul mentioned in the last few days jim talker who's
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:47.440]  no longer with us jim is somebody who i spoke to on the radio um over the years and i always like
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:52.560]  to mention jim and um david ike and alex jones because i think those three have done more than
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:56.960]  anybody else over the years when nobody was paying attention to um bill de berg david's
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:02.480]  done more than anybody i think david um to bring into people's attention i'd like to i wasn't there
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:10.240]  um we we covered it on our on our show um on uh late last week sursy on friday um and i'm not one
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:15.120]  for you know i'm not a doomsayer not one for depressing people but i'd like to ask you guys
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:21.760]  because you were there um we got a sense from our own audience um that there's a little bit of
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:26.800]  bill de berg fatigue if you understand what i mean there was a huge obviously it was in watford in
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.920]  in uh england last year just outside london with massive attention on it in england more than it's
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:35.760]  ever gotten before i think there was even a question i might remember paul helped me out here if i get
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:40.080]  any of this wrong but i remember michael meacher former environment minister i believe he asked
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:46.240]  kenneth clark uh the the so-called minister without portfolio as he was then in parliament about it
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:50.960]  um you know again unprecedented that it would be spoken about in parliament we get the impression
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:57.200]  or i've gotten the impression from some of our viewers that that they think well you guys and i
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:00.800]  don't mean me but you guys guys like you have been covering it for years david like you've
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:06.080]  gotten it out there now but but what next what next you know we know these guys are meeting
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.000]  annually we know who's there now because again because of the brilliant investigative journalism
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.720]  of talker and ike and and alex jones but but what next i don't know if you got a sense of that when
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:21.920]  you were there did you did you get that sense at all go ahead paul now i'm not getting richie's audio
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.240]  so you're not getting his audio he was asking you if you if you got a sense that there was uh
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.960]  some bill de berg fatigue amongst the people who've been following this the uh the general public
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.640]  well there definitely is in denmark because in comparison to last year you know there were
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:41.600]  about a hundred people this year at the height of the protest but ike and jones who were obviously
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:47.440]  the draw last year weren't there but somebody told me that 30 percent of the danish population
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:52.960]  are on anti-depressant drugs so maybe that's an explanation but the general thought was that
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:59.440]  but people in that area people in scandinavia have been pacified by the eu they've been made dependent
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.480]  on government so they're less likely to protest against something like bill de berg and as you
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.480]  said earlier they're more nervous about being public in their dissent so there's there are some
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.840]  very good reasons there as to why the protest was less than it was last year of course last year
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:21.200]  was more of a festival it was probably better organized in terms of the goal of getting people
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:27.600]  into one place obviously location plays a big part as well i think canada is probably up for
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.560]  bill de berg next year if not the year after so you're going to see a probably five times more
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:37.280]  people at least simply because of the location so i think there are different explanations
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:43.440]  behind that but yes i was disappointed in the turnout in uh kopenhagen but you know paul i think
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:49.760]  that the large turnout last year because essentially last year you really didn't have very much
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:53.360]  access you really couldn't see anything they had everybody's so far away from where the bill de
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.400]  berg attendees were and yet people were getting together in that kind of fringe festival that
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.440]  they called it for uh for bill de berg where people who had been following it kind of got together
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.920]  themselves and talked about what they had learned talked about what was going on there this time i
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:12.880]  think that really had an effect on the way bill de berg interacted with people they came out with
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:18.000]  as you called it a bizarre charm offensive i think that was the interesting thing about this
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.480]  year's coverage how they tried to be i guess you would say a little bit more transparent although
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:27.920]  they really didn't have any transparency releasing a an agenda whether or not that was true or not
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:35.200]  and as we found out when we talked to uh samson the leader of the dutch labor party uh that's there
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.680]  when he came out and talked he kind of let slip that there were some things besides what was on
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.080]  the official agenda but it was really pretty bizarre that he came out and addressed the crowd
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:51.280]  wasn't it well he came out several times he came out once i think it was on the friday uh and he
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:57.280]  was outside the protest pen then the next day he came back to be inside the protest pen because we
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.320]  actually got him on the street as he was walking up to the protest pen and that kind of devolved
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:08.880]  into a a long drawn out debate about 9 11 and vaccines and all these different kind of issues
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:13.120]  when i just wanted to know what they were talking about inside the building right at that point
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:17.280]  and those are the only questions which he didn't really want to answer he was happy to get involved
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:23.520]  in these long global warming debates etc but we didn't drill him enough on what they were discussing
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:30.160]  this year inside the bilderberg hotel but in terms of press access it was far better than last year
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:36.080]  last year we were kept a mile away from the hotel we never even saw a bilderberger in the flesh if
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:41.200]  they weren't inside a vehicle this year they went on walk about numerous times we had several
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:46.240]  different press areas one immediately adjacent to the hotel so we could see them right on the patio
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:53.120]  and people don't appreciate i think how difficult that is and how rare that is i mean hannah borneau
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:58.960]  compared it to spotting wild animals and that's that's precisely uh they are kind of like wild
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:04.480]  animals aren't they exactly but it's it's so difficult to get them on camera in the flesh
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:10.160]  the fact that we had the press access to do that was a big victory yeah and the fact that we saw
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:17.280]  balls carrying in these volumes of paperwork i think that was very telling they go in that
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.800]  combined with the fact that they're walking about and jogging about freely without any bodyguards
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.760]  without even a companion attendee from bilderberg what do you make of that richie ellen the fact
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:33.520]  that these people who have erected they always spend millions of dollars to create these these
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:37.600]  walls and security and they've had an army of police there and yet they just walk out on their
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.920]  own and go jogging what do you make of that the only thing you can make of that david the only
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:46.640]  logical conclusion to that is is that they're somewhat trying to play down the importance of
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:54.320]  it um and by lessing the security on there and by doing what paul said there um you know and being
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:58.400]  a little bit more up close and personal people getting access to them seeing them i mean you said
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:03.440]  they couldn't be seen in what first i mean i know what i said last year so you can only conclude
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:07.840]  that yeah they're thinking well and we need to be a little bit more um less menacing a little bit
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:13.040]  more less threatening make um as little of this as we possibly can and i mean ultimately they wanted
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:16.960]  to believe that it's an annual fraternity isn't that right david that's what they wanted to believe
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.480]  ultimately um it's it's where we can meet and speak freely without worrying about the press
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:27.040]  misrepresenting us and all we're doing is sharing ideas because you know because we've all got these
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:32.800]  high powerful uh sorry all powerful high-pressure jobs uh so this is the kind of uh get to know you
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:38.160]  session once every year now we know that's a lot of bologna we know that um so i presume that somewhere
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.800]  in the steering committee must have got together and said you know what let's come at this a little
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.280]  bit differently this year i mean we've seen on one or two other alternative news sites i won't
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:54.960]  mention them but we've seen um one or two of the um um attendees being you know being grabbed and
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:59.280]  interviewed uh even if the interviews were very brief so that's staggered me there's no doubt about
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:04.480]  that because i've not been watching belterberg as often or as much as as you guys have an alex
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.640]  and we've come to this arena only in the last few years but but what i have seen in the last
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:15.120]  few years is exactly as you described high walls lots of um security menacing i mean we all remember
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:20.960]  years ago jim talker being trailed through the portuguese countryside by men in blacked out sedans
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:26.720]  and all that sort of stuff you know so yeah maybe there maybe there's a concerted effort to uh well
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.360]  let's play just down a bit yeah for years they pretended that it didn't exist they kept the
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:36.000]  press at bay they they tried that sort of thing but they couldn't get away with that anymore because
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.280]  i think to a large degree all of the attention that happened last year in the uk so even though
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.680]  we didn't have a lot of individuals turning up they came out with a very different approach this
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.720]  time as as paul pointed out it's really kind of a charm offensive trying to make themselves
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.400]  look transparent but i thought it was kind of interesting when samson came out and talked to
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:18:01.200]  us the uh dutch uh leader and he was talking about these focus groups how they constantly
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:06.720]  they went from one meeting to the other meeting it sounded very very much like the kind of delphi
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:12.000]  control techniques that the rand corporation has developed for pushing agenda 21 at local
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  community meetings and it looks like that's what they're doing to me it looks like you've got a
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.880]  core group of go globalists who are bringing in people kind of testing the water seeing if they
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:26.480]  can get them to buy into a consensus and then if they do they bring them on to additional meetings
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:31.760]  uh a trilateral commission meeting a council on foreign relation meeting creating these
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.840]  kinds of relationships that allow them to essentially pull people into a kind of a phony
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.840]  consensus would you say that's what you what's happening i certainly there's not some leader
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:47.200]  the world i'll tell you what i'm not i'm not kissing your backside but that's one of the smartest
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:52.080]  things i've heard suggested about builder work because we have to remember these politicians
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:57.920]  greedy and filthy and corrupt though they are ultimately they're human beings and some of
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.280]  the things that's on the agenda for us in the next 25 30 40 years are horrifying things that would
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:08.480]  shake any human being to their foundation irrespective of their their um you know their
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:13.360]  psychological state so it makes perfect sense to me that there's some sort of indoctrination
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.480]  going on there there's no doubt about that yeah bringing these people in um i wouldn't use the
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.920]  word brainwashing them but you have brow beating them with um with ideas and getting them to come
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:28.720]  around to ideas that that ordinarily if they were with their families they're watching their friends
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.800]  their husbands they wouldn't do hang on we got richie allen with us as well as paul joseph whatson
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:37.280]  from the uk we're talking about how bill de burg change this year we're going to be right back
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:43.280]  after the break stay with us it's all about building consensus and these people control
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:50.480]  a lot of assets they do last if all grocery stores cease to exist not in america this can't happen
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:55.840]  in america because i'm not concerned about our government i was looking at survival stuff i was

[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.720]  the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin and in the uk i'm joined by paul joseph
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:05.520]  watson and richie allen of the people's voice now a gentleman it was actually after bill de
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:09.920]  berg last year if i'm correct that the snowden documents were leaked we got the anniversary
[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:14.480]  the first year anniversary of that coming up in just two days although last year on their agenda
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:20.400]  as they said one of the things they were looking at was big data and they had david portrays i'd
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:26.800]  believe representatives from well we had palantir there alex carp last year also returned this year
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:33.680]  as did david portray us as did keith alexander the head of the nsa and one of the topics there
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:38.640]  that they put on their official agenda that they released was does privacy exist you guys find that
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:45.360]  ironic go ahead richie let's get your comments on that well yeah to say the least ironic yeah i mean
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:52.720]  timely nearly a year since or just about a year since the the snowden leaks and i was really
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:58.320]  interested last week not to jump off topic but just to kind of segue a little bit john kerry's
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:05.280]  comments on cnn the secretary of state of course saying that you know snow snowden
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:11.200]  snowden should come back you know to prove that he's a patriot if he really stands over what he
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:14.880]  did and if he really believes in what he did is being the right thing to do what he should come back
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:18.800]  in face to music and i was thinking watching that well that didn't go that didn't go very well for
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:25.120]  chelsea manning and i know that chelsea manning didn't go on the run um especially and and again
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.880]  you know we we love the internet and we love organizations like the people's voice like info
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:37.040]  wars and you know i'm you guys are going to have to help me out here because um us history is not
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:42.480]  my greatest subject but didn't john kerry won't sit in front of a congressional committee not long
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:48.400]  after he came back from vietnam um on the side of transparency on the side of openness and getting
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  information out to people i mean you could choke on the irony of it you know you could choke on the
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:58.320]  irony of it um so yeah there's no doubt they're talking about it and of course data and and the
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:04.160]  mining of data and privacy and all of that that of course segues into the trans specific partnership
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:09.040]  and um and all of that so yeah i'm i'm really interested in that and we're finding it's one
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:14.480]  of the topics that our viewers at tpv are really interested in yeah i want to talk about we don't
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:17.600]  have much time in this segment but i do want to talk about the trans specific partnership the
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:22.560]  transatlantic partnership how that reflects what they plan for a long time but but paul when we
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:28.080]  talk about them asking if privacy exists i i think when we look at that film of ed ball's coming in
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.600]  with massive amounts of data on paper on printed paper they understand because they're the ones
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.720]  that have created this environment that you don't have any electronic privacy i think to me i look
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:43.280]  at them and the fact that they were just roaming around freely in the area what they really were
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:47.360]  protecting was the anonymity and the discussions in their meetings they weren't protecting the
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:51.200]  attendees they were protecting the meetings the information that they were exchanging
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:57.360]  face-to-face on paper documents in a hotel that had been evacuated days in advance and screened for
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:03.200]  any kind of electronic listening devices what would you say well that's right they're protecting
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.680]  the information that's why none of them will talk about what they discussed you know they'll talk about
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:12.960]  their being intensive meetings non-stop and as you mentioned before the break it is kind of
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:18.320]  like a cult for the global elite you could compare it to the ted conference which about a year ago
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.680]  it came out from some members of that who were invited along that it is a kind of cult they're
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:30.080]  ordered which people to room with they're ordered on how to treat people when they meet them and
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:34.560]  it's it's very insidious and i think that a similar kind of thing takes place at bilderberg
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:39.840]  because we know they have these big presentations then they have the smaller sub-conference groups
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.360]  certain people are allowed into those conferences certain people on so it is a kind of access
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:50.880]  cult and we even have pictures of certain bilderberg members who seem to be ostracized from the rest
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.680]  of the group as they're out in the patio having cocktails so it's very much an elite within an
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:00.400]  elite most of the bilderberg members probably aren't even aware of the inner core and what they
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.120]  actually want they're just being groomed to potentially go up the ladder at a later date
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:09.680]  but with regard to privacy i mean look at eric schmitt i mean he's there every year what did
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.400]  he say quote if you have something that you don't want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be doing
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:19.040]  it in the first place yeah i think it's the guy i think eric schmitt could probably answer that
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:22.320]  question i think eric schmitt could probably answer that question for him pretty definitively
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:28.240]  don't you think uh paul well exactly that does privacy exist and these are the people who are
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.440]  talking about it they want to destroy privacy it's not it's not how to rescue it it's how to
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:38.000]  eviscerate it to an even greater degree that's what they're discussing because the history
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.960]  their quotes tell us that exactly yeah so you got people asking if there's any privacy left
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:48.160]  so they can squash it because we've got google's eric schmitt we've got david portrays from the
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:54.480]  cia we've got we've got keith alexander from the nsa we've got alex cart from palantir who is there
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:59.040]  to data mine what these other guys steal all the information they steal about everybody and try to
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:04.080]  create relationships from it that's essentially what palantir is about i think one of the most
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:08.000]  important things that can come out of this besides getting people to understand this is actually going
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.840]  on is how the how their structure is what their plan is for the world and i think we see what
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:19.120]  david rockefella's goals were what he stated back in 1973 when he created the trilateral commission
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:25.760]  we see that now coming to fruition in these transatlantic trade partnership agreements
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:30.080]  also the trans specific partnership agreements we're going to talk about that when we come back
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:35.840]  we have richie allen from the uk as well as paul joes we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:39.520]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:06.720]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here in austin and joining me from the
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:13.760]  uk are paul joseph watson and richie alan of the people's voice internet news channel now when we
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:18.240]  were in coban hagan we didn't have time to go sightseeing but one of the things that i would
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:23.360]  have loved to have seen maybe i'll go back someday and see it is croneborg castle now this was a site
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:29.520]  of shakespeare's hamlet also known as elson or castle now according to legend this statue that we
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:36.080]  opened up with if you're watching this uh according to legend kind of a king arthur type of myth this
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:43.200]  was a danish king called holger the dane they say that uh he returned to rescue france after
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:48.560]  things were happening in england then traveled to croneborg castle where he sleeps until he is needed
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:55.200]  to save his homeland i i bought that statue because i think the danish people as well as the people
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:34:01.840]  of all of europe of north america and of asia need to wake up to what's happening with these globalist
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:06.880]  plans what is going to be happening with the trans-pacific partnership with the transatlantic
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:13.200]  partnership this is something that goes back to 1973 when they started the council on foreign
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:18.800]  relations now we see this mirrored in these new trade partnership agreements that are essentially
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:23.840]  going to elevate multinational corporations and banks to the level of the nation states in order to
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:31.040]  destroy the nation states that was the stated purpose of these commissions of these globalist
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:36.640]  groups like the bill de berg group the trilateral commission uh richie allen what do you think about
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:43.120]  the importance of waking people up to the trans-pacific transatlantic partnerships is there much
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:47.600]  awareness of it in the uk there's not much awareness of the trans-pacific partnership and
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:54.240]  the transatlantic partnership here in america no david there isn't i'm without info wars i'm
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:35:00.880]  without the people's voice and dot tv and there would be very little awareness of it um here's
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:07.680]  an agreement being sold to people as a way to bring about fair trade and to help um developing
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:13.840]  economies and bringing develop developing economies into the fold and having a one side fits all
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:19.440]  agreement that's fair to to every country but here's an agreement that i believe joseph stiglitz
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:25.040]  and paul krugman to well-known economists have said basically only serves the interest of the
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.240]  wealthiest and you mentioned earlier on and i heard alex talking earlier on in the broadcast
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:35.040]  about the provisions there for corporations to in fact sue governments when they don't like what
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.120]  governments are doing um i don't know if you know this you probably will maybe some of your
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.720]  viewers won't know um but this was put to the uh in a big poll in new zealand it was put to the
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:51.280]  new zealanders back in 2012 i'm sure paul will know this and they were asked to um give an opinion
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:56.080]  that's whether they thought it was a good thing that corporations could sue um democratic elected
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:02.240]  governments uh no surprise 64 percent nearly two thirds of um new zealand said no it's not a good
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:08.560]  idea i tell you what i think it is david and i'm new compared to you know you guys and alex i'm
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:13.200]  pretty new i worked in the mainstream media for a long time um and it's only really been the last
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:18.080]  four or five years um that i kind of came out and had a good look at what was going on and what was
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:24.480]  being reported and what was not being reported and why um so so maybe my analysis is going to be a
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:32.720]  little bit immature maybe um but i'm going to say this it seems to me that um corporations are are
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:38.080]  out to do nothing other than privatize every square inch of land on this planet yes and
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:44.240]  whatever they have to do to bring that about they'll they'll go and do it now i won't rant on too much
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:49.040]  because paul wants to get in but i was thinking today i come from ireland obviously you're probably
[02:36:49.040 --> 02:36:53.280]  seeing tell me another one you obviously know i'm Irish and with this accent this outrageous accent
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:58.960]  that i have that's great and from and from water for the mireland we my country's been decimated
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:05.440]  by the imf and the european union yeah decimated and we've lost our um our the electricity supply
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:10.720]  board we've lost the forestry we've had to give pretty much all of our state assets to the imf
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:15.360]  to pay back debts that we really didn't have and what that makes me think and i'd love to hear paul's
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:20.080]  opinion on this David what do they need these agreements for what more does they need to do
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:25.120]  they're doing it already anyway governments have been um completely taken over by corporations
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:30.240]  anyway so why the need for these bloody agreements i don't get it i really don't that's right uh yeah
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.600]  paul the european union was something that that david yon bragged about the fact a chairman of
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:40.320]  bill de berg bragged about the fact that they created the idea for the european union as well
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:46.160]  as the euro and just their second meeting uh 59 years ago this was the 60th anniversary of the
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:50.720]  bill de berg group meeting so what do you think uh what do you think they need they want to have
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:58.320]  every last bit of private property on the planet don't they paul yeah this ttip is another pillar
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:05.040]  of world government and it's about taking away any shred of representative nation state government
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:11.760]  in america or europe i mean look at the people who are behind this ttip hosey manuel baroso
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:18.880]  herman van rompoy both key bill de berg luminaries the guy running it from the us side is obama's
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:26.160]  us trade representative michael frohman cfo member wall street insider this is a guy who made out like
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:33.200]  a bandit in his position as city group managing director back in 2008 during the economic crisis
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:39.840]  so this is a kind of world company it's about joining europe and america together under a pillar
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:46.960]  of world government it's being called the economic nato and just as the european union began as a
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:53.520]  free trade area and is now a political federation basically where in some countries upwards of 50
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:39:00.880]  percent or more of laws are dictated are created implemented on orders of the e u with no nation
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:05.920]  state representative democracy whatsoever that's the plan now for america and that's how they're
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:11.360]  trying to get it done through creating this world company via the transatlantic trade and
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:16.240]  investment partnership agreement so that's what it's about because frohman is also behind the
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:22.800]  trans pacific partnership which is the america asian union so they're still intent on building
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:28.480]  this world government which they plan to have in place by the year 2000 it's being derailed again
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:35.840]  and again they're still pursuing it feverishly and this ttip is part that centralization of power
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:42.320]  into fewer and fewer hands you know it it echoes not just the goals of these globalist groups like
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:47.440]  the trilateral commission like the bill deberg group but it also echoes their operational methods
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:55.200]  because the trans pacific partnership is being negotiated by corporations without even any input
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:40:00.960]  from the democratic democratically elected people nations that are going to be affected by that
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:05.920]  us senators are not allowed to see what's going on in this trade agreement what we know for sure
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:12.800]  about it are really just echoes and leaks like we get from the bill deberg group so it's essentially
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:18.000]  having the public completely shut out of any information about this absolutely no openness
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.200]  no transparency no disclosure we only know things for sure that we've seen from it that
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:29.600]  have been leaked by wiki leaks and so we know that it goes beyond just economics we've got
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:37.200]  real issues of taking over control of the internet we've got as democratic countries
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:43.440]  have rejected syspa sopa acta pipa we now see that these guys are going to enact this through
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:49.440]  the back door where they can essentially shut down any internet site just with an accusation
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:53.040]  of copyright laws and of course it's also going to affect the way people get their medicine where
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:59.680]  they're going to extend out the copyright terms for these pharmaceutical companies even if it
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:05.520]  violates national law because these partnership agreements would take precedent over it and
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:11.680]  to make it clear when they have these arbitration sessions that would happen this would put the
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:17.120]  corporations just the multinational corporations mind you not local corporations within a country
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:21.520]  but only the ones that are multinational corporations they would have equal status
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:28.880]  in these arbitration schemes to sovereign nation states uh paul uh well let's go go to richie
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:32.880]  ellen richie what do you uh what do you think about that give us your take on it you couldn't
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:37.920]  argue with a single thing you've said um but but but i repeat again and i'm sorry if i'm boring you
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:43.520]  but it's it's a case of overkill really we're covering a story on the people's voice that
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:48.640]  you guys are interested in as well and it's about an australian farmer called steve marsh
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:54.720]  who sued his neighbor for cross contaminating his crop with gm crop steve is an organic farmer in
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:42:01.680]  australia this guy next door to him is growing gm canola and um so of course steve lost his organic
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:05.280]  certification in other words the government said steve you're not an organic farmer anymore
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.160]  because you've got you've got this stuff in your in your crop so of course that's not good for steve
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:14.560]  because organic crops cost a little bit more they cost a bit more to cultivate but they also make
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:20.640]  more of a profit so he's he's he's lost out on a on a on a few dollars so of course he sues um as
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:26.560]  he would do the um the um next door neighbor the the nearby farmer um and he loses and this is
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:32.560]  extraordinary the government who took the um organic certification away from him basically
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:37.280]  said to nobody's responsible for you losing your organic certification and to make matters worse
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:44.480]  then his neighbor who uh was sued by steve was bankrolled to the tune of god knows uh how much
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:49.600]  money by monsanto for the court case and i believe and i can't name them uh david but i believed a
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:54.720]  senior um agricultural ministers in australia have gone on the record in the last few days
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:59.040]  to say they're absolutely delighted with the decision so i say again why the need for this
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:04.240]  bloody um new agreement because what they want to do with it they're doing already anyway
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:10.560]  yeah that's true well we're in the us we had the supreme court nine to nothing have a similar case
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:17.840]  where uh it was a farmer whose uh product was cross contaminated by that and nine to nothing they
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.120]  sided with monsanto saying that he had to pay them because they had contaminated his product
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:29.200]  we see is people are fully awake in many areas of europe that they can then jam this down their
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:33.280]  throats what they could not get through democratically that's why people need to wake up to the trans
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:37.280]  pacific partnership the transatlantic partnerships that are being done there these things are being
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.400]  negotiated in secret just as they are bill de berg we've seen for a long time that the globalist
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:49.360]  agenda was to have regional consolidation like nafta like the e you then to combine europe
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:54.560]  to america to asia for world governance for world domination by these corporations paul
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.240]  what do you think about i think they're basically trying to plug the leaks in the agenda because
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.720]  they keep trying to implement this and it just keeps leaking again and again i mean look at the
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:10.800]  recent resistance in the euro elections i mean a lot of those parties have policies i don't agree
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:16.480]  with but the fact that in places like denmark france and the uk and other countries um they
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:24.240]  were dealt a huge blow by these anti globalist anti-eu parties um in the euro elections i mean
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.480]  that's got them panicked we know bill de berg were panicked about that they leaked the agenda
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.920]  beforehand they said they were going to be discussing that so as as the push gets stronger
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:39.120]  and stronger for world government the resistance uh complements it in some senses so i think this
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.520]  is why they're trying to really jam it down now and this ttip is basically about you know it's not
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:51.680]  free market it's mercantilism it's it's crappitalism as some refer to it because it's going to drive
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:57.040]  down wages it's going to eviscerate the middle class as all these agreements you know nafta gatt do
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:02.800]  we've proven that you know it's about the the carrot of fake prosperity promises that they're
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:08.000]  going to create all these jobs when in actual fact it's about eroding what little accountability
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.080]  the u.s government has left to its citizens yes absolutely and hopefully that's the one thing
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:18.240]  that we can come that can come out of our coverage they can come out of this if people start to look
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:23.760]  at what's being done why do we have this secretive meeting why do we have these secretive trade
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:28.400]  negotiations that are essentially affecting everything we have people like the electronic
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:33.440]  freedom foundation are getting involved in this because they said this is not simply about economic
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:39.120]  issues it would be bad enough if it were but it's about many things far beyond that that affects
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.160]  whether or not we're going to have any say so at all in our lives we had one of the fellows there
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.720]  one of the security guards the first day i said you know people are going to be deciding things
[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:54.640]  for your future and you're not going to have any say in it his response was well i hope that they
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.960]  decide well he doesn't have a problem with that richie allen how do you how do people feel about
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:03.920]  that are they just think that these elite the technocrats can make these decisions for people
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:09.040]  and they don't need to have any input whatsoever into it no i think things are changing and i
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.040]  again this is not blowing our trumpets our collective trumpets but info wars and david
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:20.240]  ike and david ike dot com and the people's voice and we're making a huge change i think because
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:26.000]  paul said something very interesting there he mentioned um we don't like the class system we
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:30.560]  don't like the words working class middle class but there is a middle class there is a class of
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:35.440]  people david who've always been comfortable they've always had enough and they've never suffered
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:40.880]  and i think now we're seeing and paul is absolutely right we've seen the results in the european union
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:45.280]  elections in britain and in irland and around europe and france and i agree with paul he's on
[02:46:45.280 --> 02:46:50.640]  savory characters in some of these parties golden dawn and marina lepens party in france these are
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:57.360]  awful people but um but but the middle class people who are used to doing okay even when times are
[02:46:57.360 --> 02:47:02.800]  tough are now getting squeezed beyond belief and when that i always believe that when that happened
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:05.920]  you were going to see change people are going to stand up and say no no we're not going to have
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:10.560]  this anymore um but we could be here all night long talking about the media the media is a
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.600]  disgrace i worked in the mainstream media for a long time and all we ever did was ripped and read
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:20.880]  ripped and read david we ripped and read press releases um we did we did interviews where we
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:26.240]  were as tame as a kitten in terms of the questions we asked um government ministers and uh senior
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.440]  politicians an absolute disgrace and of course we see in britain we see in irland what's remaining
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:36.240]  of the media you know independent commercial radio stations independent television stations
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:41.440]  they're disappearing at a rate of knots we've got companies like global in britain bower in britain
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:46.400]  owning i mean the vast majority of commercial radio stations um which is why of course they
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:50.560]  managed to keep so much of this agenda hidden yeah that's right now you you said that you were
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:56.880]  embedded in mainstream media you broke out just as sheryl ekinson who just broke this story about
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:01.360]  the experimentation on premature babies i don't know if you've heard about that that's breaking
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:04.800]  for david i haven't i'm horrified to hear that yes i've been listening to the program
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:11.760]  since the start i always hear the program and uh um that's an absolutely horrendous horrendous
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.400]  story that it really is and yet i don't believe that that's the kind of story that she would be
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:20.720]  allowed to cover at cbs or if she was allowed to cover it i believe they would have probably
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:27.520]  contacted the national institute of health and uh the uh the other government agencies that were
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:32.400]  involved in setting up this horrific thing and let them do a little bit of damage control at the
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:37.680]  same time before this broke you know so that's the thing that we're seeing now is people breaking
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:42.240]  out breaking free and i think this week as we look at the one year anniversary of the snowden
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:49.600]  leaks as we look at the 25 year uh anniversary of tenement square as we see that nobody was
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.840]  covering this on the outside of the bill de berg group there were media representatives inside
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:58.160]  bill de berg but i think we see that the real place that people are going to wake up and
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.280]  where the rubber really meets the road is with an information war trying to wake people up so
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:08.720]  that's why i go back to what we started with in this segment talking about the uh the sleeping
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.200]  giant many people talk about well in denmark they have the same analogy they've got a king that is
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:19.040]  asleep there until the danish people need him everybody needs to wake up thank you for joining
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.400]  us richie allen with the people's voice dot tv it was a pleasure david thanks for having me really

[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:33.520]  paul we're going to be back after the break we want to talk about uh there's a couple of
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:39.760]  breaking stories here in the u.s uh there's one about the n r a actually coming after some of the
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.960]  open carry demonstrators and telling them to stop this foolishness i want to talk about that a little
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:51.680]  bit uh we've also got some stories that are breaking again about uh china when i was in europe
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:58.000]  it looked like the financial times that i picked up on the plane almost every article was about china
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:04.400]  people in america just don't realize how much it has shifted and one of the articles that i found
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:11.280]  was interesting was the fact that china is now becoming the number one supplier uh sorry purchaser
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:18.480]  of robots so even though they have uh transferred all of our jobs to china as part of kissinger's
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:23.600]  plan his grand opening to china the globalist move production of the united states to china
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:30.320]  now even that work that the chinese had and they're getting paid horrendously low wages even that
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:35.440]  is going to be taken away from them as they start to replace people in china with robots in china
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:42.800]  we're going to be right back talking to paul joseph watson from the uk stay tuned

[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:13.360]  i'm david night with paul joseph watson from the uk and as we're going to break i mentioned that
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:18.800]  when we were in europe covering the bill berg meeting in kopenhagen i was looking at some
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:25.600]  european papers the financial times was all about china from tianaman square anniversary to an
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:30.800]  article entitled beijing hits out at us and japan alliance to the story that we had at prison
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:38.080]  planet dot com earlier about china dropping its wall rigs into vietnam territory and going
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.720]  against the vietnamese but this is one that i wanted to get paul's comments on the kind of
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:48.240]  stuck out says china transforms from quote workshop of the world i would say sweatshop of the world
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:53.840]  to the biggest robotics buyer they said china bought 36 000 industrial robots last year rise of
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:55:01.360]  almost 60 over 2012 they're now in first place uh second place was japan and then third place was
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.200]  the us they believe that at the rate that china is growing it's going to be by far and away the
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.440]  largest robotics market paul we've seen for a long time we've seen the transformation again with
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:18.160]  kissinger and others globalists they have moved us manufacturing to china now they're taking even
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:24.000]  that away from the chinese but in the us we're also going to see the loss not just of manufacturing
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:31.440]  jobs but robotics are going to impact service jobs as well drivers are going to be replaced by
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:36.800]  self-driving trucks we're going to see a lot of things happening in essentially service
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:43.520]  jobs united states it looks to me like they're on path for a massive transformation of society by
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:49.920]  the 2020 to 2025 time frame they've been talking about for a very long time well and what are the
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:56.000]  consequences if you take away the lower paid jobs then these people are going to be forced to become
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.680]  dependent on government by taking welfare so they won't they won't be dying on the streets they'll
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.880]  still be at their level of poverty but they'll just be in receipt of government welfare to an even
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:13.040]  greater degree keeping them dependent the skilled jobs the intellectual jobs will still exist but
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:18.880]  again they'll be able to keep this huge underclass of people which will be used as a voting block
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:23.360]  completely dependent on the state and that's what it's all about if you go to china though
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:30.960]  so even in like the drug stores they have an employee a service helper for every individual
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:38.080]  rack of shelves in the drug store whereas in the uk and america you know you probably get a couple
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:42.960]  of people out there asking people if they want help in china the drug stores in some of them
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:47.600]  there are more employees than customers that's the level of service employment that they currently
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:53.040]  have whether that will then be taken away it's anybody's guess but again the overriding point
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:57:00.160]  is that you can you can take away those service jobs replace them with robots but still keep people
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:06.320]  dependent on welfare i think that's what it's all about in terms of economic serfdom yes and
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:12.800]  that's exactly the point economic serfdom when you're talking about taking away people's ability
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:17.680]  to move around and it's not just as workers what they are doing with most of these regulations that
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:22.160]  we see that are being going to be pushed by these uh partnership agreements that they're trying to
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:28.320]  negotiate in secret just like most of the regulation that we see it's about cutting off the bottom
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:34.320]  rungs of the ladder of success it's about making sure that nobody goes into competition with the
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:40.640]  large corporations essentially setting up a return to serfdom as you point out kind of fiefdom you
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:46.400]  know where where these uh people essentially own everything and everybody else is essentially
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:51.440]  workers so you have a few overlords who own everything like it's some kind of a feudal society
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:55.920]  and everybody else is merely workers and essentially taking away that middle class we've had
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:02.480]  since the uh since the renaissance yeah look i mean india they've lifted themselves out of
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:07.360]  poverty by removing the regulation helping small businesses that's how you do it you don't increase
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:12.160]  regulation to improve and save the economy you reduce it people become self-sufficient they make
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:16.560]  their own money they're less dependent on government exactly thank you very much paul joseph
