[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.000 --> 00:47.000]  It's Thursday, November 10th, 2022.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  We've got a very important broadcast.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  We're launching, as we speak.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  We have primary ignition.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  We'll be here until 3 p.m. Central.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  Owen Schroyer has been doing an excellent job
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  breaking down the fraud and also tracking
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  the battleground races that are still
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  ongoing.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  He will be in the other studio.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  Someone will be casting with us in 30 minutes.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  Mike Lindell has assembled quite the team
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  and in live time in the last few days
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  has been documenting what can only be described
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  as in-your-face fraud.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  That's all coming up and more
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  and we will also open the phones up
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  and take your calls today.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  And I want to cover all the news
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  and I want to get all the different facets of it.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  We're going to.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  But I also want to just talk big picture here
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  about what we're living through
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  and what's happening and the paradox that's there.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  If the globalists tell us they want to depopulate us
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  because we're worthless scum in their eyes.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  Useful cedars is the technical term they use.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  A human scourge needs to be called
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  an infestation of disease.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  And they're self-appointed to carry that out.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  If we don't rally to our own human cause
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  and not let the worst people on earth
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  take control of our destiny,
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  as adults we do deserve to die.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  And there's a very distant point
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  for those that believe in humanity
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  and believe in free will
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  and believe in human empowerment
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  and those that don't believe in human free will
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  and human empowerment for the average person
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  and who want to be God.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  That's our part.
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  Except in the area of
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  being aware of how the universe works.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  And it really is true in a social-barbonistic fashion
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  that is we present all this
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  that's very accurate and documented
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  and the general public does not rally and awaken
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  and say no and bring the perpetrators to justice
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  that really they've all been given ample warning
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  and deserve what they get.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  And that's why the globalist target adults
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  with deadly shots and assisted suicide
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  and all the rest of it
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  because metaphysically in the natural law of the universe
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  if you can get somebody to hurt themselves
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  out of their free will,
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  even if you pretty much trick them,
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  a hint, then it doesn't come back on you
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  metaphysically as bad.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  So they're definitely involved in a spiritual alchemy
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  and they understand the law of the universe.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  But when they cross the Rubicon
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  of trying to euthanize children,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  trying to sterilize children,
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  trying to wreck the brains of children,
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  it commits an interdimensional crime
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  that God will not put up with
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  and will destroy us.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  And the other team we're finding knows that
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  and that's why they try to get us to go along
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  and sanction the killing of children,
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  whether it be abortion or assisted suicide
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  or transgenderism as a form of genetic suicide
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  for the people that actually get sterilized.
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  And so they're trying to get us to lower our shields,
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  our cells,
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  so they can really have their way with us.
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  As a conduit to the wellness company.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  We know from scientific exit polls around the country
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  that even CNN predicted an absolute total bloodbath
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  for the Democrats.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  But magically, despite there was much higher
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  Republican turnout than Democrats,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  they have effectively blocked the red tsunami.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  And Joe Biden's been stumbling around
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  on a disgusting celebratory victory lap,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  spewing lies, depending on the poll between 70
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  and 87% of Americans blamed Joe Biden
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  and the Democrats for inflation and the country collapsing
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  and were saying they were going to vote Republican.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  But it just didn't happen because the machines
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  in all the key districts, in all the key states,
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  just magically went out in the key Republican districts
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  and then their ballots had to get sent off
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  to a central special place to be counted.
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  And all the same handing out the black sharpies
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  in Republican districts.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  So those votes wouldn't be counted,
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  just done all over the damn country.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  We got Mike Lindell joining us in the second hour.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  He's always had a great job fighting,
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  but he's knocked it out of the park this time
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  with the analysis and more.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  Hell, we should get Pete Santillion on.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  I was watching them yesterday and today.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  I got a lot of their stuff up on n4s.com
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  doing a great job laying all this out.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  I would show you what it was about in the hour to look at.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  The aftermath, the fraud evidence,
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  and then the battleground states of Nevada, Arizona
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  and Georgia and Colorado.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  There's a lot of ongoing races
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  that we're going to be looking at very, very closely.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  I also want to take a lot of calls today
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  and pull back and look at the big picture,
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  what we're really dealing with here.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  And now this is the same formula of control.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  All of the world where voting is still allowed.
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  But let's just, let's play a few of these clips.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Here's Biden saying the overwhelming majority
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  of American people support his economic agenda.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  Though every poll, even New York Times polls,
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  even polls the Democrats have commissioned,
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  show absolute disgust.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  But he says you love it
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  and you just voted for more of it. Here it is.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  You're out to read him anymore.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  I hope you are uncertain as well.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  But overwhelming majority of American people
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  support the elements of my economic agenda.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  From rebuilding Americans' roads and bridges
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  to lowering prescription drug costs
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  to historic investment and tackling the climate crisis
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  to making sure that large corporations
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  begin to pay their fair share in tax.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  Biden just goes on and on and on.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  There's so many of these clips.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  Also, there's a really important clip
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  I want to play here in a moment
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  if I can play it right now.
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  A reporter sycophantically like she's a commissar
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  in Soviet Russia or a Maoist under Mao in China.
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  She's like, oh, is Musk a national security problem?
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  Are you going to investigate him?
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Should he be looked into buying Twitter?
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  You know, maybe he's a Rusky too.
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  And Biden very creepily starts smacking his lips
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  and saying, yes, we should look into it.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  Here it is.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Musk is a threat to U.S. national security.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  And should the U.S. and with the tools you have
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
[09:51.000 --> 10:05.000]  I think that Elon Musk's cooperation
[10:05.000 --> 10:15.000]  or technical relationships with other countries
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  is worthy of being looked at.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  Whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate,
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  I'm not suggesting that.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  I'm suggesting that it's worth being looked at.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  But that's all I'll say.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Now, I want to go to a clip here of the president
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  of El Salvador visiting Tucker Carlson
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  talking about looking at what's happening to America
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  and coming to the conclusion that this is all being done by design.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  Well, the globalists say they're destroying the country by design.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  They're shutting down the pipelines,
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  the coal power plants, the borders.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  They're just annihilating us.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's all a big joke to them.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Jimmy Kimmel making jokes about fentanyl deaths.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  This is a pro-death pro-terrany cult.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  And then, speaking of Biden,
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  there's a clip of him being asked about Hunter Biden
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  by a non-sycophantic reporter.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  And he just laughed at it.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  He says good luck because he knows he controls the Justice Department
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  where his boss is like Obama and others above him do.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  These are arrogant, entitled criminals who just stole another election.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  All they do is lie on every issue, on the economy, on COVID,
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  on the borders, just all of it, on Ukraine.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  But before we go to that clip,
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  here is the president of El Salvador, Naib Boukele Ortiz.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  Here he is with Tucker Carlson.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  And the term he uses is the name of my first film.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  I was trying to make a documentary about the UN World Government takeover
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  and the plan to destroy society, the family, our culture,
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  have forced medical tyranny, forced injections.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  It's all in my first film.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  Two hours long, America destroyed by design.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's still free online. You can still find it.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  And it's titled America Destroyed by Design.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  And here he is using that term.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  The demise of the US has to come from within.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  The enemies have to be inside.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  Not really outside.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  No external enemy can cause so much damage as internal.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  It's an internal operation.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  You're watching internal operations here.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  You can see them in cities.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  Cities that were pristinely beautiful 30 years ago are wastelands right now.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  You will see people, I mean, I'm from El Salvador,
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  third world country in Central America.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  And myself, I can see cities here and say,
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  I don't want to, I want to live here.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  So that would be unthinkable three decades ago.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  Totally unthinkable.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  But El Salvador wouldn't want to live in the US city.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  The US main city, I mean, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  New York Chicago, yeah.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  Philadelphia, Baltimore.
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.000]  When you look at how the cities are loading so fast,
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  this has to be by design.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  I mean, who makes so many stupid decisions?
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  Like, okay, we're going to give you money for drugs.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  Really, they're doing that.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  In some cities, they're giving people drugs.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  I mean, they're literally giving people drugs in some US cities.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  Or they say, okay, we're going to give you money if you don't work.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  Or they make all of these laws that make no sense.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Or if they have a high crime, okay, I have a solution.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Let's defund the police, right?
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  They make this analysis here.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  And you see all these campaigns defund the police.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  You will see these campaigns of, you know,
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  let's allow shoplifting up to this amount.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  They make these decisions openly.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  I mean, it's not even a secret.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  They made them openly.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  And we all know what would be the consequence of it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  Which is the takedown and the total collapse of the Western world,
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  which is their admitted plan.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  The government is not run by us.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  In most areas, it's at war with us.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  And you can cross from one town to another,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Republican run to Democrat run.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  And you leave a clean, nice, healthy place.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  And you enter a hell hall by design.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  In fact, there's examples of this.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  I'm going to send some of our reporters up to cover.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  Because I was up visiting some friends in Round Rock
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  in Williamson County last week.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  And as you drive under the bridge, there's the county line
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  for Travis County and Williamson County.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  And there's all the homelessness and garbage and crime
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  and crack dealers right here.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  And you cross right on the line, it's all clean.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Because the police don't have their hands tied.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  And again, it's the cloud and pivot strategy,
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  America destroyed by design.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  And the longer this goes, the worse it's going to get
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  until things completely collapse.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Then they're going to roll out the national ID cards
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  the implantable chips, it's all been announced.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  And you're going to have to do everything they say
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  or they're going to put you in a death camp.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Now, when the party's over, folks,
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  there'll be no more getting free stuff.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  None of that.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  It's going to be high tech compact cities,
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  death camps, combat robots.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  And they're just going to snap their fingers
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  and turn the 5G on.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  And you'll all start dying of cancer within months.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  It's November 2022.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  And that means our historic biggest sale of the year

[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  You're insane.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  All the stuff going on in this world.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  If you don't boost your immune system,
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  Don't let the globalist monsters
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  and their mercenary minions
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  be successful at silencing you.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  And the globalist number one mission
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  is to silence info wars,
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  of resistance alerting the people,
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  not as of America, but the world,
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  for the threat of the globalist
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  and their censorship and tyranny.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  That's why it's so essential today,
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  now more than ever, to share links
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  to infowarstore.com
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  and to also financially support infowarstore.com
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  at the most critical time on our fight
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  by using promo code 1776 at checkout
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  to get additional 10% off.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  They admit once they've silenced us,
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  they're coming for you.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  I'm in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down,
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  but I could give out without your support.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  Thank you for all your past support.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  for an additional 10% off
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  It's our best seller.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  We first came out with it five years ago,
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  and it was a moderate seller.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  and experienced the way it made them feel
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  and how healthy it made them,
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  And it's been sold out for a while,
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  but it's finally back in stock.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  your immune system, but it helps
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  every cellular function of the body.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  Vitamin minerals, all the key amino acids,
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  all of the essential vitamins
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  with a product like this.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  but this is amongst the very best,
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  and it's a low price, and it funds the infowar.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  By the will of God,
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  and by God working through you and your support,
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  info wars continues to persevere
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  against the attacks never before seen
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  in the Western world against independent media.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  You have stepped to the plate so many times
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  and kept info wars and free speech on the air,
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  and I thank you.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  I have my own legal bills that have reached the point
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  that I can't pay them, and I need your support.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists,
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  please visit saveinfowars.com.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  that gives SINGO for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  This whole phase of their attacks,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  foyers in the making, is almost over.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up,
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:08.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.000 --> 20:21.000]  Now, I want listeners that are tuning in here to the Alex Jones show
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  to understand something.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  When I talk about things on air, I'm deadly, deadly serious about it.
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  So when we just went to break and I said,
[20:32.000 --> 20:36.000]  this is what's going to happen if they execute the next phase of their plan,
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  and they're going to start turning 5G on,
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  and people that live close to it
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  are going to die in a matter of months from cancer,
[20:44.000 --> 20:51.000]  we actually have the studies, okay?
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  Going back with the other previous forms being used for quote communications,
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  and what's important to understand is,
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  all of these platforms are multi-use.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  You can modulate 5G in these other systems,
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  and they're good for communications,
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  and they still have major cancer-causing effects.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  That is an admitted fact.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  We've interviewed countless engineers.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  It's in all the major studies.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  You can pull up Wired Magazine five years ago, big studies.
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  5G does cause even more cancer than the previous generations of it.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  And now the CHICOMS are having sixth and seventh G coming out
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  to run the robot cars, to control the robots on record,
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  to track everything you do.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  They can also then modulate them differently,
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  and it's a pre-programmed system, centralized,
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  where they can have even higher rates of medical problems,
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  deoxification in the lungs, burning of the skin.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  Just because you can't see the waves coming off,
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  doesn't mean they're not there.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  They are, and we all know this.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  So when I talk about these issues of incrementally hitting you
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  from dozens of different angles of different soft-kill weapons,
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  show that there's lots of different symptoms,
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  lots of different illnesses, lots of reforms of death,
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  but the life expectancy everywhere these systems go in is plunging.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  The IQs are plunging, the cognitive ability is plunging,
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  the neurological disorders are exploding,
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  and the heart problems and cardiovascular problems,
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  you see, the body's electrochemical.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  All your nerves, all your cells are electrochemical,
[22:43.000 --> 22:51.000]  but the heart particularly and the brain are extremely electrochemical.
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.000]  The heart is like a big powered battery, full of nerves,
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.000]  and there's study after study that these electromagnetic waves
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  jack with your heart, and in studies with mice,
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  they can change the oscillations that aren't as good for communication,
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  but that will fry you even faster.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  So when I'm talking about this, you have to understand this kill grid's going in.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  It didn't just hit us with the COVID-19 out of the lab,
[23:24.000 --> 23:31.000]  and then roll out a deadly shot that whether it's the virus vector injections
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  of J&J and AstraZeneca, or whether it's the mRNA gene therapy of Pfizer and Moderna,
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  by the way, it's the exact same shot.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  It's just Moderna's three times stronger.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  It's all the defense department made,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  and they cheap nipped it out in China to claim that's where it came from.
[23:47.000 --> 23:54.000]  In two hours with Dr. Peter McCullough on it last Saturday,
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  they are then able to test, engage the public,
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  and see if you wake up and see if you get upset,
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  and see if they can normalize a 40-plus percent death rate in every western country
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  previous to any other year, not COVID-related.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  They're testing to see if you wake up, if you get organized, if you say no.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  And if you don't notice what's happening to you in the stunned condition you're in,
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  then they up it even more, and they see this as a human scourge.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  And let me explain why the globalists are so confident.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  We just played a clip of the very populist,
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  patriot, president of El Salvador with Tucker Carlson saying,
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  this is America being destroyed by design.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  Now, how does he know that?
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  Well, if you look at Latin America until the 1960s,
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  until the IMF and World Bank funded leftist revolutions down there,
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  half of the countries in Latin America had a standard of living close to the U.S.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  Another 20 or so percent were on par,
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  about 30 percent of Latin America had a higher standard of living than we do.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Beautiful cities, beautiful farms and rural areas, very low crime.
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  But culturally, they had the same thing done to them that's been done to us.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  And it was easy because people moved off the farms the last 100 years.
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  They had kids, they had kids, and people also got disconnected from reality and got decadent.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  So that allowed the globalists to come in and inflate their currencies
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  and create the social systems that produced this poison.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  So when you look at the IMF and World Bank,
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  they're just front groups for large private central banks,
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  but also on the private Federal Reserve.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  And you see them with billback better and collapsing our economy
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  and shipping in drugs and all of this.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  You think, man, that's crazy to do that and giving us poison shots.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  You got to understand that in Central Asia and Southeast Asia and all of the Pacific
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  and all over Africa particularly and all over poor areas of Eastern Europe
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  and all over Latin America and in Native American reservations here in the U.S.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  and Canada, it's a big scandal in Canada,
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  since the 30s they've been giving indigenous populations so-called vaccines
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  that had cancer viruses in them, they had that since the 40s,
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  and sterilant hormones to cause an autoimmune response since the 60s.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  And there's official UN programs admitting they did this.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  So they've already tested it in other countries,
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  cutting off resources, starting civil wars, poisoning people, doing all this.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  And now they're taking everything they've learned.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  This is important to the Western world,
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.000]  because the Western world is only about 15% of the world population.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  Some of them are about 13.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  You count China, quasi-industrial, now you're talking about 35% of the world population,
[27:05.000 --> 27:13.000]  but the West is less than 15% and the globalists say people have air conditioning,
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  they have cars.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Remember, Obama went to Africa before he left office seven years ago
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  and said, you can't have cars, you're air conditioning.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  Well, Latin America had told them that in speeches, we've played it many times.
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  Well, they look at the West, the globalists see us as using their resources,
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  they own us, they believe, they've taken control through fraud,
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  and they say, well, we've already been attacking the Third World for a long time,
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  now it's time to make sure no one has anywhere to run,
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.000]  and there's no example of freedom and liberty and upper mobility and consumerism
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  that they've used to control us, but just the idea of consumerism,
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  the ability to buy and go and travel and do what you want, your lifestyle.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  There's authoritarian models coming in, they have to get rid of the West,
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  so it's not an example to aspire to.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  So they've already gotten away with all this beta testing, mass murder and control,
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  and police states all over the world, China's their biggest project,
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  testing it for the rest of the world, they admit that at the Council on Foreign Relations
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.000]  and the Bilderberg Group and the Club of Rome and all these other new order organizations
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  like the WEF, it's all the same people, same organizations.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  So they have a really out of control, long-term strategic operation
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  that's now going from being cloaked to uncloaked,
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  and it really does intend to incrementally, slowly kill everybody.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  But you notice now, it starts slow, but it starts accelerating over time,
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  and so now we're moving pretty quick, and in five years we'll be going ten times faster,
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  but this is the reality.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  They've stated there's too many people, they say they want to kill you,
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  and they then say, hey look, you're dumb, you don't care, we're going to kill you.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  I think globalists try to get me to go over their side.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  They say, Jones, you're not going to stop us, you just join us.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  The public needs to go.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  Now do you really want to go, folks?
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.000]  They are attacking, and suing, and censoring, and spying on,
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.000]  and engaging in bullying, and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians,
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  not just in America, but worldwide.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars,
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  because we know the globalist number, we know their operation,
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[33:00.000 --> 33:11.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.000 --> 33:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:41.000 --> 33:54.000]  I know you tuned in to this Thursday broadcast, and we hear about the election,
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  and what's happening there.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  We're going to be covering that most of the balance of the broadcast today.
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.000]  I just wanted to pull back and talk, big picture here, about why they're destroying,
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  not just America, but every once-free nation of the world, and it's for total absolute control.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  So there's no independent pockets of wealth, and so that no one is self-sufficient in any way
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  when they release far more powerful bio weapons and electromagnetic weapons in the very near future.
[34:25.000 --> 34:36.000]  We are living under an organized nanotech biological warfare operation, implanting the public with
[34:36.000 --> 34:48.000]  self-replicating protein crystals based on the spike protein, where your body manufactures a system to kill you.
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  And it's mainstream news, sudden death syndrome, 40% plus death rate above any other rate bigger.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  We have higher death rates per capita than World War I and World War II, Vietnam combined.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  They are killing us, and it's in all the countries that took the shots.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  It is a fact that they did this.
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  It is a fact that if they're not brought to justice, they're going to do it more.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  It's a fact that the groups that say there's too many of us are running the operation.
[35:16.000 --> 35:23.000]  I'm done talking about that now, but later we've got more info on it, and we're also going to be up with the phones up.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  But this is a very, very serious time to be alive.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  Now, Owen Schreuer has done an excellent job with the rest of the team, tracking the election.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  He's about to look at some of the evidence coming in, mounting of fraud.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  Michael and Dell joins us next hour to get into bombshell information on that front.
[35:47.000 --> 35:55.000]  But Owen's first going to look at the states where the fight is ongoing.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  Republicans destroy the Democrats in popular vote.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  The GOP margin of victory was more than 6% nationwide.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  Total of 95,786,183 votes.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  50,103,444 Republican.
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  44,243,277 Democrat.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  With Michael and Dell coming up, we're going to look at the official tally numbers coming in.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.000]  Let's show every time Herschel Walker or Kerry Lake or Oz or anybody got in the lead.
[36:27.000 --> 36:36.000]  At the exact point of the lead, boom, a perfect straight line explosion putting them way over the lead.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  But in one case in Pennsylvania, they added more votes than even existed in those counties and districts and precincts.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  So they even brought it down, but then back up.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  Unprecedented stuff. Michael and Dell is going to be covering that as well.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  We're going to be looking at everything along it.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  Owen Schreuer, give us the latest.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  Alex, the old vote Viagra for Raphael Warnock.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  Boy, that's a trick they love to use.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  The two states we're still watching, Nevada, Arizona.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  Let's start in Arizona.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  Now, what's going on in Maricopa County at this point is just ridiculous.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  That's the greater Phoenix area.
[37:09.000 --> 37:18.000]  Really the entire state, it's ridiculous, but it's whatever the problems are in Maricopa County that we're going to be talking about and we're going to be watching very closely.
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  The lead for Hobbs, obviously in Maricopa County is where the big gap is about 50,000.
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.000]  In the entire state, Lake is only behind by just under 15,000.
[37:32.000 --> 37:42.000]  Now, the Lake campaign believes that the districts and the areas where the votes are still coming in are in the more conservative areas of Maricopa County.
[37:42.000 --> 37:50.000]  So we're talking about outside of the Phoenix area, and they do believe they're going to be getting 60% or even higher percentages of those votes.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  That's why they're still confident at the Lake campaign.
[37:52.000 --> 38:00.000]  Even the Masters campaign, who is a lot farther behind than the Lake campaign by about 100,000, if you guys want to switch to the Senate now,
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  you'll see that that one is a lot bigger of a margin for the Republicans to overcome.
[38:06.000 --> 38:14.000]  And in fact, I actually think that Kelly is probably going to end up keeping his seat there with Masters just barely coming up short.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  We'll talk about the issues if people trust that or not when we come to that point.
[38:19.000 --> 38:27.000]  But when you go back to the governor's race, this is the amazing thing about what's going on right now in Arizona, specifically in this governor's race.
[38:27.000 --> 38:39.000]  Everyone across the country, whether you're a Democrat or Republican or a libertarian or whatever, has to admit what's going on in Maricopa County and what's going on in the state of Arizona has been an absolute disaster.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  How is it Florida does so well after a hurricane and Arizona can't figure out its stuff?
[38:44.000 --> 38:52.000]  How do entire countries do so well in a day of voting in person like France and Arizona can't figure their stuff out?
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  What is going on in Arizona?
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  So the late campaign, essentially, imagine if we had a reelection tomorrow.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  Imagine they say, oh, the governor's race, too much shenanigans, we're going to have a re-race.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  Well, now you go up and you say, do you think that Arizona's elections were held well?
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  Do you think Arizona's elections did good in the midterms?
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  And of course, everybody's going to say no.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  And you're going to say, do you know who was running them?
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  Katie Hobbs.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  Katie Hobbs is running the elections in the state of Arizona.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  And she just so happens to be on the ticket for governor.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  How convenient is that?
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  This is so ludicrous.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  It's stunning that we're actually in this position, Alex.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  It's like, how is this not raised?
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  How did we not see this coming?
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  But I guess we did.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  I guess we did.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  And I guess we'll be watching to see what comes after this.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  So we're continuing to monitor this.
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  They're going to have to get probably 100,000 vote advantage the rest of the way, I think,
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  in Maricopa County for Hobbs to win it, specifically rather in Phoenix.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  I don't know if they're going to get it.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Again, the late campaign believes that the ballots coming in are going to be 60% for them
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  because they're in conservative areas.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  But hey, who knows when they're coming in?
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  Who knows who's voting?
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  Who's ballots they are?
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  Nobody knows.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  In fact, there was an airplane.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  There was an unmarked airplane flying around Maricopa County.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  It was a joke on the internet.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  It was just a story about a site that follows aircraft news.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  There was an unmarked airplane flying around Maricopa County.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  The big joke was they were waiting for 3 a.m. to drop off ballots for Hobbs.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  Maybe it wasn't a joke.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  Maybe it's still in flight, just slowly dropping them off.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  But hey, let's jump to Nevada because this is the big one.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  I don't know why Nevada hasn't been called for laxalt yet.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  And I don't understand what's going on here either.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  What we were watching, Alex, was the Las Vegas area, Clark County, is where we've been watching.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  That's where we were concerned there was going to be maybe some shenanigans and some voter fraud.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  But the Democrats really not doing as well as they would have hoped to in Clark County.
[40:56.000 --> 41:04.000]  As you can see, just about 30,000 votes separate Masto and Laxalt there.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  So that's not a bad number for Republicans.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  Here's what happened overnight if we zoom back out.
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  Overnight, here we are in Reno and Washaw County, and now all of a sudden that flipped to blue.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  This was red the entire time.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  It's been red the entire race.
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  And then magically last night, it becomes blue.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  So now we're going to be watching this to see what kind of margins we have there.
[41:29.000 --> 41:34.000]  This might have been the area that we weren't expecting the Democrats to try to pull some shenanigans.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  But Laxalt's still ahead by about 15,000 votes, 83% of the vote in.
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.000]  So now, Alex, it's a matter of what are we going to witness between today and tomorrow and then over the weekend?
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  How much crap are we going to put up with in these races?
[41:51.000 --> 42:01.000]  Are we going to believe it if Masto comes back and beats Laxalt with amazing final drops in Reno and Las Vegas?
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  Are we just going to take that because here's what it looks like is going to happen.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  Laxalt is going to take Nevada.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  That gives Republicans 50 seats.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  Kelly is going to take Arizona.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  That gives the Democrats 49 seats.
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  And now you have a runoff for the Senate, essentially, in Georgia between Warnock and Walker,
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  which is going to be a complete and total bloodbath.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  But it looks like that's where we're going at this point, Alex.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Now, there's a couple of other races we're watching.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  Lauren Boebert's race, a house race in Colorado, has been pretty odd.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  She was actually behind most of the race and has, I think just recently, I don't know the latest numbers,
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  but may have actually pulled ahead.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Hold on. Stay there.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  We're going to go to break.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  We're going to go to break.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  We're going to come back with those latest numbers and more and then look at the evidence of fraud
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  than Mike Lindell's coming up, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[43:07.000 --> 43:13.000]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  Not just in America, but worldwide.
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is infowars because we know the globalist number.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  We know their operation.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  We know their modus operandi and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  and the highest quality of your immune system and more.

[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.

[44:24.000 --> 44:29.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  It's unsustainable.

[46:57.000 --> 47:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:04.000 --> 47:31.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  You know, I really think Tucker Carlson took it to the next level
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  a few nights ago on the eve of the election.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  He said they have to steal the election.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  We know they're stealing elections.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  We know they're lying frauds.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  And just like any other country that goes communist,
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  they never let it go back peacefully.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  And that's why they keep saying don't be violent, don't be violent.
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  Not because we're going to be violent,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  but because they intend to get violent
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  with their political opposition.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  That is such an important 18-minute monologue he did.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  And I'm tempted to just play the whole thing here today.
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  But we are in a lot of trouble.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.000]  We have to admit that.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  But fighting back is the way to go.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  This is only going to wake more people up
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  that they've done this.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  It's only going to energize folks that much more
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  to understand how much turning we're under.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Because you don't have polls of 70% to 80%
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  not like of Democrats in Biden and blaming him.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  And all the polls, exit polls showing Republican mega-realignment
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  tsunami, and then the opposite happens.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  And just to these numbers with Mike Lindell.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  And these aren't just from Mike.
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  Mike's a great guy.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  We went and looked him up ourselves from the federal database
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  as it released the graphs.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  And all over the country, just like we saw
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  in Michigan and Pennsylvania before two years ago,
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  right when Trump goes ahead, boom, magically,
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  it just shoots up straight line above them.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  And the same thing's been done over and over again
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  except they screwed up in Pennsylvania.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  They gave 90 plus thousand votes to Federman in just one second
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  and then had to pull that back down
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  because it was just too ridiculous.
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  So I'll destroy your, please continue analyzing
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  the latest developments and give us your analysis
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  on where you think this is going.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  Look, I think they stole the runoff two years ago in Georgia.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And so notice as you predicted Tuesday night,
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  long before the numbers were clear
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  and it still looked like Republicans were winning
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  in the landslide, you said,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  I think they're running the exact same playbook
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  two years ago.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  And it turns out all the same anomalies,
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  all the same problems, everything shaking out
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  down to the runoff in Georgia deciding it all.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  Yeah, and of course, I mean, the Democrats are predictable.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  Communists are predictable.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  And when criminals don't get held accountable
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  for their crimes, they're going to repeat the crime.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Let me just break this news right now.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  This has just happened.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  Lauren Boebert has indeed flipped her race
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  and is now in the lead for Colorado's third district.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  This has been in the Democrat advantage since election night.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  It has just flipped.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's been neck and neck.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  Obviously, Lauren Boebert, a strong Republican.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  And she's only won about 300 votes ahead.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Yeah, so that one is continuing,
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  but it looks like with this flip
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  and the vote trends coming in now,
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  I think it's safe to say that Boebert should retain her seat,
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  but we'll obviously be watching that.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  But Alex, exactly, everything we saw in 2020,
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  maybe to a lesser degree, obviously, with less at stake
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  without the presidential election going on,
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  but everything we saw in 2020 repeated
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  in a lot of ways of what we saw in 2022.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  The one, the one different thing that they did
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  was instead of doing all of the ballot drops,
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  you know, 300,000 here, 200,000 there
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  in the five states that they stole from Trump
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  at 3.30 in the morning,
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  they did some in the middle of the day.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  They did some in the morning.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  And so I think that they were hoping
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  that would kind of mitigate their strategy.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  And another trend that I noticed
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  was they're not really showing you the line graphs anymore.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Usually, they have the line graphs everywhere.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  On the mainstream news, on the internet tabulators
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  and everything, they don't really like us
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  seeing those line graphs anymore
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  because obviously it was used against them
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  with the questions of voter fraud in 2020
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  where, again, we call it the vote Viagra
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  where it's just, okay, normal trends,
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  and a straight line for Biden in five different states.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  So I know you're going to be covering that
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  at length with Mike Lindell.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  So I'll pull back from that.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  And I want to talk about two of the big stories
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  that we're seeing.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  Well, we're only three of the stories
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  that we're seeing here, Alex,
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  and that's libertarians' role in elections.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  What is going on in inner cities
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  and the Democrats bragging about young voters,
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  while that is a story,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  I think the bigger story is actually with Latino voters.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  So let me start there, Alex,
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  because this will lead into the question
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  of what goes on in inner cities.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  The Democrats are really pleased with themselves.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  They got the young people to turn out to vote today.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  And you can see that when you look at these graphs
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  and you go into cities like Madison, Wisconsin,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  where you have big college populations,
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  or even Austin, Texas, where they didn't do so well,
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  but you look at these areas kind of outside of the bigger cities,
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  but they have their little college towns
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  where they can get about 50,000 of the young voters
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  to show up, they hope, and vote Democrat.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  And they did.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  And they had early polling at colleges.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  The Democrats all campaigned at colleges.
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  It was a strategy that did go well for them.
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  But all things considered,
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  young people already tend to vote liberal Democrat.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  That's not necessarily such a big news story.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  I think the real story is now what you have
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  is the people in college now have never been as radicalized
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  and propagandized by the leftist propaganda
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  that are now voting for the first time.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  That might be the story there.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Nonetheless, everybody knows the older you get,
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  the more life experience you get,
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  the more you tend to vote Republican.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  So who knows how much of that they'll retain.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  But the Latino voter is another story, Alex.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  These are adults. These are people with families.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  These are people with kids.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  These are people invested in the American dream.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  They're now voting Republican,
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  and now overall as a demographic,
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  I would say, showing up to the polls as conservatives.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  And so this is really the story that I'm seeing.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  This is why Texas had such a strong showing.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  This is why Florida had such a strong showing.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  And I think this is about to bleed out.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  For some reason in Arizona,
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Republicans don't do well at the border.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  I think that can change as the Latino vote
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.000]  starts to bleed out of Florida, bleed out of Texas,
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  and people start to realize, hey, wait a second,
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  maybe these Democrats have never been in our best favor,
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  and they're going to realize most of the candidates
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  that run as Democrats in border towns are actually Republicans.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  They just can't run as Republicans
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  because they know they won't get any money
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  and they know they won't have a chance.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  So I think that's the real story here.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  And now if you look at this, okay,
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  because here's the other story
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  that Republicans need to be asking themselves, Alex.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  And I can go up on the map here.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  We can go into Denver.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  We can go into Chicago.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  We can go into New York City.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  We can go into Philadelphia.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  And you guys can just pull all these cities up in the back
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  and you're going to find out Democrats are getting 80, 70,
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  90% of the votes in some of these inner cities.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  That is a serious story that begs a lot of questions.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  But why didn't Miami go Democrat?
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  Why didn't Miami have 80%, 70% for Democrats?
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  Because Miami is a largely Latino-Hispanic community, Alex,
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  and it went Republican.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  I think this also speaks to how great DeSantis leadership is,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  but let's just draw back from that for a second.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  The Trump-DeSantis debate is obviously going to be raging.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  I think what you see here is Miami
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  with a strong Latino vote showing up for Republican,
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  flipping a major city that obviously favors Democrats.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  Now, people might also argue,
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  Ron DeSantis did a great job getting the voter rolls cleaned up,
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  making sure they ran a good clean election in Florida.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  So that argument can be made too.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  But why isn't the Republican Party asking the question
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  of how Democrats get 70% and 80% in these cities?
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  So guys, you can pull up Chicago, pull up New York,
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  pull up Philadelphia, whatever you guys want on the map here.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  But you'll see, I mean, you go to Chicago here, Alex.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  I mean, these numbers are out of control.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  73% for the Democrat Duckworth.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  And this trend repeats itself.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's even worse in New York City.
[55:25.000 --> 55:29.000]  Democrats are getting 90% of the vote in New York City,
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  which, by the way, I think that it's time
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  for the New York upper state body
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  to separate from the island and New York City.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  These numbers are so ridiculous,
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  the splits there are so ridiculous,
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  it needs to be a serious conversation.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  But let's not talk about that now.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  So are Republicans that pathetic
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  that they can't even get into the cities
[55:49.000 --> 55:53.000]  and even make these things contestable?
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Like they can't even draw Democrats down
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  to getting like 60% instead of 70, 80%
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  so that they can help their Senate candidates,
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  so that they can help their governor candidates.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  Is there just no interest there?
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Isn't there not even going to be a question of voter fraud?
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  Are we not even going to raise the question?
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  How do Democrats get 90%, 80%, 70% of the city's?
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  Oh, and stay there.
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  Oh, and stay there.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  We're going to come back to five minutes with you.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  And then Mike and Del's coming on to go over
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  what he calls the crime spikes and crime watch live
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  and all the rest of it.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  He's been on, particularly on fire lately.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  And so have you.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  We're going to come right back to you in a moment.

[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  cutting-edge broadcast.

[58:42.000 --> 58:49.440]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, I win-win.
[58:49.440 --> 58:55.360]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[58:55.360 --> 59:00.720]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[59:00.720 --> 59:02.800]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[59:02.800 --> 59:05.600]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[59:05.600 --> 59:08.800]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.280]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[59:10.280 --> 59:14.400]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[59:14.400 --> 59:18.720]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[59:18.720 --> 59:19.720]  your support.
[59:19.720 --> 59:22.840]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[59:22.840 --> 59:27.320]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[59:27.320 --> 59:31.280]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because
[59:31.280 --> 59:32.280]  of your past support.
[59:32.280 --> 59:36.480]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[59:43.920 --> 59:52.800]  The destination is infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[59:52.800 --> 59:58.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:58.960 --> 01:00:10.080]  All right, final segment with Owen Schreuer, doing a great job laying out these races and
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.080]  what's unfolding.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.480]  Michael Adele's huge news coming up here in just a moment.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.840]  Other key points you'd like to add, Owen?
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.880]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to become talking about on the war room, and because
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.080]  here's what I'm seeing.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.880]  There's the DeSantis-Trump debate that's obviously raging, and people are kind of picking sides
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880]  right now.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.000]  All right, I think mostly people are getting ahead of themselves, and it's a politically
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.280]  charged season.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:39.280]  I think the debate, the real movement I'm seeing here that needs to be focused on is
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.680]  the removal of poor from the Mick Republicans, McConnell, McConnell, Daniel.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.560]  They're ouster, it's time for them to go.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.680]  You already have Republicans that just won re-elections calling for it.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.200]  It's pretty much wide swept across the media, conservative media.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.040]  They don't want this Republican leadership anymore.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.280]  They're not happy with the results.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.840]  They believe Republicans should have done much better.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.680]  That's a consensus right now in the Republican voter base, in the populist movement that
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.440]  is trying to take over the Republican Party from the establishment and the Uniparty that
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.880]  the Mick ouster needs to happen.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.760]  McDaniel, McCarthy, and McConnell have got to go.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.200]  We're going to see how that develops, but I think there's going to be enough of an initiative
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:28.240]  and a charge with this 218th Congress that you might actually see a position change in
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.000]  those positions, and good, the Republican Party has such great talent and such great
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  potential coming up through it, it'd be ridiculous to keep these people around who don't energize
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.080]  the party or reach out to the young or the cities at all.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.600]  That's going to be a great thing that's going to come from this no matter how the numbers
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.440]  shake out in Congress at the end of the day.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.720]  Here's another big, maybe not big, kind of a side issue that I'm seeing, and that's
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.200]  the libertarian vote.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.360]  In a lot of these races, Georgia might be your best example, but I think Pennsylvania,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.000]  it was the same case.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.320]  The libertarian vote was more than enough to, if you would give all the votes, it would
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.400]  always put the Republican ahead, but I don't even think they would need all the libertarian
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400]  vote.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.120]  I think they would really just need 90% of the libertarian vote, and I believe it would
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.560]  have put Oz ahead, and it definitely would have given Walker the majority, and he would
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  have won the Senate.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.200]  And so I understand, I'm not going to get into the libertarian bashing game here.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.560]  I understand why libertarians exist.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.880]  I understand why they have a disposition towards the Republican and the Democrat Party, and
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.840]  I understand that why you vote third party and why you keep a third party out there.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.760]  But I think that libertarians are not being fully honest with themselves after the results
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:48.480]  of this election, because if you don't see how you have a real power here, because they
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.800]  say, oh, well, I don't want to vote for the two corrupt parties, or I don't want to vote
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.240]  for this person or that person.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.080]  Well, how about I put it to you this way?
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.680]  Let me give the libertarians a pitch here, because I'm not a Republican, I'm an independent.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.040]  But let me give the libertarians a push here of why, a pitch of why they should be moving
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040]  their votes to Republican.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.680]  Do you want to vote for the Democrat that's going to take your gun, or do you want to vote
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.920]  for the Republican that's not?
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.920]  I mean, do I really have to say anything else?
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.360]  And here's the classy way to do it, and this is what happened in Arizona, Alex, and I don't
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.080]  know if it's going to be enough to put masters ahead, but they still have their fingers crossed.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.320]  The libertarian candidate in Arizona bowed out about a week or two before the election
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.280]  and endorsed Blake Masters.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.160]  That's what the libertarians need to do at this point.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.080]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.000]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Georgia.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.840]  I understand you don't like the Republican party.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.080]  I get it.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.480]  I get it.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.320]  But if you don't see the power in what you can do now, just by endorsing the candidate
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.280]  that's not going to take your guns, hopefully not raise your taxes.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280]  But I get it.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280]  Republicans do that too.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.760]  But just on the issue of guns, I mean, isn't it easy enough?
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.160]  I mean, isn't that clear enough?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.160]  Do you want to be disarmed or not?
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.680]  So that's another issue that I kind of see as a side order of Alex that people are going
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.680]  to be talking about.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.440]  But these are the big issues that I see that we're going to be covering on the war room.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.080]  I'm looking forward to hearing from Mike Lindell with these ridiculous numbers, the exact same
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.560]  playbook they ran in 2020.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  Well, let's do this.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.000]  I know you've got to get ready for your own show at three today, but Mike Lindell is giving
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  us the whole hour.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.720]  I know you'll have some great questions and great analysis, so you get your big board
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  ready in there.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.200]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we'll have you pop in with some comments, analysis,
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.960]  and any questions for Mike Lindell.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.160]  And then you'll be back at Pre-PM Central with the War Room at infowars.com, Ford Slash
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  Show.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]  That sound good?
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.160]  All right.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160]  We'll be right here.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160]  All right.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]  Great job, the crew.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160]  Great job, the listeners.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]  Keeping us on air.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.760]  There's no water here, but we're still in the fight, just like America is, we're not
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760]  going to give up.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760]  All right.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.960]  We'll be right back with Mike Lindell, infowars.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.840]  Big sale going right now with promo code 1776.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.280]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:10.160]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.720]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:25.360]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide, providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:33.160]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:40.560]  post-COVID, vaccine injury symptoms, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:47.560]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.800]  advice.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:06:17.600]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.720]  Well, the people think I'm like an octopus with eight arms trying to fight the new world
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.960]  order or everything I got.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]  Watch out, Mike Lindell.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.240]  I mean, even during the break, the guy is directing five different people to do five
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.720]  different things.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.840]  Just amazing.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.200]  And he was dead on about election fraud, and now he's built the organization to expose
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200]  it.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.840]  And he's joined us for the full hour here, and I went and checked the data he put out.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840]  It's dead on.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.720]  He was the first to put it out, and it's just been on top of it was an amazing team.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:55.640]  We have things like Federmann with these crime spikes, as Mike Lindell has coined here, with
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.480]  these crime spikes.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.880]  We have all of this happening, and then we have votes being taken away from Federmann
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.920]  because they obviously added too many to it.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.720]  But I want to say something before we play a short compilation of some of the highlights
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.080]  of their election coverage, and we go right to the great guy himself, Mike Lindell, there
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.080]  on screen.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.440]  We're in a fight against the new world order.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.440]  And so you need to go to MyPilla.com and get some of the best sheets and pillows and slippers
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.160]  and shoes and dog beds and human beds and just hundreds of amazing, made American products
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.720]  that fund our operation and his.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720]  You want fighters?
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.240]  We're fighters.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]  We need funding.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]  He needs funding.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.880]  Plus, they're great products that are way higher quality.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.760]  You'll find it stores for four or five times the prices.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.960]  So stick with those that have been fighting hard.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.120]  Everybody do your Christmas shopping early at MyPilla.com with promo code Alex, so we
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.880]  can get some of the support a total win-win because every time I get my call, he just
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880]  adds a plug at the end.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.520]  I thought it was upfront important to point out the biggest bed and sheet sale ever as
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.600]  low as $29.95 for that giant set.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:05.400]  MyPilla sheets as low as $49.95.

[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.400]  Overstock sale.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.600]  Six piece MyPilla towel set, $39.98.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.040]  My goodness at the store, towels look 30 bucks apiece.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.920]  MyPilla sandals, $19.98.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.400]  MyPilla is as low as $19.88.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.320]  MyPilla beds, massive discounts up to 50% off on that.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.320]  Towel sale.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.520]  MyPilla plush blanket as low as $19.98.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.600]  Roll and go anywhere.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.880]  MyPilla is $14.98.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.240]  Beach blankets and beach towels save 30%.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.680]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:41.640]  Women's sleepwear, long wear, hundreds and hundreds of products made in America funding
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:48.880]  the second American Revolution, MyPillow.com, MyPillow.com, promo code Alex at checkout
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.120]  and get a massive discount.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120]  It's all over the place.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.000]  He's got a bunch of other amazing sites.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  He'll tell you all about it before he leaves us in like 50 minutes, but I wanted to play
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  a compilation.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.520]  He was asking me before he went live, right during the break, he said, did you see our
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.520]  coverage?
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.800]  I said, well, of course, I was watching and everybody is.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.000]  You've done the best job.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  You've nailed it.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.800]  Did you see my crime spikes and live time crime?
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.440]  I said, of course, I've got a compilation of some of the best of it.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.480]  We'll air a few minutes of it and go to the man, Mike Lindell.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480]  Here it is.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.720]  Note we have here, we have the votes going up.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.280]  I'm putting my cursor over it, votes going, staying the same, staying the same.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:31.920]  And then we have, we go from 326,000 votes down to 288,000 votes.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.480]  So where'd they go?
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480]  They're gone.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.080]  You can't go and reverse everybody.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.600]  These are the order, these votes are coming in through the Edison report, which is one
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.240]  of the biggest monopolies in this country.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:46.760]  Every single vote goes through New Jersey and then it comes out to us.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.360]  I switched over while you were talking to the governor race in Pennsylvania and you'll
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.800]  see it happen there too.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.640]  So we have a 63,000.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:02.080]  We have a 90,000 crime spike, another 90,000 crime spike, a 63,000 crime spike.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.680]  And then they go, uh-oh, the whole world's going to know that Maseriano's getting, you
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.280]  know, we're cheating by too much.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280]  So what do they do?
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.320]  Everybody right there, point to the cursor, they got, they took away 90,000 votes from
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320]  the Democrat.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  Yeah.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.840]  If you look, it took the vote total back to where it had been way back here.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:26.640]  These are real time crime spikes, machine manipulation.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]  Look at that.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:33.600]  That Democrat got dinged up 150,000 votes because Herschel was taking the lead.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.040]  So they just dumped some votes by computer in there.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.680]  Everybody can understand that.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.680]  That's something everybody can enjoy, real time crime.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.320]  That's right there, right?
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.440]  That's a hundred thousand votes that comes out of nowhere.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.240]  That's just not real.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.360]  If you took that real spike out, that crime spike, Herschel would be up by 150,000 votes.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.480]  Yeah, it looks like about a hundred thousand votes spike there, if I'm reading that correctly,
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480]  out of nowhere.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.920]  Yes, that one.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:16.120]  For Gretchen Widmer, that has all the indications of a vote dump, of likely counterfeit ballots.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.320]  Both of these look really, really strange, but in particular, yeah, that one.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.840]  Because there was almost hardly any increase in the, yeah.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  That's 22, 23.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.440]  So it's 10, 23 p.m. Eastern Town, if I'm reading that correctly.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.040]  And so that is almost beyond belief.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.320]  Wow, look at this, everybody.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.680]  That's a million votes up and a million votes down.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.880]  You know, a million votes here and a million votes there, and eventually it adds up to
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.560]  real, you know, real election.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.840]  Can you explain this one?
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840]  Can you explain this one?
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.080]  Well, I can't really explain it.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:02.480]  There is no explanation, but you see that you had an update at Eastern Time, what is
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:11.680]  that, 1042, of about a million votes for Duckworth and pretty much none for the other person.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.200]  And then you see, it wasn't like it was something that came right back.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.640]  It's like we kept on having a little more updates, a little more updates, and then suddenly
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.400]  there goes the million votes back down again.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.600]  What million-person spike there?
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.560]  We're going to have more of these highlights in the hour, but I got to get to the man himself,
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560]  Mike Lindell.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.520]  Wow, incredible time to be alive.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520]  We only have four minutes to break.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  We'll come back.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520]  You'll have the floor.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.120]  But just a snapshot to hear the guy, literally at the heart of the fight against these people.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.040]  What is really going on, Mike Lindell?
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.400]  Well, what they're doing is the same thing that they did in the 2020 election and in
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.080]  the primaries, by the way.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.880]  What they do is they pull, that's what we told everybody to vote same day and don't
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.000]  vote early or with the mail and all this stuff.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.560]  They're just pulling names.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:00.840]  The computer just pulls names and you get these injections of votes.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:09.400]  So let's say, let's use the odds, the odds raise, you know, with Federman, they did 590,000
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400]  vote injections.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.720]  So as soon as it gets close, boom, boom.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:19.000]  Now once it's the day of votes, like we're seeing down in Arizona right now, all these
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.040]  day of votes come in and those votes aren't as corrupted or might not be at all.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.120]  But this is what's happening and we have to get rid of the machines.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.000]  And this time, though, the miracle, everybody, I want to tell everyone, the miracle is that
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.680]  when I woke up on election day, I'm going, I'm hearing from 32 states, remember, I have
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:46.120]  people in 50 states, Alex, and all 50 states, we have a massive amount of people on the
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:53.120]  ground and it was reported in 32 of the states, machine malfunctioning, just like Arizona,
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:58.720]  which made national news and international news that they weren't even accepting ballots.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]  People were getting there.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.520]  They're going, oh, you've already voted.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.560]  You pull out your little mail-in ballots and no, I haven't.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.680]  They called their sheriff's departments.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.360]  So right away, the awareness that was made around the world about these machines was
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.280]  like, that was like a divine intervention.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.800]  That was a gift from God.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.080]  And then now we're seeing what goes on inside the machines.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.120]  And we overrun the algorithms, I believe, so far in at least nine races, but obviously
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.280]  we have all the evidence now of all the ones they stole.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.600]  They decimated Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.880]  They just took it all.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.800]  They weren't even shy about it this time around.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.880]  What's incredible is even Tucker Carlson that hasn't really looked at the fraud, now he
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.240]  agrees with you and says they clearly stole it.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:49.760]  So congratulations, nobody deserves more credit than you and your supporters and our supporters
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.560]  because Mike, you've been through hell and you're a winner.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.440]  You don't complain about it, but buddy, you've been right about the FBI.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  You've been attacked.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440]  You've been de-platformed.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.480]  You have been sabotaged, but you seem stronger for it.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.080]  Well, you know, it's my faith in God and I'll tell you, Alex, we don't want to be Venezuela
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.800]  and we got a perfect example right before this election and what they did to Brazil.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.840]  5.1 million votes were stole from that great president, Barcelona, and you've seen all
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.440]  the millions of people out there going, this can't be, this can't be.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440]  But you know what?
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.840]  The mainstream media didn't even cover that.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840]  So you are right.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:32.720]  I'm so happy right now that Tucker and other news outlets actually started covering this.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.240]  If they start covering the real time crime and start covering these things, we're going
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.040]  to get, we're going to get there a lot faster to this beautiful place we're going than ever,
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.600]  than ever, than we could ever think that we'd get there that fast.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.600]  All right.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.320]  Mike Lindell, Mike Lindell, truly the man in the arena, I'm going to come back and give
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:54.880]  you the floor to get into everything because you are again, absolutely on target.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:02.720]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:09.600]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:15.160]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:38.240]  and post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.040]  care.

[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:03.560]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:09.240]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.840]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.240]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:23.280]  all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.600]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.840]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:33.840]  it changes the world.

[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:03.120]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.480]  you.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.360]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence infowars because they rightly see
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.480]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people not as of America but
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:18.280]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.800]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:05.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:14.720]  I think what Mike Lindell said earlier in the last segment of Alex Jones show is so
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.720]  central.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.440]  We hadn't had all the poll watchers and we hadn't had the massive resistance exposing
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.480]  the fraud, it would have been far worse and we wouldn't even have a shot at the house
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.840]  or the senate.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.800]  But we're on the march, the vote stealers and their crime spikes are on the run and
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.560]  so Mike you are the encyclopedia on this, I'm going to try for the rest of the hour
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.520]  to give you the floor to just go through what happened, what's happening currently, what
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.640]  you see coming next and how we're going to peacefully expose this.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.280]  Well we have breaking news just on break here, I got a text from our lawyers.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.040]  I don't know if everybody knew out there but there was a company CEO called Koenig
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.680]  out of Michigan that got charged with probably the biggest lord of data breach in United
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:06.360]  States history which was during in our elections and this is out of China everybody which I've
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.200]  been saying all along that the CCP combined with the unit party, the globalists and the
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.800]  deep state, this is the attack, this is who's attacking our country, the democrat party
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.800]  just loves to join on in.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:24.880]  Now let me tell you, they just dropped the charges against Koenig, they're against the
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.560]  CEO, it's disgusting.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.560]  Now you think that China isn't involved in our government, it's absolutely disgusting
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:39.080]  with what they just happened and it says that their office, they took out a press release
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:44.120]  saying they didn't rely on true to votes data but they did their own investigation.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:50.240]  Lie, remember they put the true to vote, Catherine and Greg in jail, they put them in jail for
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.360]  almost a what a week, this is what's important to add, you're getting swapped in, people
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.200]  are being thrown in jail as you're exposing this and being vindicated, that's what people
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.160]  need to be praying for you and everybody that's supporting what you're doing including
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.840]  info wars because folks you want us to fight, we're doing it, continue.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.760]  You guys are awesome everybody with your support, so this is what we're up against but I will
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.120]  tell you some other lawsuits, there's over 45 lawsuits going on in this country right
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.760]  now that we're fighting for in every state and we're adding to it today, we have one
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:29.880]  in Arizona, I'll give you Arizona here, we appealed, we just appealed to deny, remember
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.480]  they denied Cochise County in Arizona, they told him they couldn't hand count the election,
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:40.360]  what night, why, why would you come in there and say and get a ruling from a corrupt judge
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.840]  or something, I don't know, he ruled that you can't do a hand count, well we appealed
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:50.200]  that to the Arizona Supreme Court, we'll see what comes of that, over in Wisconsin, let's
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.320]  move over to Wisconsin, there you won't believe, you won't even believe this one, this is the
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:03.560]  complaint that's filed against the WEC, the Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission, okay,
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:11.520]  the Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission and there's been two-way communication between
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:18.280]  tabulators that goes out to an unofficial address, it's called WISCNET.NET, it goes
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:26.040]  to this foundation called WISCNET WISN or WISCNET.NET and all of our stuff, all the
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.320]  Wisconsin elections and our stuff across the country is going to these guys, then it goes
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.800]  out from there all over the place, so we've put a complaint in there, a lawsuit in there,
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.440]  get to the bottom of it and just want everybody to know there's hope everywhere, you know,
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.640]  and now that we're going to get the house, I believe we'll get the house and the Senate,
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.760]  I believe right now, you got the stuff going on which I can tell you about in a minute
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:54.360]  and an update on that, but to slow the destruction of our country, but in the meantime, the big
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.960]  smoking gun is getting rid of these electronic computers and voting machines, we have to
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:05.920]  get down to elections, not selections and we've got, there's just so much hope out there,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:13.200]  but I know if you're in Michigan or you woke up your Michigan, Colorado, Pennsylvania,
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.080]  so many of them have lost hope now, Alex, because they were just decimated by the stolen
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:23.240]  election, by these elections that were stolen, but let me tell you, I'll give an example,
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:30.740]  our cyber guys were watching, do you know in Pennsylvania and with Georgia, the same
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:38.160]  attacks, some of the same IP addresses that did this in 2020 and in a couple of the primaries
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:44.600]  came from the same place, so we're getting deeper and deeper into that and there's just
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:52.080]  so much hope in this country right now, I'm happy, I want to say this to everybody too,
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.080]  everybody goes, well, Mike, we didn't get the red wave we wanted, you guys, that's a
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.720]  miracle we didn't get that, we are so blessed that we didn't get that and here's why, if
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.120]  we'd have got this big red wave, if I'd have been there markers, I'd have said, don't do
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:13.320]  anything stupid with the machines, let's let this go and we can take the country later,
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.880]  they're on to us, if it had been a big red wave, do you know what they would have said
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:21.520]  to people like me, they would have said, Mike, it's okay to have all these mail-in ballots
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.200]  from the China virus and all this garbage, two months of early voting like my home state
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:31.960]  of Minnesota, Mike, it's all okay, the machines, look at the Republicans won, this isn't about
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:38.560]  that, everybody, the Uniparty was there, the CCP, this is what was taking our country,
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.400]  50 over 50 countries have been taken by the machines, there's my own governor's race,
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:51.280]  look at this, this is, he lives in my hometown, Scott Jensen, he right out of the gate, they
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.680]  just dumped it on waltz, they gave him a quarter million votes, extra votes, here you
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.560]  go waltz, and look at that, all the way up, I mean, it's disgusting, they stole it, you
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.560]  know, and this went on across our country, this is machine manipulation, everybody,
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:13.120]  in computers, we cannot have computers, we're the apex in history, we get one chance, one
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:21.840]  chance for our freedoms to be back and to save our country, I want to tell, and look
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.240]  at this, look at here in Michigan, this is when I went to bed on election night, two
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.240]  in the morning, this happened at one, or about 12.58, it might have been a little after one
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:37.640]  o'clock in the morning, the traditional Michigan dump, look what they gave to Nessel, they
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:44.240]  gave Nessel, I think it was 200,000 or more than that, votes, and just took Matt to Pernod's
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.600]  dream, and everyone's dream, boom, gone, that's the attorney general of Michigan, everybody,
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.680]  they stole it in real time, Mike, the graph says it gave him 300,000 plus votes, 300,000
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:03.120]  plus votes, instantly, instantly, you guys, this came down, and let me tell you, let's
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.840]  just, I'm going to tell you how similar it was to the 2020 election in Michigan, when
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.240]  they stopped everything, and by the way, isn't it weird that they stopped everything in 2020,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.520]  all the states at the same time, you think there's not some communication there, shorter
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.960]  now we got a problem, Donald Trump's going to win all these states anyway, because he's
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.600]  overrunning the algorithms, well let me tell you, in Michigan, when 106,000 votes came
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:34.800]  down for Biden at 2 in the morning in Michigan, and 3,000 for Donald Trump, and everyone said
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:42.600]  to us, the big lie was, well, those darn inner city, those darn votes from the Democrats
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:50.160]  all voted for those mail-in votes, those darn mail-in votes, well let me tell you, if Fox
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.800]  News or any other news outlet that we had, at that time, had grown to trust, if they
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.760]  had got on there and said, hey everybody, the mail-in votes in Michigan were counted
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.400]  on the morning of the 3rd, not in the middle of the night on the 4th, everyone had said,
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.520]  well then where'd they come from, I'll tell you where they came from, a big white band
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:18.480]  that pulled in and 3 fobs and a download of 106,000 votes for Biden, so this went on again,
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.680]  everyone needs to understand, the same input's going to give you the same output, we were
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.320]  getting boil-like frogs for two decades, the Democrats even warned against these machines,
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:34.240]  but now that they're on the right side of a fixed game, they don't care, there it is
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.320]  in Michigan, it brings back memories, all the memories, there they come, here let's
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.920]  drop 106,000 votes for Biden in the middle of the night, which brings up another point,
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.920]  remember Donald Trump-
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.480]  Mike Lindell, stay there, you'll have the floor, you're on fire, when we come back on
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:29:00.360]  the other side of this break, we'll continue to run the entire field here.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:07.840]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now, they are attacking and suing and censoring
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.520]  and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.040]  and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide, and their number one most hated enemy in
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:24.800]  the media is InfoWars, because we know the globalist number, we know their operation,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.640]  we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.480]  Again, thanks for your support, it's a critical fight, visit infowarstore.com right now.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:01.280]  Think about a world without info wars.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.620]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.920]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:16.040]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:23.520]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.040]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.800]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.280]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:43.320]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.040]  it isn't going to give up, without your support we can be shut down.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:58.040]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.240]  Our jobs have been shipped overseas, we've been deindustrialized, they've cut our power
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.000]  supplies off to bank reprisons and get us under control, we're trying to pay Americans
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  not to work.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.160]  And if you read different documents that came out from the Clinton Library, National Library
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.600]  a few years ago when World End Daily soon got the documents, when they first got into
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.240]  office in 93 they were obsessed with killing the US economy to control Americans and to
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.080]  kill any populist or conservative media that could create its own ecosystem.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.520]  That's why info wars is so precious.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.280]  And Mike Lindell is just a great entrepreneur and a made America patriot that solved problems
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:00.720]  and literally just solved the history that was taking place and stood up for everybody.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.960]  That's why it's so critical understand to fight a war takes money.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.640]  So if you just donated to myself or Mike Lindell and we're fighting hard that's a good thing
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:14.160]  but with Mike you get the great products made in America, it's employees in America and
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.720]  then he's a fearless fighter and he's a sponsor of info wars a win-win.

[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.960]  Yep, absolutely and I'm going to tell everybody the, I'm going to give everybody a little
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.200]  hope here too, I was down in Florida and when I was there for the Hurricanes we were giving
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:22.320]  out pillows and blankets, my pillows and we went into this Hispanic community, they
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.440]  had lost everything, they're piled up, all their physical stuff piled up like cordwood
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.600]  and it's gone and we, a lot of them we had to have an interpreter and you know what they
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.920]  were saying, almost unanimously, all of them were saying, Mike, is there the stuff going
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.000]  out of this country, can we, is there hope, is there hope?
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.800]  They were worried about our future Alex, their freedoms that they have here, they had just
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.080]  lost everything physical but you know they're not going to get those physical things back
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.640]  if we lose all our freedoms, it's over and that's what we've been fighting for and that's
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.120]  what we, we are winning everybody and I want to tell everybody just to give a couple updates
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.560]  here, you've got going down in Arizona right now, everyone says are we going to get the
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560]  Senate?
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.760]  I believe we are, we've got Kerry Lake, Blake and Mark Fincham, they're all, they're counting
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.880]  the same day votes now, Kerry Lake's only down by 13,000, she was down by a quarter
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.360]  million when they were doing the cheating ones that all the mail-in and other early
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:27.800]  voting and they're overtaking the algorithms, everybody, they are overtaking the algorithms,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.560]  all three of them I believe and when Kerry for sure, 100%
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.800]  That's key, for folks that don't know what overpowering the algorithm means is, a giant
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:40.800]  red wave, they can't stop it completely, explain what overpowering or overtaking the algorithm
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  means.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.880]  Right, so the computer, when you have the computers, you have a, when you're using computers
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:52.160]  and you set them, you set them to steal, so let's say, just like our great president,
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.960]  real president Donald Trump in 2020, they have these set, you have to have a base to
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.200]  begin with, you have to, you know, kind of do a prediction of what you think it will
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.880]  be of how many votes will come in on the day of and now you're taking, you can't make it
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.280]  look so obvious, you know, you can't make it look obvious, otherwise they will go, hey,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.080]  there's a problem here, and, but when they do that, so they can only steal so much from
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:23.440]  a, like from a Kerry Lake, like down there in Arizona, and I'll give you a perfect example
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.320]  where the primaries were Kerry Lake, we told everybody to vote day of, Kerry Lake, remember
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.400]  she was down by 10%, 11 o'clock at night, then they started counting the day of votes
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.280]  in the primary, remember this was months ago, and she caught up and she was only down by
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.920]  12, or up, then she was up by 12,000 votes, so what did Maricopa County do, they put the,
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.160]  they stopped the machine, stopped the counting, put the covers over the windows, put the fence
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.240]  up again, and we waited three days until they find there's nothing they could do because
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:59.360]  there was a 90,000 votes left, and the same day was coming in 75 Kerry, 25 the opponent,
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.160]  so they had to give it to Kerry, it's identical to what's going on right now, there's about
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:11.640]  400,000 votes left, and Kerry Lake's only down by 13, all the votes coming in for Blake,
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:18.880]  Mark and Kerry are coming in at a 80%, 80-20 clip, so they're all going to, I believe they're
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.400]  all going to win, Kerry's going to win for sure, and this is going on in other races
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:29.560]  too, in Nevada, Jim Arshad, the other, the other senator that's there that's running
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:34.520]  for Senate, I can't think of the name right now, I got a mind block, but he, he's going
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.520]  to probably win, that gives us the Senate, control the Senate, and if it does, if just
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.120]  one of them, when if just Blake comes in, then we got to go and Herschel Walker for
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.640]  that runoff, which Herschel won going away, but they, they stole it, made it a runoff,
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:55.960]  and then also Lauren Boeber in, in Colorado, she's only down by 30 votes now, and so what
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.840]  I mean everybody, these are the real, the real votes coming in, the day of votes, so
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:06.960]  they overtook, they beat the machine steal, so to speak, whatever they set, okay, it's
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.200]  pretty hard for them to do dumps, you know, and yeah, we got to pray that Lauren, because
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:17.280]  she would be the bright spot of Colorado, they took everything in Colorado, everybody,
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.280]  they stole it all.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  Yeah, that just means she had such a landslide, she beat the algorithm if she wins, in fact,
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:26.360]  I've been watching today, she's been in the lead off and on, so this is, this is like
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.960]  a buying those horse race right now.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:35.120]  Right, right, it's kind of like, I mean, if they, and by the way, I'm going to tell
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:40.200]  everybody this too, realize the candidates, the ones that they do, that they have taken,
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:44.000]  there's a lot of, most of them out there aren't going to concede, we're going to go, they
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.440]  have more rights you think than to do audits, and they won't be able to kick them out for
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.520]  standing.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.120]  So I believe what's going to happen, Alex, we're going to get the House of Senate, I
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.680]  believe, control, and that'll slow the destruction.
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.800]  And we're going to get this country back by the judges, everybody.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.840]  We've got so many sheriffs out there, they're going to be bringing this all the evidence
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.840]  of what happened in this, in this election, to the, to the judges and cases and court cases.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.520]  Remember, no judge in the United States has looked at any evidence from 2020, or for that
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.760]  matter, any of these elections, even in the primaries, because they kick the can on something
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.760]  called standing.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:24.040]  It's just an easy way for a judge to say, I don't want to see that.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.920]  Well, we've got to pray for our judges.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.080]  If you know a judge out there, and you, and you're a family, or you're a friend of a,
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.800]  as a judge, just encourage them to say, just have courage to be the judge that God put
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.800]  you here to be.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.800]  Be a judge.
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.800]  It is an example.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:41.440]  It's like the district attorney, Frank Gearsson, exposed the whole Kennedy thing, because one
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.280]  district attorney did the right thing, that's why Soros has been trying to buy him off.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.600]  They come back, what's coming next, other big developments, your deep research from
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:59.120]  two years ago.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.200]  I'm pointing my finger at you, and I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:08.600]  You forget to take your multivitamins, you forget to take your vitamin D3, you forget
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.080]  to take your brain force plus, you forget to take DNA force plus, you forget to take
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.840]  the X3, and you know it makes your life better, and you know it makes you healthier, and you
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:20.560]  constantly forget, and when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.080]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.640]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:02.600]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:08.920]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.920]  world.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.680]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.680]  deserve the credit.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.600]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support in info wars are the real
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:23.160]  reason we've had this success.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.880]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war we've ever
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.880]  had.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:35.320]  We're now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.280]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight, and to continue in the
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.120]  efforts you've been carrying out, and to intensify it.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.120]  God bless you all.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.120]  I salute you.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.120]  I thank you.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.120]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target, and this
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]  grief is happening.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.120]  The fight is my fight.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.120]  It's your fight.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.120]  It's our fight.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.480]  God bless you all.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.360]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:07.720]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.800]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.640]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.760]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.280]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:21.400]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.360]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.680]  it without your support.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.840]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.320]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.640]  because of your past support.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.400]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.880]  three double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:48.880]  on air.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.880]  1776 is the promo code.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:58.640]  The destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:05.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:13.240]  Yeah, okay, so with that being said, with the exposure, once that's lifted, now you're
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.320]  going to, this should get rid of all the lawfare.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.800]  It'll get rid of the lawfare, it'll get rid of this.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.560]  Before lawfare has not been used in our country since 1798, it's horrible what they did.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.960]  And who started that?
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.200]  Smartmatic did.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:33.960]  When Smartmatic sued Fox News on February 4th of 2021, our voices got silent because
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:39.480]  they Fox One talk, nobody will have anybody on to talk about the election crime, including
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.600]  2,000 meals, and that wasn't even machines.
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.000]  So you have, you've got your newsmaxes of the world, your Foxes of the world, they can't
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.920]  talk about election crime, or machines, or anything like that, it's disgusting.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:58.280]  And then, so they, they either afraid of being sued, well, once you sue Fox News, everybody
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.760]  was afraid, right?
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:06.120]  And, which, that's a whole other story about Fox News, but, but anyway, so this lawfare,
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:10.920]  now when with, and all these lawsuits, remember, these machine companies, the one of them rhymes
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.480]  with the word dominion, they've sued over 200 people or sent them threatening letters.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.960]  A lot of these citizens had to go get home security system, these were like mafia letters
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:21.960]  sent to them.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.520]  Well, these citizens, like in, nobody hears about in Michigan, like these citizens did
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:31.360]  a class action lawsuit against dominion, with Alan Dershowitz and one of the lawyers, and
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.120]  going, hey, this is wrong, you can't do this.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.280]  We did nothing wrong, nobody's did anything wrong.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.880]  We're speaking out against something that everybody's seen and knows.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.120]  And so what's happening, Mike Lindell, because even last week before the election, Politico
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.200]  and a bunch of others wrote articles admitting machines are hackable and are being hacked
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.400]  and saying everything you said, everything I've been reporting for 28 years.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.120]  I mean, so, so, so, so, well, yeah, we're totally, totally vindicated.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.480]  You guys, I did, I was down at, I was down at a Senate hearing or hearing down in Louisiana
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.400]  a couple months ago, and all the machine companies were there.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.920]  Well, here's the ESNS, they're one of the biggest ones in the country, if not the biggest
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:13.680]  out of Omaha, Nebraska, one of their owners was there and he comes up and he goes, the
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:20.200]  great Secretary of State, Kyle Ardnwin, asked him straight out, he said, are your machines
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.520]  hackable and vulnerable, and he at least he didn't lie.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:29.640]  He said, yes, they are, but all machines are, all voting machines are, end quote.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.120]  And then with these guys, with these guys, they tried to paint themselves that they're
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:40.520]  not Dominion and Smartmatic, we're the hometown boys from, from Omaha, Nebraska, but our parts
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:46.320]  are made in China, our software, it's all the same software, it's all corruption.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.320]  And then Alex, you'll like this, so they let me talk for 24 minutes.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.400]  And the one guy on the, on the, up there at the committee, she says, Mr. Lindell, in
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.640]  our, in our, in our state here, we'd rather not use paper to save the trees and stuff.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.080]  I said, I said, well, ma'am, we're going to recycle too.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:10.000]  We're going to take these machines, melt them down and turn them into prison bars, end quote.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  End quote.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  I love it.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.800]  I want to bring Owen Troyer here and hit a bunch of other key points you've got.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.600]  We're very blessed to have you for the full hour.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.480]  Owen Troyer has been our election expert here, been following your work, and he's had a few
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480]  questions and comments.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.760]  Owen Troyer on the air with Mike Lindell.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:29.160]  Yeah, Mike, you're doing such great work monitoring all of these races and all the trends going
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160]  on across the country.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.440]  It's really an amazing team you've assembled, but I'm curious, what are you noticing in
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  these inner cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, where Democrats
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:45.160]  are getting 70, 80, sometimes 90% of the vote?
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.680]  What do you think the story there is?
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.320]  I mean, are Democrats really that popular in the cities they destroyed?
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.880]  Or is your team noticing maybe some shenanigans that are getting these huge numbers for Democrats
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.560]  that end up in Senate races overwhelming the state's desires?
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.560]  Right.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.840]  Well, you're, all you have to do is just look at, look at Florida.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.840]  Like I said earlier in the show, Florida, they put in stuff there to at least, at least
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.400]  slow the steel to a crawl.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:16.840]  And you just had a governor there, I mean, and get a, a Wendee County, which hadn't been
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:18.720]  won in decades, I guess.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:23.680]  So if you look at, that's what it really would be like without machine manipulation or somewhat,
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:26.880]  because remember, they still have a machine, but they put things in place where they couldn't
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.920]  pull names.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:31.840]  So when you talk what you're saying there, no, they're just blatantly because, oh, it's
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.480]  inner city, they've completed the propaganda to the people is all they're all going to
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.480]  vote Democrat.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:42.720]  No, I was out in, I was out in California for a week about two months ago, and you could
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  all look it up.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.760]  Mike Lindell, California, and I was in a town.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:51.960]  They were all very Democrat and liberal and, and the average age was probably 30, but they
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.360]  all came up to me.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:57.800]  All of them were friendly and they were concerned their gas was $7 and 30 cents.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.640]  They weren't going to vote Democrat anymore.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.280]  By the way, Mike, that's what I've seen where I live with liberals that are awake now.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:07.880]  That's what the scene and exit polls predicted a mass Republican victory, because 70 plus
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.200]  percent of Democrats said, we blame Biden, we're going to vote Republican.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.920]  But the exit polls that now are completely wrong, though, historically, they've all always
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:16.920]  been extremely accurate.
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:22.040]  So I think it's clear, big city, deep blue, Democrat cities, Chicago's famous for it on
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.640]  record, you know, stealing it back down the sixties, they are engaged in massive fraud
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:32.920]  there, and I think they're just overdoing it in those areas to get up the overall averages
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:38.240]  for the rest of the state in these statewide congressional and presidential elections.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.240]  What do you think?
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.240]  Well, absolutely.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.080]  It's been ever the public, remember, when they use these computers and stuff, they don't
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.320]  want to make a deviation seem to do out of hand.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.440]  Well, if you got the public convinced that everybody loves the inner city, they're all
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.360]  going to vote Democrat, that's a big lie.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.200]  That is the big lie.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:03.680]  Remember in the 2020 election, the most votes sold against Donald Trump was California,
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.680]  minimum 1.5 million.
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:11.800]  Second most in the country was Texas at 1 million, and third was Florida at 950,000.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:16.520]  So what they did in the read and you say, well, why would they take from a from a Republican
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.600]  state like Alabama or Ohio?
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:22.320]  Well, here's why if I I'll give everybody an example.
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:27.800]  Let's say I told you that in my home state of Minnesota that Donald Trump won 2 million
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.240]  to Biden's 100,000.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.320]  Everyone would say, that's a computer error.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.160]  There's something wrong.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:40.880]  So wait, you have to make it look, you have to boil the whole ocean, so to speak.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:46.080]  So you can look at those inner cities and say, we can take more there because people will
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.200]  believe it's all Democrat.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:54.600]  Or you can go to Republican area and say, it's so overwhelming, 80% is going to be Republican.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.600]  That you go, hey, we can take 10% off the top there.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.880]  It's like skimming.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.960]  If you had a massive casino or something, you're skimming off the top.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.960]  Perfectly said.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:04.960]  Just one thing.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.960]  Perfectly said.
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.440]  I want another question.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:12.120]  Well, Mike, we were all concerned in Nevada that it was going to be Clark County, that's
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:16.240]  Las Vegas, where the Democrats are going to be up to shenanigans and tricks, and maybe
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.280]  that's how they were going to try to pull off an election victory in the Senate.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:25.080]  But we've been watching Clark County, and it really hasn't seemed too anomalous as
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.480]  far as the numbers coming in.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.720]  But then overnight, it was Reno.
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:35.920]  It was Washaw County that magically 60% of all the recent ballot dumps are coming in
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.920]  for the Democrat, Mostau, where it used to be 60% for Laxalt.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.120]  Are you guys watching Washaw County, Nevada right now?
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.720]  Are you guys seeing these anomalies?
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.840]  Do you think that's where they're going to try to steal this Senate seat?
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:56.960]  Well, I have not talked to him about Nevada, but I will say this.
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:01.400]  I think you need to look more of what votes are they counting.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.280]  I believe they counted all the early votes.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:10.760]  Remember, I said that's where most of the steal goes in these early voting before the
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:12.640]  same voting.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.840]  So if they're counting in Nevada, I don't care if it's Clark County, Reno, wherever
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:23.240]  it is, if those people voted day of, I believe that you're going to have a big win in the
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  Senate there.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.240]  All right.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.240]  I'll enjoy your great questions.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.240]  Thank you so much.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:31.480]  We'll be hosting the War Room, 3 p.m. Central today, coming up in a few hours.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.960]  Mike, we're almost out of time.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.880]  Thank you for so much time in 60 seconds.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.840]  Closing comments or any other key things you'd like to add?
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  Yeah.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.480]  I would just like to tell everyone.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:42.720]  We are in it.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:47.640]  It's absolutely awesome that the way things are just laid out here from these little mini
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.640]  miracles.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.320]  We had, remember, we had all these machine problems called malfunctioning across our
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:56.960]  whole country, which made national and international news.
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:00.400]  That's huge for what we have to do in the future to get rid of them.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.000]  And then we had, we got the House, we're going to get the Senate.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.280]  I believe we're going to get that.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:10.400]  And then you're going to see Kerry Lake and all them, Kerry Lake and Mark Fincham, win
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.960]  in Arizona.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:12.960]  That's the gateway.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.520]  That'll be the prototype.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:18.480]  The first thing they're going to do is say, we got these machines got to go and then it'll
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.480]  spread across our country.
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.800]  We're going to look back and we're going to say, when we get to this great place we're
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.440]  going, God had his hand in all of this.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  And if you look back, everything had to happen just the way it did.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:36.320]  And with everybody having patience, because even the bad stuff is making people pour into
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.320]  the nonsense.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.320]  Exactly.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.120]  And as long as we don't give up, they lose and over time, we're out of the boiling frog
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:43.120]  pot.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  We're awake now.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.120]  Now we know we're under attack.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:46.120]  We're getting stronger every day.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.480]  The longer we continue to fight.

[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.560]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:05.080]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.080]  It's came over.
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:11.080]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.

[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:59.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:14.400]  All right, Alan Schreuer is always kicking ass, host of War Room 36B of Central.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.080]  He's got a lot of other breaking news and points to make.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.280]  He's hosting us five minutes and I'm coming back and I'm opening the phones up for the
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.280]  balance of the hour.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.280]  Alan Schreuer.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:29.360]  So ladies and gentlemen, here's where we're at as far as the Senate is concerned.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:33.160]  Republicans have to win either Nevada or Arizona.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.360]  Otherwise, the runoff in Georgia is really going to be for Senate.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.400]  And a 50-50 split really gives Democrat a role.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.960]  You do have Joe Manchin who's kind of a stopgap.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.960]  I think he'll be overwhelmed.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.680]  And so Republicans need either Arizona or Nevada.
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:53.320]  Now if they get both, that's huge.
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.720]  Now you're not just a clear majority.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:59.600]  You even got a chance for 52 with that Georgia runoff that's certainly going to be a blood
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.600]  bath.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:02.520]  But I'll be covering more of that coming up later.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.560]  But when we focus on Arizona, the shenanigans are going to be in question.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.560]  What happened in Maricopa County?
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:13.200]  The machines are going to be in question.
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.480]  Masters in Lake are both still extremely confident.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:19.520]  I do think Lake will overcome and eventually be declared the winner.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:24.440]  But remember, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's running against her, is the one in charge
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.960]  of counting the ballots.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.280]  What did I believe was Stalin say?
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.760]  It's not how the ballots are counted.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.600]  It's who's counting them.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.800]  So very suspicious there for Arizona.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:39.520]  The good news is, no matter what happens, I think the Republicans there are fighters.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.800]  I don't think they're going to let a loss go easily.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:44.080]  I think they'll be audits.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.720]  I think there'll be lawsuits.
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.840]  And I think that the Arizona conservative, populist, Republican movement has the spine,
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.640]  has the backbone, has the will to try to save that state from the corruption.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.360]  Now, we jump up to Nevada.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.720]  This is the big developing story now.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:11.400]  Reno, Lashaw County, where the new ballot dumps coming in are going 60% Democrat.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:16.840]  All the last, you know, I guess we're on day three election, election day three.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:20.840]  What am I going to be up here day 40 with a long beard and gray hair?
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.000]  Election day three.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:28.040]  So now on election day three, all of a sudden the trend in Washaw County here is Democrat
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:33.360]  and Mastow, who's been losing the entire race, has now overcome and has more votes than
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.440]  Laxalt in Washaw County.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:39.160]  We thought it was going to be Clark County down here in Las Vegas, where we were going
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.560]  to have to watch out for some shenanigans.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.240]  Looks like it might be Reno, looks like it might be Washaw County.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.880]  So we'll be watching that closely as the votes slowly, slowly start to trickle in.
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:55.640]  I do still believe that Laxalt will win this state, but I think they're going to make it
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.800]  interesting depending on how desperate and committed they are.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.400]  They're either going to keep counting ballots in Washaw County till the Democrat is ahead
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.960]  or eventually they're just going to say, okay, this is enough.
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.960]  It's time to call it for Laxalt.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.560]  So that should be determined by the weekend.
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:18.960]  I think we'll have an idea or a conclusion on Nevada by the end of the weekend.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.840]  Now a couple of the races that we're watching right now, obviously Lauren Boebert, I do think
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:27.400]  that she's going to save that seat of hers in the house.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.040]  In fact, the latest numbers, okay, I don't think we have any new numbers.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:36.320]  Boebert literally up by about 400 votes.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.760]  Wow.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.280]  Now people are saying that's hard to believe.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.360]  I can understand why some people might not like Lauren Boebert, but this is a very conservative
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:51.920]  area and for the Democrat there to be making it close with an incumbent who's pretty popular,
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.880]  Lauren Boebert is interesting.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.400]  But nonetheless, if she takes it, I don't think there will be any questions asked.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400]  They'll take that seat.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.280]  And then, you know, I just want to quickly, let's go over to the speaker of the house.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  Shall we?
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.200]  Let's look at Nancy Pelosi.
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.440]  She's about to lose the gavel, thank God, but you know, Nancy Pelosi must be pretty
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.800]  popular guys because she is dominating her district.
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.840]  So I guess the people, it's easier if you go over here guys and just scroll down, it'll
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:22.640]  be easier to find it because her district is so small.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.680]  So the people of San Francisco love Nancy Pelosi so much.
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.920]  I believe she got, yes, there it is, 81% of the vote.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:38.800]  They just love Nancy Pelosi for 70 years, for 70 years, Nancy Pelosi in the district,
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.280]  11th district of California, San Francisco.
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  And you look at what's happened in those 70 years that Pelosi has been in office, obviously
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.440]  great things have happened to San Francisco.
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:54.760]  The defecation on the street, the homelessness, the poverty, the crime, way to go San Francisco,
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:05:00.400]  good job.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:04.760]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:10.920]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:16.440]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:22.800]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:27.520]  number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.720]  down peacefully.

[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.720]  Atlantis blew up.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:42.360]  What do you believe and what Plato wrote about and said was real, they found almost everything
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:48.880]  else he said was real, he was a historian, not just a father of philosophy, that Atlantis
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.880]  was real.
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:54.600]  Whether or not we are at that Atlantean moment with God-like power but not a God-like brain
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:59.720]  or soul on the verge of destroying ourselves.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.600]  I want to play a clip here, take on this, I'm going to let him get ready for his own,
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.280]  show the war in the three p.m. central, I'm going to open the phones up and take your
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:11.840]  calls on the election, that one topic, first time callers, you don't screen calls, I do
[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:12.840]  it on air.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.200]  Sometimes I say, usually it's a free-for-all, 90% of the time, but 10% of the time I say,
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:18.880]  I want you on this one topic, humor me.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.000]  That's a big deal, what do you think, what did you with this, what did you see, toll-free
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:35.360]  number to join us, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, first time callers, 877-789-2539,
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:41.280]  but we've got this clip and it wasn't just MSNBC, it was CNN, it's everywhere like Beto,
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:48.440]  they picked the weirdest, fakest people and make them into celebrities and the Democrats
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:53.720]  are such a horrible field, their best is Gavin Newsom, literally looks more like American
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:59.520]  Psycho and acts like more than American Psycho than Christian Bale in that seminal film.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:03.880]  And so now they're saying, oh, he's so wonderful like Abinadi, oh, he's going to run for president,
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:09.920]  oh, oh God, Federman, oh, Federman, oh, we love him, and I feel sorry for Federman, he's
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:16.480]  this big demonic, evil mutant who literally can't talk and that's the perfect thing,
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:20.720]  I guess for the fourth administration of Biden with election fraud is a sick joke, we'll
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:27.520]  have Federman like, hey, hold on, I have brain chip, what I do, Obama, Obama say I take a
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:34.400]  gun, I felt her man there, I am felt him there, I died, mom beat up, what do you take, are
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.280]  you not, I mean, here's the clip.
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:46.320]  Federman as a nominee at some point for president, I know there's some variables obviously, but
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:54.520]  I just, you know, what he did in the super red, deep red parts of Pennsylvania and the
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.600]  way that he ran ahead of Biden as you were saying, ran ahead of Trump, I mean, it just
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:02.160]  makes, it makes you wonder about his future.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:06.200]  And they go on to talk about him for president, I've got all the articles right here, the
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:11.960]  Democrats already floating the idea of a Federman presidential run red state, oh, and I see
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:17.400]  you laughing, but I mean, I guess the electronic voting machines could elect a tomato or a
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.440]  potato here and be better than this guy.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.560]  Oh, I'm sorry, Alex, I'm not prepared.
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.360]  I've probably seen that clip, I'm not even kidding, I have tears of laughter.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:32.040]  I've probably seen that clip at least 20 times and it still gets me every time, Alex, because
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.560]  Katie Turr sitting at the desk, you notice she's got this smug arrogant, like she chess
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.200]  our cat, like she thinks she's got the greatest idea ever, and she crosses her arms and leans
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:46.200]  back in the chair like, well, you know, I'll be the first to suggest Federman for president.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:50.960]  It reminds me of that guy's pull up skelter saying that Avenatti's gonna be the next
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  president.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:52.960]  I mean, it's that ridiculous.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.280]  Yeah, I think he might be in jail right now.
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.520]  I don't know what happened to Avenatti.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:58.520]  He's on the map.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:09:59.520]  But okay.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.720]  Yeah, Katie Turr arrogantly smug like, oh, like, I think Federman, but did you hear what
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:05.960]  she said?
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:11.120]  She goes, I know there's some variables, some variables, some variables.
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:12.120]  What?
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:13.840]  That he can't think he can't talk.
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.280]  He's mentally deranged and Alice fans wife up there.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:24.160]  Look at her like she's crazy variables, Alex, she says variables.
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.920]  I'd love to know what variables she's talking about.
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:31.040]  You know, most, most people think Federman is not even gonna last, but maybe a couple
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.480]  months and he's just gonna hand the seat down to his wife.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.720]  And if they're acting like he's gonna recover from the stroke, folks, he's already reached
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.000]  the time of full recovery on average.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.400]  He's passed the point of having any more recovery.
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.880]  And so this is Federman now and look, it's sad.
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:52.920]  I mean, you know, he's got a family, whatever it says, this is the trend of vegetable Democrats.
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:57.000]  Why do you think they choose vegetables because they're the perfect puppet?
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.400]  Alex, you know, it's hard to even try to get into the mind of a Democrat and you kind
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:09.360]  of have to go with these prerequisites that everything that they do comes from a psychological
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:14.480]  perspective of they want to gaslight you, they want to pee on you and tell you it's
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:20.480]  raining, they want to give you a crap sandwich and tell you it's filet mignon.
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:24.720]  I mean, so there's just that energy, there's that direction, it's kind of a domination
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.320]  thing over you that they can abuse you, it's kind of an abuser predator tactic.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.400]  And so that's just the Democrat psychology.
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.920]  I mean, even Katie Turr has to admit, oh, I know there's variables.
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:40.400]  What variables, Katie, that you're putting up a mentally ill, a mentally incompetent
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.400]  person?
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.160]  Is that the variable that you're sitting up there talking about?
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.160]  Yeah, we all know it.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:50.440]  But you know, and then they go along and just lie to you, oh, Federman did so well in these
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:51.760]  deep red areas.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:57.240]  See, now what they're trying to do is they, this is how Glenn Young can actually probably
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.240]  do.
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:11:59.240]  It's their psychological operation.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:02.960]  They're not just going to steal traditional Democrat areas where there's a red wave.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.120]  Now we're going to take deep red areas.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:08.520]  But it wasn't even true.
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.240]  That's not even true.
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:13.960]  That's what Republicans need to tap into and realize is the only way they can overwhelm
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:18.840]  the voter fraud in the inner cities is to go out into the deep red areas and get massive
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.840]  voter turnout.
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.040]  That was one of the reasons why Junkin was able to win Virginia and really change the
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:25.480]  state's politics.
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:29.760]  So really, the Republicans need to be heeding that message and they need to be out in the
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.760]  deep red areas.
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.960]  They need to be doubling the total.
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  I'll say this.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.080]  I mean, they clearly stole key areas.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.400]  But a big part of this was like the Q effect.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.240]  OQ, we're all going to win, we're invincible and I knew it was a fraud.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.280]  And then a lot of people just thought Trump was invincible because of the Q thing and didn't
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:46.280]  even vote.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.560]  Even though they stole it from Trump, they couldn't have stole it if it was overpowered
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.560]  the algorithm.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.060]  That's what the science shows.
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:54.060]  It's the same thing.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.760]  If you're going to win, a bunch of conservatives I knew didn't even vote.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.280]  Oh, we're about to totally win.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.880]  And again, the media told you that.
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:02.760]  Stop taking stuff for granted.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:07.200]  Owen Schreuer, 3 p.m. Central of the War Room, you'll be covering the latest developments.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:08.200]  Thank you.
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:09.200]  All right, Alex.
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:10.200]  Thank you.
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  Looking forward to big breaking news at three o'clock.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.960]  All right, here's some big breaking news, an exclusive response to it.
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:21.000]  And I want to go to your phone call, so I don't want to spend a lot of time on this.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:28.160]  But the media spends this constantly, like Jones is laughing at the billion dollar judgment
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:33.760]  in Connecticut, or Jones is laughing at the lawyers requesting 2.57 trillion.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:40.720]  Well, I mean, I'm laughing because I have a couple hundred thousand dollars in my savings
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:46.560]  account and I own a little lake cabin and I got a house.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.720]  I mean, I've never cared about money.
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:51.320]  It's not what I do things for.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:52.320]  I haven't been trying to amass it.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:55.520]  I took all the money I made and built an infrastructure and, you know, media operations
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:56.520]  to challenge the new world order.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:58.000]  That's what I really care about.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.760]  I mean, they said, well, beat the whole new world order and stop all the globalists right
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  now.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:04.080]  We're just going to throw you into a wood shipper.
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.480]  I'd say, well, let's get this going.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.600]  I'd climb into the damn thing and say, pull the trigger because I really care about people.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:13.840]  See, these psychopaths, these sociopaths don't get that, that I'm committed to humanity.
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:14.840]  I came from humans.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.240]  I want humans to keep going on.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.760]  I realized I'm a blip on the radar screen and I'm a collectivist.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:26.480]  I'm an individualist to the max, but it's individual vigor that adds to the collective.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.400]  The collectivist tried to enslave everybody and call a collectivist, but as long as you
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:34.400]  empower everybody, you have competition and out of that competition in the collective,
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:37.640]  we create the superhuman and that's what we're going.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.480]  But as soon as you cut that out, you create the nightmare.
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.960]  So the Nazis and everybody want to suppress and control everybody to create the Uber mention.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.400]  They create the opposite mass death and destruction.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.400]  It's the same thing.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:53.040]  No, empowerment, competition, open free societies, not George Soros is free society.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:58.880]  It's a counterfeit, real libertarian Renaissance ideas is what empowers people.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:01.640]  The problem is that the general public handle that much power.
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:09.440]  So we're going to get to your phone calls, but when we come back, they ask for 2.75 trillion.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.400]  The judge just ruled.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:13.160]  And what do you think she did?
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.040]  And I mean, it's ridiculous, okay?
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:18.080]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.560]  And they put in the filings again, they go, he's laughing at it.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.120]  Well, of course I'm laughing at it.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:27.920]  It'd be like if you sent me a bill for a billion dollars in the mail, oh, man, we got you.
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.560]  It's all for psychological effect.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:30.880]  It's all the wizard of Oz.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.200]  I am the great and powerful Oz, when they know full well with bankruptcy law and all
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.680]  the rest of it, it'll show what I've got and they get that and that's it and I have almost
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.680]  nothing.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:45.800]  So, I mean, I don't want to say I'm having an orgasm right now, but I mean, it's a joke
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:51.080]  because I don't have hardly anything except a giant audience of patriots and liberty and
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:56.120]  freedom and I'm super rich in that area.
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:01.360]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  you.
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.680]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:11.760]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.560]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:24.080]  any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars, despite the massive

[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:06.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:24.160]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide, it's the Alex Jones show, episode 1776, a new hope.
[02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:29.080]  All right, so this will be the big statement, I mean you'll edit it and take it out of context
[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:36.080]  as they do, they already had a 965 million dollar rigged deal where the judge said I
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:39.640]  was guilty and told the jury that I was a bad person and wouldn't let me put on evidence
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:44.680]  and put on fake evidence against me, I don't have two million dollars so it's a joke on
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:47.920]  them and they know that, they got all our discover, they got all our financials and
[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:50.080]  said we didn't give it to them and then did this.
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.920]  Now the judge has issued a ruling, my lawyer just sent it to me 10 minutes ago and it's
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:21:00.480]  already all over the news, Alex Jones ordered to pay 473 million more to Sandy Hook family,
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:13.040]  they asked for 2.75 trillion or 2,750 million, which is ridiculous and then now they want
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:22.280]  oh it's more reasonable only 473 million dollars, if I sold everything I had it's not 5 million
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:27.840]  dollars, 4 million dollars, so that's the camera equipment here and everything, so they're
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:32.520]  doing this so you hear billion dollar numbers, you hear 4 million dollar numbers, you hear
[02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:37.440]  trillion dollar numbers, well he's over, that's not how America works folks, they can't stop
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:41.600]  me from being on air, they can't stop me from broadcasting, they can't stop any of it, even
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:45.880]  though they admit that's their goal, so I'm going to go to your calls and briefly explain
[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:53.280]  this, we're in chapter 11 sub chapter 5 bankruptcy because the system's not set up yet to just
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.040]  shut businesses down.
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:22:00.120]  So Alex Jones won't get any money but the company and the crew and the operation will
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:06.160]  continue on as long as it's profitable, the reason we could do bankruptcy is we've been
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:10.920]  almost insolvent the last year and so it's a very real bankruptcy, that's why I'm buying
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:14.720]  products at m4store.com, it's great and it keeps us on air and we make it out of this
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:19.360]  bankruptcy in the next 3-4 months, then we continue on and then it's agreed that in the
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:24.120]  next 2 years if they win these appeals, which everybody says they're going to lose, total
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:28.640]  kangaroo court, that's why they're so mad, then in 2 years if we lose the appeal then
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:33.080]  whatever profit there is from info wars and there is almost no profit goes to them and
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:36.320]  they know that, that's why they're like no we don't want that judge, they told the bankruptcy
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:40.060]  judge we just want him taken off air, the judge's like well wait don't you want money
[02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:44.080]  as creditors, no we don't want money, we want him off air, they sent it and they're closing
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:49.280]  arguments in Texas and Connecticut, so again you're keeping us on air, you're letting us
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:53.760]  do the appeals, you're doing the exact opposite of what they want by going to info wars store

[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:45.360]  2.75 trillion there and 473 million there you just go my gosh the wizard of Oz guy was

[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.760]  of people, hundreds of millions a month of people, minds, souls that matter that need
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:51.160]  the truth and unborn babies that have got to be protected, I am one of the richest men
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.960]  in the world when it comes to influence, if influence was the currency I am a tycoon,
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.960]  I am a juggernaut, I am a force of nature but only through God not me but through the
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:08.040]  genes of the spirit and the family and the environment I was given, I sprouted, I gave
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:13.320]  good fruit and I am nothing but humble and blessed to be here as your humble servant
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:19.960]  and you've commissioned me into this fight, infowarstore.com, they are so pissed that after
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.760]  they had their fake Connecticut ruling with a fake, you know, I'm already guilty, tell
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:29.200]  the jury I'm guilty, totally rigged, they said, and what's Joan's listeners, don't
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.880]  bet on him, he's going down, do not buy his products, I thought you want my money, they
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:38.440]  know we don't have money, they have all the intel, democratic party runs this, deep state
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:46.080]  runs this and they are just enraged right now that they just cannot make you give up,
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:52.800]  they cannot make you submit, they cannot stand it, they want to hold me up as this example,
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:59.120]  their persecution, their lies, their strawmen, their demonization is a badge of courage other
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:06.040]  than my family and we're all, you know, in this fight, my most valuable possession is
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:13.440]  that the enemies of freedom and the human species and God, big G, big O, big D, triple
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:19.120]  exclamation point to infinity are my enemies and there's nowhere, your word of mouth is
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:26.800]  more key than infowarstore.com and man-dog-video-news-warstore.com, alright, I said I'd take calls, but I'm
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.320]  going to take your calls, but I'm going to give each call about a minute, you're going
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.520]  to talk about the election, we're going to talk about the election, I want to hear what
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.360]  you say about the election, I'm going to move the next person and then who we got in the
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.040]  fourth hour, I'm going to have to take some of the fourth hour here, we've got, oh my
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:42.680]  gosh, Paul Lodge has been off a few weeks, he's returned to Paul Lodge and this should
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:46.520]  be interesting, I don't want to cut into him and then the war room is coming up at 3 p.m.,
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.720]  central standard time, but we're going to come out of break, tell us not to come out
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.200]  of break, let's go to Beverly in California, it's one minute on air, Beverly, go ahead.
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:02.200]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to say thank you for all that you do and also, I'm kind of
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:09.840]  curious to know what you think about Gavin Newsom, supposedly not even being qualified
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:16.800]  to be on the ballot, even in the primaries because of SB 27, which he signed in 2019,
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:21.840]  which says all presidential and gubernatorial candidates must submit the last five years
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:27.920]  of filed tax returns to the California Secretary of State, which he failed to do in 2021.
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.160]  Well, exactly, we know Democrats never follow their own rules.
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:38.840]  And apparently on the website, it's been scrubbed, you can't find it, the page doesn't exist,
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.400]  except if you go to the Wayback machine, you can see that the tax returns are missing
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  for 2021.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:48.360]  Well, I'd say Gavin Newsom's there, darling, he's running for president, he's enemy number
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:50.640]  one, great point, Beverly, thank you for calling.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:55.720]  Back with more calls, stay with us.

[02:30:55.760 --> 02:31:01.920]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:07.560]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:11.200]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:15.600]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:21.600]  all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.920]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:44.400]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.

[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:57.160]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[02:31:57.160 --> 02:32:02.080]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:08.600]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but the world.
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:14.160]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war but I don't
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.160]  deserve the credit.
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:20.080]  Yes, I've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support info wars for the real
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:25.720]  reason we've had the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:28.000]  the new order we've ever had.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.760]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:38.680]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:41.560]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:42.560]  God bless you all.
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:43.560]  I salute you.
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.560]  I thank you.
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:49.560]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.060]  week is happening.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:52.400]  The fight is my fight.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:53.400]  It's your fight.
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:54.400]  It's our fight.
[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:55.760]  You are Four.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:56.760]  Five is all.
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:33:05.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the Lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:16.480]  The answer... to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:37.080]  Live from Austin, Texas Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:40.520]  So thirty-plus years ago when I decided I was going to fight the globalist twenty-eight
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:46.160]  years ago when I got on air, I knew the globalists were already in partial control of the planet
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:49.560]  and I knew they meant business, I knew they had to be challenged and we could build a
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:50.560]  resistance against them.
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.560]  That's what we're in.
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:56.160]  I mean, number one, and we've already done such incredible work together.
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.240]  It's all in God's hands now, but every day we stay on air, damages and more and more.
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:01.720]  Our credibility is the highest ever.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:04.200]  That means your credibility is not saluting.
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:05.200]  Thank you all.
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:06.200]  All right.
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:07.200]  Let's rampage through calls.
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  Craig in Washington.
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:09.200]  You're on the air.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:10.200]  Go ahead.
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  Yeah.
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:12.200]  Hey, Alex.
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  How you doing?
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:14.200]  Good, brother.
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:19.560]  So a quick thought that could be, it might not be the right time for us to be strong
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:25.520]  as humans, but could be a revolutionary thought or could be used in the wrong hands to get
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:26.520]  us.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:31.360]  And it kind of stems, Naomi Wolfe had an article like, when are we going to consider not making
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  voting anonymous?
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:36.680]  You know, if you put your name on it, there would go all fraud issues, but we'd have to
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:38.920]  be strong individuals with conviction.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:39.920]  Well, exactly.
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:43.000]  I mean, they want your ID to buy a gun, they want your ID for insurance, but voting all
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.480]  the Democrats don't want that.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:47.920]  Remember they never wanted illegals to vote now all over the country in city elections.
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:50.520]  The Democrats have legalized illegal aliens voting.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:51.520]  Yeah.
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.520]  Yeah.
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:57.640]  So, but actually putting your name on your ballot, so not being anonymous, which would
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:59.160]  be, I don't know if we're ready for that.
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:00.160]  And I don't know if we're ready.
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:05.160]  The idea I have, let's just say Herschel Walker's election, what hit of everybody who was going
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:08.160]  to vote for him wore a red shirt that day.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.440]  It was just an idea, I mean, the deep state could come through this in their favor and
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:17.040]  be like, yeah, bring it on, we're going to use that and we're going to stuff it down
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:18.160]  your throat.
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:24.160]  But just, you know, something that would allow the eyes to see what we're not being told
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.720]  from the deep.
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:26.720]  So.
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:27.720]  Great point, sir.
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:28.720]  Thank you, Craig for calling.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:31.400]  Let's talk to another Craig in Ohio.
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:32.400]  You're on the air.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.240]  Yeah, it's a great job on the 5G to open the show, that's the best explanation connection
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:40.120]  I've heard of the jab yet.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.720]  I was on six months ago, I made a prediction, the dollar would go higher even when the countless
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:45.240]  idiots said it would go lower.
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:48.960]  Now I'm going to call the US dollar to Swiss franc going up, it has huge energy building
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:49.960]  in it.
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:54.120]  The reason I say this is because I think it ties to the Bank of International Standards,
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:58.480]  which also ties to the great part, the great piece Kate Daly did yesterday about why Biden
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:03.320]  and Fetterman trying to prep us for the central bank digital currency.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  Now that we're admitting the elections are rigged by electronics, I'd also like to try
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:13.080]  to get out there that markets have been rigged for a long time because of electronics.
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:14.080]  I've watched the evolution.
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.640]  That's how Bloomberg made his $50 million.
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:19.640]  It's all exactly.
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:20.640]  Yeah.
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.760]  So the thing is, this deserves a lot of credit and I'd like to try to get with Greg Reese
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:28.920]  because I've got a ton of information that he could do his short clips on and this really
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:32.680]  needs to get out there because capital markets are just as important as protecting our southern
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:33.680]  border.
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.360]  Our whole show is about connecting great minds with our crew.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:42.320]  Guys get Greg's name and number and give it to Greg Reese and Greg, I'm sure will call
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:43.320]  you.
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:45.200]  He's a really smart guy, but help him out with this.
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:46.200]  He'll want to talk to you.
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  Thank you.
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.200]  Give Greg's number to Greg Reese, please.
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:51.440]  All right.
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:53.040]  Up next, Travis at Omaha.
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:54.040]  Go ahead.
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:55.040]  Hi.
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:01.920]  You know, I was calling because I think as far as the elections go, I think everyone's
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:08.360]  figured out that, you know, these rebranded, titanic bankers from Europe who are trying
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:13.680]  to take over the world and close at the same time are in control both sides of the aisle.
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:19.840]  So I think people voted for the people that were against them, like DeSantis, like Paul,
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:20.840]  like Libertarians.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:30.160]  And therefore, I mean, Rand Paul won by a giant majority by promising to try to get Anthony
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:31.160]  Fauci arrested.
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:35.120]  In fact, I'm at the start of the show with that video, Victorious Rand Paul vows to subpoena
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:37.760]  every last document of Dr. Fauci.
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:39.360]  Yes, we must go in the office.
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:41.360]  In fact, give me that clip, guys.
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:42.360]  Go ahead.
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  Sorry, Travis.
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:44.360]  I know.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.360]  Yeah.
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:49.160]  I mean, that was actually the point I wanted to furthermore because I think we all need
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:50.600]  to get behind Rand Paul a bit more.
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:52.480]  I mean, he's the one that's there with it.
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:53.480]  No, I'll say it.
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.920]  I think Rand Paul as a man, as a leader is a hundred percent genuine.
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:01.800]  I've known him since he was on my show in 96, his dad getting reelected in Congress.
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:02.800]  I've known him.
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:04.240]  I've known him for 25 years.
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:06.040]  I think we need Rand Paul as president.
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:10.520]  I think he's better than DeSantis and better than Trump on actual policies and his grasp
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:11.520]  of things.
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:14.560]  And I'm not trying to have a horse race here, but if we've got a horse race between Trump
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:16.400]  and DeSantis, what about Rand Paul?
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.720]  He doesn't have all the Hollywood pizzazz, but he's probably the best person we have
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.200]  in the federal government.
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:29.680]  Yes, I think we should stop asking questions that the Democrats ask, like, who's more marketable,
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:32.640]  who's going to win, that type of thing.
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:37.760]  And we should say who's been fighting for us, who has his ribs broken.
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:44.560]  And if you look, if you look, it's MTG, it's Matt Gaetz, it's Rand Paul winning by the
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:45.560]  biggest numbers.
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:46.560]  I totally agree with you.
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.560]  In fact, I meant to say this today before I got on air.
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:52.680]  I was going to say, that's why I love to take calls, I forget to make my points, and when
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:57.040]  I take your calls, you make the organic true point that we want hard chargers, we want
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:59.320]  real people, we want authenticity.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:00.320]  Thank you, Travis.
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.680]  Let's go to Sean in New York here on the air, go ahead.
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.160]  Alex, just want to thank you for your passion and your sacrifice.
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:10.400]  I was trying to vote here in New York, and I decided not to this time, because last time
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.760]  they mailed me something in the mail that said what the priority that I voted for.
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.600]  And I was very upset that I was on the front page of my mail that showed up to my house.
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:22.400]  So this year, I got a little upset with my girlfriend, she went out and voted.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.520]  And I told her, listen, this year we're not going to vote, we're going to see if that
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:28.520]  paper comes again and see if we voted.
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.480]  And so you're going to find out and see if it came back.
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:34.480]  To see if it says that I voted when I didn't this time.
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:35.480]  That's a good point.
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:36.480]  Yeah.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:37.800]  I mean, I don't know how they could do that.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:41.040]  Just let every postman know, oh, this house is this, this house is that, how can that
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.040]  happen?
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.040]  How do I know that guy's not an agent?
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.320]  As far as I know, they were the last people to get vaccinated.
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.680]  They didn't force them because they needed them to win the election.
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:48.680]  You know that.
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:51.960]  Oh, oh, oh, the federal government doesn't have to take the shots.
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:52.960]  Only the troops.
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:53.960]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:56.240]  I'm talking about the mailman, the people in the post.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.320]  No, you're right.
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:02.760]  Don't you love how they exempt themselves from what they do to us?
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:04.520]  Alex, we love you, bro.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:08.000]  Keep up the good fight and God bless you, my brother.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  God bless you, Sean.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  We're all in this together, brother.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  We're going to make it.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.520]  But believe me, it looks bad now, but humanity is just now waking up so things are getting
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:16.520]  very, very positive.
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:21.560]  And I'm not just saying that as negative as they are, it's Newtonian physics for every
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:25.000]  action is an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  It's happening now.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.520]  That's why they're scared.
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.520]  All right.
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:30.160]  Gordon in Alaska, you're on the air.
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:31.160]  Go ahead.
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:32.160]  Hey, Jones.
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:33.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:34.160]  You hear me?
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:35.160]  Oh, wow.
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:36.160]  What a, what a moment.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:40.160]  I, I've been listening to you since October of 2001.
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:41.160]  So, wow.
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.640]  Nice to finally, nice to finally reach out to you, but anyway, real fast.
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:51.560]  So up here in Alaska, we just used ranked choice voting for the first time.
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  For the first time.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:55.120]  And I'm not really sold on the idea.
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:41:02.960]  I'm still kind of weighing it, but it's something that's not really been in place in our country
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:03.960]  for a long time.
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:04.960]  How does it work?
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:05.960]  Explain to me.
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:14.280]  So, it's, it's opposite of basically what Madison and Hamilton, how they want to do,
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:19.680]  which has been historically and across the country, the theme of voting, it's first past
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.800]  the poll, which is just the majority takes the seat, basically.
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:29.520]  And what's interesting is that's actually encouraged a two-party system, according to
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.560]  a bunch of them fancy sociologists out there, you know what I mean?
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.960]  So you're talking about a parliamentary system, then bingo, man.
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:43.920]  So that's, that's why I love frigging interacting with you because you know, anyway, it is,
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:45.600]  it is European in nature.
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:46.600]  That's where it comes from.
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:51.320]  But the idea is that it opens up third parties from what I understand.
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.880]  But I don't even know if that's really solution.
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:42:00.080]  It's almost like, it's like if you're, if your car, like headlights are out, right?
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.640]  Our, our voting system is clearly in need of maintenance.
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:09.360]  Well, I was about to say, as bad as a two-party system is, in a parliamentary, it's easy whoever's
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.320]  in power to make alliances with the other sub-parties.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:17.080]  And then, so let's say the, the party of power gets 30% like Trudeau.
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:19.760]  He just goes out and gets a few other groups to go to 51.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:21.480]  Now he nixes all the other groups.
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:24.160]  So they've both got their problems, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.280]  All right, we're going to break and we come back.
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:37.720]  Bob Pattis, my lawyer, is going to respond to the $473 million on top the $965 million.
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:43.560]  It's all academic, it's all monopoly money, it's all the great, powerful laws trying to
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:44.560]  scare you.
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:45.560]  Oh, don't support him.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:47.400]  That's a billion dollars.
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.640]  They think you're stupid, but you're not.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:50.640]  We're winning.
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:51.640]  They're losing.
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:43:04.040]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:10.200]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:15.720]  physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:22.080]  Their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.800]  number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:27.800]  down peacefully.
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:33.000]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the

[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:17.640]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:23.520]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Info Wars despite the massive law
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:29.200]  fair being waged against Info Wars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:30.200]  Info Wars.

[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:16.840]  the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[02:30:40.260 --> 02:47:53.200]  I just saw God bless you man and I wanted to tell you I was wearing an info
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:57.160]  war shirt and someone bought my dinner and it was like four times the cost of the shirt.
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:00.440]  Have I not told you that'll happen?
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:06.240]  So anyways, I wanted to address something that Owen was talking about, he was saying
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.760]  how there's Democratic candidates who get like 90% of the vote.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:15.720]  Well here in New York state, the Republican arm of the Uniparty is so feckless, they don't
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:19.080]  even bother to put Republican candidates up, right?
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:23.640]  So the Democrats are running unopposed and these are like, you know, real leftists running
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:24.640]  unopposed.
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:29.360]  So when they put your ballot through the machine, just automatically, you know, because there's
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:33.520]  no option to say, no, I don't vote for this person, like no vote, right?
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.240]  So the machine automatically gives the vote to the unopposed candidate.
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:43.320]  So you have somebody running, you know, getting like 95% of the vote.
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:44.320]  That's a really good point.
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:45.800]  Where do you think this is all going?
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:48.560]  Where do I think it's going?
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:49.560]  Yes.
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:54.920]  Well, like Mike Blindell said, you know, we got to keep the faith, this is only just
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:55.920]  the beginning.
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:00.560]  We cannot let up, we have to put the foot on the gas, you know, I'm personally I'm going
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:05.440]  to get in touch with New York citizens audit and I'm going to see what I can do here on
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:06.440]  the local level.
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:10.640]  Well, I'll tell you what's beautiful, as they always say, it's not the destination,
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:16.360]  it's the journey, getting to meet all the great people, very race, color and creed,
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:21.920]  all female, gay, straight, you know, it doesn't matter that they want freedom in this process.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:22.920]  It's what's amazing.
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.360]  Getting to talk to you, Casey, and all the great things you're saying, it's just, it's
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:29.960]  the process that is really the best.
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.160]  Thank you so much for calling in.
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:34.600]  All right, let's talk to Evan and then Deborah.
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:39.760]  Evan in Kentucky, where Rand Paul just won by huge margins, promising to go after the
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.000]  deep state for their COVID attack and the COVID cover up as he calls it.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.480]  What's on your mind today?
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:48.480]  Yes, sir, how are you, Alex?
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:50.880]  You know, I'm in the fight, brother, so I'm actually doing pretty good.
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.720]  Myself, like what I'm doing, my spirit really, I really feel good every day.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:49:57.720]  Sleep really good.
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:58.720]  Feel really strong.
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:01.360]  I'm under a lot of attack, but I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:05.640]  Yes, sir, I just want to say we love you here in Kentucky.
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:07.440]  Love you.
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:13.880]  And yeah, I was wondering, so with it being like three days off from the election, there's
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:18.600]  no representation from the Republican side to watch them create votes?
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:24.240]  No, I mean, look, it's big tech, it's big media, it's the corporations, they're far
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.120]  known, they're out to get us, they're still in front of us, but we're making them steal
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.880]  in front of us and it's only going to make folks matter.
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:35.840]  And once we get 70% of the vote, which we're getting close to, they mathematically cannot
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:36.840]  steal it.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:40.040]  They're so close right now where they're out of bullets.
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:44.120]  I mean, we are, we're winning.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:49.840]  Yes, but it just seems like everyone knows, I mean, I don't believe there's a soul here
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:52.240]  that believes that this is what you're doing.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:56.240]  But that's why Rand Paul, I've got the numbers here, but he got the highest Senate reelection
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:00.280]  number because Kentucky's awake and it doesn't matter.
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:05.120]  I mean, literally, when you've got 70% of people vote for somebody, they can't steal
[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:06.120]  it.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:16.520]  You, Kentucky overpowered, Florida overpowered, but I got to say Kentucky better than Florida,
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:22.880]  Kentucky, Florida, Texas overpowered them with just your numbers.
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:29.600]  Yeah, but especially in the battlegrounds, like those are the only states really contested.
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:37.600]  Well, Kentucky was a battleground until folks got really pissed and woke, and so yeah, no,
[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:38.600]  it's here.
[02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:39.600]  That guys pull up the numbers.
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:40.600]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:41.600]  The article is now.
[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:45.520]  But like Rand Paul won by a gigantic majority when they said one of the biggest wins out
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:46.520]  there.
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:53.560]  Well, yeah, he's good person and people know that and he is the prototype, not the Santas,
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:54.560]  not Trump.
[02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:55.560]  And I like both Trump and the Santas.
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:52:00.000]  I'm saying Rand Paul on policies is the best thing we've got.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  Thank you, sir.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:06.160]  Deborah in Boston, Massachusetts, you're on here.
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:10.120]  Oh, my God, Alex, I can't even believe I'm talking to you.
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:20.080]  I'm a female in Massachusetts, so I was watching you like 20 years ago.
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:27.000]  Honestly, I kind of tune in and out so that I can try to not go crazy.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  That makes sense.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:33.000]  Anyway, I had an idea.
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:37.760]  I have supported in info wars of that stuff.
[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:43.880]  When I saw like what they did with the truckers in Canada, freezing their bank accounts and
[02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:47.880]  stuff, I have to admit that kind of scared me.
[02:52:47.880 --> 02:52:54.520]  And you know, rallying is only so powerful, they're going to infiltrate and make somebody
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:56.600]  do something crazy.
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:53:00.640]  And the idea, honestly, it's like getting on your knees and asking anyway.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:01.640]  Well, you're right.
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:03.680]  But I mean, here's the example.
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:09.320]  Rand Paul is the is the model of populist, forget Republican, forget conservative, forget
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:14.800]  man, woman, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, all gay, straight, all this BS.
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:18.840]  Or pro-America constitutionalist common sense.
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:22.920]  He won by put the numbers back on screen, please.
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:30.520]  He won by a gigant or 61.7% despite all the fraud.
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:33.400]  So you cannot beat a tsunami of 70%.
[02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:37.320]  As I said, his the guy who ran against got 38%.
[02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:38.320]  Okay.
[02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:41.440]  So, so this is 38.
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:42.440]  That says 30.
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:47.640]  That says 38 too, so I'm saying, don't we all agree with Rand Paul?
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:49.040]  Well, of course we do.
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:56.120]  That's the model, not a Republican, not a Democrat, a populist that's pro-human, pro-success
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:57.120]  and pro-America.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:53:58.120]  Anything else, Deborah?
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:00.120]  Um, yeah, I totally agree with you.
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:01.120]  Hey, I got to go back to you.
[02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:02.120]  I got to go back to you.
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:05.840]  We finally got my lawyer on to come back to you and back to Jonathan when we start the
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:06.840]  next hour.
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:08.520]  Norm Pattis, I know you're busy in a meeting.
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:09.680]  You came on with us.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:13.800]  We've got confrontations with Brennan and others here in a minute.
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:21.240]  But another 473 million, the judge on top of 965 million.
[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:25.680]  What do you make of this, Norm Pattis, the guy that was there at my show trial in Connecticut?
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:30.320]  Well, you know, obviously we know what we're looking at now and the whole got a little
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:31.320]  bit deeper.
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:33.480]  Candidly, I thought she'd go a lot deeper.
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.360]  I suspect she did what she could while maintaining a straight face.
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:41.520]  I think there's plenty of talk around the state that this unprecedented verdict remains
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:42.520]  vulnerable.
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:47.200]  And, you know, I think she tried to hit you hard, but not so hard as to be more shocking
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:49.520]  than this result already is.
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:50.520]  Absolutely.
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:55.240]  So, so what happens now, because I mean, you've seen my finances, I don't have $2 million.
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:58.640]  So people say, oh, he, the media says he says he won't pay it.
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:03.240]  Well, I mean, if I weigh 260 pounds and they ask for a trillion pounds, I don't have that
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:04.240]  much flesh.
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:08.840]  No, I mean, look, I don't think these cases are about financial recovery.
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:12.720]  And at this point, I think these cases are about making the point, making an example
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:15.080]  of you and trying to shut you up, frankly.
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:20.760]  I think the goal is to pile you up with a judgment debt, the likes of which no one else
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:26.440]  has ever seen, no private person or non-corporation, and then see what you can do to score a lot
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:27.440]  of it.
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:31.400]  I think they'd like to put you on a financial leash with the name of silencing you.
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.960]  And the asset test will be what becomes of the free speech bankruptcy.
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:39.520]  You know, the bankruptcy court has complete jurisdiction and access to your records and
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:40.520]  whatnot.
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:41.800]  They know what you have.
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.480]  People will be summoned to an effort to settle these cases, and if they don't try to settle
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:50.080]  in good faith, it'll be because their goal is to destroy you.
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:52.160]  And I don't think you'll let that happen.
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:55.760]  And they've said their goal is to silence us.
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:59.520]  Well, you know, and I hope, I hope for the sake of the American people and for the sake
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:02.040]  of yourself, you don't let that happen.
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:05.880]  I think you have a unique voice, and it's a voice that hundreds of thousands, if that
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:10.680]  billions of people listen to, don't always understand everything you say, don't always
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:12.440]  understand your appeal.
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:16.160]  But I know my world would be less rich without you in it.
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:19.320]  And I'm proud to represent you in the fight to remain on the air.
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:26.000]  Well, the preposterous nature of a $9.5 billion kangaroo court already found guilty by the
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  judge verdict.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:34.880]  I mean, I guess they put out the $2.75 trillion to make the billion and change look small.
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:36.760]  Is that what's happening with anchoring?
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:41.080]  Like they've got like a, oh, we want $2.75 trillion, but oh, we want, I mean, is that
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  what's happening?
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.480]  I don't know that they know what's happening.
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:46.960]  I mean, remember how the trial unfolded?
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:51.920]  You were sued, you were defaulted at no point prior to the trial that anybody ever make
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:53.960]  a financial demand of you.
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:56.440]  During the trial itself, the plaintiffs had no financial demand.
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:58.400]  They presented no financial records.
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:02.720]  It wasn't until closing argument that their lawyers stood up and basically said, hey,
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:08.720]  550 million, they've got 550 million impressions on social media in a given period, give these
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:14.040]  people a dollar for each and maybe 550 million per plaintiff, you know, they threw a big
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.800]  number in front of the jury and then invited the jury to multiply by its own reasoning,
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:20.800]  by its own lights.
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:25.280]  There's not going to an apple tree that has 10 apples and asking for a thousand.
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.440]  Dr. Patis, we'll talk to you tomorrow, then you're going to get back to an important meeting.
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:29.440]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:30.440]  Be well, Alex.
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:31.440]  Bye.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:32.440]  All right.
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:33.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:34.440]  Stay in attack formation.
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:36.680]  Debra, we'll finish up with you and then Jonathan.
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:45.760]  And then Paul Joseph Watson from His Majesty's Rattania.
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:51.240]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness

[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:03.640]  been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[02:58:57.640 --> 02:58:59.360]  You forget to take your brain force plus.
[02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:01.760]  You forget to take DNA force plus.
[02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:05.360]  You forget to take DX3 and you know it makes your life better and you know it makes you
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:09.960]  healthier and you constantly forget and when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:12.600]  This stuff will blow you away plus it funds our operation.

[02:59:47.200 --> 03:00:02.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:06.920]  Final segment I'm hosting, Paul Watson takes over and then I'll enjoy it in one hour.
[03:00:06.920 --> 03:00:09.920]  The war room and boy is he ready to unload.
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:13.320]  Deborah, finishing up your point from Boston, go ahead.
[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:18.120]  Hi, so I have an idea.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:22.560]  I want to support you and I want to try to encourage everybody else to support you and
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:28.840]  I'm sure you have spectacular numbers as far as how many people are actually tuning in listening
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:30.320]  and watching every day.
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:38.520]  And every single person donated like $5 and we just had this massive money dump and maybe
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:44.600]  you have like call it like an I am Spartacus movement because if we have like 10 million
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:51.400]  people that give you five bucks, are they going to put us all in jail?
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:54.640]  If people get excited stopping them, people understand info wars is a spirit, but I'm
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:55.640]  going to take your idea.
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:01:00.520]  I'm going to call it the Spartacus fundraiser because all we need is word of mouth and money.
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:01.520]  We'll beat the globalist.
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:06.480]  That's what they're trying to cut everybody's money off, not just ours, but the the deindustrialization,
[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:08.440]  the shipping the jobs to China.
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:11.440]  Amazing points, Deborah.
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:16.400]  We actually got Vivian Kubrick out here, her dad made a Spartacus and I'm Spartacus made
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:17.400]  it really famous.
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:20.000]  She's down there videotaping, she's making the documentary.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.600]  And so he popularized with Spartacus, but that's absolutely true.
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:27.280]  Well, you mentioned that Deborah, thank you, Jonathan and North in South Carolina, go ahead,
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:29.280]  you're on the air.
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:34.480]  General Jones, I as I say thank you, I thank myself and all the other info warriors who
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:40.960]  are here rowing and paddling and actually bailing ourselves in this rowboat out of out
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:45.320]  of this storm that's coming, you know, and as far as elections go, man, this is so great
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:50.320]  that I can talk to you about this because I want to I want to jump ahead for just a
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:55.080]  moment and ask a rhetorical question that I'm going to answer, but do any of us think
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:59.560]  that this superhuman that we are to become in God's kingdom and go forward and leave
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:01.560]  all this evil behind?
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:07.640]  Are we ever to answer to any actual authority that we're going to vote on?
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:09.560]  So the answer is no.
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:17.840]  So and then now to rewind back to what the founding fathers gave us, the idea was self
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:22.200]  independent, meaning, and of course, we had to have people that we elected and put there
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:24.160]  to make sure it all followed through.
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:27.200]  But we are going we're going full we had to be informed.
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:28.560]  We had to know the topics.
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:29.560]  They were our representative.
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:33.680]  In fact, until 1913, same year, we got the Federal Reserve, the IRS.
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:34.680]  They had that amendment.
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:36.120]  What is the 17th Amendment?
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:37.120]  I forget.
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:42.880]  Look at the 17th Amendment that made the senators elected instead of the legislators
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:49.160]  who we elect would then elect the senator to make the senator a creature of the state
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:50.760]  to balance the power.
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:57.120]  The House representatives was generally elected, but then the senator was elected by the legislature
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  and sent by the governor.
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:02:59.960]  And we need to go back to that.
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:05.280]  We need to go to real self governance where we we actually come around and realize, hey,
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:07.240]  we know how to build our own road.
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:08.240]  We don't need them.
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:12.000]  We don't need to steal from people, steal their money and then make a pile of it and
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  then go.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  No, I agree.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  Paul Watts has taken over.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.680]  But I want to finish up with this short clip.
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:22.080]  This is former CIA director John Brennan that ran the attacks on America and Trump that
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:25.920]  admits the chemtrails and all the evil involved in every form we look you can imagine.
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:30.480]  Here he is being confronted on a big list of crimes.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:34.560]  So was John Bolton and his answer is you don't have your fact straight.
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:36.320]  No, we have our fact straight.
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:38.720]  We know you are a war criminal.
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:40.480]  Here is this short clip.
[03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:43.640]  We'll come back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:44.640]  Please stay with us.
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:49.240]  How do you respond to the claims that you're deciding whether Bush and Obama administrations
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:53.960]  led to unnecessary torture you addressed in there, you know, what you said was necessary
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.920]  and you said you'll strive not to have any civilian deaths.
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:02.440]  But the documents leaked by Snowden show a whole other story show the disposition matrix
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:08.120]  was not as accurate as you as you represented it, sir.
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:12.160]  How would you say it was one of the critics of you lying about surveillance, saying that
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:15.800]  there was no mass surveillance of Americans, that's on the record.
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.520]  And you, you know, we originally people didn't want you in the Obama administration because
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:22.760]  you, your ties to torture under the Bush administration.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.760]  Now you rehabilitate your character and become a hero to the left because of your anti-Trumpness.
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:32.800]  But what do you say to the critics who still care about America not being a police of the
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:36.640]  world and not doing rendition and torture and kidnapping of Americans?
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:40.480]  What about the people who've had to sue the U.S. government because they've been tortured?
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:44.360]  The people who have permanent rectal damage because of the torture that you approved?
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:47.320]  The people who have permanent shoulder damage because they've been tortured by the U.S.
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:48.320]  government under your decisions?
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:49.320]  I would say get your facts right.
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:50.320]  All your facts you've said.
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:51.320]  No, they're not.
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:52.320]  The lawsuits are there.
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:05:01.960]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:07.320]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:09.400]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:05:09.400 --> 03:05:10.760]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:05:10.760 --> 03:05:11.760]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:15.360]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:16.840]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:21.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:22.000]  all of this.
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:25.320]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:26.320]  your support.
[03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:29.400]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:33.920]  as to America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global agenda.
[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:37.560]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:39.240]  because of your past support.
[03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:43.040]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:47.480]  three double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:48.480]  on air.
[03:05:48.480 --> 03:05:50.480]  1776 is the promo code.
[03:05:50.480 --> 03:06:16.480]  The destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[03:06:16.480 --> 03:06:39.760]  It's going to be election fortnight, maybe it's going to be election month.
[03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:41.640]  When does it end?
[03:06:41.640 --> 03:06:43.500]  When does the counting end?
[03:06:43.500 --> 03:06:46.120]  When do we get the actual results?
[03:06:46.120 --> 03:06:51.360]  You know, Joe Stalin, when 99 percent of Soviets voted for him, he at least told them
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:56.960]  that 100 percent of the votes were in and 99 percent of the votes were for Stalin.
[03:06:56.960 --> 03:06:59.520]  Americans apparently now they don't get that privilege.
[03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:05.000]  We have a situation in Arizona which I'm going to get into in a minute.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:11.320]  But again, the wider picture, a historically unpopular president, record low approval
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:17.880]  ratings, rapidly declining cognitive abilities, presiding over an inflation crisis, an economic
[03:07:17.880 --> 03:07:22.520]  crisis heading south in a hurry, and we're supposed to believe he had a better midterm
[03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:25.720]  than either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.
[03:07:25.720 --> 03:07:28.080]  Makes absolute perfect sense to me.
[03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:33.080]  You have a situation where we can have elections in the United Kingdom where 40, 50 million
[03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:37.520]  people vote, and they've counted the vast majority of the votes in a matter of three
[03:07:37.520 --> 03:07:39.320]  or four hours.
[03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:43.960]  In Arizona, they're now saying it's going to take until next week.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:49.020]  In Nevada, they're now saying it's going to take until next week.
[03:07:49.020 --> 03:07:54.840]  Why does Florida have the capability to count 7 million votes in a matter of hours?
[03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:59.560]  Why does Texas has the capability to count so many millions of votes in the same time
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:04.840]  period with vastly greater populations than Arizona and Nevada?
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:09.560]  And now maybe next week, you'll get the results in Arizona and Nevada.
[03:08:09.560 --> 03:08:11.520]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:08:11.520 --> 03:08:13.920]  It's a complete farce.
[03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:18.800]  They're now saying that there are 400,000 more votes to be counted in Maricopa County
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:21.360]  alone in Arizona.
[03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:24.760]  And again, Carrie Lake, it obviously won.
[03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:26.440]  She won after a few hours.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:32.480]  All the remaining votes left to count are heavily in her favor for the governor of Arizona,
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:37.600]  and yet they're doing these strategic voting dumps, still trying to pretend that she's
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:41.200]  not got a path, got a course to victory.
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:42.880]  What are they doing?
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:43.880]  They're so haughty.
[03:08:43.880 --> 03:08:44.880]  They're so arrogant.
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:50.200]  They're so deluded that they think by just delaying counting the MAGA votes, the Republican
[03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:54.360]  votes, the Carrie Lake votes, that it's just not going to happen.
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:56.400]  Count the frigging votes.
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:08:58.240]  Why does it take a week?
[03:08:58.240 --> 03:09:00.520]  Why does it take two weeks?
[03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:05.120]  Say what you want about Brazil's election and corruption and vote fraud, but at least
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:10.920]  they claim they can count the votes in one night in Brazil, which by American terms is
[03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:13.760]  a pretty backward country.
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:14.760]  Arizona no.
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:17.120]  Maybe next week, maybe Monday, maybe Tuesday.
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:19.840]  Who knows at this point?
[03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:20.840]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:25.080]  And in fact, Carrie Lake came out today a few hours ago in an interview.
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:27.000]  This is a headline out of Valiant News.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.720]  Carrie Lake, 100% confident we're going to win.
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:34.360]  She was confident she was going to win on Tuesday, but you're not allowed to know that
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:39.200]  because they're not going to count the votes, promises action to stop future election nightmares.
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:44.160]  And again, obviously if she wins, she has presiding control, oversight over the election
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:49.240]  process itself to make sure nothing like this happens again.
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:53.520]  So Carrie Lake told Charlie Kirk a few hours ago, she's 100% confident she will win as
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:59.520]  the majority of votes tend to favor Republicans, but they're not counting them as saying, no,
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:00.520]  you're going to have to wait.
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:06.760]  We don't know when there's 60,000 here, there's 200,000 there, we're going to selectively
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:12.040]  in a tactical manner dump certain votes that favor her opponent to try and pretend that
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:15.040]  she's not going to win.
[03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:19.400]  She promised that as governor of Arizona, her first action will be to call a special
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:23.480]  legislative session where the new Republican Congress will be asked to solve the state
[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:30.960]  infamous election system, where of course they had the massive failures in voting machines
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:39.960]  where 70 out of 223 voting locations now, that's up from 60, were beset with these mysterious
[03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:45.480]  problems in those areas and those election day voters, those ballots which heavily skew
[03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:49.720]  Republican, that's where they had mysteriously all the problems.
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:53.200]  Who could have predicted that?
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:57.880]  She said, I feel 100% confident we're going to win this, I'm frustrated like everyone
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:01.160]  else, it's embarrassing the way elections are held in Arizona, this is why I've been
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:04.280]  standing in the alarm since 2020.
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:09.920]  She went on to say yesterday, we gave them 24 hours and they released 62,000 votes.
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:15.600]  Again, as I pointed out in a video earlier today, who is counting these votes in Arizona?
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:20.280]  First grade children, who's counting them?
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:26.080]  Why haven't they got enough people to count more than 62,000 votes in a time period of
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:28.280]  24 hours?
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:31.360]  How long does it take to count a single vote?
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:37.600]  She added, we have 622,000 votes yet to be counted but they're not giving us the results
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:43.800]  and of those 384,000 of people who took their mail-in ballot and walked them in on election
[03:11:43.800 --> 03:11:48.680]  day because Republicans knew that if they use the US postal system, if they use any
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:54.000]  of these drop box shenanigans that up in the air, whether the vote will actually count
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.280]  or not given our previous experience, she said, I think we all know how the majority
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:01.000]  of those people were going to vote.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:04.680]  So again, she's still confident that she's going to win this.
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:09.040]  She says of the votes that haven't been counted, if they ever count them, they're going to
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:15.400]  be two to one Republican, if not three to one Republican in Kerry Lake's favor.
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:20.120]  So she's already forming her transition team, even as the predicted markets, the betting
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:26.440]  markets, even as the Democratic operatives on Twitter all cry in unison that Kerry Lake
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:32.320]  is going to lose, despite the fact that the votes remaining to be counted are two to one,
[03:12:32.320 --> 03:12:35.560]  in some cases three to one in her favor.
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:40.120]  And again, Blake Masters, of course, in the Senate race is further behind, but people
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:46.400]  who have looked at these voting ballots that remain uncounted say that Blake Masters has
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:52.400]  a chance of overturning that deficit if they just count the damn ballots.
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:57.000]  Of course, if that's the case, Republicans win the Senate, even aside from the runoff
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:00.840]  in Georgia, which is going to happen in December.
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:06.720]  But again, the wider point, Biden has a better midterm than Obama or Bill Clinton, despite
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:13.320]  record and popularity levels, 73%, according to the CNN exit poll, are either angry or
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:17.280]  dissatisfied with the way America is heading with the state of the country.
[03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:21.320]  Other polls say that 75% and even higher number.
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:28.040]  And yet it's the best midterms for Democrats in terms of governors since 1986 makes perfect
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:29.840]  sense, doesn't it?
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:35.240]  Bloomberg reported that Biden, despite his low approval rating and relative absence on
[03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:38.920]  the campaign trail, will likely be able to claim the best midterm performance for an
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:41.840]  incumbents president party in 20 years.
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:48.560]  So just like 2020, when he spent half the time in bed, called a lid on it at 12 in the
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:54.320]  afternoon, one in the afternoon, Biden has performed outstanding.
[03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:59.720]  Same as Vettemann, of course, who like Biden can barely string together two coherent sentences,
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:05.920]  absolutely crushed Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania, one convincingly.
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:12.680]  So again, Biden, the most votes for any president ever, despite the fact that he barely got out
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:17.800]  of bed in 2020, despite the fact that he barely campaigned in 2022, has had an outstanding
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:20.320]  night and outstanding couple of days.
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:27.880]  You also have the situation in Pennsylvania with Tony DeLuca, headline out of RT, dead
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:31.440]  candidates win US elections.
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:35.680]  Pennsylvania State Rep Tony DeLuca won his race for state Congress in a landslide victory,
[03:14:35.680 --> 03:14:39.640]  despite the fact that he's been dead for a month.
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:46.520]  You had similar outcomes in Tennessee with Barbara Cooper and with Simon Silver in California,
[03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:51.880]  both being dead for months, both won easily.
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:54.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:01.440]  Dema County in Arizona says most of the ballots might be counted by the 14th or 15th next
[03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:04.040]  week.
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:09.080]  So again, we have world elections across the developed world again, running elections
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:12.040]  with tens of millions of voters on one night.
[03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:15.160]  You know the result of the election within hours.
[03:15:15.160 --> 03:15:18.920]  Even backwards countries like Brazil can pull this off.
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:24.240]  And yet we have the world's premier superpower, America, with the supposedly sophisticated
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.760]  election system, and they can't get it done for a week.
[03:15:28.760 --> 03:15:32.400]  If not more, it's absolutely incredible.
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:34.600]  They're talking about how many votes are left.
[03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:39.040]  They're analyzing how many are going to split for Carrie Lake and for her opponent.
[03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:43.200]  And it's quite obvious that Carrie Lake, who is now within, what I think it was 12,000
[03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:47.640]  last time I checked, within 12,000 votes of her opponent, clearly going to win.
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:52.080]  They should have called it yesterday, if not the day before is an absolute force.
[03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:54.880]  We'll be back now going.
[03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:59.680]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:04.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:09.280]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:14.640]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:22.200]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[03:16:22.200 --> 03:16:25.400]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:31.160]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:35.640]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:37.400]  I don't take the credit.
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:39.240]  I give you the credit.
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:41.640]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:16:41.640 --> 03:16:43.640]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:45.400]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[03:16:45.400 --> 03:16:54.840]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:00.120]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:01.480]  you.
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:05.400]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see
[03:17:05.400 --> 03:17:10.480]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[03:17:10.480 --> 03:17:14.680]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:20.840]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com

[03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:41.200]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now, who have my commitment to never
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:44.560]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:02.160]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks tried
[03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:07.040]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made
[03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:11.240]  them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while
[03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:13.200]  but it's finally back in stock.

[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:19.640]  function of the body.

[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:31.040]  Essential means without these things, you die and so much of the food is debased.
[03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:36.120]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses

[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:40.800]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[03:19:55.840 --> 03:20:02.020]  Opening of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:02.020 --> 03:20:20.160]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:29.880]  So I'll just check Sene Race in Arizona on Google, which gets their data from the Associated
[03:20:29.880 --> 03:20:30.880]  Press.
[03:20:30.880 --> 03:20:38.360]  There's live updated at 2020 GMT, which is my time, 20 past 8 in the evening, 20 past
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:43.040]  2 central in Austin, where we're broadcasting from.
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:44.560]  And it still says the same thing.
[03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:49.360]  It said yesterday, 70% reporting in Arizona.
[03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:51.320]  70% of the ballots are in.
[03:20:51.320 --> 03:20:52.640]  That was what it was yesterday.
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:56.200]  What have they been doing all day?
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:59.000]  This is a national midterm election.
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.880]  There's been almost 24 hours gone by.
[03:21:01.880 --> 03:21:05.680]  No new votes reported according to the Associated Press.
[03:21:05.680 --> 03:21:10.280]  Some other news outlets, some trackers have different metrics, of course, but they're
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:12.840]  just not updating it.
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:15.560]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:16.560]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:22.120]  Nevada, Adam Laxalt still winning, 83% reporting.
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:26.560]  That hasn't been updated since yesterday, as far as I know.
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:31.440]  I mean, just call it already, absolutely incredible.
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:34.740]  Then you get drilled down into the other numbers, of course, there's a lot of black pills flying
[03:21:34.740 --> 03:21:38.080]  around over the past couple of days with Republicans.
[03:21:38.080 --> 03:21:42.200]  Some people saying the Trump candidate's underperformed because Trump is toxic.
[03:21:42.200 --> 03:21:45.280]  There's no more room for Trump that he should step aside.
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:47.000]  It's time for DeSantis.
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:52.600]  Other people saying the GOP establishment sabotage Trump candidates withdrew the funding, even
[03:21:52.600 --> 03:21:56.080]  used funding to attack them.
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:59.880]  In the primaries, of course, that's a different debate.
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:06.760]  If you actually drill down into the stats, as represented with them, 70% of 18 to 19-year-olds
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:11.440]  vote a Democrat, and this is literally the TikTok vote.
[03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:15.720]  In fact, top Democrat operatives came out and celebrated this on the night, one saying
[03:22:15.720 --> 03:22:19.200]  if not for voters under 30 tonight, it would have been a red wave.
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:23.440]  The argument is, as they get older, more and more of them will vote Republican, they'll
[03:22:23.440 --> 03:22:27.720]  stop voting Democrat, but again, these people are 18 to 29 years old.
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:30.640]  How long is that going to take, 20 years, 30 years?
[03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:33.680]  Do we really have that length of time?
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:40.040]  Given the stats on migrant voters, obviously second, third generation, where you have a
[03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:49.040]  situation where the percentage of white voters, 73% white voters making up the total vote
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:57.920]  in population, 73%, 58% voted Republican, but then you have a 27% non-white voters across
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:23:04.720]  the entire United States, and I think the numbers were what, 68% voted for Democrat.
[03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:09.160]  If you continue to have mass migration, if you continue to have a complete absence of
[03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:13.880]  border control, anchor babies and everything that goes with it, that's just going to get
[03:23:13.880 --> 03:23:16.880]  worse every two years.
[03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:20.280]  Media says you're not even allowed to talk about replacement migration because it's a
[03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:25.720]  dangerous right-wing conspiracy theory, yet in every single election, we see those numbers
[03:23:25.720 --> 03:23:28.680]  creep up time and time again.
[03:23:28.680 --> 03:23:35.600]  And again, going back to the Zoomer thing, no Republican in any key race campaigned via
[03:23:35.600 --> 03:23:37.440]  TikTok videos.
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:43.040]  In the most competitive Senate races, and NBC News reported on this before the election,
[03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:49.400]  the four top Democrats in those key battleground Senate races posted regularly to TikTok.
[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:53.680]  TikTok is absolutely huge and it's only getting bigger, just because the Republican
[03:23:53.680 --> 03:24:00.160]  party barely understands what it is and doesn't use it at all, that's not an excuse.
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:04.960]  They're posting 10-second cringe dance videos on TikTok, Beto O'Rourke and all these are
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:05.960]  the candidates.
[03:24:05.960 --> 03:24:10.280]  Not in his case, obviously, because he got crushed, but this is how they're reaching
[03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:12.600]  the Zoomers.
[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:18.880]  Cell phone addicted, 10-second attention span Generation Z. They're watching these cringe
[03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:23.680]  TikTok dance routines and they're saying, I'm going to go out and vote Democrat because
[03:24:23.680 --> 03:24:29.200]  I want to have promiscuous degenerate sex until I'm 30, 35, and if someone gets pregnant
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:34.280]  and I need to terminate the baby, that's how they're reaching Generation Z.
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:39.760]  So again, Republicans pretending that that doesn't exist as a key demographic and ignoring
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:45.560]  how to do proper outreach by campaigning on TikTok is partly why they got absolutely
[03:24:45.560 --> 03:24:48.240]  crushed in that Zoomer vote.
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:54.920]  Of course, TikTok being what is the most censorious platform in terms of social media in existence
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:25:00.840]  ever, they will ban conservative content on a whim because of their mass flagging system,
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:04.960]  where if you say anything right of Stalin, you get your account new straight away.
[03:25:04.960 --> 03:25:10.400]  Big problem, I mean, people will claim we've solved it to some degree with Elon taking
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:16.160]  over Twitter, but you really need to focus on TikTok for the 2024 presidential election
[03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:20.560]  because that is where the Zoomer vote lies.
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:27.680]  We also had the issue of abortion on the ballot in numerous states, including the deep red
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:32.200]  states of Kentucky and Montana, they had a measure which would have asserted there's
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:38.320]  no right to abortion in the Kentucky State Constitution, that failed in Kentucky.
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:43.360]  We also had a measure in Montana, the red state, which would have criminalized healthcare
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:50.640]  workers not trying to save the life of a living baby after birth.
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:54.240]  That failed in Montana, really?
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:56.920]  If that's true, then that is a huge black pill.
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:26:02.840]  They're literally saying a child born either during abortion prematurely should be left
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:09.920]  to die outside the womb, and they passed that or didn't pass it in that case in Montana.
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:12.040]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:18.680]  The other argument, aside from the GOP establishment sabotaging MAGA candidates, is that all this
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:25.560]  talk of a red wave produced some kind of lax, blasé overconfidence within Republican voters,
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:29.160]  and many of them couldn't be asked to get off the sofa and go and vote.
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:32.000]  They thought it was a done deal, they thought it was a lock-in.
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  We were told before the election that the Congress, the House, was an absolute lock-in.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:40.480]  Massive giant overwhelming Republican gains.
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:45.720]  Now they're still fighting, struggling as we wait until next week or next month or next
[03:26:45.720 --> 03:26:52.080]  year, whenever the heck it will be, to actually achieve that 5C gain that they needed to take
[03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:53.080]  the House.
[03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:57.880]  I mean, it's still probable they will, but it's not certain.
[03:26:57.880 --> 03:27:04.480]  So was their vast overconfidence, naivety, blasé thinking in the fact that Republicans
[03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:07.600]  didn't get off their ass, didn't get off the sofa and go and vote?
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:10.280]  There's also the question about independence.
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:15.160]  Did they really buy into this hysteria, which was funneled through the legacy media in the
[03:27:15.160 --> 03:27:21.560]  weeks before the vote, that if the Republicans performed well facilitating the return of
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:25.960]  Trump, Trump of course expected to make an announcement within days whether that happens
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:28.080]  will remain to be seen.
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:33.800]  But if Republicans won big this time around, that would be Trump would become the dictator.
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:37.600]  There'd be no more elections ever again and Republicans would literally try to kill your
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:38.600]  kids.
[03:27:38.600 --> 03:27:43.560]  That's actually what top Democrats got up on NBC News and other platforms and said,
[03:27:43.560 --> 03:27:47.880]  did they actually believe that and did they go out and vote for Democrats in far larger
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:54.400]  numbers than we expected, really believing that the voting system democracy itself was
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:56.400]  at risk?
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:59.720]  I suggest not, but apparently that's one of the arguments going around.
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:05.240]  Meanwhile, Biden says he plans to change nothing in the wake of red wave evaporating.
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:10.920]  So of course, you still have these polls, 73% on a CNN exit poll, 75% on other polls
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:15.240]  saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the way the country was going.
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:19.680]  Did that mean Biden would want to change any of his approach going into the next two years?
[03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:26.800]  No, we told reporters today that he planned to change absolutely nothing.
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:29.800]  Analysts warns there probably won't be an election in 2024.
[03:28:29.800 --> 03:28:34.480]  This is Martin Armstrong has been very accurate in his previous predictions saying there may
[03:28:34.480 --> 03:28:40.680]  not be an election in 2024 that United States may not exist after 2032 due to massive societal
[03:28:40.680 --> 03:28:47.200]  upheaval and financial collapse and people not trusting the election system to run fair
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:49.120]  to even count their votes.
[03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:50.120]  Incredible.

[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:33.720]  testing internationally from the summit.news headquarters in the united kingdom it's paul
[03:33:33.720 --> 03:33:43.960]  joseph watson you're back and let's get into some of the covid news because yes covid still
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:50.240]  is a thing i read today that they're talking about discovering a deadly new variant still
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:55.080]  threatening that there could be new more deadly variants than omicron which wouldn't be hard
[03:33:55.080 --> 03:34:01.160]  because it was basically less than the common cold i've literally had the latest version
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:07.920]  of covid now about three times over the past three months i've had way worse colds it was
[03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:13.480]  literally a 10 12 hour thing and i'm completely over it yeah they're still fear mongering
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:18.960]  they're still brow beating into the public that it's going to come back whether that
[03:34:18.960 --> 03:34:22.520]  is this winter or not whether they try to introduce reintroduce all the restrictions
[03:34:22.520 --> 03:34:28.480]  remains to be seen we have this story today fiza boasts of multi-billion dollar covid
[03:34:28.480 --> 03:34:36.240]  vaccine franchises it marks up price of vaccine by 10 000 percent keep taking your booster
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:42.000]  this is fiza's chief financial officer who boasted in an earnings call with investors
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:48.240]  david denton that the virus had become quote somewhat like the flu can't say that six months
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:53.320]  ago if you said that you'd be band and de platformed but more deadly and that the vaccines
[03:34:53.320 --> 03:34:58.560]  and antivirals produced by fiza's to combat it would be relevant for many years to come
[03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:03.000]  and that's quite convenient for them isn't it because they want to meet a projected revenue
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:10.600]  target this year of 32 billion on the covid vaccine and the antivirals alone how are they
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:17.320]  going to do that after previously receiving 80 billion in profit from sales of covid vaccines
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:21.960]  well they're going to triple the price and they're going to mark it up by 10 000 percent
[03:35:21.960 --> 03:35:27.240]  so they previously charged governments 19 to 30 dollars for each dose of the vaccine
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:33.000]  and they're going to hike that up to 130 dollars presumably because far less people are going
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:40.280]  to take it so they need to make that margin so they're going to hike it by 10 000 percent
[03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:46.040]  peter may barduck director access to medicines at public citizen said fiza would already
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:52.520]  made obscene profits no 80 billion profit that's not enough with the company having
[03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:59.920]  grossed 40 billion in 2019 41 billion in 2020 and a projected revenue of total pharmaceutical
[03:35:59.920 --> 03:36:06.600]  pharmaceutical sales of 102 billion in total revenue this year now it's not enough they
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:13.120]  need more take your booster meanwhile striking correlation between autumn vaccine boosters
[03:36:13.120 --> 03:36:20.720]  and excess deaths in england as total non-covid excess deaths top 23 000 this is still a situation
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:26.240]  that's developing in the united kingdom with barely any media attention the excess deaths
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:34.000]  crisis continues 1232 excess deaths 12.3 percent above the five-year average again when the
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:38.360]  excess deaths due to covid everybody freaked out about it when it's probably due to the
[03:36:38.360 --> 03:36:44.360]  vaccine nobody cares registered in england and wales in the week ending october 28th
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:50.680]  according to the ons of these 804 were attributed to an underlying cause other than covid 19
[03:36:50.680 --> 03:36:58.920]  bringing the total excess non-covid deaths since the wave began in april to 23 000 they're
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:04.320]  saying that many of the high excess deaths are heart related what a surprise they continue
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:08.360]  throughout the summer and didn't drop off as the booster campaign finished and as the
[03:37:08.360 --> 03:37:16.760]  graph shows in this article on dailyskeptic.org the boosters are directly in correlation with
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:21.360]  the excess deaths but i'm sure that is just a coincidence and no one needs to worry about
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:27.800]  it get your seventh booster Pfizer needs 102 billion more in profits this year meanwhile
[03:37:27.800 --> 03:37:33.120]  covid commemoration you must be joking again in the united kingdom of course we had the
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:38.920]  loyalty oath to the regime here for about a period of six to seven months which was people
[03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:45.080]  literally going outside their front doors at 8 p.m. every night and applauding the NHS
[03:37:45.080 --> 03:37:50.160]  the health workers as they were busy doing tiktok dances in empty hospitals it was a
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:55.280]  loyalty oath to the regime to the narrative to the message and now in a sense they're
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:38:01.360]  trying to bring this back we have a new commission in the uk which is suggesting we remember those
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:06.280]  who lost their lives and those who cared for those in need when the hospitals were 40%
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:11.840]  empty as well as those who kept our essential services running by having a commemoration
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:16.080]  and they're trying to decide on which day we have this commemoration a national day
[03:38:16.080 --> 03:38:21.160]  of remembrance of course this will be completely hijacked it won't be a day of remembrance
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:26.840]  for any of the people who died from vaccine injuries it will be a day of regime narrative
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:32.000]  with loyalty oath reinforcement so they're saying should it be on march the fifth the
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:36.680]  announcement of the first covid death in the uk or should it be on march the 11th which
[03:38:36.680 --> 03:38:43.560]  is when the who declared the pandemic again in homage to the who should it be march the
[03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:50.000]  23rd which was the date when the uk was placed under lockdown so they're literally pushing
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:57.960]  potentially the anniversary of lockdown to be the covid commemoration day to bolster
[03:38:57.960 --> 03:39:03.560]  the crumbling regime narrative that lockdown was anything other than an absolute outrage
[03:39:03.560 --> 03:39:11.200]  which will end up killing more people than covid virus could ever dream to kill the thousands
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:17.760]  of untreated cancers people not being allowed to go to funerals to bury their own parents
[03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:23.800]  suicide rates spiking in young children speech delayed developments in toddlers now soaring
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:30.480]  300 400 percent knock on effects for years and years to come economic decline poverty
[03:39:30.480 --> 03:39:35.360]  death for years and years to come now they're saying we need to have a day to commemorate
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:42.720]  all that like it was a good thing absolutely disgraceful meanwhile research countries
[03:39:42.720 --> 03:39:49.400]  that sought zero covid lockdowns had the least immunity oh my god what a spide who knew that
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:55.400]  locking yourself indoors for two years and not even exposing your body to viruses developing
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:02.040]  natural immunity which is what's protected the human body from viruses for millennia
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:06.280]  that that would lead to people having bad immune systems that don't function properly
[03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:13.280]  anymore I went to a family wedding a couple of weeks ago with elderly people generally
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:18.920]  who had had three or four vaccines half of them had covid and was spluttering into their
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:23.560]  face masks half of them weren't even able to attend the wedding because they were at
[03:40:23.560 --> 03:40:34.480]  home with covid again all triple or quadruple jabbed I was fine on vax healthy immune system
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:37.760]  new researchers revealed that countries that implemented the harshest lockdowns are part
[03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:42.680]  of the zero covid policies which of course China is now continuing now have the least
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:48.800]  immunity from the virus itself this is a study by the Institute of health metrics and evaluation
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:53.280]  University of Washington which estimates that China which still has multiple lockdowns in
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:41:00.800]  place as the lowest level of immunity to covid 19 on the planet and yet they're still announcing
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:05.440]  snap covid lockdowns where people are literally in shopping malls in supermarkets and they
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:10.760]  announced a snap covid lockdown and they all pile out the door to try and get home before
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:18.240]  they're arrested and thrown in a containment gulag a quarantine gulag absolutely incredible
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:23.280]  that that is even still happening other nations that didn't institute harsh lockdowns including
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:27.600]  Russia Singapore and Brazil are thought to have the highest immunity level so all those
[03:41:27.600 --> 03:41:33.040]  countries are recovering way quicker then of course you look at Sweden which was absolutely
[03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:38.160]  savage during the early days of the covid lockdowns as basically accusing the government
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:46.040]  of killing their own people guess which country has the lowest pandemic mortality in the entire
[03:41:46.040 --> 03:41:52.680]  world as we move what two and a half years past the first covid lockdown it's Sweden
[03:41:52.680 --> 03:41:58.720]  what a surprise as this article points out again in the daily skeptic Sweden did much
[03:41:58.720 --> 03:42:04.720]  much better 10 times better than Chile notorious for having the strictest lockdowns despite
[03:42:04.720 --> 03:42:11.000]  also having one of the most successful vaccination campaigns so Chile vaccinated vast quantities
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:17.720]  of their population strictest most draconian most totalitarian lockdown in the early days
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:23.320]  and it has exceedingly high mortality rates whereas Sweden is right at the top of this
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:28.560]  table and that's a good thing being at the top of the table for having low covid mortality
[03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:33.560]  Sweden of course having not locked down having not forced their population to wear masks
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:38.800]  and having not enforced the vaccination vaccine mandates preventing people from going out
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:44.800]  going to bars restaurants traveling more so than any of its neighbors any other European
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:50.600]  country Sweden has come out on top exactly as we predicted summit don't use we'll be

[03:47:15.760 --> 03:47:24.240]  we've got three quick videos that i want to throw to in this final segment but first
[03:47:24.240 --> 03:47:29.780]  we need to talk about this and it's something i've predicted uk man sent to prison for six
[03:47:29.780 --> 03:47:34.840]  months for serving snacks at club during lockdown again we've literally got police dancing
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:39.640]  in a macarena at gay pride parades arresting pregnant mothers in their own kitchen for
[03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:44.760]  being transphobic on twitter but they're really cracking down on hardcore criminals because
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:49.760]  a 72 year old man has been sentenced to six months in prison for the crime of serving
[03:47:49.760 --> 03:47:55.600]  mince pies with wine at his shooting club in 2020 while the area was under a lockdown
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:48:01.560]  bbc reports morris snelling broke tfv three restrictions at cloudside shooting grounds
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:07.960]  in 2020 by allowing people to sit in at his premises rather than take away oh my god the
[03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:16.000]  absolute gall of it mr snelling pleaded guilty god knows why probably couldn't afford a proper
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:20.360]  lawyer to perverting the course of just argued that his club was in the area where restriction
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:24.880]  state of visitors could sit inside and consume drinks if they were accompanied by food so
[03:48:24.880 --> 03:48:31.920]  he's basically broken a technicality a stupid farcical thing at the time where they had to
[03:48:31.920 --> 03:48:36.240]  for example if you went into a pub you couldn't just have a pint of beer you had to have a
[03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:42.360]  scotch egg because then the pub would be classified as a restaurant he violated that technicality
[03:48:42.360 --> 03:48:48.040]  and now he faces six months in prison absolute clown world and on the subject of crime in
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:53.160]  the united kingdom let's go to this video now because again i predicted this a year ago
[03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:59.040]  this video is called i knew this would happen let's roll it well they're still not listening
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:05.120]  to a word we say partly thanks to woke policing we've now reached an ominous milestone crime
[03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:10.960]  in england and wales just hit an all time high while police are solving the lowest proportion
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:16.680]  of crimes on record a telegraph reports only five point four percent of all crimes resulted
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:20.720]  in a charge in the year to june equivalent to just over one in twenty offences being
[03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:24.800]  solved that represents a fall from six point five percent in the previous year and is just
[03:49:24.800 --> 03:49:29.360]  a third of the charging rate of fifteen point five percent seven years ago when records began
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:35.680]  recorded offences also hit six point five million an all time historic high gee i wonder
[03:49:35.680 --> 03:49:43.520]  what could have been happening to exacerbate all this i mean police may not be able to
[03:49:43.520 --> 03:49:48.720]  respond to burglaries car thefts and all manner of other crimes but you can sleep safe tonight
[03:49:48.720 --> 03:49:53.800]  comforted by the thought that the real criminals are on the run like this wife of a priest and
[03:49:53.800 --> 03:49:57.880]  mother of five who was arrested in her own home for posting offensive things about transgenders
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:02.160]  on the internet you don't think i'll even bother lock in the door when i go to bed tonight
[03:50:02.160 --> 03:50:06.360]  politicians must hold police chiefs to account for addressing these mainstream concerns rather
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:11.840]  than allowing them to fix a on pronouns privilege and identity politics said rory george again
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:16.280]  a former special advisor to borris johnson on criminal justice but political correctness
[03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:21.920]  is just being nice to people who isn't this is yet another example where political correctness
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:27.360]  leads to real world harm the more resources you devote to policing people's speech the
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:32.840]  fewer resources will be left to prevent and investigate actual crimes list trust promised
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:37.400]  to do something about all this when she was prime minister for about five minutes was
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:42.320]  rishi sunak promised to do about it nothing meanwhile police are selling members of the
[03:50:42.320 --> 03:50:47.720]  public not to intervene when just stop oil activists break the law by blocking major
[03:50:47.720 --> 03:50:52.840]  roads oh just let the police handle it yeah and what are the police doing nothing giving
[03:50:52.840 --> 03:51:03.120]  them cups of tea counseling and dancing with them in the street maybe if you get the activists
[03:51:03.120 --> 03:51:08.280]  to call you a mean name or post an insult on twitter they'll send the riot cops steaming
[03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:16.240]  in no questions asked right bar reports stop debating gender on twitter and solve real
[03:51:16.240 --> 03:51:21.880]  crimes braverment tells police chiefs this is uk home secretary suella braverment who
[03:51:21.880 --> 03:51:26.000]  was called on the british police to focus on solving actual crimes rather than debating
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:31.400]  gender on twitter in a new speech of course suella braverment being the home secretary
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:36.240]  actually trying to crack down on illegal migration well we now have a situation where these boat
[03:51:36.240 --> 03:51:41.520]  migrants are arriving on british shores and then just running off into local towns and
[03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:47.040]  committing crimes we had a case two weeks ago of one breaking into a woman's home local
[03:51:47.040 --> 03:51:51.240]  residents are now having to arm themselves with baseball bats or whatever they can get
[03:51:51.240 --> 03:51:56.680]  their hands on to defend their homes against illegal migrants invading british shores but
[03:51:56.680 --> 03:52:03.120]  people were more outraged about suella braverment using the word invasion and on that subject
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:08.680]  let's go to this video because previously the british government were housing migrants
[03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:14.360]  at taxpayer expense of seven million pounds a day in four star hotels but now they're
[03:52:14.360 --> 03:52:21.040]  actually housing them in five star hotels in absolute luxury this video is called it
[03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:27.080]  beggars belief here it is here we go again every day i think surely it can't get any
[03:52:27.080 --> 03:52:32.600]  worse then it gets even worse yesterday i told you about the four star hotel in central
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:37.880]  ips which being used to house illegal boat migrants four star that's for peasants the
[03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:44.320]  sun reports that the government is now using some five star hotels to house illegal migrants
[03:52:44.320 --> 03:52:49.360]  at taxpayer expense of seven million pounds a day one in four of the hotels used to house
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:54.480]  them are rated in the top brackets denoting class and some high-end resorts nationwide
[03:52:54.480 --> 03:52:58.880]  are being blocked booked for months home office officials are sitting refreshing booking
[03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:03.320]  dot com in the hunt for more capacity a source said pushing up prices for brits looking to
[03:53:03.320 --> 03:53:07.880]  go away at christmas and the new year has supplied dwindles great howlingbury manner
[03:53:07.880 --> 03:53:14.400]  of four star tutor style hotel in sx is now being used to house migrants it has 44 double
[03:53:14.400 --> 03:53:19.160]  rooms 20 rooms in chalets in its wooded grounds in its own lake picnic area above the cube
[03:53:19.160 --> 03:53:24.200]  that's better accommodation the most brits can afford but get this it's still not good
[03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:29.320]  enough for the migrants according to one employee quote they have the run of the hotel the bedrooms
[03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:35.080]  are very comfortable three meals a day but some have complained about the food no doubt
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:39.600]  they're whining about the wi-fi connection too maybe the evening turned down service
[03:53:39.600 --> 03:53:46.280]  just isn't up to par the employee also revealed quote there are about 50 men all between 20
[03:53:46.280 --> 03:53:53.400]  to 40 from north africa again all young men no women or children economic migrants not
[03:53:53.400 --> 03:53:58.200]  refugees another hotel being used for the same purpose is the dolphin in beside the

[03:54:08.040 --> 03:54:12.760]  into their rooms local said people used to spend a fortune to stay here or live along
[03:54:12.760 --> 03:54:18.880]  the river so they're doing very well meanwhile new census data reveals that one in six people
[03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:23.440]  now living in england and wales were born in a foreign country this was all started
[03:54:23.440 --> 03:54:29.440]  by the black government and rapidly accelerated by the Tories and yet there's still more outrage
[03:54:29.440 --> 03:54:38.880]  about overcrowding at the manstone facility and suella braver man using a mean word now
[03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:43.320]  there are so many of these boat migrants coming into the south coast right now again some
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:48.320]  of them being given a taxi service by our own border force at the best of leftist NGOs
[03:54:48.320 --> 03:54:53.280]  who are working with criminal people smugglers there are so many coming in that they can't
[03:54:53.280 --> 03:55:00.000]  buy up enough four and five star hotels on the outskirts of major cities to house all
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:06.400]  these migrants in of course the previous system worked in which they would buy up parts of
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:10.400]  hotels they would rent parts of hotels the government would pay the hotels to rent the
[03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:16.160]  rooms for migrants but then you had holidaymakers stop tourists staying in the same hotels and
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:20.800]  they would of course be aghast at the behavior of the migrants now they have to buy up entire
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:26.880]  hotels and that's happening in ip switch where they now have to buy up major tourist area
[03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:31.760]  hotels in the center of major towns and cities in britain to house these migrants because
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:37.360]  there are so many coming in they're just running out of space people are booking months in advance
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:42.720]  posh hotels four five star hotels for their wedding celebrations the hotels are phoning
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:48.560]  them up and saying now your wedding is cancelled because we need to house illegal migrants
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:53.840]  four out of ten of whom are coming from albania a country which isn't even at war
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:59.360]  they're drug dealers they're criminals and we're just housing them at taxpayer expense
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:04.560]  in four and five star hotels then you get situations like that that happened up in
[03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:09.280]  wigan in northern england where some of these migrants obviously they get bored they've got
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:14.400]  nothing to do they go around harassing and stalking women in a hotel near wigan where
[03:56:14.400 --> 03:56:19.920]  these migrants were staying you have a high school nearby where 12 13 14 year old girls
