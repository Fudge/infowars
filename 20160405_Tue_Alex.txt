[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Worldwide Tuesday edition.
[00:05.520 --> 00:06.520]  Stay with us.
[00:06.520 --> 00:13.240]  As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the Azan at the break
[00:13.240 --> 00:14.240]  of dawn.
[00:14.240 --> 00:22.160]  I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed.
[00:22.160 --> 00:24.360]  That experience guides my conviction.
[00:24.360 --> 00:28.280]  America is not and never will be at war with Islam.
[00:28.280 --> 00:35.200]  Once again, the Muslim disguised as our commander-in-chief has openly scoffed at the reality of our national
[00:35.200 --> 00:36.200]  security.
[00:36.200 --> 00:42.280]  MRCTV reports the White House briefly pulled video of a press event on terrorism with President
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.760]  Obama and when it reappeared on the White House.gov website and YouTube, the audio of
[00:47.760 --> 00:53.480]  French President Hollande's translator goes silent, beginning with the words Islamist
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.120]  terrorism, then begins again at the end of his sentence.
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.480]  In the audio of Hollande saying the words Islamist terrorism in French have apparently
[01:03.480 --> 01:13.400]  been edited from the video.
[01:13.400 --> 01:16.360]  And this pattern has been repeating itself for years.
[01:16.360 --> 01:20.560]  I don't quibble with labels.
[01:20.560 --> 01:24.400]  Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism.
[01:24.400 --> 01:27.360]  It is an important part of promoting peace.
[01:27.360 --> 01:30.640]  Is violent Islamist extremism at war with us?
[01:30.640 --> 01:32.240]  No, sir.
[01:32.240 --> 01:35.160]  We are being attacked by al-Qaeda and its allies.
[01:35.160 --> 01:41.080]  Is al-Qaeda, can it be described as being an exponent of violent Islamist extremism?
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.760]  The al-Qaeda are murderers with ideological agenda.
[01:44.760 --> 01:45.760]  No, I wasn't my question.
[01:45.760 --> 01:54.000]  My question was, is al-Qaeda acting out violent Islamist extremism?
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.680]  Al-Qaeda is a violent organization dedicated to overthrowing the values that we intend
[01:59.680 --> 02:00.680]  to advance.
[02:00.680 --> 02:01.680]  Yes or no?
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.080]  Can I hear the question again?
[02:05.080 --> 02:09.880]  Yes, again, could one of these three individuals have been incited by radical Islam?
[02:09.880 --> 02:11.640]  Apparently, you feel that they could have been.
[02:11.640 --> 02:16.280]  Well, I think potentially incited by a few of Islam that is inconsistent with history.
[02:16.280 --> 02:18.920]  It is hard to get an answer yes or no.
[02:18.920 --> 02:23.680]  They're unwilling to even mention a term when all over the world this is happening and it's
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.640]  going to start happening more and more here because we're allowing so many in is just incredible.
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.680]  Why is Islamic terrorism such a dirty phrase to the Obama administration?
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.480]  Intelligence officials in Pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist network Islamic
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.120]  State has admitted receiving funds transferred via the U.S.
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.400]  He made the confession while being interrogated.
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.160]  Today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.160]  firepower, Stinger missiles.
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.680]  It was a willful decision, a willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafist
[02:55.680 --> 02:56.680]  out.
[02:56.680 --> 03:02.160]  But a willful decision to do what they're doing, which you have to really ask the president
[03:02.160 --> 03:04.560]  what is it that he actually is doing?
[03:04.560 --> 03:05.560]  It's simple.
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.560]  The Obama administration and the Muslim Brotherhood are one in the same.
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.760]  Back in June of 2015, the Washington Times reported that the policy of backing the Muslim
[03:15.760 --> 03:21.320]  Brotherhood is outlined in a secret directive called Presidential Study Directive 11 or
[03:21.320 --> 03:22.520]  PSD 11.
[03:22.520 --> 03:28.120]  The directive was produced in 2011 and outlines the administration's support for political
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.680]  reform, i.e. regime change in the Middle East and North Africa.
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.480]  According to officials familiar with the classified study, efforts to force the administration
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.160]  to release the directive or portions of it under the Freedom of Information Act have
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.920]  been unsuccessful.
[03:45.920 --> 03:47.440]  American fun time is over.
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.560]  While the fear machine keeps churning, on average, kids now spend less time outside
[03:52.560 --> 03:53.880]  than prisoners.
[03:53.880 --> 03:59.880]  At least 50 ISIS supporters work at the Brussels airport and openly cheered the Paris-ISIS
[03:59.880 --> 04:00.880]  attacks.
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.160]  Obama's Iranian nuclear deal is thawing funds for global terror cells.
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.040]  U.S. commandos are scrambling to deter the activation of dirty bombs within the United
[04:11.040 --> 04:12.040]  States.
[04:12.040 --> 04:16.600]  Mexican drug cartels, supported by the big banks, are gaining new ground in the United
[04:16.600 --> 04:18.280]  States every day.
[04:18.280 --> 04:22.480]  While more Mexican civilians have been killed by the cartels, then the civilians that have
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.520]  died in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2007 combined.
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.800]  And if you thought there may have been a ray of hope, the RNC is now hijacking the popular
[04:32.800 --> 04:33.800]  vote.
[04:33.800 --> 04:37.840]  And the American dream just lays there in its hospital bed, lifeless.
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.920]  It's as if Americans have entered into a state of nationalized domestic abuse.
[04:42.920 --> 04:50.920]  Our servant, big government, beats us, insults us, refuses us, our God-given rights, and
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.080]  then arrogantly threatens to imprison us in our own home.
[04:55.080 --> 05:00.640]  But this is our house, and servants like these can be replaced.
[05:00.640 --> 05:08.000]  A member of parliament in Switzerland says the Muslim refugee crisis could trigger a
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.920]  new world war.
[05:09.920 --> 05:15.320]  Swiss people's party member Roger Kopel is warning everyone that the European migrant
[05:15.320 --> 05:20.800]  crisis is so out of control that it could lead to a full-out world war.
[05:20.800 --> 05:26.520]  He also says that civilizations that fail to secure their borders are doomed.
[05:26.520 --> 05:33.120]  Kopel's comments echo those made by numerous other prominent political and military leaders.
[05:33.120 --> 05:40.480]  Norwegian Army Chief Oden Johanesen says Europe must be prepared to fight to defend their values
[05:40.480 --> 05:42.160]  against radical Islam.
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.400]  Swedish Army General Anders Braunstrom has ordered his troops to prepare for war.
[05:48.400 --> 05:55.120]  And Swiss Army Chief Andre Blotman says the social unrest is intensifying, and citizens
[05:55.120 --> 06:00.600]  should arm themselves now, and you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[06:25.120 --> 06:28.360]  Kashima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today.
[06:28.360 --> 06:31.680]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[06:31.680 --> 06:37.160]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[06:37.160 --> 06:42.920]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[06:42.920 --> 06:44.560]  ever concerning iodine.
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.480]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[06:46.480 --> 06:50.760]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[06:50.760 --> 06:53.000]  any optimum health regimen.

[07:01.560 --> 07:07.360]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation, we have now procured the most high quality
[07:07.360 --> 07:13.280]  and potent forms of oregano oil on the market, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this
[07:13.280 --> 07:17.920]  key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to
[07:17.920 --> 07:24.040]  promote health, sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive
[07:24.040 --> 07:30.200]  ingredients, extracted directly from the wild herb, and sealed in easy to use capsules you
[07:30.200 --> 07:34.360]  will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[07:34.360 --> 07:39.000]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.800]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[07:43.800 --> 07:47.280]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[07:47.280 --> 07:52.560]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano,
[07:52.560 --> 08:00.600]  now available at infowarslife.com, that's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[08:00.600 --> 08:03.600]  We've got it.
[08:03.600 --> 08:09.280]  Thank you for your specialness coming to you.
[08:09.280 --> 08:11.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:11.280 --> 08:21.280]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[08:21.280 --> 08:32.120]  April 5th, 2016, this is an original live Tuesday broadcast.
[08:32.120 --> 08:38.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here for the next four hours today.
[08:38.400 --> 08:42.400]  Coming up, we've got Leo Zagami, I'm the latest with Vatican scandals, and boy there
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.760]  have been a lot of them coming out, he's going to be popping in from Rome.
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.080]  Wayne Madsen, he's one of the big sources in the National Enquirer article about Lion
[08:53.080 --> 08:57.800]  Ted Cruz and the DC Madame.
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.520]  His number, reportedly by radar online and others, is in that data cache, there's a federal
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.360]  judge that's blocked the release of the names, but the phone numbers have been public for
[09:09.360 --> 09:10.360]  years.
[09:10.360 --> 09:16.880]  Obviously, Deborah Jean Palfrey was a listener of this show, the DC Madame, and she was friends
[09:16.880 --> 09:24.200]  with Madsen, Madsen's also friends with her lawyer, and her lawyer is saying he may just
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.200]  ignore the federal gag order because it's public interest, but Ted Cruz is up to and
[09:28.200 --> 09:29.600]  may release it.
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.960]  The lawyer is on Friday with Madsen again.
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.840]  I say again because Madsen's coming on today, investigativejournalist4infowars.com, to break
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.360]  all of this down for us, and look, I've been working with Wayne for 18, 19 years, he's
[09:45.360 --> 09:51.200]  been working with us for about a year as a liaison writer and correspondent, officially
[09:51.200 --> 09:56.520]  getting paid some and having his expenses taken care of when he travels around to cover
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.040]  things like the mysterious death of Scalia, and he said, looks like some kind of secret
[10:02.040 --> 10:08.880]  society operation to me, looks like some type of occult, Bohemian Grove deal, and he said
[10:08.880 --> 10:16.720]  that two weeks before it was in the Washington Post that indeed it was a secret society gathering.
[10:16.720 --> 10:25.040]  There were devil paintings on every wall, paintings of devils murdering children, little
[10:25.040 --> 10:32.000]  children's beds outside each bedroom in the hallway, I mean, it is a weird facility on
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.840]  that 20,000 acre ranch run by the former black op commander, top Obama donor that Obama made
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.840]  a special award just to give him, and then it turns out it's some weird spin off of
[10:43.840 --> 10:51.400]  the Bohemian Grove and Madsen literally, literally called it, and he was on air via
[10:51.400 --> 10:54.520]  a video Skype down there with David Knight, Joe Biggs and others, and I'm like, really,
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.640]  really, you think it's occultic, come on, and I started seeing the footage, and I was
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.280]  like, whoa, and then it comes out, it is occult.
[11:04.280 --> 11:09.680]  It never ends, ladies and gentlemen, so that's the type of investigative journalist we have
[11:09.680 --> 11:15.200]  on the payroll around here, people that constantly make national news and constantly get proven
[11:15.200 --> 11:17.720]  right and accurate.
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.760]  He was the one that told us, I don't know, 16 months ago that Marco Rubio was shopping
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.840]  around a dossier on Cruz and his lady friends, and then it gets blamed on Donald Trump.
[11:28.840 --> 11:30.960]  It's just not what Donald Trump's doing.
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.000]  Donald Trump isn't running a dirty tricks operation.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.520]  So he gets accused of it when Roger Stone comes on the show, whose partner at their
[11:44.520 --> 11:47.960]  political firm is now basically according to Politico The New York Times, really the
[11:47.960 --> 11:54.080]  new head of the campaign, we're doing a face saving thing where the other gentleman, Lebowski,
[11:54.080 --> 12:01.720]  that's pun intended, not actually Lebowski from the Big Lebowski, but another fellow
[12:01.720 --> 12:05.320]  with a similar name, you know, the guy that's in all the trouble, supposedly grabbing the
[12:05.320 --> 12:08.320]  woman on the arm, looks like much too about nothing.
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.440]  He's kind of being sidelined, and now the whole hardcore camp that's actually won a
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.640]  bunch of big campaigns and stopbrokered conventions and things like that in 1980 are coming in,
[12:19.640 --> 12:26.880]  and they come out and demonize Stone when he comes on the show and talks about the fact
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.560]  that we need millions of people in Cleveland when they try to steal it, which is going
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.880]  to happen, to historically stand up and say, we're aware of the fraud you're engaged in,
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.840]  this is criminal, follow the will of the voters.
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.480]  And then MSNBC, Buzzfeed, you name it, try to imply that it's a dirty trick and that
[12:45.480 --> 12:49.400]  we're trying to overthrow an election or that we're threatening violence when we've done
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.920]  no such thing.
[12:50.920 --> 12:56.920]  You're the people trying to sell, stealing the election openly.
[12:56.920 --> 13:03.160]  And then David Knight will be running, anchoring the fourth hour today, will obviously be having
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.320]  our reporters popping back in, I'm working on getting Joe Big separately, who's on the
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.640]  East Coast, where they start in one city and then travel all the way to New York, I guess
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.280]  to confront Trump at Trump Tower, and he's been out there trying to cover the protest,
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.520]  and all he covered was a riot last night after a basketball game.
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.520]  So that video is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[13:26.520 --> 13:29.040]  We're going to be going over some of that.
[13:29.040 --> 13:36.760]  Watch drunk sports fans riot, see fires on public streets, zombies get excited over sports,
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.880]  while their country collapses.
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.080]  Watch as the zombies again go crazy.
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.760]  So we'll give you details of exactly where that happened and what unfolded coming up
[13:49.760 --> 13:56.360]  a little bit later.
[13:56.360 --> 14:01.520]  And again, that was in Villanova, but we'll give you the details in Philadelphia coming
[14:01.520 --> 14:08.240]  up when Joe Big is able to join us and able to pop in on the broadcast.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.240]  That's a pretty important story.
[14:09.240 --> 14:11.240]  I know he followed himself to infowars.
[14:11.240 --> 14:16.440]  I'm going to get some blurbs written by our writers up there to describe people in text,
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.520]  what happened, what unfolded, because it's pretty newsworthy.
[14:20.520 --> 14:25.680]  Time and time again, our reporters are so overwhelmed with the amount of news they're
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.200]  actually gathering that they don't even write a story or put a bug on the videos that then
[14:30.200 --> 14:32.200]  go viral, which is fine.
[14:32.200 --> 14:34.560]  I'd rather just get the information out.
[14:34.560 --> 14:40.640]  But the story about the Black Lives Matter crowd spitting and stomping on the American
[14:40.640 --> 14:47.080]  flag and spouting all their racism against white people, that story is in scores of newspapers
[14:47.080 --> 14:54.120]  and publications, The Blaze, The Daily Caller, you name it, just everywhere.
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.920]  But it all just originated as a video on our site.
[14:57.920 --> 14:58.920]  And I'm not complaining.
[14:58.920 --> 15:04.560]  It's just so much of what we break, so much of what we get that's exclusive, we don't
[15:04.560 --> 15:07.000]  even ever really get the credit for.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.920]  And it's important to get the credit so that we get more listeners, so that people come
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.520]  here and find the full truth of what's being broken down, not just little fragments of
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.640]  it, not just little pieces of it.
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.520]  But I'm kind of going off on a jag right now, because I'll be sitting there watching all
[15:23.520 --> 15:26.520]  this amazing footage and I'm like, where is this?
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.520]  I'll be just wondering and trying to discover for myself, where did this happen?
[15:32.520 --> 15:33.520]  Where's the crew now?
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.960]  Because they're just all over the country.
[15:35.960 --> 15:40.080]  I got Richard Reeves over here and I got Rob Do and crew over here and Joe Biggs over
[15:40.080 --> 15:41.080]  there.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.360]  I mean, it is just, it's a three-ring circus and everybody's doing a fabulous job.
[15:44.360 --> 15:49.880]  We just all need to remember that Info Wars is on the cutting edge.
[15:49.880 --> 15:52.840]  Info Wars is under attack by the White House surrogates.
[15:52.840 --> 15:55.320]  We need the support now more than ever.
[15:55.320 --> 15:59.840]  Because quite frankly, I am running through our funds to be able to cover this election
[15:59.840 --> 16:00.840]  properly right now.
[16:00.840 --> 16:03.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever that viewers and listeners shop with the
[16:03.640 --> 16:09.040]  good guys at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, whether it's water filtration systems or non-GMO
[16:09.040 --> 16:14.000]  heirloom seeds or whether it's shortwave radios or whether it's Patriot Apparel or the highest
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  quality nutraceuticals, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.120]  And by the way, bottom mineral fusion will sell out by tomorrow.
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.040]  We're going to hold back a little bit obviously for folks that are signed up for auto-ship.
[16:26.040 --> 16:32.440]  When you're signed up for auto-ship and you can cancel any time, you get 10% off and none
[16:32.440 --> 16:36.920]  of our products ever run out because we hold back reserves for folks, as you have to do,
[16:36.920 --> 16:40.320]  that are signed up for auto-ship at a small surplus as well.
[16:40.320 --> 16:43.400]  So whenever you really need something and it's sold out for everybody else, you can
[16:43.400 --> 16:46.680]  go sign up for auto-ship to get it and get 10% off.
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.720]  Also get free shipping on any order above or at or above $50.
[16:51.720 --> 16:57.920]  We have brought back the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirt, which I said was a limited edition.
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.080]  We've had six or seven others I never brought back, but this was so popular.
[17:01.080 --> 17:07.440]  I brought it back and just updated it and added the term under 2016 till the end of time.
[17:07.440 --> 17:15.640]  So Hillary for Prison 2016, the classic campaign style shirt, and then it says for Prison 2016
[17:15.640 --> 17:16.640]  till the end of time.
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.400]  And on the back, instead of it being in white, saying InfoWars.com legalized freedom, it's
[17:22.400 --> 17:28.600]  now in red, InfoWars.com legalized freedom and this too will be a limited edition shirt
[17:28.600 --> 17:36.800]  that will go out until the end of the election or until she is put in prison either way,
[17:36.800 --> 17:39.600]  which may be never.
[17:39.600 --> 17:40.600]  I don't know.
[17:40.600 --> 17:45.080]  No, let's just say it'll be limited edition until the end of the campaign season.
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.800]  One way or the other after the election, we will pull this new limited edition shirt.
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.600]  But who knows, we may just call for war crimes for her a new shirt for what happened of course
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.000]  in Benghazi and Syria and everywhere else.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.160]  That's why when we come back, it's so incredibly rich in its irony that I'm going to be breaking
[18:03.160 --> 18:04.680]  it down.
[18:04.680 --> 18:10.840]  Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump quote is the recruiting sergeant for ISIS.
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.040]  And that's a George Soros talking point they've been putting out the last year.
[18:17.040 --> 18:21.240]  They've had the Pope spouting off and others saying similar things.
[18:21.240 --> 18:27.120]  Here's the one that points out along with Rand Paul to his credit and others that Hillary
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.720]  Hancho ran the whole program at the State Department to turn Libya as a base of operations
[18:32.720 --> 18:34.360]  over to Al Qaeda.
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.320]  That's who we funded, our criminal government, illegitimate elements of it that run the country.
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.920]  And that they then sent them into Syria and other areas and they changed their name to
[18:42.920 --> 18:45.000]  ISIS to confuse the public.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.760]  And then she's saying, and I've got the clip coming up, she's saying that he is the recruiting
[18:49.760 --> 18:52.520]  sergeant, in fact, let's just play that now.
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.000]  Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is the recruiting sergeant for ISIS.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  This is a clip from Business Insider, here it is.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.280]  I think it was said just this week that the way Donald Trump talks about terrorism and
[19:05.280 --> 19:12.000]  his very insulting language toward Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant for
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.080]  ISIS.
[19:13.080 --> 19:16.880]  So you do have to walk a fine line here.
[19:16.880 --> 19:17.880]  All right.
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.440]  So no one in modern history has funded radical Muslims more than Obama and Hillary.
[19:24.440 --> 19:25.760]  No one has turned them loose.
[19:25.760 --> 19:30.160]  No one has overthrown allies like Egypt.
[19:30.160 --> 19:32.600]  No one has done things like this really in U.S. history.
[19:32.600 --> 19:37.560]  This is the most dastardly underhanded, openly evil, out of control operation.
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.760]  Then with their cohorts in Europe, the other socialists and globalists, they bring in millions
[19:41.760 --> 19:47.400]  of the Muslims from the radical areas, military-age men, 80-something percent of them, let them
[19:47.400 --> 19:51.440]  attack and then tell everybody, we've got to give our speech up or it's our fault they
[19:51.440 --> 19:52.440]  attack us.
[19:52.440 --> 19:54.440]  And that's what the government in Greece is saying.
[19:54.440 --> 19:57.480]  They're saying, capitulate to the Muslims or they'll bomb us.
[19:57.480 --> 20:05.080]  That's the leftist plan teamed up with our enemies.
[20:05.080 --> 20:11.480]  December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.
[20:11.480 --> 20:18.000]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history, the attack
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.800]  on Pearl Harbor.
[20:19.800 --> 20:27.080]  Now you can remember December 7, 1941, with the purchase of the first ever 75th anniversary
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.880]  Pearl Harbor legal tender solid gold coin from the U.S. money reserve.

[22:01.080 --> 22:05.360]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.360]  It's true.
[22:06.360 --> 22:10.120]  The municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[22:10.120 --> 22:12.600]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[22:12.600 --> 22:17.280]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[22:17.280 --> 22:24.240]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[24:28.240 --> 24:39.840]  All right, we do have a ton of guests obviously joining us today.
[24:39.840 --> 24:45.840]  We're going to look at the ongoing plan to implode Europe's sovereignty with Leo Rosami
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.000]  joining us for about 20, 30 minutes from Rome.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.280]  We're going to also look at the latest numbers with the polls out of Wisconsin and other
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.760]  key races.
[24:57.760 --> 25:05.520]  We're going to look at the latest on radical Islam and its march towards expanding its
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.360]  caliphate.
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.280]  Also a story up on infowars.com.
[25:09.280 --> 25:11.080]  The links have now been discovered.
[25:11.080 --> 25:16.000]  Soros and Ford Foundation behind the Panama Papers, financial elite hijack investigative
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.360]  journalism to attack Putin and to attack the International Football League, to attack
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.480]  millionaires, to attack Nuvo Rish and groups they don't control, which is exactly what
[25:27.480 --> 25:33.520]  I said was going on Sunday when it first broke and now that's all been confirmed.
[25:33.520 --> 25:37.800]  When you see CIA connected newspapers coming out and telling you they're going to expose
[25:37.800 --> 25:40.880]  offshore banking, give me a break, folks.
[25:40.880 --> 25:43.200]  It's a sick joke.
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.840]  It has snared Cameron's father who's in banking, but it's legal and lawful to have
[25:49.840 --> 25:51.160]  offshore money.
[25:51.160 --> 25:54.560]  You can take your after tax money and ship it overseas.
[25:54.560 --> 25:57.960]  The globalists want to get rid of that for most of the general public so you have no
[25:57.960 --> 25:59.760]  way to get out of the country with your money.
[25:59.760 --> 26:04.480]  They've changed the laws here in the U.S. to do just that.
[26:04.480 --> 26:07.960]  So it's amazing how the big banks act like we shouldn't be able to keep any of our own
[26:07.960 --> 26:11.320]  money not in their system because they want to be able to tax it, they want to be able
[26:11.320 --> 26:15.600]  to regulate it, they want to be able to do these bail-ins like they've done in Cyprus
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.880]  and Greece and other areas where the big banks or foreign banks that claim they own
[26:20.880 --> 26:24.680]  part of your national debt, they just take money directly from your bank account or out
[26:24.680 --> 26:25.680]  of your check.
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.800]  And that's why they want to force automatic transfers.
[26:28.800 --> 26:31.680]  And this digital system doesn't make things easier.
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.440]  It's creating massive identity theft, you name it, and we first reported on this more
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.520]  than a decade ago because the big banking associations were calling for it.
[26:40.520 --> 26:47.720]  Now the big five megabanks globally in the last six months have all called for ending
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.080]  cash as we know it.
[26:51.080 --> 26:59.400]  And they're calling for governments to get rid of $100 bills, $100 euro, 100 pound notes.
[26:59.400 --> 27:00.400]  They are phasing it out.
[27:00.400 --> 27:03.400]  Here's a zero hedge article up on infowars.com.
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.360]  Was there a run on the bank J.P. Morgan caps some ATM withdrawals?
[27:08.360 --> 27:14.520]  I remember about three years ago Drudge linked to our story from J.P. Morgan Chase where
[27:14.520 --> 27:20.120]  they were telling people that we're going to charge you for more than $100 withdrawals
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.480]  and that we're going to make you get a special bank account to be able to withdraw cash where
[27:24.480 --> 27:26.040]  you pay special fees.
[27:26.040 --> 27:31.800]  We had letters from listeners that showed the letter in the letterhead.
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.120]  And then once we posted it, we were sent hundreds of other scans and photos via email
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.120]  of other people's letters.
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.280]  And J.P. Morgan came out and said we were making it up and that they weren't doing it.
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.800]  So they were doing a stealth introduction to see how big the backlash would be.
[27:48.800 --> 27:50.280]  Again, we broke.
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.280]  Go back to it.
[27:51.280 --> 27:59.120]  Six, seven years ago, I forget the time, that Bank of America was starting a $5 per bank
[27:59.120 --> 28:06.120]  transaction per debit card charge every time you use a debit card.
[28:06.120 --> 28:12.040]  Our news was out there and a few months later, then it was confirmed by mainstream media.
[28:12.040 --> 28:15.360]  And again, I'm not talking about info awards always being cutting edge.
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.280]  It's just frustrating that we broke two years ago that they were completing the smuggling
[28:19.280 --> 28:22.760]  process, bringing illegals into the country.
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.720]  We broke that the board of patrol was giving them vouchers and completing the smuggling
[28:26.720 --> 28:27.720]  process.
[28:27.720 --> 28:31.560]  And it took almost a year for the mainstream media to admit that was happening and then
[28:31.560 --> 28:32.800]  nothing was done.
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.400]  And since then, it's expanded.
[28:35.400 --> 28:37.000]  And the board of patrol aren't bad people.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.240]  They want to do their job.
[28:40.240 --> 28:42.760]  It's crazy and people say, well, don't be against the immigrants.
[28:42.760 --> 28:45.280]  I'm not against non-criminal immigrants.
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.120]  But you can't not have a border and then lie to people and say you don't because the president
[28:50.120 --> 28:52.520]  has some secret order on the books.
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.520]  There it is.
[28:53.520 --> 28:56.440]  Wells Fargo denies planning to charge customers for domestic deposits.
[28:56.440 --> 28:57.640]  That was another one they denied.
[28:57.640 --> 28:58.640]  Yeah.
[28:58.640 --> 29:03.080]  There's another one you can find where it was a JPMorgan chase.
[29:03.080 --> 29:04.080]  But here it is.
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.080]  Wall Street Journal.
[29:05.080 --> 29:07.560]  Will you believe it now?
[29:07.560 --> 29:14.560]  Use ATMs to limit withdrawals for non-customers to $1,000 a day.
[29:14.560 --> 29:18.240]  And then we have another article here that they're actually ratcheting it up and expanding
[29:18.240 --> 29:19.480]  it to even their customers.
[29:19.480 --> 29:23.200]  So this is how they beta test was something that sounds reasonable and then radically
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.680]  expand it very, very quickly.
[29:25.680 --> 29:29.520]  Speaking of what's happening in the economy, US trade deficit rises to a six-month high
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.800]  of $47.1 billion for last month's numbers.
[29:33.800 --> 29:39.520]  There's some good news, March sees record gun sales, pat them on papers and rich and
[29:39.520 --> 29:42.360]  powerful respond to claim they hit billions offshore.
[29:42.360 --> 29:43.360]  We'll get to all of that.
[29:43.360 --> 29:48.400]  The latest on Trump, the latest on the campaign, and just how close are Obama and Google?
[29:48.400 --> 29:49.400]  You won't believe the answer.
[29:49.400 --> 29:51.400]  I think my audience will believe it.
[29:51.400 --> 29:52.400]  We're on the march.
[29:52.400 --> 29:54.800]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.800 --> 30:05.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, a member of parliament in Switzerland says the Muslim
[30:05.640 --> 30:09.960]  refugee crisis could trigger a new world war.
[30:09.960 --> 30:15.440]  Swiss people's party member Roger Copel is warning everyone that the European migrant
[30:15.440 --> 30:20.880]  crisis is so out of control that it could lead to a full out world war.
[30:20.880 --> 30:26.720]  He also says that civilizations that fail to secure their borders are doomed.
[30:26.720 --> 30:33.200]  Copel's comments echo those made by numerous other prominent political and military leaders.
[30:33.200 --> 30:39.560]  Norwegian Army Chief Odin Johanesson says Europe must be prepared to fight to defend
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.400]  their values against radical Islam.
[30:42.400 --> 30:48.520]  Swedish Army General Anders Bronstram has ordered his troops to prepare for war.
[30:48.520 --> 30:55.200]  And Swiss Army Chief Andre Blotman says the social unrest is intensifying, and citizens
[30:55.200 --> 31:01.680]  should arm themselves now, and you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[31:01.680 --> 31:22.040]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I got my bottle
[31:22.040 --> 31:26.560]  of brain force right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later everything
[31:26.560 --> 31:43.520]  just clears up, I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could
[31:43.520 --> 31:48.120]  not have done it without brain force, I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours
[31:48.120 --> 32:05.480]  of sleep, got up, took two more brain force, and came in, you will find brain force and
[32:05.480 --> 32:10.760]  other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[32:10.760 --> 32:21.560]  Thank you brother, it's because it also funds our operation, but doing that I know I've
[32:21.560 --> 32:22.560]  got to have the highest quality.
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.560]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[32:23.560 --> 32:24.560]  of using synthetic chemicals.
[32:24.560 --> 32:28.840]  We did the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've
[32:28.840 --> 32:33.640]  gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[32:33.640 --> 32:39.360]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[32:39.360 --> 32:44.560]  maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.320]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[32:48.320 --> 32:52.680]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I
[32:52.680 --> 32:53.680]  love it.
[32:53.680 --> 32:59.240]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[32:59.240 --> 33:12.000]  from InfoWarslife.
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, you're listening to
[33:17.480 --> 33:31.440]  Alex Jones.
[33:31.440 --> 33:34.960]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, will join us for the third hour.
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.720]  He is an InfoWars.com reporter and he's one of the main sources out there investigating
[33:40.720 --> 33:49.400]  the Ted Cruz phone number, reportedly in the data dump of the DC Madame's phone numbers.
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.880]  So they may have killed her, but they didn't stop the phone numbers from getting out and
[33:53.880 --> 34:00.560]  we are going to obviously have the DC Madame's lawyer, the late DC Madame's lawyer, on Friday
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.520]  with cutting edge breaking news.
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.760]  I'm just going to leave it at that and I'm not bragging when I point out that we're
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.560]  continually at the center of everything that's important in this country.
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.520]  It's just we understand the zeitgeist, we know what the globalists are up to.
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.520]  Just like Wayne Madsen said, this looks like Bohemian Grove.
[34:21.520 --> 34:27.200]  I sense Dick Cheney, I sense the occult, I believe this is an occult compound.
[34:27.200 --> 34:30.760]  And on air I'm like, now Wayne, I respect you, but let's be careful.
[34:30.760 --> 34:33.780]  Off air I'm like, dude, I don't want to get sued.
[34:33.780 --> 34:37.320]  And then, boom, Washington Post to get out ahead of it.
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.800]  He was part of a secret society set up from Bohemian Grove.
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.360]  On target.
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.360]  On target.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.360]  On target.
[34:48.360 --> 34:51.760]  I mean, he was friends with Palfrey, the DC Madame.
[34:51.760 --> 34:54.480]  He got her on the show exclusively.
[34:54.480 --> 34:57.440]  I told her, I said, you better watch out and tell folks you're not going to kill yourself.
[34:57.440 --> 34:58.520]  In fact, we have that clip.
[34:58.520 --> 35:03.120]  You can just go to YouTube if you want to see it and just type in Alan Jones, DC Madame.
[35:03.120 --> 35:05.720]  You can hear the full interview a few weeks before she died.
[35:05.720 --> 35:08.400]  It was found beaten up and hung in her mother's shed.
[35:08.400 --> 35:15.040]  I'm going to be talking about that and recapping it all with Wayne Madsen in the third hour
[35:15.040 --> 35:17.880]  today on the day of the night will host the fourth hour.
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.000]  I mean, I host three hours every day.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.120]  The one of my great crew members or anchors host the fourth hour.
[35:23.120 --> 35:24.840]  Some days I host the fourth hour as well.
[35:24.840 --> 35:27.760]  There's just so much news and a lot of stations, one of the fourth hours.
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.760]  That's what we're doing.
[35:28.760 --> 35:31.840]  And down the road, we'll probably add more and more live hours as well.
[35:31.840 --> 35:35.800]  If we're able to build the infill war because there's so much news breaking, we need to
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.120]  be live 24 hours a day, quite frankly.
[35:38.120 --> 35:41.840]  I just don't have the capital to do it and to be able to organize it.
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.000]  And quite frankly, there's not enough people out there that know what's going on, who could
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.920]  actually host shows at that level and not engage in co-and-tell pro or in fighting or
[35:50.920 --> 35:55.160]  other mental illnesses that seem to pledge so many other people in the patriot movement.
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.160]  But we are moving towards that and having a big effect thanks to your prayers, your
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.240]  support and more.
[36:03.240 --> 36:06.840]  Now let me get into the whole Trump situation.
[36:06.840 --> 36:08.560]  First off, I want to finish with Hillary.
[36:08.560 --> 36:09.560]  Let's play that clip again.
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.000]  Hillary says Donald Trump is the recruiting sergeant for ISIS.
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  Here's a clip.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.200]  I think it was said just this week that the way Donald Trump talks about terrorism and
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.920]  his very insulting language toward Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant for
[36:27.920 --> 36:29.560]  ISIS.
[36:29.560 --> 36:35.920]  So if you actually create ISIS out of al-Qaeda, fund them in Benghazi, give them the missiles,
[36:35.920 --> 36:39.760]  give them the weapons, give them $5 billion at least, let them launch chemical attacks
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.960]  to try to frame Assad and the Russians, you create a corridor out of Iraq and out of Saudi
[36:44.960 --> 36:53.400]  Arabia up through Syria into Turkey so your gun can ship them all to Western Europe.
[36:53.400 --> 36:55.280]  You are the literal author.
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.280]  You wrote the book on funding modern al-Qaeda ISIS.
[36:59.280 --> 37:00.880]  You are their mommy.
[37:00.880 --> 37:03.000]  You're their milk cow.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.040]  You give them their funding, their love, their protection.
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.480]  And then you blame Donald Trump, who said five years ago, don't be involved in Syrian
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.760]  civil war because we're backing al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[37:18.760 --> 37:23.520]  By the way, before they even called it ISIS, Trump has good advisors from the Pentagon,
[37:23.520 --> 37:24.840]  they're patriots.
[37:24.840 --> 37:27.160]  The names of the people they listed, I looked them up.
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.600]  I knew who one of them was and they're patriots.
[37:29.600 --> 37:31.600]  They're nationalists.
[37:31.600 --> 37:34.320]  They're for America.
[37:34.320 --> 37:37.920]  Trump revealed, he's revealed this before, but the news is saying he revealed how he's
[37:37.920 --> 37:40.560]  going to get Mexico to pay for it.
[37:40.560 --> 37:51.440]  Mexico gets, depending on the year, between $70 and $100 billion just in money transfers
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.800]  from people in the United States who have family in Mexico.
[37:56.800 --> 37:59.880]  And the Mexican government taxes that when it comes through.
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.880]  And Trump's saying, we'll put a tax on that if you don't build the wall.
[38:04.880 --> 38:05.880]  Now let's be clear.
[38:05.880 --> 38:07.520]  The Mexican people don't get anything out of this.
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.560]  The elites are using Mexico, like a outhouse or something.
[38:12.560 --> 38:14.640]  Our toxic waste is dumped there.
[38:14.640 --> 38:18.840]  They move the plants right over the borders so the coal plants run dirty.
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.120]  They force the people off their land to make them go work in these hellholes.
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.040]  Mexico City is 35 million people last time I checked.
[38:27.040 --> 38:32.960]  In the summer, the sky becomes black when the human excrement becomes a powder in the
[38:32.960 --> 38:35.960]  air.
[38:35.960 --> 38:38.680]  It is soilent green.
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.360]  And this is what globalism is and this is what it'll do to our country and the exploitation
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.040]  of those people down there.
[38:45.040 --> 38:52.360]  So they're playing saw off against each other, but here's Hillary saying she's also the only
[38:52.360 --> 38:54.080]  candidate being attacked by Wall Street.
[38:54.080 --> 39:02.480]  She has gotten more money on record from Wall Street than all other candidates combined.
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.760]  And PolitiFact, even who normally does a lot of twisting, has to say that she is pants
[39:07.760 --> 39:08.760]  on fire.
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.480]  Now what PolitiFact does is sometimes they're really accurate, other times they're not,
[39:13.480 --> 39:15.600]  but they have to be accurate sometimes or nobody would trust them.
[39:15.600 --> 39:22.960]  But yes, pants on fire, Pinocchio, 900-yard long nose, I mean this is ridiculous.
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.560]  But again, there's another line, even the way the question's asked.
[39:27.560 --> 39:33.920]  Hillary Clinton quote bashes Wall Street and capitalism like it's bad and evil for a company
[39:33.920 --> 39:35.760]  to have stock.
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.600]  That's how you build this country, that's how Europe got built, that's how the Renaissance
[39:39.600 --> 39:41.320]  got funded.
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.880]  Now you can lose it in a bad company, it's a gamble, but it's a lot better than, look
[39:45.880 --> 39:51.840]  stock started in England as everybody knows about 600 years ago because you'd buy stock
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.240]  in a ship and if you went in with 100 people and owned one one hundredth of a ship or 120th
[39:56.240 --> 39:57.760]  or whatever, you went in.
[39:57.760 --> 40:02.120]  If you lost on average 10, 15, 20% of ships, it varied.
[40:02.120 --> 40:07.760]  On a mission, a trade mission, then you wouldn't go bankrupt if you just financed everything
[40:07.760 --> 40:09.160]  in one ship.
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.960]  So you pulled your resources, you hedged your bets.
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.080]  And then on the interesting story, on the Gresham side of my mom's family, the family
[40:18.080 --> 40:24.120]  crushes a grasshopper, I'm a direct mail line from that, then through my mother's line
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.760]  on the maternal, just interesting little tidbit of some of my English background, invented
[40:28.760 --> 40:34.520]  the stock exchange, the physical stock exchange, the first stock exchange in London, England.
[40:34.520 --> 40:40.640]  Pretty interesting story there.
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.200]  I think it was just dad got his leg cut off in some famous battle and that's how they
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.040]  got their title or whatever it was, which I'm not even proud of a bunch of ancestors
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.120]  that had titles and stuff.
[40:53.120 --> 41:01.680]  And plus all those lines died where they brought in the German lines in the 1700s, but digressing
[41:01.680 --> 41:08.600]  off of those subjects, this is just the craziness of these people, the incredible deception.
[41:08.600 --> 41:09.800]  Here's the clip.
[41:09.800 --> 41:10.800]  Let me ask you this.
[41:10.800 --> 41:14.640]  You have said you would release the transcripts of these speeches when all of the other candidates
[41:14.640 --> 41:15.640]  have done.
[41:15.640 --> 41:18.840]  Bernie Sanders is the only candidate in the Democratic race and he says he's released
[41:18.840 --> 41:22.240]  all of his transcripts because he didn't give any of these paid speeches.
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.880]  What say you?
[41:23.880 --> 41:30.160]  Well, what I've said before, I will say again, I've heard him say that and, you know, look,
[41:30.160 --> 41:37.440]  I think what he's trying to imply, and I know his campaign tries to imply this, is undermining
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.880]  or again misrepresenting my record when it comes to being tough on Wall Street.
[41:42.880 --> 41:44.400]  I have a record, Chuck.
[41:44.400 --> 41:49.680]  It is out there in the public and I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary or
[41:49.680 --> 41:58.080]  actually on either side who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running
[41:58.080 --> 41:59.080]  ads against.
[41:59.080 --> 42:00.080]  Okay, that's enough.
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.600]  I don't want to hear anymore.
[42:02.600 --> 42:09.040]  That's why saying Hitler in 1940 was against the Nazi Party.
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.280]  It's that stupid of a lie.
[42:12.280 --> 42:15.120]  But her constituents want to be lied to.
[42:15.120 --> 42:16.120]  They want to be deceived.
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.840]  But it's, again, not stock exchanges that are bad, not the stock market that's bad, not
[42:21.840 --> 42:22.960]  Wall Street that's bad.
[42:22.960 --> 42:24.520]  It's the big mega banks.
[42:24.520 --> 42:30.680]  There's only five, there were six that consolidate control, that have the flash trading, the
[42:30.680 --> 42:37.600]  real-time trading, that rig the interest rates, the currency rates, and the stock market.
[42:37.600 --> 42:44.600]  And they're the private owners of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[42:44.600 --> 42:48.120]  And they're the people giving capitalism a bad name.
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.120]  They're the ones financing the gun control, financing the open borders, financing the
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.880]  too big to fail, they're the ones that get the bailouts.
[42:56.880 --> 43:03.600]  But 64%, it turned out, of the bailout money went to foreign banks in 2008, 2009.
[43:03.600 --> 43:08.640]  I mean, I can't believe I even have to sit here and cover these lies, they're so ridiculous.
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.480]  And here's the good news, actually, most people aren't buying into it.
[43:13.480 --> 43:21.840]  So that's certainly a ray of sunshine in all of this.
[43:21.840 --> 43:26.560]  Now let me go ahead and finish up with the Trump news I was mentioning.
[43:26.560 --> 43:35.600]  Poll, Trump takes 10-point lead over Cruz in Wisconsin's home stretch.
[43:35.600 --> 43:44.080]  He is now at 42 over Cruz's 32% in a bombshell new polling data from American Research Group
[43:44.080 --> 43:46.760]  that's a pretty respected group.
[43:46.760 --> 43:54.360]  The other polls show him about three to four points behind Cruz or coming into a dead heat.
[43:54.360 --> 43:58.240]  And the question is, we're going to play a clip from the lawyer here in just a moment,
[43:58.240 --> 44:03.800]  again, who's joining us Friday, Montgomery Blair Sibley, is seeking funds to release
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.160]  the DC Madame's records, because he knows he's going to get sued and attacked for probably
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.160]  indicted for violating the gag order.
[44:12.160 --> 44:21.400]  But the question is, is it the mistress news, the prostitute news coming out that's hurting
[44:21.400 --> 44:22.400]  Mr. Cruz?
[44:22.400 --> 44:29.440]  Look, I'll be honest with you, I'm a libertarian, and so I don't endorse these type of activities,
[44:29.440 --> 44:37.560]  but I also don't sit there on some high horse and say that the big sin here is that all
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.960]  evidence points towards the fact that he is quite the pepula pew, as I've said.
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.760]  The issue is that he could be blackmailed, he was going to be in the highest office if
[44:46.760 --> 44:53.680]  he has been visiting the prostitutes, and the fact that he's being anointed of the leader
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.880]  of the priesthood by Glenn Beck, who's now anointing children, I mean, next they're going
[44:57.880 --> 45:03.640]  to have orange-flavored or grape-flavored Kool-Aid in Guiana, I mean, this is getting
[45:03.640 --> 45:04.640]  really crazy.
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.860]  Especially when I know behind the scenes what a creep Glenn Beck is, and the weird stuff
[45:08.860 --> 45:11.720]  he's into, reportedly, and I don't want to sit there and attack him, but he attacks
[45:11.720 --> 45:19.280]  me as a turnabout's fair play, Glenn Beck is a would-be cult leader.
[45:19.280 --> 45:25.800]  And I guess he wants to make the messiah this Ted Cruz guy, and I'm just having trouble
[45:25.800 --> 45:26.800]  dealing with it.
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.480]  I mean, if his phone number is in the numbers, and radar online and others have gone with
[45:31.480 --> 45:36.320]  him and say, no, it's his registered phone number, and if this stuff's happening, then
[45:36.320 --> 45:38.040]  it's a serious situation.
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.480]  It's a very, very serious situation.
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.040]  And that's probably why a lot of the polls now are shifting and going for Trump.
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.040]  As we go into the election today, we're going to be following those numbers and more, and
[45:53.040 --> 45:59.440]  of course, have that right through to tomorrow with you.
[45:59.440 --> 46:02.680]  So again, we'll be following Wisconsin today, in detail, and on the nightly news, we'll
[46:02.680 --> 46:07.120]  have some expanded coverage tonight at 7 o'clock central in FullWarsNews.com.
[46:07.120 --> 46:11.480]  Corporate media finally covers Cruz's sex scandal on Eve of Wisconsin Primary, that's
[46:11.480 --> 46:16.760]  Kurt Nemo's story, story made of Troy Cruz's five-point lead over Trump in the Badger state.
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.160]  There's a lot of Christian conservatives just don't like the fact that Trump's got a hot
[46:21.160 --> 46:22.160]  Asian-European wife.
[46:22.160 --> 46:26.920]  I think there's some jealousy there, and I think, I'm not mad at you, I mean, I get
[46:26.920 --> 46:27.920]  it.
[46:27.920 --> 46:34.560]  But I mean, Trump's got his wife in a very classy pose, just showing her back naked
[46:34.560 --> 46:36.160]  in furs.
[46:36.160 --> 46:37.920]  That's a very classy thing if it's your wife.
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.280]  I mean, who doesn't want to have their wife if she's super beautiful, painted like that,
[46:42.280 --> 46:43.440]  you know, on the bedroom wall?
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.680]  I mean, I just, I don't think, you know, the image of a woman's body is evil.
[46:48.680 --> 46:56.680]  I think denigrating women against their will, hurting women is a bad thing, using women.
[46:56.680 --> 47:00.440]  But also women, you know, manipulating men is if that's bad.
[47:00.440 --> 47:06.440]  But I just don't think it's, you know, a problem with Trump, the fact that he loves life.
[47:06.440 --> 47:14.800]  The lover of life's not the sinner, but the Pharisees of our modern age, the priest class,
[47:14.800 --> 47:22.960]  want to make our normal human behaviors something we're guilty of.
[47:22.960 --> 47:26.000]  It's true, we should control them, be aware of it, that the institution of marriage is
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.560]  special and wonderful and should be held up and defended, but they'll all day lecture
[47:30.560 --> 47:36.480]  everybody and make you feel guilty for your own passions instead of feeling good about
[47:36.480 --> 47:38.480]  the good things you stand for.
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.920]  And so so many really good people never get involved because they're so humble and they're
[47:42.920 --> 47:47.760]  so upset about their own issues that they won't stand up against things a thousand times
[47:47.760 --> 47:49.480]  more evil.
[47:49.480 --> 47:55.440]  So again, I'm not going after Cruz if he had girlfriends and mistresses and he and his
[47:55.440 --> 47:56.680]  wife were broke up for a while.
[47:56.680 --> 47:59.640]  He was in Texas for three or four years while she was in DC.
[47:59.640 --> 48:00.640]  I'm not endorsing it.
[48:00.640 --> 48:01.640]  I'm not saying it's good.
[48:01.640 --> 48:04.720]  I'm just not judging him.
[48:04.720 --> 48:05.720]  I'm human too.
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.720]  So are you.
[48:06.720 --> 48:09.680]  I mean, really folks, don't throw rocks and glass houses.
[48:09.680 --> 48:13.800]  So many times people standing up the loudest bashing gay people and things like that are
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.040]  the ones that get caught in a bathroom with another guy.
[48:17.040 --> 48:18.040]  That's what I'm getting at.
[48:18.040 --> 48:20.960]  The people that all day tell you how moral they are, you better watch them.
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.920]  I grew up in a wealthy area of Dallas and our house was like one of the smaller ones
[48:26.920 --> 48:30.960]  in the neighborhood and it was a nice three story house.
[48:30.960 --> 48:38.520]  And on the golf course, you know, on the ninth hole, all nine yards and there were all these
[48:38.520 --> 48:40.120]  famous Dallas preachers.
[48:40.120 --> 48:41.760]  The televangels were based there.
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.000]  They moved to LA later and, you know, I knew their kids and their kids were trying to sell
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.320]  me drugs at age 12.
[48:48.320 --> 48:51.040]  The preachers would have super gorgeous prostitutes their house.
[48:51.040 --> 48:52.280]  I mean, I didn't know what they were then.
[48:52.280 --> 48:53.880]  Now I look back and I know what they were.
[48:53.880 --> 48:57.960]  I'd be like 14 and be like, Hey, baby, you look pretty good, you know, getting out of
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.200]  them, you know, their Mercedes and their Bentley's and everything else.
[49:01.200 --> 49:03.520]  And then I'd see them on TV begging for money.
[49:03.520 --> 49:07.200]  So that's kind of where I got that dislike for the televangelist and how fake they are
[49:07.200 --> 49:14.040]  and kind of seeing behind the scenes of all that because, you know, I witnessed it.
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.480]  I witnessed the, you know, the televangelist Christian lady that you'd see, you know, on
[49:18.480 --> 49:28.720]  TV and then, you know, we'd be at a lake party and then next door, there'd be a party.
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.480]  And I remember having older family members with me going, look at that preacher.
[49:31.480 --> 49:36.320]  And I remember my mom going, look at her in that leather outfit, David, is that a swinger
[49:36.320 --> 49:37.320]  party over there?
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.880]  You know, my mom to my dad and I'm like, what's that daddy's like, nothing, son, nothing.
[49:40.880 --> 49:41.880]  Don't worry.
[49:41.880 --> 49:47.040]  I grew up around the preachers, just running around like satanic rabbits.
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.240]  The ones you've seen on TV, a lot of the famous ones, and I just sat there and I watched it,
[49:51.240 --> 49:56.040]  you know, at the yacht club or whatever, just, just seeing their behavior.
[49:56.040 --> 50:02.880]  And so that's why Ted Cruz disgusts me and Glenn Beck and the rest of them because they're
[50:02.880 --> 50:03.880]  so, they're just pervy.
[50:03.880 --> 50:07.680]  And, you know, like Glenn Beck on national TV that time, but I became a Mormon so I
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.200]  can have sex with my wife, you know, like giggle, that weird little perv, sweatery wear,
[50:12.200 --> 50:14.720]  it's just, it's like, uh, perv alert.
[50:14.720 --> 50:15.720]  People got gaydar, man.
[50:15.720 --> 50:18.920]  I got pervar, pervertar.
[50:18.920 --> 50:22.600]  And let me tell you, that guy is a pervert, if I ever saw one, I don't know what he's
[50:22.600 --> 50:23.600]  perving into.
[50:23.600 --> 50:26.840]  I'm, I don't know anything about, I'm just gonna tell you right now, I don't like Glenn
[50:26.840 --> 50:29.160]  Beck and I had enough of, how's that sound?
[50:29.160 --> 50:33.080]  And I'm digressing and I apologize, I don't normally stoop down to that, but, but this
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.080]  is what we're covering here and, and there should be an investigation if he's connected
[50:37.080 --> 50:40.240]  to this madam that was found murdered.
[50:40.240 --> 50:41.320]  That's where I'm going.
[50:41.320 --> 50:43.520]  And that's what I had to say on that front.
[50:43.520 --> 50:49.800]  So, when we return, we are going to continue looking at the moves to get rid of cash.
[50:49.800 --> 50:53.480]  Uh, we're gonna look at the latest on the second amendment, the letters on the Panama
[50:53.480 --> 50:55.200]  Papers and so much more.
[50:55.200 --> 50:59.520]  We got a bunch of big guests joining us as well in the second, third and fourth hours
[50:59.520 --> 51:01.800]  of the day.

[54:28.000 --> 54:55.720]  You're a TV viewer, you can see me running into the studio, it's not because I'm playing
[54:55.720 --> 55:01.960]  tiddlywinks or pinnacle or marbles during the breaks, I am just busy wargaming all the
[55:01.960 --> 55:02.960]  breaking news and information.
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.400]  We're going to get John McAfee on probably today, he just contacted us, he has a business
[55:07.400 --> 55:09.440]  insider story.
[55:09.440 --> 55:15.080]  A time bomb is hidden beneath the Panama Papers and then I read the article and it's exactly
[55:15.080 --> 55:21.560]  what I was saying, that it's not one American, one top globalist, this is totally economic
[55:21.560 --> 55:25.960]  warfare to shut down every other country, every other group's offshore banking that's totally
[55:25.960 --> 55:28.080]  legal in almost all cases.
[55:28.080 --> 55:32.440]  It's all selective enforcement to create the illusion that it's all illegal and then the
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.760]  FBI in our country will just announce worldwide hegemony to put bags on your head and throw
[55:37.760 --> 55:40.360]  you on a private jet and fly you back here.
[55:40.360 --> 55:43.280]  Kidnapping, I mean that's what it is.
[55:43.280 --> 55:46.000]  And again, they're running the whole world government out of the United States and then
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.400]  we get hated for it, but we're going to get McAfee to pop in.
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.160]  Richard Reeves is going to pop in from Brookfield, Wisconsin, obviously as the election goes
[55:54.160 --> 56:00.160]  on as we speak and so much more, he'll be popping in, Leo Zagami from Rome coming up
[56:00.160 --> 56:05.040]  for the first 30 minutes of the next hour will also be joining us.
[56:05.040 --> 56:13.080]  So McAfee, Leo Zagami, Richard Reeves, the list just goes on and on, Wayne Madsen on
[56:13.080 --> 56:18.000]  the DC, Madame and more.
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.880]  I also want to get into the situation with the cash as they move to restrict that because
[56:25.880 --> 56:28.540]  that is so incredibly important.
[56:28.540 --> 56:32.880]  Also I want to talk about the fact that not all cultures are equal, okay?
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.840]  Humans are humans, humans act the same throughout history, but a lot of cultures get into systems
[56:36.840 --> 56:43.240]  of evil, whether it was the Nazis or the Communist in Russia or whatever, that becomes the culture,
[56:43.240 --> 56:44.880]  the Chinese Communist culture.
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.360]  And you're allowed in your culture to be offended by somebody else's culture.
[56:49.360 --> 56:53.320]  You know, maybe somebody doesn't think Western culture is superior if they're in the East,
[56:53.320 --> 56:57.400]  maybe they're Tibetan, that's their opinion.
[56:57.400 --> 57:02.760]  So it's all about perspective, but under multiculturalism we're supposed to honor the cultures,
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.160]  but only in the branding the establishment gives them, only the traits that the establishment
[57:07.160 --> 57:09.080]  claims those cultures have.
[57:09.080 --> 57:17.360]  China's dog meat festival appalls animal lovers and they teach the university it's racist
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.240]  if you say that you're grossed out by eating dog in Asian cultures.
[57:22.240 --> 57:28.920]  Well, no, I'm allowed to say I love dogs and I think that that is a gross thing and a weird
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.120]  aberration of some of those Asian cultures and I think it's gross, just like killing
[57:33.120 --> 57:40.600]  tigers for their member, because you think it makes you have stamina, which it doesn't.
[57:40.600 --> 57:46.480]  So you know, I'm not bashing Chinese people, but man, lay off the dog, okay?
[57:46.480 --> 57:52.400]  Come here, Americanize, don't grab my dog out of the backyard, I mean that goes on folks,
[57:52.400 --> 57:54.040]  that goes on.
[57:54.040 --> 57:59.000]  Don't be a predator on my animal, just like coyotes will eat your dog out of your backyard,
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.400]  I'm not against coyotes, that's just what they do.
[58:02.400 --> 58:06.840]  So that's all coming up, because Paul Watson did a video that has some profanity, not really
[58:06.840 --> 58:10.080]  profanity in it, he talks about some of the cultural practices that are done out there
[58:10.080 --> 58:15.000]  that I can't say on air, I forget the name of it, it's a powerful video, but it made
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.680]  me think of it, it's on his YouTube channel.
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.200]  Not all cultures are equal and he goes on to break down what he thinks the West is
[58:22.200 --> 58:23.920]  the best, so that's all coming up.
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.120]  Briefly, we're going to sell out an anthroplex that goes very well with Super Mill Vitality
[58:28.120 --> 58:33.640]  today, InfoWarsLife.com, the Secret 12 medical bottleman is back in stock, Hillary for present

[59:54.240 --> 01:00:01.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:16.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600]  Yes, you are.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]  We've got three hours.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.240]  Now laying out the forest, we've already eclipsed the first hour.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.800]  Coming up in the third hour, we're going to be joined by Wayne Madsen, investigative
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.000]  journalist for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.160]  He's in radar online.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:45.600]  He's on the Inquirer news story about Lion Ted and his number being found in the DC
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.800]  Madam's phone records cache.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.360]  We have the late DC Madam's lawyer coming on Friday with Madsen as well.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.360]  I thought I'd take you back to part of an interview I did on Fox News when she died
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.840]  back in 2008 and the article written by Paul Watson, overwhelming evidence points to murder
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.720]  of DC Madam.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:10.800]  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of a secretive society of elite hunters.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.680]  We're also investigating that mysterious death.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.840]  So we'll talk about that as well with Wayne Madsen, who called it and said, this looks
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.760]  like an occultic area.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.960]  I believe they do rituals here, Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.120]  Three weeks later, it came out in the Washington Post that it was part of a secret society
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.560]  founded by Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.560]  Talk about on target, it's actually frightening.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.200]  Truth is, Madsen just doesn't have a great nose.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.200]  He has great sources.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.920]  He was in the national security agency and covered Capitol Hill for decades and he's
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]  amazing.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.360]  I mean, the guy's been a long time spook, folks.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.520]  But he just freelances for America.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.160]  I'm kind of scared of him a little bit.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]  Let's go ahead.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.760]  He's a nice little plump, sweet little creature.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:03.880]  So that's the funny thing about guys like that is that they look so unassuming.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.320]  He's a very interesting fellow.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.720]  I wish I knew all his secrets or maybe I don't, but let's go to that clip.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.880]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.280]  I'm planning to go into court on April 7th and I plan on exposing the government in
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.000]  ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.480]  Joining me now from Austin, Texas, the well-known radio host himself, the conspiracy theorist
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.560]  and documentary filmmaker, Alex Jones.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.720]  Alex interviewed Deborah Palfrey in March of this year when she told him what you just
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.840]  heard that she would never commit suicide.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  So Alex, welcome.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840]  What do you think?
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.480]  Do you believe this to be as the authorities say it is?
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.520]  Harold, first off, thanks for having me on.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.840]  She was a very nice lady, a very genteel.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.120]  There's no doubt in my mind that she was murdered.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.080]  Let me just go through some of the basic evidence.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.680]  She told me repeatedly on my radio show, and those interviews are posted at infowars.com
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.120]  in full that she would never kill herself, that she wasn't planning to kill herself.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.480]  I pressed her during breaks in front of the board ops.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.040]  I said, listen, this is dangerous.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.120]  You've got to say who these people were, you know, do you know?
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.280]  And she said, well, I'm not going to say.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.280]  I just want this all to end.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.680]  And I said, you've got to say who it was or you're not safe.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.680]  She said, listen, I'll never kill myself if they claim that I was murdered.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.080]  So we have a tape of her saying she wouldn't commit suicide.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:21.840]  Now, NBC in Florida, where she had a condo, was reporting that one of her friends, who
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.240]  was the manager of the high-rise condos, and he's on tape saying two days before she
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.080]  was killed, before she died, she left her mothers and said, look, I'm being followed.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.120]  I think there's a contract out on me.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.000]  I'm not going to kill myself.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  This is on tape.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.120]  Then you look at Brandi Britton.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.640]  She was facing six months in jail last year, shot her mouth off, Ms. Palfrey said, that
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.880]  NBC Madam said, and said, I'm going to talk about who my Johns are.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]  This is hypocritical.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]  She was a professor.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.920]  You know, she had a psychology degree.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920]  She was saying, this is hypocritical.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.720]  I'm going to tell who my Johns were.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.200]  And then she hangs herself.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.320]  Number one, Geraldo, you've covered a lot of criminology.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.760]  You know, women don't normally hang themselves.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.400]  First one of her girls kills herself.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.360]  Now she kills herself, exactly, and on top of it.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.360]  That's it.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360]  There's more there.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360]  We're going to repost all this.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360]  Do some stories on it.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.280]  The news is tied into all this, and I tell you, they kill a lot of the women involved
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.280]  in that.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.840]  And I love how the media degrades these women, but the most powerful men and women, by the
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:28.280]  way, get these women, these high-end prostitutes, the oldest profession.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.360]  And then they sit there and talk about how bad and evil these women are, and the whole
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.320]  culture just treats them like they're trash.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:42.600]  And it's total hypocrisy, and just watching him be anointed and swiming around and everything.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.760]  I mean, look, look, lion-ted is cheating-ted.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.040]  The evidence is overwhelming, and he's also blackmail-ted, and now you know why the globalist
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.520]  like him is because, hey, they got him by the short hairs.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.520]  They got him by the way votes, just like, well, just like George Carlin said.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.800]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:13.520]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.240]  for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.920]  The memo, entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by Donald Trump senior advisor
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.080]  Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.640]  like never before to bash the Trump campaign.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.640]  As the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for Donald Trump, and they
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.360]  are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.600]  The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between Trump's rising popularity and the
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.680]  media talking points.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:55.000]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.880]  of our candidates and causes.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.520]  You'll learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:07.280]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two, supermale, brainwashed, prostagart,
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]  silver bullet.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280]  I use them all.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]  They're phenomenal.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]  They work.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]  Buy them, folks.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280]  Thank you, brother.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.400]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]  products.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400]  Welcome to the Info War.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:26.760]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760]  at the same time.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.760]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, aquafx, nasonide.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760]  Right.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760]  Have they worked for you?
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.400]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400]  What products are you taking?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.840]  Everything from supermale to brain force to winter sun, X2.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:50.480]  Even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.960]  Clean pure drinking water.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.480]  You can't survive without it.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480]  But where do you get it?
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:10.600]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]  like no other.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.960]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.080]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with

[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:07.680]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]  Don't look for it.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.200]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.440]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.600]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.160]  The real owners, the big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.800]  the important decisions.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.080]  Forget the politicians.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.960]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.160]  You don't.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.520]  You have no choice.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.720]  You have owners.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.000]  They own you.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.560]  They own everything.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.560]  They own all the important land.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.320]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.280]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, and
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.920]  the City Halls, they got the judges in their backpockets, and they own all the big media
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.760]  companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.880]  They got you by the balls.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.840]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.680]  machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.200]  pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.160]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.040]  Now they're coming for your Social Security money so they can give it to their criminal
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.800]  friends on Wall Street.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.720]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.400]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400]  You better believe it.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.680]  So what specifically did they do?
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.960]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to,
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960]  just so you understand.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960]  A lot of money.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.360]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.920]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.120]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.520]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want, they don't want a population of citizens capable
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]  of critical thinking.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.320]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.320]  They're not interested in that.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.320]  That doesn't help them.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320]  That's against their interest.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.320]  That's right.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:09.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.960]  John McAfee has a big article out dealing with the bombshell revelations hidden in the
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.440]  Panama Papers, concurring, but my analysis is that it's really a Rockefeller Soros Foundation
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:28.120]  op targeting Putin selectively, but not one person in the United States.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.640]  Also, we're going to obviously have Wayne Madsen on the murder of the DC Madame and
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.360]  the phone number now confirmed, reportedly, according to Radar Online and others, to be
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]  Ted Cruz's.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.760]  And we've been at the heart of that investigation since she was on my show two weeks before
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.480]  they murdered her.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.200]  And I've interviewed her friends, her family.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.200]  They were after her.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.360]  They said they were going to kill her.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.360]  She was hiding.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.800]  She was trying to get documents to people when they beat her up, drug her into the shed,
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.720]  and her mother's house and killed her.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.880]  And the mainstream media went along with that lie, except for Geraldo Rivera and a few others.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.760]  And as much as I disagree with Geraldo on a few issues, I think he's a very honorable
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.200]  smart man who has a lot of courage for the things he's done in the past.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.960]  That said, I disagree with him on the open borders and things like that.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:19.720]  But look, there's so much happening in this world and it all ties together.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.960]  And I want to get him on for a full hour in the near future, but he's just on with us
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.560]  for about 20 minutes right now.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560]  Leo Zagami.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.080]  Leo Zagami.com is the bestselling author worldwide.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:35.080]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he has been highly involved in the Vatican,
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.640]  been involved in some of the higher level secret societies that are based there in
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.080]  Rome's family, obviously involved in some of that.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.400]  That's how he got into all of it.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.720]  And so much of what he's talked about has ended up coming true.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.920]  Like he said, they're going to have a black pope.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.120]  It's going to be a Jesuit, probably of this individual that we now currently have.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.720]  He's talked about a lot of this.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.480]  He said a couple of years ago that this new pope would end up resigning later and setting
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.880]  the precedent that you just have popes for five to 10 years or less.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.400]  Now he's announcing that where you may have multiple popes.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.680]  So they're, they're killing the institution, whether you love it or hate it, calling for
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.000]  world government, calling for open borders, criticizing Donald Trump.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.640]  When he's got 100 to 200 foot walls, he's called for the Italian military to go into
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.360]  Macedonia and Albania to stop the Islamics pouring in, but he wants every other country
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.520]  to take these folks in.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.440]  So if you're a radio listener, he's joining us via video Skype, but if you're a TV viewer
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.440]  at infowars.com forward slash show, you can see in the background some of the amazing
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:39.640]  footage we shot last year in Rome, right above the Vatican and inside of the Vatican.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.760]  So HD footage shot by Rob doing myself there on screen.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:50.280]  Also roll HD footage of the bizarre occult compound out in Southwest Texas where Scalia
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.720]  died where there were devil masks on the main walls, little plaques of demons ripping apart
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:01.160]  and eating children and, and Wayne Matzwood is an investigative journalist par excellence.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.960]  He said, I believe this is Bohemian Grove connected and that this is Dick Cheney connected.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]  And he said, how do you know?
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.560]  And he just goes, Oh, I just have a gut feeling.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.960]  Well, no, he has sources.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.280]  And then it broke in the Washington Post that indeed it was a cult stuff going on there.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.800]  And he was part of a ancient Vatican association of the brotherhood of hunting, but that's
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.000]  a cover because they said it would, it had been destroyed by Hitler.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.080]  And so it was brought back by Bohemian Grove in 1960.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.160]  They take old orders and launch them again.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.440]  Now, if you're a new listener, this isn't Alex Jones saying this.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.800]  This is the Washington Post, Justice Scalia, spent his last hours with members of a secretive
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.200]  society of elite hunters.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.400]  This is weeks after our crew was down there and said it was like Bohemian Grove meets
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.400]  the shining.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.080]  So all this occultism ties in so I'll just boil down this in pieces with Leo Zagami with
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.080]  us right now.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.800]  We'll also talk about his latest book as well, that's also in English.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.560]  But Leo, I mean, the occultism, the secret societies, they recruit you saying it's a
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.920]  good society.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.320]  Then later you find out there's a society within a society, a society within a society.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.440]  Geopolitically, what do you make of our election?
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.200]  Donald Trump, other big stories you're working on and how this ties into Scalia?
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:19.880]  Well, Scalia was in a club in an order actually, which is called the order of St.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880]  Tumbertus.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.120]  This order is an order dedicated to hunting.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.320]  It's a knighthood order that goes back hundreds of years in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.320]  It's basically...
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320]  Yes, to Germany.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320]  Sorry?
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  To Germany.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320]  Yes.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320]  Yes.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.920]  But at the same time, like all knighthood orders, they are linked to the Vatican because
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:53.000]  there is no knighthood order that can be granted without the blessing of a church if you are
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  an aristocrat.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.480]  As this order is particularly connected to the European aristocracy, of course, is also
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  connected to the Vatican.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:11.200]  So judgeically, I found himself in an environment which is typically conservative, like the
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.960]  environment we know in Bohemian Grove, and like you said, it has connections to Bohemian
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:25.200]  Grove because some of these orders risk to be extinguished when the Nazis arrived and
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:31.760]  they first of all closed down Freemasonry and then persecuted certain knighthoods which
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.280]  they feared could be used against them.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.080]  One of them, of course, was this specific one.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:46.160]  They might have on the outside an honorable cause, which is to defend the honorability
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.920]  of a certain kind of hunting done in a traditional way and so on.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:16:00.680]  But like you said earlier, the honorable maybe outspoken endeavor of this order is not really
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680]  why they are meeting.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:09.360]  They are meeting to just make business, lobbying, and manipulating this New World Order, crafting
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:16.200]  it in a very reserved fashion in these clubs, in these orders, wherever they are in the
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.200]  world.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:24.560]  The Panama Papers that we are seeing now, of course, they are, it's a conspiracy specifically
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:32.560]  dedicated to those people who are not in line with the democratic agenda of the U.S.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.280]  So with the Soros, with Obama, and the whole show.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280]  Sure, exactly.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.240]  And they admit Bohemian Grove recreated the society, so it wasn't the original conservative
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.240]  society.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.920]  We don't even know it was authorized by the Vatican.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.600]  He goes to it even though it's run by a bunch of former Black Ops commanders and Democrats
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.360]  that are in Obama's hip pocket and that Obama hangs out with.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.160]  As to me, like he walked into a trap, we'd be insane to not investigate it.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:04.400]  The thing is, you see that this order in the specific actually is linked to the Black
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.480]  nobility of Europe.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.960]  This aristocracy, which is very close to the Vatican, is a superpower.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.360]  So you're saying he was in a super high-powered group?
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:21.920]  It was a very super high-powered group, absolutely, I mean, they are the ones who are untouched
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:28.520]  I mean, if you go and see, for example, who is being touched by these Panama Papers now
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:34.080]  scandal, the latest thing that has happened in the media, you will not see any members
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.880]  of the Bilderberg or prominent members of the Trilateral.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:49.080]  You will simply see those people, which at the moment maybe can be, let's say, an enemy
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:56.360]  to this plan, which was to install Hillary Clinton, president of the White House.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.040]  And everybody here in Europe is feeling this.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.240]  That's why they have also now exposed in the Panama Papers that a lot of money is going
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.040]  to the Le Pen family, for example, because they want to destroy the credibility of Le
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:17.240]  Pen in France and at the same time, Le Pen is connected to Matteo Salvini here in Italy,
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.200]  which is now with the Northern League taking a very strong conservative stand against this
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.200]  immigration.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:30.840]  And also, of course, we have in the Panama assets Vladimir Putin, which is really the
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:38.240]  only one who has been really fighting ISIS on the ground, not with terrorists, but with
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.720]  actual war on the ground, which cost him also a lot of soldiers.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.200]  Of course, at one point, he pulled out of the whole thing because he has probably reached
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.480]  some kind of deal at the geopolitical level, without getting into too much of the esoteric,
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.840]  looking at the election, looking at what's happening, looking at Ted Cruz, and they have
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.160]  a lot of great sources, Leo Zagami, and this is all interconnected.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.480]  What does it signify that the popes openly come out for world government, openly got
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.560]  involved in our internal elections, the Chinese communists have joined in, everybody else
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:15.480]  has joined in, we see this total demonization of Trump, I mean, from your intel, is he good,
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.880]  is he bad, do they not know who he is, so they don't want him getting in a power position
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.520]  because he's not compromised?
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.840]  I mean, to me, it looks like they're legitimately really fearful of Donald Trump.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.240]  I can see them demonizing him in case he's their operative to put him in power and fool
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.840]  the people, but they look legitimately upset right now.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:41.680]  No, they are upset, you see, I have had contact with people who are actually very close to
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:47.280]  Donald Trump here in Europe, and I see how they are operating, there are actually a lot
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:54.160]  of old friends of mine involved in this, and of course, even here in Italy, they are fearing
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:00.720]  the arrival of Donald Trump because that automatically will mean a complete change, a political change
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.560]  in Italy, in France, in Germany, everywhere in Europe.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:12.680]  So this reflection of something that could really change things scares the Democrats.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:19.480]  The Conservatives now, unfortunately, are getting corrupted, and we will see how much
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.600]  this corruption gets in the coming, of course, GOP.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.920]  Let's talk about the state.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.240]  They seem to be losing control with the corruptions coming out everywhere of every institution.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:35.720]  We're finding secret societies that are Vatican connected under every rock.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:39.400]  You know that I've never been a Catholic basher, I'm not saying it's a Catholic conspiracy,
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.520]  but clearly they've used the Catholic system and the Catholic institutions to bring in
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.520]  this Illuminati program that I know the church for many hundreds of years reportedly fought.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.880]  Some would say, though, that's really a dialectic, it's controlling it, but then separately,
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:58.960]  we've got all this other corruption coming out about the royal families and pedophilia
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.680]  and other institutions and that the interest rates are rigged and that there is a world
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.320]  government and that there are cancer viruses being added to the vaccines.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.200]  I mean, almost everything I talk about and that you talk about that was hidden is now
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.000]  just coming out in the open.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.720]  Have they lost full control?
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:20.880]  Why are they just admitting so much like, okay, we really are going to appoint whoever
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.200]  the candidates are going to be for the first time ever.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.000]  It seems to be an un-ploking.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.920]  They are scared of Donald because Donald is not part of a club of an order, doesn't care
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:38.480]  about a knighthood, doesn't care about any degree in Freemasonry that can be bestowed
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.200]  upon him as an honorary degree because he's been a good fellow in the system.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.920]  Donald really cares about the American people.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.840]  I think that that is, he's a businessman, he's a practical man.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:57.000]  He might not be a great statesman, but I'm sure he might surround himself with great
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.920]  statesmen in the future.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:05.280]  The problem is now that they might be an act of sabotage against him from the military
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.880]  industrial complex that is moved within the Republican Party nomination.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.600]  This is the real problem of now and it will reflect in the whole politics of the New World
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.600]  Order.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.320]  As opposed to the media complex globally, as the newspapers across the world collapse,
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.000]  as establishment media collapses, as new independent media that knows what it's talking
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  about explodes, there seems to be some point where the establishment has to do something
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.120]  desperate to maintain their control.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.680]  We see the attempts at censorship, we see the Muslim invasion.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.680]  How does all that tie into this?
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:44.680]  Well, they continue to pour in immigrants into Europe.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.640]  The Pope continues to say that we have to accept them.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.920]  He goes through all kinds of propaganda stunts.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:57.160]  He even washed the feats of Muslims on the day he was supposed to do the act of washing
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.920]  the feats of some faithful.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:04.800]  I really don't understand how a Pope can wash the feet of another faith, of somebody from
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.200]  another faith in an act, which is really a rearrival.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.120]  That's one world religion stuff.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.120]  Yeah, it is really in the end, like we said in the past, Alex, going towards the one
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:21.520]  world religion scenario, and these immigrants now, of course, are a lot of business also
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:29.480]  for the church and for all these hypocrites, these politicians that I'm sure if Panama
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:35.240]  is the place where a lot of conservative politicians have put their money, there is other places
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:41.040]  around the world where the democratics, the left-wingers put their own.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.760]  Well, it's come out, the French socialists literally pay almost no taxes and have Swiss
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760]  bank accounts.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.080]  People like, for example, Massimo D'Alema, who used to be a communist, he has big palaces
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.760]  in Monte Carlo, he has money all over the world, and the same is for many other political
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:04.360]  leaders of the so-called left, including, of course, people close to the Clintons.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:10.360]  So now we are in a situation in which we have to really understand that the people who are
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.240]  ruling this planet are corrupt, fundamentally they are corrupt, there's very few people
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240]  who are not.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.240]  Well, you've made a lot of predictions.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:20.160]  You wrote the book, The Last Pope, and then before that you predicted there'd be a Jesuit
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.000]  pope the first time ever, then you predicted that they would start again, as I said earlier,
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.160]  only serving five years like a tour or a term.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.080]  He's now announcing everything you said he would do because you've obviously got the
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:37.160]  valuable sources in the Vatican, so tell us, Mrs. Igami, tell us the next shoe to drop.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:42.720]  Well, last week, for example, the famous attic of Bertone, which we talked about for
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:49.200]  the first time on our special, you remember, here on Infowars that we made in Rome, was
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:56.040]  exposed even by the pope who started his own investigation against Cardinal Bertone, because
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.000]  the money to build this famous attic, which we talked about, you remember Alex in the
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.920]  documentary, this lavish place where Cardinal Tarchesio Bertone was living, was made with
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.880]  the money stolen from the church for the little children.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:21.320]  So this is the hypocrisy of the powerful people that are in the Vatican, and Tarchesio Bertone,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.000]  instead of condemning this situation, he came out and said, well, my attic is smaller than
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.680]  the ones about the 30 Cardinals living in Rome.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.760]  So there is another 30 Cardinals living in Rome who have an attic bigger than the one
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.640]  that Tarchesio Bertone has, which is several hundred square meters.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.080]  So why do we have to continue with this pathetic nonsense?
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:52.040]  I think that they are very scared because Donald Trump is a man of practical means,
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:59.840]  a man that sees also injustice when he sees it, and that he might really break this whole
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:06.840]  balance that they are achieving through selling to the people an illusion, an illusion that
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:12.720]  the pope is a holy man, that the prime minister or the president are very great people, but
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.320]  in reality, they're all corrupt.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:23.000]  Sure, I want to shift gears back to what happened to Justice Scalia, Antonin Scalia.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.480]  Do you have intel on whether he was murdered or not?
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.480]  And if so, why?
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.320]  I mean, so many key cases he was going to be hearing.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.240]  Such an important time for this to happen.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.200]  The whole thing stinks to I have in the scripting of how they announced he died, the bizarreness
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.360]  of where he died, not having the autopsy.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.880]  It's from the beginning, it was almost meant to make it suspicious.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:50.920]  Well, you see, the problem here is that the means that they might have used to kill him
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:54.600]  are now only known to intelligence services.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:02.160]  Basically, they can give you, they can insert in your systems particles and things that
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:10.000]  react in a way that is even worse than a poison and create, of course, a possible stroke
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.080]  or some kind of other illness within the matter of days.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.120]  So we might never really have a confirmation because it's literally impossible if they
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:26.960]  have not permitted even this body to be resumed or controlled in any way that you will ever
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.920]  have an answer for what you are asking me.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:37.200]  But from what they're saying here in Europe, it seems that this secret society is linked
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:44.760]  to the directly to the Club Bilderberg and to the Jesuits, not only to the Bohemian Grove,
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:50.680]  because it's linked to the some elements in the European aristocracy who are completely
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680]  behind.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.280]  Remember where one of the last meetings of the Club Bilderberg was was done.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.000]  It was done in Austria, no?
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.320]  Say that again, sir.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.720]  One of the last meetings of the Club Bilderberg was done in Austria.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.280]  And this order is linked to Austria.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  Absolutely.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.360]  Now, now expanding on this, how are things going for the globalist?
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.640]  How are things going for this power block?
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.040]  Because China, we're almost out of time, is threatening military action, there's a lot
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.960]  of fights going on with Russia.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.500]  How are things going between the different power blocks?
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.400]  What are your key points you'd like to make in closing, Leo?
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:34.240]  Well, in this power struggle, still we have to see the definite moves that will be done
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.680]  by China in the coming weeks.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:45.000]  Because I think that if China gets involved by Soros into these Panama Papers, they might
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.160]  he might risk some kind of reaction from China, and China has some very powerful assets.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.120]  They can move against Soros and, of course, the Bank of China also works very closely
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.960]  with the Rothschild Bank.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:07.920]  So it might seem like at the moment, these Panama Papers are only hitting on one direction,
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.920]  but the reflections of this scandal might actually hit the actual people who have motivated
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.360]  the CIA agents who have given that material, because that's how it is.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.360]  Sure.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.280]  The Papers are the most controlled, that's come out in the news, they put it out, they
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.000]  have it for a year to vet, to target who they want to go after, and it's clearly to just
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.200]  go after anybody that they don't control.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:35.200]  Leo Zagami, LeoZagami.com, his book, The Last Pope, available in English across the
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.200]  world.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.280]  And also, Professions Volume 1 and Volume 2, where I also mention you, Alex, and there
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.600]  is a surprise for you on Volume 2.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.800]  Surprise for me in Volume 2, I can't wait.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.080]  All right, we're going to have you on soon, buddy, thanks a lot for joining us.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.080]  I want to do an interview with you on that sometime.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.080]  Stay with us, we've got...
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.080]  McAfee joining us.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:30:20.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.640]  He also says that civilizations that fail to secure their borders are doomed.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:33.120]  Copel's comments echo those made by numerous other prominent political and military leaders.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:39.480]  Norwegian Army Chief Odin Johanesson says Europe must be prepared to fight to defend
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.320]  their values against radical Islam.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:48.440]  Swedish Army General Anders Bronstrom has ordered his troops to prepare for war.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:55.120]  And Swiss Army Chief Andre Blotman says the social unrest is intensifying, and citizens
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.320]  should arm themselves now.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.800]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.

[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here live, John McAfee,
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.720]  the inventor of one of the first and most successful antivirus programs, also an adventurer
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.720]  in his own right.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.680]  Investigative journalist running for president in 2016, the libertarian ticket.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.040]  He came out with an excellent article on Business Insider.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:53.440]  John McAfee, a time bomb, is hidden beneath the Panama Papers and we concur with his analysis.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:57.360]  Here's our article, Soros and Ford Foundation, behind the Panama Papers.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.280]  Oh my gosh, $2 billion in Russian-connected money, oh my gosh, in offshore accounts,
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:07.000]  oh my gosh, that is, is it quadrillions and fake derivatives or Bank of America taking
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.040]  houses that they never had a deed to that were paid for?
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:17.160]  Oh no, it's loan guarantees, it's Russia doing business, I'm not saying Russia doesn't
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.120]  have a bunch of mafia activities going on, that's how governments operate, I'm not defending
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:24.600]  any of it, it's just literally a joke to see this type of crud in our media where our
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.480]  media that tells us it's okay to steal popular elections from Donald Trump tells us how evil
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.440]  Vladimir Putin is, I mean give me a break.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:40.240]  We're gonna go to John McAfee, McAfee 2016.com here in just a moment.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.480]  First off though, ladies and gentlemen, it's not a glitch, it's something I noticed and
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.040]  I said we ought to advertise it because it works this way.

[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:16.040]  want to forget to get, you get 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship, you get every 15
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:22.320]  days, every 30 days, every 60 days, every 90 days, you can cancel any time.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.280]  And it is 10% off your order when you do that.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.840]  Well, we always hold back a surplus for people that have signed up for auto-ship and I made
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.680]  the point that if people guaranteed we're gonna order something, we could factor that
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.760]  in and hold back more so that we never sold out of some of the key items because we sell
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.720]  out of a lot of it because it's hard to get super high quality organics always and so
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.280]  sometimes we just don't have it so we can't produce it at some of the top labs in the
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.480]  country that m4slife uses.
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.680]  So it's a little loophole there that we've decided to, to keep there.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.960]  I mean, we can, we can keep it there or we can remove it.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.120]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna test it out, I mean, if you sign up now, you'll be grandfathered
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]  in and be able to do it.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.280]  I don't know if we're gonna keep it there forever, but you can go get items that are
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:15.440]  sold out because we held back enough to always be able to supply everybody who had already
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.680]  ordered and we kept the surplus.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.800]  Now the problem is if everybody figures that out when things like DNA force are sold out
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.440]  for three months, then we may get more orders in there than we actually have it.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.800]  So it's gotta be watched.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.000]  That's why I say we may not keep it forever or it may get so popular because it's starting
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.720]  to get popular that we can't do it for new people.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.280]  We're just gauging it, beta testing it right, right now.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.840]  By the way, a small shipment of DNA force did come in yesterday.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.880]  It's gonna be back up on the cart today.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.200]  It's our flagship product.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.920]  It's a nutraceutical of the highest quality, half the price of leading competitors that
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.240]  aren't even as good.
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.640]  Most people go to medical doctors to get stuff like this.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.800]  It's not prescription, but some of the stuff in it is prescription in Europe.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.040]  The bio PQQ is of the highest quality, the CoQ10, all of it is just over the top nutraceutical
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:07.080]  level, which is not a deal of the huge nutraceutical company, actual, not nutraceutical.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:13.000]  It's actually a large company that actually produces pharmaceuticals, but to start putting
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.320]  out our products as well, then we can even say that it was manufactured at one of the
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.800]  biggest labs in the country.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.400]  But that's the level of products we're bringing you and the DNA force is back in.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.720]  It says get on the waiting list, but we're about to change that and let folks know that
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.600]  it is back in stock as of the next hour or so.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.800]  So Anthroplex will sell out.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.680]  We also have super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:41.840]  That is still in stock, but selling out quickly.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.280]  And the newest product, the vitamin mineral fusion with all the vitamins, all the minerals,
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.720]  all the amino acids, totally absorbable because you're drinking it so much better than pills.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.560]  The best tasting out there, the healthiest, I mean, this is a game changer.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.840]  You won't have any in for at least a month, so tell us what you think, give us your reviews.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.640]  And we really, really appreciate all of your support out there in FullWarsLife.com.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:10.720]  Is the nutraceuticals in FullWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site that covers it all.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:17.280]  Now, going back to John McAfee, who doesn't really need any introduction here today, McAfee
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:25.520]  2016.com, who is McAfee.com, FutureTentsCentral.com, and of course, he was a programmer, engineer,
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.160]  worked at NASA, then worked at a bunch of other areas in the government and things, a very
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.160]  interesting fellow.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:37.160]  In 1987, McAfee founded McAfee Associates, again, the most famous antivirus company in
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.960]  the world, sold it, the multi-billion-dollar company, and then, of course, escaped police
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.400]  and said that they were funding jihadists coming to the U.S. with fake passports.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.600]  And Ryerson, I rolled my eyes, and a year later, it turned out to be true.
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.000]  I mean, I didn't think he was lying, but it just sounded like a James Bond movie.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.720]  And he joins us now, good friend of mine, getting to know him over the years, really
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:02.440]  interesting, trailblazing, Maverick-type individual, if it was a real Captain Morgan, they had
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.320]  to put him on the side of the rum bottle, folks, I'm telling you.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.160]  So the real Captain Morgan, John McAfee, joins us with what he says is a time bomb hidden
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160]  beneath the Panama Papers.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.720]  Mr. McAfee, good to have you back with us.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.720]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.520]  It's always good to be on your show.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:22.940]  I concur with your analysis, but you've gone over much of the data dump.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:23.940]  What is hiding there?
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:29.360]  Well, I think the biggest thing that's hiding there, Alex, is that this is a smear campaign
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.400]  orchestrated by the U.S. government.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.600]  There's an organization called the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.040]  put out this report.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:45.120]  But what they did, I mean, there are 14,000 people who were listed in the sport.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.800]  None of them are Americans.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.200]  There's no American politician.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.600]  There's no American sports figures.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.600]  There's no American actor.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.000]  There's nothing.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.120]  And yet we know for a fact that America probably uses these services to American citizens more
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.480]  than anybody else.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.880]  And so I did some checking, Alex.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:12.160]  I found out that the ICIJ is actually, it's part of the USA Center for in Public Integrity.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:18.480]  It's funded by Soros Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Rockefeller, W.K. Kellogg.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.360]  The usual suspects.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]  The usual suspects.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:29.680]  And it reports to the organized crime and corruption reporting project, OCCRP.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.760]  And that's financed by the U.S. government through USAID.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.520]  So this whole thing is a setup.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.360]  It's basically to smear, it does two things, Alex, it smears our enemies or the government's
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360]  enemies.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:46.200]  And number two, it alerts those Americans who are actually in that database that we
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.920]  know who you are.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:56.560]  And it sets up the table for enormous potential blackmail by the U.S. government.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.200]  This thing is so absurd that it's ridiculous.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:00.560]  There's already been one casualty.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.480]  The Prime Minister of Iceland resigned this morning.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.480]  And I think that there's going to be more casualties.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:09.720]  But either one of two things is happening.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.400]  They will come out later with a list of U.S. citizens and they will be selective, as you
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:22.240]  and I know, or all these people will be blackmailed by one of our secret services agencies.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.120]  Well, I concur with that.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.520]  On Sunday, I came out when I first looked at it and I said, this is a blackmail operation.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.880]  It's been in the news that Germany has the most infiltrated media by the CIA and by the
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.360]  private foundation networks.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.600]  They sat on it for a year with 100 newspapers to vet who they would go after, showing they
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.720]  were very, very selective to clean it, just like WikiLeaks to a certain extent, and that
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.080]  clearly it's a way to try to bring in more international law, more regulations.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:58.240]  It is completely selective and just what an amazing scandal that, sure enough, you've
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.600]  got the story.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.320]  Business Insider Kurt Nemo did the same research, leads right back to the Ford and Rockefeller
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.320]  foundations.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320]  They're the ones trying to get rid of the borders.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.920]  They're the ones coming after the guns.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.280]  They're the ones financing the war on police.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.520]  They're the ones financing globalism.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:18.060]  They literally are financing the fall of every nation state, the war against Russia and Ukraine,
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.680]  the overthrow of non-radical Muslim countries.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.840]  They are the lesion of doom.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:28.920]  I mean, Lex Luthor, Alexander Luthor of Fantasyland has nothing on these true supervillains.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.120]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:37.520]  Well, absolutely, like the Sue Deutsches Eithung, the South German newspaper in Munich, sat on
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.960]  this story for over a year.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.560]  We do, in fact, know that the German media has been, in fact, highly infiltrated by the
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.560]  CIA.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  I'm sure that every single reporter on the International Commission, what a great pilot,
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:57.120]  by the way, International Commission of Investigative Journalists, I can guarantee you every single
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.120]  one of those are CIA.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:07.320]  This entire thing stinks, it really does, and it bodes ill for American citizens.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.680]  And maybe you have an offshore account for totally legitimate purposes.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.600]  We don't know that the prime minister of Iceland, for example, did not have an account for
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.600]  legitimate purposes.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.960]  Yeah, most of this is totally legal, and the ultra-robber baron rich for 60 years act
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.800]  like it's evil if anybody else puts money offshore because you can't trust your government
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.000]  or whatever, or because it's after-tax money, and they're not talking about taking after-tax
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.400]  money out of our accounts, it's a normal thing.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.960]  The elites wrote the book on it, but they don't want the general public or the new wealthy,
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.200]  the new voriche to have access to it.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:46.400]  Right, well, I had one myself, it was after-tax income, and I put it offshore because I didn't
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:53.400]  trust the American banking system, and I had full control of it, and it was independent
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.160]  of whatever happened here in America, which gave me a sense of security.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.760]  So there's nothing illegal about any of these things out there, sure.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.800]  Many of them are used for illegal purposes, no question.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.000]  But by and large, there's nothing wrong with this, and yet when it does come out, because
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.360]  like I said, the prime minister of Iceland has resigned, and there's smear campaigns
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.640]  throughout the world, people are going to be terrified if the CIA says, look, we know
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.640]  that you're in this database, here's the data, but we want to favor it, we want you to not
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640]  do it.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.320]  Exactly, it's about blackmail, it's about control, and worse than that, it is about letting
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.720]  the public think our governments are going after corruption, going after international
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:41.520]  football, soccer organization, over little petty stuff about who gets what deal or who
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.880]  gets what sponsorship, going after stuff like that, while the big multinational banks run
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:51.400]  the aircraft, run the drugs, run the weapons, fast and furious, it's still going on through
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:57.400]  Mexico, out of the Marine Corps base in Arizona, to Al Qaeda, to ISIS, things that are thousands
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.680]  of times worse, and they sit there and tell us how they're stopping all this corruption,
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.680]  but it gets worse.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.720]  It's like saying if you have blinds on your windows, you must be doing something wrong
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.680]  or a front door, because you can have a private bank account or cash, and just because criminals
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.280]  might use that sometimes, doesn't mean you can't have privacy and can't have access
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.280]  to it.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.480]  And I know you harp on this rightfully so that if you don't have privacy, you don't
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.640]  have freedom, it's that simple.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.800]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.000]  And by the way, you mentioned the football league and things.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.480]  I do not know what the hard on is that America has for FIFA, but a number of sports figures
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:45.240]  from FIFA were outed during this Panama Papers smear, and I can guarantee you.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:49.360]  The Western globalists want it for global propaganda purposes, and they're muscling
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.720]  it because it's actually controlled by an international board.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.520]  The Russians have a seat at the table.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.400]  The Russians are in their influence peddling as well.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.640]  And the Anglo-American West is muscling in and taking it over, period.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.520]  It's setting the FBI up as this global police force to go put bags over hundreds of the
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.960]  executives' heads in foreign countries and throw them on private jets to fly them back
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.880]  here to face prison.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.800]  Absolutely, and privacy, again, you mentioned you can't have freedom without privacy.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:23.040]  That is absolutely crucial, and people do not understand that, because without privacy,
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.760]  the government knows your every move, where you are, who you're talking to, and what you're
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.720]  talking about.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.880]  And cleaning the streets, as they might call it, would be such a simple thing if they knew
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.840]  everything about everybody.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.640]  But we have to have privacy, it's just a fundamental right, it's a necessity.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:44.920]  I mean, even between husband and wife, where you have almost completely open communication,
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920]  there might be some things private.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.280]  I mean, you might be having an affair, you might not choose to tell your wife that.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.280]  This is your right.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.720]  It doesn't sound like saying it's morally right or wrong, but if it's a way to keep
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.360]  a family together, perhaps.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.400]  So you simply can't remove our privacies.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.520]  And I've been debating with the FBI up until last week when they finally dropped their
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:09.920]  lawsuit against Apple, about giving a master key to the FBI, so that they can spy on everybody
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:10.920]  who has a title.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.080]  And by the way, that just makes it easier.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:15.800]  As you said here months ago, as I said, I'm not even an expert top hacker like you.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.640]  I mean, you're well respected when you're breaking into the Belizean government system
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.520]  with Trojan Horses and the rest of it.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:27.760]  But I've talked to people, I have top hackers on, they go, you plug a computer cord that's
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.520]  a computer interface into it.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:36.360]  You don't go through the front code and literally, depending on which generation it is, you can
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.560]  get in a matter of minutes or a matter of hours if it's the latest updates.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.680]  Most the apps with big companies have had the government has done deals to build backdoors
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.680]  in them.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.960]  There are so many ways to get in.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.800]  It's also known they can energize remotely some of these chips that the chips themselves
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:00.040]  in deals with China and others have basically remote boot programs that can be sent in wirelessly.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.160]  I mean, these are Swiss cheese operations.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.920]  Why do you think they finally had to admit, okay, we can break into it?
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:12.680]  Well, because I found out that the FBI had a contract with an Israeli company called
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:18.320]  Celebrite that sells small devices for you can buy for a few thousand dollars that you
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.280]  can plug any Apple iPhone into and get all of the data off of it.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.280]  I don't care whose it is.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.760]  You don't need any codes that breaks all the security breaks the encryption.
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:30.800]  I found that contract and I outed them.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.440]  I said, okay, so obviously you had this contract, you knew all along and they have purchased
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  these devices.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.360]  They have thousands off of Alex.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.120]  They had already purchased these things.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.840]  So they knew that they could break into the iPhone.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:48.000]  They just wanted to use the fact that this iPhone was used in a terrorist act, a terrorist
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.120]  act, which we're all supposed to be terrified of.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:54.400]  They just wanted to sell the idea to the dumbed down public that, hey, we can't even break
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.400]  it in your phone.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.440]  We need the keys, everything to keep you safe.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.560]  Just to sell the idea that we should all wear see-through clothes.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.560]  Right.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:06.880]  In fact, the FBI mouthpiece I spoke with James Gordon when we were debating on CNN, he said
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.680]  at one point, and I cannot believe he said, well, you have to give up some privacy in
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.240]  order to get security.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.800]  My teeth almost fell out.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.760]  I mean, I could not believe that in, you know, on a national program, he would say that.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.760]  Sure.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:27.280]  What's the next big shoot a drop with all these Panama hoax, Panama paper hoax and the
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280]  iPhone hoax?
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.120]  What's the next shoot a drop, Mr. McAfee?
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.640]  You know, I think they're going to do another law firm.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:41.160]  I mean, keep in mind that the, the, the, the, the Cassock Fonseca firm was the fourth largest,
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.660]  not the largest.
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:46.640]  There are two firms that are more than twice the size of this one.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.760]  I guarantee you they're going to be popping into those things soon.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:54.400]  So, you know, if anybody out there has accounts there, he might want to, you know, remove
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.040]  yourselves even further from it because the U.S. government is going to own your ass if
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.040]  you don't.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.480]  Can I say that on, on your phone?
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.000]  No, no, it's okay, my friend.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.440]  I mean, look, if this isn't the time to use French, I don't know what time is.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.120]  How do you think the power structure is doing?
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.880]  I know it's a bunch of different factions, but I want to, I want to ask you as we go
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:18.960]  to break and after the break, what would you call this time in history, my friend?
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.080]  I would, I would call it utter political chaos.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  Alex, I would.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.520]  I mean, we've got, we've got the Republican Party seriously in chaos.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:32.440]  We've got those in power trying to take the, the election away from Trump and the Republican
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.120]  Party and the Democratic Party.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.960]  God knows what's happening there, but it's not pretty in either case.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.960]  You know, you've got a case of the measles or bladder infections to choose from.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:42.960]  Or brain cancer.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.120]  Yeah, well, the Democrats, they're just, they're robbing Sanders and now he's trying
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.120]  to rob her.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.600]  I mean, it's like just mugging each other.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  Everything's basing down the gangs and we're really seeing the curtain pull back and it
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.600]  is not pretty folks.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:58.600]  This is an amazing time to be alive though, a lot of opportunity for freedom in this time
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.600]  of change.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.640]  John McAfee's our guest stay with us.

[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:59.520]  So you definitely want to visit that website frequently. There is so much to cover so much to go over
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:05.000]  So much unfolding but what I wanted to bring up with mr. McAfee while he's here with us and in the next segment
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Talk a little bit about why he's running for president. Now. This is out of market watch now. You knew this 20 years ago
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.720]  I knew this 20 years ago. They're moving towards
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.400]  Our audience knew this a long time ago
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:21.040]  Towards this this smart grid technology that's really just back doors to track and trace everything we do in taxes
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:28.880]  The police could be controlling your self-driving car. Well, all the new cars are coming out with self-driving technology already in them
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:36.080]  They're advertising in a safe technology where the car stops itself or goes out of the way, but this is total control
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:43.120]  It's a global program. It's being wired in they've got all these chips in the computers now that can be wirelessly activated
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.120]  They have little transponders in them
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:52.200]  I mean, this is like something out of a science fiction movie where aliens take over and you know program the world to turn against the people
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.240]  I'm not saying that's what it is, but it's just so wild. There's this giant global
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:06.080]  Technocratic program putting Trojans in everything and now they're getting to the point with Samsung last year going in the terms of service for a new TV
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:09.920]  Oh, yeah, we are watching and listening to you and selling it to third parties and yes
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.640]  We are gonna take control your car and yes
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:19.120]  We are doing this and yes, we are putting cancer viruses in your vaccines. I mean, it's getting so open. What do you think's going on John?
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:27.360]  Well, I mean, it's ultimate control. I mean the government that knows everything about the populace becomes a dictatorship
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.640]  I mean, this is this is the philosopher's stone of the of people who want to be dictators
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.400]  If you know everything about the citizenry, then you can control the citizenry and this is what they want
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:46.840]  And now they're so arrogant now. They're so arrogant. They're saying they'll just take the delegates away from Trump even if he wins
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.840]  I mean that is crazy
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.440]  Well, you know worse things have happened not worse
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:56.240]  But certainly stranger things have happened in this country and our government is turned inside out, you know
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.160]  That's why I'm glad you're running for president. I mean and so you're well, you know
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.680]  I'm in the libertarian party and then you know what we believe we believe that personal freedom
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:11.240]  And liberty is the the prime focus of life and the greatest secure of freedom
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:16.160]  And the greatest secure of security. I mean freedom brings security
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.840]  Totalitarianism is Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin said does not protect you
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:30.200]  Absolutely, we have what what what we have is this is a government which has taken away our freedom because what is freedom freedom and liberty is
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:35.160]  The fact that we own our own bodies and our own mind
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:39.040]  So I can put into my mind whatever I want if I choose to believe in evolution
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:44.520]  I can do that although the government at times has tried to restrict even what we're allowed to teach our children
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.960]  If you know if I choose to smoke cigarettes to drink alcohol, that's my business. It's not yours
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:52.280]  It's certainly not the government's our government has become
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:59.000]  Our boss our mother and our father instead of our servant, which is which was its original intent
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.360]  I don't need a mother and father. I'm 70 years old
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:05.880]  We've reached that point. No one even the dumbest person can cannot deny
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.880]  We have reached a moment where we are collapsing into flaming over-the-top
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.260]  Classical tyranny. I mean who can deny that?
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:16.480]  Well, no, we're we're reaching a totalitarian
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:21.600]  Government there is no question about it and they're using the
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:29.480]  Technology of the modern age and all the cyber sciences to gain the knowledge of the citizenry so it can't be controlled
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.880]  I don't want to be controlled stay there 70 seconds five more minutes

[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.040]  You've all heard the shocking statistics
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:05.720]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly ten thousand dollars per man woman and child in this country
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:13.000]  Obesity diabetes cancer heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant one out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:19.240]  Challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease if you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy

[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:56.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:10.040]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:13.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.800]  I'm talking to Roger Stone during the breaks. He's coming on tomorrow with huge bombshells, but man
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:20.800]  They are attacking him everywhere
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:35.280]  He's on it noon tomorrow by the way Nico. I know we already have somebody there, but let's move that and then we've got a bunch of other I've got you know
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:39.360]  I've hit the point of overwhelmed with all the data. We've got I mean it is just crazy
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:44.120]  I wish I could tell you the inside baseball on the Trump stuff. It is crazy. What's going on?
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:47.400]  I can tell you Trump knows about the New World Order. He knows about globalism
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:53.320]  He's more of a populist. I wish he was more anti-police state like somebody like McAfee
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.280]  Trump doesn't seem to get and I'm told by folks that know him really well that he's not very computer savvy
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:06.280]  That's kind of a blind spot. Maybe if Trump does get in maybe he can have McAfee as his national security advisor on cyber security or something
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.920]  Because we need some libertarians and people that know what they're doing, you know advising Trump
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:14.200]  He's got a lot of great points, but also some blind spots John
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:22.200]  Well, it's a blind spot to really concern me Alex the you know, as you said the the overburdening police state that has to be cut back
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:26.600]  It really does. I think we're we're the libertarian stiffer from Trump is in the
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:33.720]  The idea that government is way too big overbearing and it is too intrusive into in our lives
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.760]  You know in my own campaign. I am I am focusing on reducing government dramatically
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.760]  I mean look at the FDA. I mean the FDA tells dying people
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:50.120]  That they cannot have access to certain drugs because it may harm them
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.520]  And so we're basically saying you're terminally ill, but we're not going to give you this
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:58.760]  We don't want to hurt you the insanity of that. You know makes me sick. It's incredible
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:07.320]  And the and and again, I think Trump's uh lack of understanding of cyber science and cyber security is also very alarming
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.920]  And we we have been attacked by Iran by North Korea by many of our enemies
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.520]  And we just barely squeak to buy through luck when the Iranians
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:22.760]  Hacked into the new york power dam in 2013. They were trying to open the sluice gates
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.920]  Absolutely, and the iranians better watch it with something like that because I mean
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.120]  We don't just have our crazy government. We have all these other crazy government
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.480]  You heard the question I asked earlier and I kind of digress into trump. I apologize
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.880]  Reading what google said what they released last year that when they were first founded 16 years ago
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:42.360]  It was to create an ai system to predict the future so that when they predict the future
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.200]  They can then add stimuli to control the future. They say they've successfully done that
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:51.080]  Other people apple have done that microsoft reportedly has done it. Uh, that's why um
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:57.160]  amazon says they come with a 99 accuracy rating with their prime members that order stuff all the time from them
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.880]  Have prepackaged what you're going to order before you order it that is predicting the future
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:07.880]  Doesn't that begin to end free will and then we have an elite that's so corrupt with that type of power mr. McAfee
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.320]  Absolutely, it's not just google and apple and amazon. It's also facebook and twitter
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  That are manipulating our emotions
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:19.960]  Um, I mean look at look at all the fake news from these quote
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.000]  satire news sites that don't approach satire whatsoever. It's it's absolute
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.560]  fabricated nonsense
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:34.040]  Uh, and and people on facebook are believing it. They're meant to cause confusion like like they'll have articles from the onion about fema camps
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.800]  That mirror c-span and then there's real announcements about fema camps on c-span and people think it's the onion
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.840]  Yes, absolutely. It's insane
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.840]  So it's a very dangerous
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:49.480]  It's a dangerous cliff that we are teetering on all of us here in this society in this society
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:56.920]  And and seriously alexa if the president of this country does not understand the nuances of cyber
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.120]  Science then we're lost. I'm sorry. We are
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:01.240]  um
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:07.080]  And and I'd like to say that it takes this opportunity to say that the libertarian party offers a third choice
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.560]  It really does and it's a unique choice
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:15.160]  And it's a choice where we want to form a government that gets the hell out of your way
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:20.120]  In this story exactly. I mean, it's like coming home and your 14 year old kids are bossing you around
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.880]  And you know locking you up in your room. I mean, it's just totally inverted
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:29.560]  It can't go on forever and I see all this flailing as signs of desperation from the from the kleptocrats
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.560]  What do you say? John McAfee in closing?
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:36.360]  Well in closing, I'd like to say go to McAfee 2016.com
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.040]  Uh, and donate a dollar to donate 50 cents
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:46.280]  Whatever you can afford because um, we're up against two very powerful machines and these machines have not worked for
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.240]  Sure, and I'll say this
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:51.400]  I know you're running and you're running to win and I respect that but you're winning by
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.000]  Being involved by being in the debates coming up by injecting real ideas
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:00.440]  Standing up for civil liberties and cyber security. That's sensible. Thank you. John. You're doing a great job. Have a great week
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:07.320]  A leaked memo reveals how the trump campaign really feels about the establishment
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:15.320]  An internal memo leaked to the washington post reveals the level of disdain that trump has for the political establishment
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:21.080]  And they're talking heads in the mainstream media the memo entitled digging through the bulls
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:29.000]  Is written by donald trump senior advisor barry benet who said the mainstream media and washington establishment are working together
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:37.240]  Like never before to bash the trump campaign as the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for donald trump
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.960]  And they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:48.920]  The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between trump's rising popularity and the media talking points
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:57.240]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes

[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:30.040]  Wayne madson is an award-winning investigative journalist formerly ran a lot of the internal security operations at the national security agency
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  And he's got amazing sources
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:36.680]  Remember two weeks before was in the washington post. He said on site
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:41.720]  He said this place smells like bohemian grove. I sense dick cheney
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.120]  Almost like darth vader. I feel a presence. I haven't felt
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:52.040]  And then turns out it's all true comes out in the washington post weird secret society
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.560]  Refounded by bohemian grove. I don't know how he predicted that. I think he had a source
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:59.960]  But he won't he won't tell us we're gonna go to him in a minute
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.480]  But you know i'm i'm joking around we're talking about a dead supreme court justice and something so suspicious
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:08.440]  It's it's almost like it was designed to make us suspicious
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:12.360]  He had a pillow over his face no autopsy
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:18.600]  We're gonna get to all that and deborjean pal for the dc madam who he was friends with

[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.920]  So this is big stuff and let me tell you I can sense when something's dangerous
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.480]  I get a little tingle
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.640]  A little sick feeling in my gut like I told palfrey a couple weeks before she got killed
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.960]  I get that same feeling on this for everybody involved. This is dangerous
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:12.040]  Because it's not just Ted Cruz, but you got dead hookers Cruz

[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.960]  I don't mean that name in the pejorative by the way. That's just what the media calls them
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.200]  The real slime balls are the people that go around using these women and then end up killing them

[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.720]  Not just product placement. We don't get any of that money
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.600]  zero
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:52.600]  I remember many years ago that I'm going to Wayne Madsen
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.840]  Major news corporations and then major movie corporations wanted me to consult
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.880]  I'd say sure. I'll be a consultant on your movie and then I just get a check
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:04.040]  They'd call me ask like five questions. That'd be it
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.040]  And then later
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:09.480]  I'd get a phone call going you shouldn't be criticizing things, you know, you get a lot of friends
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:15.000]  Don't you want to be a consultant? I'm like, oh, I figure out what this is. Excuse me. I didn't understand
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:17.480]  No, I won't be a consultant for your movie coming out
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:24.040]  And I've been a consultant for some big Hollywood movies and I can't say why, you know, you sign a non-disclosure deal on it
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.680]  But people want to know about high tech police stuff or they want to know about, you know, your view on this your view on that
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:33.640]  So there was some real consulting there. But but but really it's just the system saying we'll take care of you
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:40.280]  Just hey, you want some voiceover work? Why don't you stop being so radical Facebook would let us reach 3 million people with every video
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  So does that criticize Zuckerberg? No more
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:49.800]  They put it out to read them into block it. This is the real world we face. So don't take the broadcast for granted. I know you don't now
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:54.760]  I'm going to go to Wayne Madsen right now and then we're going to play some clips
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:00.760]  Of the lawyer for pal free and of course myself on fox news breaking this down at the time it happened
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:04.200]  And then Madsen's gonna be almost for a full hour on friday with the lawyer
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:10.360]  But this is just a a sneak peek in an update on what's happened and the latest developments. So first off great job
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:13.000]  Uh, Wayne doggedly being in there
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:20.120]  Please tell us who the progenitors of the cruise sex scandal are how much validity there is to the hookers
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:23.960]  Obviously, uh radar says it is the number
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.120]  Uh, you didn't want to go that far. You just said well, you know, he's got some big problems
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:32.680]  How serious is this and where do you see this this going Wayne?
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:40.680]  Well, Alex, I think we're dealing with two different stories here. The the inquire a couple of weeks ago had one story about five
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:46.280]  Women that Ted Cruz supposedly had extramarital affairs with
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:52.440]  Uh, of course, that's after his marriage to Heidi in 2001 one of those women
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:57.000]  Uh was said to be a prostitute, but they did not give that individual's name
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.800]  This story I believe has to do with uh Ted Cruz before he got married and if you if you know that uh last uh night
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:10.920]  When he appeared with Megan Kelly in a town hall in Wisconsin
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:19.400]  Cruz uh was very Clinton-esque Bill Clinton-esque uh and saying I've been faithful to my wife
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:22.280]  Well, okay, he got married in 2001
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:27.240]  But that doesn't say anything about what he was doing before 2001 when he was a single
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.040]  Uh, man, uh after he uh left uh
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:38.680]  Uh, Harvard he came to Washington. Uh, he uh clerked for uh
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.600]  Chief Justice Rehnquist, then he went to work for a law firm uh representing
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:49.640]  The National Rifle Association and he also worked on the Clinton impeachment
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:54.200]  Uh issues. He also represented, uh, John Boehner in an issue
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:16:00.680]  Uh having to do with Jim McDermott and some a phone call that was supposedly intercepted
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.640]  And given to mcdermott, but that put him on the radar screen for a lot of
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:11.080]  GOP individuals, so uh, he then uh in in uh
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:14.120]  Um
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:20.280]  In 2009, he goes to Austin and he joins the Bush Cheney presidential campaign
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:26.840]  And uh, he represented Bush uh in Florida and the whole thing in 2000
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.400]  with the election
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:36.280]  He he wanted to get a job in the White House, but apparently from what I've been told he was not very well thought of
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  by a lot of people
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:42.120]  Uh in the uh on the transition team
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:46.600]  Uh that were handing out the federal jobs, so all he managed to get
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.120]  Was a job uh at the federal trade commission
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.960]  Uh, probably an organization knowing Ted Cruz's policies he'd like to do away with
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:03.320]  Uh, he also had a uh a job as a uh an assistant to attorney general Ashcroft the justice
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.280]  It's during this time frame before he was um
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.000]  Um, uh selected as solicitor general for texas by governor
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:19.640]  Now governor Abbott then attorney general Abbott that I believe we have the the smoking
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.040]  phone calls
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.040]  um and uh
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:29.000]  When I investigated the palfrey story and I I was the she told me I was the first one who got
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:35.320]  All of her phone records because she had given a partial list of brian ross at abc news
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:39.320]  She felt very bad about what abc did to her because
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.080]  Here they had some of the lists and then they come out in a in a report and said well
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:47.880]  We went through what we were given and we didn't find any
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:53.240]  Uh names of any uh notoriety, which was a complete hogwash
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:55.320]  abc
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:57.320]  Took a dive on that and
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:00.440]  so
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.880]  At this at this point in time. I'm looking through the phone lists
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:05.560]  Um
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.080]  in a very
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.080]  I got to say it was I didn't have
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:12.440]  The means to do intelligence searches and whatnot
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:19.800]  So I went to the public libraries in the dc area and and was going looking up all these phone numbers on some called the hains
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:27.000]  Chris cross directories, which were used by direct marketers to you know, uh, basically they had a phone number
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.160]  Then they tried to match it to an address
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:35.080]  Sure, I should have introduced you as wane madson investigative journalist who first got the full list and risked his life
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.440]  To go connect these numbers to public figures. I mean, this is dangerous stuff. You've been doing my friend
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.320]  Well, other than the fact that I thought I uh, I still believe I I nailed
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:49.800]  Uh a one-time attorney for televangelist pat robertson
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.680]  The other find was the central switch for the bush cheney
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:00.040]  Transition team which was located at the west building in mcclain, virginia
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:07.240]  And that's very close to where cheney lived at the time and also cia headquarters later became very apparent
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:14.680]  When gene palfrey tried to invoke the classified information procedures act at her trial and and the new judge
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:19.960]  On the case refused to allow that that she had some relationship
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:26.360]  with the central intelligence agency and I I wrote and I believe still that that was with
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:29.640]  uh, the executive director of the cia
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:31.560]  former
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:32.760]  head of the
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:36.680]  Logistics for the agency at their frankfurt station in germany
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:44.200]  Uh, uh, uh dusty fago who was then indicted and served, uh, several months sure
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:46.760]  So so as best you can tell and from your sources
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:52.360]  Cia connections intergovernmental wars
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:58.040]  She seemed confident then she got scared said they're coming to kill me. I talked to her landlord. You did
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  Talk to the family
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:03.960]  What changed why did they decide to take her out?
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:12.280]  Well, I think she um, you know, there's a lot of we've seen a lot of madams, uh in washington and elsewhere
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:18.760]  Over the years you remember there was the hidey floss that had all the names in hollywood and and then there were madams
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:21.960]  Going back to the 50s and 60s in washington
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:27.240]  Uh, who and and and actually, uh, they dealt in heterosexual
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:35.640]  Uh, uh hookups and homosexual hookups one thing I know for a fact is and I asked gene palfrey this
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:41.080]  Right to her face. I said are you are you only dealing with women or are you dealing with call boys?
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:43.080]  She said only only women
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:48.200]  So I mean there were other he wasn't tied into barney frank and his his call boy of under underage boys
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:51.560]  Not only that well, I mean also that would eliminate, uh,
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:58.360]  You know of the five presidential candidates the viable ones now that would certainly eliminate hillary clinton
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:02.760]  Uh, although I know she has gone both ways, uh over the years
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:08.040]  So the word is she'll be with men for power, but she likes the girls. Yeah. Yeah, I mean we know about her and benz foster
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.000]  But now I think it's her and whom Abedin and
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:17.240]  Um, and maybe a few others over the years, but uh, anyway, and she didn't have a good taste in women either
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:21.720]  Her girlfriends look like salacious crumb, but I'm I'm I'm digressing here
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:23.000]  um
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  What does this mean though to
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:29.080]  To the young ted Cruz the lawyer ted Cruz with his old number
[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:36.040]  Uh in the stack. I mean how dangerous is this to him? It looks like he's already falling in wisconsin polls losing some of his leads
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:42.040]  Yeah, the the problem is if ted Cruz were a liberal democrat, you know, who would care, right?
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:45.560]  I mean we've seen um people like that in the past
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.120]  get outed uh
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:49.640]  And you know, I mean
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:55.320]  Uh, nothing happens, but the prom for cruises is he's led this life as an uh evangelical
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:57.960]  christian dominionist
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:03.640]  Uh, uh, he's very he's very it takes a very hard line on social issues. So
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:07.640]  Uh, the the problem for him is going to be the hypocrisy
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:12.600]  Um, now exactly. I'm not attacking him if him and his wife were split up. This is going on
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:16.680]  I mean, I'm not up here saying, you know that you know that i'm the grand poob of all morality
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:21.080]  But at the same time being anointed by glenn beck as the messiah
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:25.000]  I mean, it's so jim jones cultish. It's getting crazy
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:29.400]  Yeah, yeah, and so I think the biggest problem is I mean
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:33.400]  And we we know there was some issues with him and his wife his wife apparently
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:39.960]  Suffered a nervous breakdown at one point in time and I look at you know, we we can't I don't think anybody can make fun of that
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:44.120]  Type of thing that you know these these uh family issues
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:50.520]  Uh, but uh, my focus on him. I think is is before he was married to Heidi
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.920]  Uh, uh in in 2001 now, how did they meet? They actually met
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:58.520]  at in the bush campaign in austin and uh
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:05.800]  Uh, she did go on to the white house, uh, where she was working with people like robert zealik the trade representative and
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:12.040]  Uh, robert pastor who was like a big proponent of the north american union. Sure. Sure. She's a key globalist a key
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:14.360]  Gover of the globalist. Let me ask you this. Yeah, why was cruz?
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:21.720]  Unpopular with texas and dc republicans, but he still got plumb jobs and why do they say they hate him because the word is
[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:24.280]  And you and you've agreed with this historically
[02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:30.760]  Republicans tend to be into the homosexual stuff the democrats more into the heterosexual stuff just on average
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:38.520]  And that and that the word is cruz may not be bisexual and so he's not in the whole austin republican club
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:42.840]  Right. Now, I think the thing with cruz is and I have a story
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.480]  Two independent sources
[02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:47.640]  Told me that while he was at princeton
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.520]  As an undergrad he went to harvard law
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:55.640]  Uh, that uh, he was known as a person who would dress up in women's clothes. Oh
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.440]  sneak into the sorority houses
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:02.840]  And um, and and and and basically be he was a peeping ted
[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:09.240]  He would spy on women in various states of undress going to and from that's really creepy. So he's a wow. Wow
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:12.120]  Yeah, it's an ick factor with ted cruz
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.280]  Uh, I think and that's the reason uh, he sort of got shunned
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:20.920]  Uh by the bush white house and he said well, we got to give him a job out of the plum book
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.480]  But you know, make sure it's not here. So it turned out it was over at the ftc
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:31.560]  And some low-level job political job at the justice. Sure. I want to bring up the lawyer who I know, you know
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:35.000]  I know you've been out with palfrey and and him and others at memory serves
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:41.480]  This montgomery Blair sibley has it has a gag order on and I want you to flesh that out for us because the numbers are out
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:44.280]  But not the names let's play a clip. He's coming on the show friday
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:51.400]  My name is Montgomery Blair sibley and I was the attorney for deborjean palfrey known as the dc madham
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.360]  Who for 13 years ran a high-end escort service in the district of columbia?
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:02.600]  I am the custodian of the records of that escort service and since 2007
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:07.560]  I have been under a court order restraining me from publicly releasing those records
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:13.000]  Those records contain information relevant to the 2016 presidential election
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.760]  And as such last month, I went into court seeking permission to release those records
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:23.400]  Rather than hearing me the court instead refused to even file my pleadings
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:26.200]  Essentially shutting the courthouse door to me
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:33.320]  I must continue this fight to the dc circuit court of appeal and then on to the us supreme court
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:41.720]  To do that. I will need to spend $25,000 in filing fees printing fees and attorneys fees for representation
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:49.160]  In those courts. I need your help to get on that horse. All right. Thank you. He's going to join us friday
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:50.280]  I mean
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:54.040]  Wayne you're a smart governor comes to law. Would it be legal for trump to pay
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  to get these numbers released because
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.720]  Or the names because you know the word is it's matched up with ted cruz. Isn't that a huge torpedo?
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.000]  Can can trump pay for that instead of us coming and asking the audience to do it?
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.640]  I would suggest that donald trump not get involved in this but he's got to have
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:15.480]  Uh, a lot of deep pocketed supporters who could come up with that. That's not a when we're talking dc
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.880]  That's not a huge amount of money 25k
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:20.280]  um
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.760]  What I know about this case with the records is
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:30.920]  Gene palfrey originally had uh judge uh gladdus kesler as the trial judge us district judge in the
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:33.560]  district of columbia
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.320]  us court
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.920]  Judge i attended many of those hearings and judge kesler was very very sympathetic
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:48.920]  To gene palfrey and was seen more interested in finding out the identities of the customers of her escort service
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:55.640]  A couple times she said, you know, I I really think that that we ought to be also looking at who the clients were
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:01.480]  And uh, and the u.s. Attorneys uh there at the time really were irritated at that
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:10.360]  That's not where they wanted this thing to go all of a sudden judge kesler goes to the uh, uh, the the senior judge
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.680]  On the at the u.s. District court and asked to be relieved from the case
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.160]  I heard through the great mind that she had been threatened the woman was single
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.440]  She lived alone and it would have been quite easy
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:29.400]  Uh for her to be harmed some way because look what happened to gene palfrey and one of her uh escorts later
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.720]  They were both found here the professor got whacked
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:38.600]  Right, and that's what's so scary about this is they want to indict her years later to cover up that the government was using her
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:46.040]  But you send the women to prison, but the guys who ran it all don't get in trouble just leave these women alone
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:53.400]  Yeah, there's it's it's it's kind of ridiculous. So a new judge took over james robertson
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:28:01.640]  who uh declared a mistrial and uh, and then there was a retrial and uh, he uh, there was a new attorney
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.800]  Appointed for gene palfrey uh that the government paid for uh from the oryc
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:11.320]  Law firm in washington dc a guy named Preston Burton
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.160]  Uh now this is at the point in time where these uh, so-called gag orders are
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.280]  imposed because uh
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:27.080]  A montgomery sibley bears sit the Blair sibley was then off the case and there was a coin a court appointed
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.960]  Trial lawyer. I wouldn't want to be Blair sibley sitting on top of the names that go with the numbers
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:35.880]  I would want to be you having all the numbers you're I mean again. I just keep sending a lot of courage wane
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:37.240]  um
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:43.720]  In closing what does your gut tell you about cruise where this election is going the hysteria about taking
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.360]  Trump's delegates whether you love or hate trump. I mean nakedly stealing elections now
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:51.080]  This is this is so crazy. I can't believe it's real
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:57.640]  I think trump uh, I I'm sorry. I believe cruise like um, obama
[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:02.920]  Uh has uh friends in high places and I think it's linked to his family
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.800]  I think we have to look at his dad rafael cruise
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:11.880]  Who who cruise ted cruise doesn't seem to understand his own dad's history. He says you know my dad escaped
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:14.920]  Castro's cuba his dad left cuba
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.920]  Uh, three years before uh, Castro took over power
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:21.320]  But I I've been talking uh
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:28.280]  some researchers in new arlands that uh feel that they can place rafael cruise in new arlands
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:36.600]  Uh, uh in 1963 and that opens up a new can of worms because of rafael cruise was involved in anti-castro
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:39.240]  activities in new arlands in
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:40.920]  1963
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:45.880]  It's it's quite clear who he may have been tied up with. Oh, absolutely. You know what wane?
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:50.600]  Let's do five more minutes and we're gonna get richard reeves from milwaukee today. Well, this will be back

[02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:57.400]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:09.400]  A member of parliament in switzerland says the muslim refugee crisis could trigger a new world war
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:17.400]  swiss people's party member roger koppel is warning everyone that the european migrant crisis is so out of control
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:20.360]  That it could lead to a full out world war
[02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:29.720]  He also says that civilizations that fail to secure their borders are doomed koppel's comments echo those made by numerous other
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.600]  prominent political and military leaders
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:41.880]  Norwegian army chief odin joe hannison says europe must be prepared to fight to defend their values against radical islam

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:15.400]  Look it's clear what's going on the social engineers across this planet
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:21.560]  Know that there's advanced computer systems that can predict the future control markets and then what stimuli control
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:24.520]  mass populations
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  That you're giving godlike power
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.000]  To some of the most inbred hateful arrogant people
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:35.000]  And so they're building the whole structure to be extremely predatory
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:41.160]  There's always been predatory individuals out there and corrupt elites, but there's also been chivalry and honorable groups and others and just reality
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:47.480]  And the world is headed to a very unbalanced very decadent part of a historical cycle
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:50.040]  That i just hope we can make it out of but
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:55.160]  We openly announcing they're stealing the election from sand or stealing it from trump
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:57.800]  Openly saying your vote doesn't count
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.040]  Openly trying to start all these wars openly saying they're getting rid of cash
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:06.520]  Openly saying they're bringing in a corporate world government and they're above the law and they're our saviors
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:09.400]  And their approval ratings are in the single digits
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:16.360]  So I don't see this whole plan going the way they want it to it never does
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.960]  Because they don't even follow what their own ai algorithms are telling
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:28.040]  I mean here's an example. I brought it up with james wesley rals yesterday formerly of army intelligence
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:31.480]  And it was involved in some very important operations smart guy
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:34.360]  He was pointing out. I said why 18 years ago?
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:41.160]  Did they say at marine corps and army bases don't go to info wars dot com and don't listen all shouts my audience like tripled overnight?
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:42.360]  I was nobody
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:46.840]  I might have been reached a million people a week on like six seven eight stations shortwave amfm
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.880]  And a little bitty website where I've just posted an article or two a day and a photo of what I was going to talk about
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.600]  And suddenly I had this huge audience
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:58.120]  It was like 80 percent of my audience was suddenly military
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:02.920]  Why would the government say don't listen to all shones because some people are already listening?
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:05.720]  It just shows a disconnect of the Shryzan effect
[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:10.600]  You know where she attacks somebody because they say where she lives and then everybody knows where she lives
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:12.760]  This is in the news
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.280]  The Shryzan effect you know became known after I had experienced it, but it's always been around, you know, just because they
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.200]  Come out with the term stockum syndrome in the 60s
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:26.680]  For prisoners or victims of kidnappers supporting their oppressors doesn't mean that it didn't happen before
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:33.160]  It's now just been given a label and an approximation. It's what I'm saying is the globalists the elites have blind spots
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.520]  and
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:43.160]  there if you look at their criminology as sociopaths as psychopaths as control freaks as perverts as weirdos
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:48.120]  They really are twisted and disturbed people borderline personality disorders
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.120]  multiple personalities. I mean
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:56.040]  Just like statistically psychologists and psychiatrists are the most mentally ill people there are
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:02.200]  Doesn't mean there isn't something to those sciences, but there's just approximations of human condition is what I'm getting at
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.480]  But then the people running the asylum should be the inmates is what I'm saying. So I just have a very
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:13.880]  weird intellectual view of this and a weird feeling Wayne about where all this is going because
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:17.320]  It's just so whacked out now. It's so crazy now. It's so
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:23.160]  Bizarre and it feels so apocalyptic to know we're in the hands of these people
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:31.480]  That are so out of control. I mean that's kind of a three minute rant there, but what can you comment on about the the direction I'm going
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:38.920]  Well, it's interesting because you know, I over the over the last few days. I was watching some old clips, uh, including, uh
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:41.480]  the 1960 election between
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:44.680]  uh, Kennedy and Nixon and how far would he we've gone down?
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.720]  Uh, the drain because back then the issue was, uh,
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.720]  Nixon had a had a little bit of a five o'clock shadow
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:37:01.400]  beer whisker growth and uh, was sweating and the but the debate was centered around things like quinoa and matzoo
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:06.600]  Two islands between Taiwan and China now we're dealing with all these other
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:08.600]  extraneous
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:15.240]  Issues I'd rather not be having to report on Ted Cruz being a peeping time at Princeton and
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:18.760]  Uh, you know and the ick factor and messing around with
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.880]  uh, call girls escorts, uh, when he
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:26.840]  uh, initially joined the government and uh in washington back in
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:34.520]  Uh, 2001, but uh, that's where we're at and we've seen it and just each election seems to
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.560]  Uh, get further and further down into the gutter
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.120]  I think it's a shame
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:46.600]  The word is though, you don't even get let in to higher level dc operations unless you have had sex with call girls
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:53.400]  You go to these, uh, poker parties in the room next is the women and you basically have to do it to even be trusted
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  Kind of like joining a gang. You got a rob a liquor store
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:59.880]  And then to some of the higher levels it becomes homosexual sex
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:07.160]  Pedophilia that this is pretty organized now that you knowingly have to compromise yourself instead of the old days being the mafia
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  You know, you got to make your bones and you know kill somebody now. It's you've got to
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.680]  Do something even worse. I mean from your deep research. Is that an accurate statement?
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:19.640]  Oh, I think so and I'm not saying that the our past
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.520]  Political leaders were any saints. They certainly weren't but uh, they the
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.000]  the the the photo
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.200]  But uh, they the the the focus of elections and the news media
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:39.000]  Uh, was a lot different and uh, I think that's uh, uh, you know, you look at that today and uh, you wonder
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:45.720]  Why uh, we have so many problems because the real problems we should be addressing are not being addressed
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:52.040]  And uh, we're focusing on these other things. So, um, but uh, I I believe that uh,
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:55.160]  There is something with Ted Cruz because
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:57.160]  Uh, if if there weren't
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:01.800]  Uh, Megan Kelly would have not brought it up on fox last night
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:07.480]  Uh, it would not be even though it's uh, you know, the story's been in some tabloids
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:11.960]  I've noticed now it's being picked up like like by the daily telegraph in london
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:19.160]  Uh newspapers in india and and elsewhere around the world. So I I think there's uh, like the story
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.880]  What else is brewing?
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:27.320]  That I'm sure it'll be breaking by friday when you join us for a full hour. What else is on the radar screen?
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:32.680]  Well, I I I really think we uh, uh, and I know you've been addressing it this issue
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.160]  Uh with the uh, the migrants in europe, I think is coming to a head
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:43.480]  The other issue is I've looked at these uh, uh, Panama papers and it's quite clear there was cherry picking
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:50.280]  Extraordinaire going on there. It was just like the state department cables with wiki leaks the initial
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:55.800]  Uh releases were all focused on what the saudi king had to say about iran
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:01.880]  Uh, so uh here again, uh, they they didn't nail putin or the chinese president
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.760]  Uh, personally on any of these they they might have been some acquaintances some
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:13.080]  distant family members in the case of the chinese president some old friend of putin from st. Petersburg
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.640]  but uh, first of all, where are the americans? There's not one american named
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:20.040]  uh, and uh
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:22.040]  why uh, uh
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:30.840]  Was not the focus on individuals like the new argentine president who was installed by the global bankers in Buenos Aires
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:37.320]  Uh, he's in it over his head, but that's not the way the headlines read yesterday or today
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.720]  it's still focused on putin and uh, and of course, uh
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:50.200]  The international consortium international investigative journalist is funded by usaid, which is another name for the cia
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:52.680]  And george soros is open
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:57.320]  Society foundation, so it's quite clear where these guys are coming from and I think we're so dumb
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.960]  It's all out in the open. We have a story on info wars dot com
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:04.920]  And mccarthy was just talking about it. Wayne madson report dot com as well. Wayne. I know you're a busy guy
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:07.720]  We're a busy guy. We got to start pow wowing about you going to dc
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  Uh, you know to cover some of this. I know you're in dc a lot
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  but also going uh to
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:14.200]  um cleveland
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:18.680]  Uh, and also, uh, you know going to cover the democratic national convention for us
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:21.800]  Um, definitely be able to get his credentials into the republican deal
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:27.400]  The democrat as well, but outside's really where the news is going to be so i want you to get suited up and ready
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:34.040]  Are you able to cover those for us? Oh, absolutely, and I think uh, you know that unlike the last uh conventions, which were basically
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:38.200]  infomercials, uh, I think we're going to have like a little bit of a
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:43.960]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, you know back to the future deal. We're going to see a lot more brokered
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:46.440]  Uh aspect battle royale
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.040]  Yeah, yeah folks had wrestle mania this weekend. This is the real wrestle mania. This is going to be wild
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:42:01.400]  Yeah, just like, uh, chicago in 68 in atlantic city in 1960, uh, and some of the other, uh, uh, uh conventions where
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.680]  You know, it wasn't a foreseen conclusion that these, uh, candidates were going to be nominated
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.360]  So I think we're going to have aspects of of that with both conventions this year
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:16.680]  Wow, well very exciting time to be alive. I I feel sorry for folks that watch mainstream television and
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:22.760]  You know feel bored about life. I mean, this is such an incredible time the medical discoveries that are happening the
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:28.920]  Just all of it is so incredible that the the astrological, uh, things that are being discovered
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:34.680]  Uh, the astrophysical things that are being discovered just it's such an amazing time
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:37.880]  If you had it in 30 seconds or in just a few words describe
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:44.600]  The state of human and world development right now. What would it be? Wayne madson of Wayne madson report dot com
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:51.560]  We have access now to more information. It's ever been available to any one individual ever in history
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:54.840]  Uh, and I think uh, although that's a good thing
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:43:02.360]  I I you know, I just wish that the news media that also has access to this massive amount of information
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:07.000]  would focus their attention on more important things and not, you know, uh, what
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:14.120]  Uh, uh, you know Taylor Swift, uh, what color uh stocking. Well, you know, that's all done on purpose
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:19.480]  They've done he classified that but talking to your former NSA buddies and and and other people when I know you
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:22.120]  You go to the ap bar or whatever
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:27.960]  I'm seeing people in the system that used to even not like me. Tell me. Okay. You're right. We're really in deep trouble
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:34.600]  I mean, it seems like we've won the war for the hearts and minds of the people that we are run by globalist who are anti-free market
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:37.320]  Really anti-human sniveling evil people
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:43.240]  But then everybody in government corporations go. What do we do and quite frankly? I don't know what to do
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:45.640]  So it seems like we're winning the info war
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:48.120]  But then the elite are still in control
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  Sneering down on us quite frankly
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.800]  You know what they do in money python when they go visit the french castle. They're they're more than sneering at us
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:59.800]  They're they're doing, you know, what on us. What what do we do? Where is this going in?
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:03.000]  When you talk to those other folks you're you're contemporaries
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:06.600]  Are they waking up? Are some of the media people not so arrogant now?
[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:13.160]  Oh, I think so. I think you just look at this election even though the the elites are still behind the scenes trying to
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:19.800]  Manipulate but in both parties the the the candidates that everybody was talking about one year ago
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:26.360]  Uh, was jeb bush against hillary clinton one thing that Donald trump should get the Nobel peace prize for
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:32.600]  Destroying that bush brand for at least three more generations hopefully and and now once again
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:39.160]  Uh, hillary is not going to be coronated. It looks like I mean, she's having real trouble again and sanders
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:42.200]  Oh, yeah, do you think the the FBI will call for indictment?
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.640]  Uh, I what what I understand is not only was she uh running her own, uh,
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:55.800]  Clinton a foundation business on that private server, but she had established her own intelligence system and classified
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:03.880]  Management system to deal with that information outside the government. She was running her own organized crime syndicate milking the dictators
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.880]  Absolutely
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:12.840]  She is a true Lex Luthor in the real world. Wayne will talk to you friday. Great job. Uh, dude gets back today. Let's start, uh, planning
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:17.720]  Uh, what we're going to do with these conventions. Thank you. Absolutely. All right, there goes wane madsen
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.320]  Uh, wow, what an investigative journalist the real deal
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:25.880]  Uh, we're going to go until five after uh next hour before hand the baton to
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:27.480]  um
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:30.200]  David knight our intrepid reporter
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:35.240]  Who was on the ground in brookfield, wisconsin covering that key primary today
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:41.160]  That of course is richard reeves the guy telling you six months ago eight months ago a year ago obsessing on broker conventions
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:47.160]  Well, I tell you it's happening big time now. So richard reeves has got big developments from on the ground and inside baseball for us
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:49.160]  in just one moment
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:51.160]  Please don't forget history is happening here
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:57.000]  Just because we're willing to tell the truth and have the experts that know what's going on. I mean, it's really not that special
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:00.520]  But in a world of dumbed-down people and bought-off media
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:02.440]  We are special
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:04.440]  It's kind of like if a caveman invents a wheel
[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:08.120]  He's pretty special then not now. You're like, hey, well, I don't know about a wheel
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.080]  Well, we kind of reinvented the wheel here because nobody was using it
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:16.600]  In the info war. No one even wanted in 1997 info wars dot com
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.640]  I went the url was available for like 15 dollars. I mean is that info war. I knew about info war. I knew about
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:26.280]  Stuff like that because I was informed
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.320]  But no one wanted the url now. Everybody wants the url don't believe what I've been offered for it
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.960]  so
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:38.760]  Hillary says they're losing the info war. Yeah, because they thought we never catch up
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  No, we have caught up and now surpassed them. So
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:43.400]  We're doing great reaching people
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.520]  But man, I tell you it is expensive to have investigative journalists in the field in three different states right now
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:50.680]  It is well actually I got reporters in london
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.560]  It is expensive to do all this and to have this great crew
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:58.440]  And to bring you this info and we can get a couple more camera people and editors and a couple more reporters
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:01.400]  So that when people go on vacation, we're we're short-handed
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.640]  We we need five six seven more people
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:06.920]  We need a couple more writers too. We really need about 10 people

[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:38.520]  To richard reeves in location in brookville, wisconsin
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:41.160]  As the election is here
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:44.760]  With the big sex scandals the hookers the dead hooker scandals and the rest of it
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:48.920]  Uh on cruises back. He's lost his lead in a lot of polls. We covered that earlier
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:55.720]  Richard's there on the ground. We don't see crowds for Ted Cruz. We see huge crowds of our reporters there the last week and a half everywhere
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:00.840]  Mainly info wars supporters. It's amazing Richard reeves. Uh, we're going to break here in a few minutes
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:03.320]  But just tell us what's coming up and some of your bomb shells
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:05.560]  well, Alex
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:10.120]  One of the bomb shells is you careened into just a little while ago with Wayne Madsen is the fact
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:17.160]  That we have won the hearts and minds of the people they are awake the info wars that you started in the mid 90s
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:22.680]  That I latched on to in 1997 when I first heard you as a talk show host on kjfk
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.720]  Uh fm radio there out of austin texas. We have got the hearts of minds
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:33.720]  The only way we lose now Alex is if we are not organized enough or not networked enough to win
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:37.880]  The republican party is like a turtle that's been rolled over on its back
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:39.880]  They are on their last
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:44.840]  Literally on their last legs. They are just rigging everything they can right now to try to
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:47.880]  Not allow us to win in the rnc
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.720]  But the thing of it is
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:55.960]  Is we've got the numbers as you talked about a little while ago is in at the Donald trump rallies
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:59.160]  There are literally thousands of people. It's just they don't know exactly what to do
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:00.840]  They don't know about the delegate process
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.600]  They don't know how about to go to precinct conventions and coxes, etc
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:07.240]  And that's kind of good news too though because
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:12.680]  Where we're going to be at the rnc is the people that support ted crews
[02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:19.400]  They bottom line is they're almost on the same page as we are about the only difference between a lot of ted crew supporters
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:25.160]  Is that they don't believe in 9 11 truths, but they believe in the constitution. They're patriots most of them are patriots
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:31.800]  So ironically we're kind of in a battle amongst patriots amongst constitutionalists
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:35.400]  You've got the donald trump patriots, and you've got the ted crews patriots
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:40.440]  Even if he isn't really a patriot cruise he represents good people just like even if trump isn't good
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:42.200]  He's a figurehead for liberty
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:44.360]  And that's why they want to destroy him when we come back and want to get into this
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:48.600]  But listen the fight comes down to the media being told we're not putting up with your lies
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:54.120]  Where you have the cover to steal the delegates and the popular vote and to let the republican leadership know
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:51:01.480]  Like uh stone's doing we're gonna politically come after you will stone saying go to their hotel rooms. Ha ha ha
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:06.120]  Are you concerned about the power grid about the new war on the power grid?

[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:18.360]  Here's why an important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the power grid has just been written
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:25.880]  Incredibly the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited time to gcn listeners
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:31.320]  He simply asks that you pay three dollars to cover part of the shipping and handling cost even better
[02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:37.240]  If you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually fedex the book to you. Why do this?
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:41.160]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to fedex his new book?
[02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:42.600]  The answer is simple
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:46.600]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most americans are clueless
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:53.480]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is do you fear for your life?

[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:05.640]  december 7th
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:11.880]  1941 a date which will live in informates 75 years ago
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:15.960]  america suffered one of the worst moments in american history
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.360]  The attack on pearl harbour
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:28.920]  Now you can remember december 7th 1941 with the purchase of the first ever 75th anniversary pearl harbour legal tender solid gold coin

[02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:07.080]  They don't want just
[02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:09.080]  me
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:15.320]  So the wall street journal came out yesterday we mentioned it and said the police could be controlling your self-driving car
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:21.880]  I know that's old news for our audience, but it's not just me the police. It's hackers. It's governments. It's the globalist
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:27.240]  I mean what if everything has backdoors in it and space aliens arrive that know how to control it
[02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:32.840]  I'm not saying what's going to happen just or there's a glitch or the satellites all get blown up by a solar flare
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:37.800]  On and on and on we are building a system that makes us totally and absolutely
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.840]  dependent and pathetic and stupid
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:45.480]  Where'd arithmetic go the calculator
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:52.140]  Where did our immune system go the antibiotics this stuff should be used in emergencies
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:59.160]  You shouldn't have autonomous drones and robots and where I'm getting it is the elite are building this they're running it globally
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:03.400]  They don't like a Donald Trump showing up and going I think I'll get elected. I think I can run against these people
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:09.240]  I don't like us having unfair deals. It's a plan to deindustrialize this Donald. It's a plan to sell us out
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.000]  And now they're coming in to block you because they don't like it
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:16.600]  The truth is anybody could get up there and call for sovereignty and people support them
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:21.240]  But they own the political process through fraud and so this is a big
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:27.560]  Come to jesus moment when the curtain gets pulled back by todo richard. Uh, what have you witnessed there in wisconsin?
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:29.000]  What's coming next?
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.720]  Uh, this is just going to be quite quite a year my friend
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:35.800]  Yes, absolutely. It's going to be quite a summer in july and cleveland
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:42.040]  That's going to be a big throwdown and we've got a preview of cleveland potentially happening right here in wisconsin because alex
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:44.040]  They put every bit of machinery
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.440]  From the republican establishment behind ted cruz up here in wisconsin
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:54.280]  They've got radio talk show host going on for hours and hours and hours and helps ted cruz is the best
[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:58.440]  He's the greatest and how the donald trump is the worst thing ever
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:02.360]  So it's just hours and hours and so to see that machinery
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:06.360]  Really be put into play here has been amazing and of course
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.560]  Part of what comes with the republican establishment getting behind you is the ground forces that they are the ones that
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:16.440]  Literally knock on doors in neighborhoods. They're connected to their neighbors. They're passing out flyers
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:22.200]  They're having barbecues together in their neighborhoods. They're making phone calls that machinery has all been loaned
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:24.840]  Here in wisconsin to ted cruz now. We know
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:28.680]  I want to say exactly what the democrats put out that donald trump's dumb
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:36.680]  Well, that's it that and this that's the other thing is they've even the establishment has drug out the left
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:40.200]  To attack trump as well. I mean they're playing bernie sanders ads on
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:45.240]  conservative talk radio here locally that and i wouldn't be surprised if hillary or george soros
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:49.320]  Probably paid for those ads. So like i said, they've brought every tool for the shed out
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:54.120]  Anointed one and that's the new thing for the another one is he connected to dead dead madams
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.920]  The anointed one, you know, the anointed vampire
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:02.840]  And see they won't even talk about that. They'll ignore that of course now if if ted cruz were to win the nomination
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.000]  They're absolutely gonna barbeque and freak a z ted cruz, you know
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.920]  But that's the other spin is that is that trump will be barbecued by hillary bull
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:14.360]  He'll run her over he'll run that bug-eyed witch over
[02:57:14.840 --> 02:57:15.560]  There's no doubt
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:20.280]  But let me go back to this big picture that we were talking about a little while ago how you started this in the mid 90s
[02:57:20.520 --> 02:57:26.280]  Well, you know, it's that old axiom of first they ignore you then they ridicule you then you fight and then you win
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:31.320]  Well up till 2008 basically we were all on ignore the patriot constitutional people
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:37.160]  They were ignoring us in 2008 when ron paul came along from 2008 to 2012
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:43.320]  We went into the the ridicule mode. We saw that happen and uh ultimately where they switched into the fight mode
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:49.400]  And now we've been taken over the republican party and the establishment from the pope to the chinese communist are having conniption fits
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:56.280]  That's right. They're having conniption fits because in 2012 we went into the fight mode when we saw them institute that rule 40 b
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:58:03.400]  That every talks about everybody talks about and that was specifically that rule was designed to crush the ron paul delegates
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:10.280]  In 2012 well, guess what those ron paul delegates that represented probably about 25 or 30 of that delegation
[02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:15.400]  In 2012 in tampa. They didn't forget about that and they're not gonna follow ron paul's deal
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:20.440]  Uh, good for rancy and he will support him and I get ron paul's a purist. That's fine. We respect him
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:24.360]  But this is about war against the globalist not just about having a perfect purist record
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:26.840]  And i'll tell ron that the next time he's on i mean i disagree with him
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:29.640]  It's it's good. We disagree on something we can actually have a discussion, but
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:35.880]  I'm all in i mean when the chinese communist murders are telling us that we can't have somebody and they're doing it for real
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:40.600]  I'll tell those shotgun murdering filth their mobile execution van something go straight back to the companies
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:44.600]  How old you came from scum i'll say whatever i want and that means kim jong-un too as well
[02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:50.200]  You little fat piece of garbage murdering vampire pig demon. We'll be back in 70 seconds four hours stay with us
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:56.920]  Brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do joins us you worked
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:01.240]  I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force did i've been working all day
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:06.760]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of run down
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:10.840]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:15.080]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later
[02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:20.520]  It's like being everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars people really love it
[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:22.840]  Read about it find out why third party
[02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:30.600]  Neutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:34.600]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:36.680]  I went home about 6 45 this morning
[02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:40.600]  Took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in
[02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:49.640]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at info wars life.com or call 888 253 3139
[02:59:49.640 --> 02:59:56.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:14.200]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:20.200]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:28.520]  The war is on
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.200]  I think it says a lot about the whole donald trump camp the insiders there
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  that they know to
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:38.120]  Be tied into the info war pretty much constantly
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  A lot of exciting stuff coming up
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.880]  The american people are taking the gloves off against the globalist. They want to conquer us down to the individual
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:50.440]  By the way, bernie sanders about a month ago came out or I guess three weeks ago and came out and said
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:52.920]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:55.800]  And I said we're gonna have a meme contest for a week
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:00.360]  I'll announce the winner and then I never really ordered the crew to follow it and a bunch of submissions came in
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:05.480]  We never posted them. Well, they pulled them up yesterday. They were in the email. They're on info wars.com
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:07.320]  We're gonna give it till friday now
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:14.120]  So more folks can enter the contest the thousand dollar winner will be announced second place 500 third place. We'll get a hillary for prison
[03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:16.040]  t-shirt
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:18.920]  And the article is up on info wars dot com
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:27.960]  So you can see some of the contest entries that have already come in here's the headline meme contest exposes sanders
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.080]  Absurd white people don't know what it's like
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  to be poor remark
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:39.320]  We'll announce the winners on friday at the end of the third hour maybe in the fourth hour
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:43.960]  That way all the great memes get coverage on facebook and twitter and everywhere else
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:46.920]  But it's not about winning a thousand dollars. It's about getting involved
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:51.640]  Encountering this crazy hypocrisy richard three minutes and 10 seconds till we
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:55.960]  Handle baton to david knight. You've got the floor. What else you want to get into here?
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:03.080]  All right. Well talking about bernie there. Basically, I've really joined the larry nickles camp about the uh race in the democrat party
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:08.440]  I think really, you know, we've been hearing this email story about hillary. Oh, will she be indicted etc etc
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:12.040]  I just think that the whole thing with the emails right now is yes
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:16.280]  They can't take her down anytime they want to but basically it's made it look like she's under attack
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:20.920]  Oh, please vote for her democrats line up for her and then same time bernie sanders
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:23.640]  Taking away would be donald trump votes
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:27.640]  So I think basically the whole game on the left has just been big diversion
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:32.600]  A to help hillary b to hurt donald trump and then c you know
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:36.600]  They might even take hillary out at the right time and put in biden. Who knows what they'll do
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:39.080]  But coming back to the republican party
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:42.040]  GOP race here in wisconsin
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:48.680]  Really one of the things about john casick is this why has he stayed in the race and and what it's boiled down to is this
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:53.080]  John casick is basically the representative of the legacy
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:59.480]  Established from the faction of the republican party. That's why they have to keep him in the race because if they don't keep him in the race
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:02.680]  In these upcoming, there's about 15 or 20 states remaining
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:06.680]  If john casick's not there then a lot of the established voters
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.720]  They may not even come out to vote and even worse
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:17.800]  Would be as those people don't come and and participate in the convention process the caucus process and get themselves to cleveland
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:20.120]  thereby they would vacate
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:25.400]  positions for constitutionalists and patriots delegates to fill up the cleveland convention hall
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:30.600]  So that's why they're keeping john casick in this race. He's kind of the placeholder for the establishment
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.360]  I think down the road
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:33.720]  if they do
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:40.440]  Have a a high majority delegate representation at the r&c, which I don't think they will I think I think we're going to have
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:45.400]  60 to 70 percent of the quick and loans arena is going to be
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:50.440]  Constitutionalists and patriots. We're going to load that thing up with 60 70 percent
[03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:55.240]  Constitutionalists and patriots the problem is we're divided between trump and cruz
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:57.800]  So what you're going to be seeing is potentially ted
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:04.200]  Trying to line up with the establishment that 20 or 30 percent delegates to have a majority that way or
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:07.000]  You know trump could be in that he's in that position too
[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:10.680]  But the other thing about trump is he can come across and I think grab
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:15.400]  10 or 20 percent of ted's delegates if he approaches it the right way
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:20.040]  So basically I see that the establishment is going to have a minority faction there in cleveland
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:25.080]  And the only way they're going to get what they're going to get is because casick's in the race if he dropped out right now
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:28.120]  We would probably have an 80 maybe even 90 percent
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:34.040]  Constitutionist patriot delegation there in cleveland. So that's casick's role is to make sure
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:39.560]  The establishment legacy faction of the delegates show up to cleveland to get there to cleveland
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:44.600]  And so that they have an opportunity and part of the gambit is we're out of time. David night's coming up
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:47.720]  We'll talk to you more tomorrow. Great job. David night takes over. Don't forget

[03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:07.240]  A leaked memo reveals how the trump campaign really feels about the establishment
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:15.160]  An internal memo leaked to the washington post reveals the level of disdain that trump has for the political establishment
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:21.000]  And they're talking heads in the mainstream media the memo entitled digging through the bulls
[03:05:21.400 --> 03:05:28.840]  Is written by donald trump senior advisor barry benet who said the mainstream media and washington establishment are working together
[03:05:28.840 --> 03:05:37.160]  Like never before to bash the trump campaign as the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for donald trump
[03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:41.800]  And they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign
[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:48.760]  The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between trump's rising popularity and the media talking points
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:55.400]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our

[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:43.800]  I'm david night your host on this bright cold day in april when the clock is striking
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:50.040]  13 yeah, that's the opening of george orwell's 1984 and i thought it was interesting place to start this hour
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:52.760]  There's a story from rt
[03:08:53.480 --> 03:08:57.640]  Talking about how the bbc the actual ministry of truth
[03:08:58.040 --> 03:09:03.080]  This is what orwell patterned it after he worked at the bbc and we'll talk about
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:06.920]  The connections to the bbc and the ministry of truth of propaganda
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:12.680]  Of course now the bbc is going to put a statue up to honor george orwell
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:15.400]  I guess that gives them street cred
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:23.960]  Not really not really they say despite his resignation from the bbc in 1943 when he grew tired of quote pushing propaganda
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:29.000]  A statue is being made of george orwell the author of 1984
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:33.480]  And it'll soon be outside the london headquarters of the bbc
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:38.760]  And of course his real name is eric blair. If you don't know they say the inscription
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:42.840]  That will be there with a statue is if liberty means anything at all
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:46.280]  It means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
[03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:47.880]  hmm
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:52.200]  Sounds like a pushback against political correctness. It sounds like a micro aggression
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:54.200]  and of course
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:10:02.120]  People like george orwell would be shown the door and today's bbc in a split second because they are the home
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:08.280]  of political correctness look at what they did with top gear and jeremy clarkson the many years of course they use the
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:13.800]  The the physical uh altercation that he had with one of the guys they were going to get rid of him anyway
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:18.360]  They absolutely despised jeremy clarkson because in a humorous way
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:26.840]  He exposed their political correctness so they they despised him like they despised donald trump because he doesn't expose their political correctness with any humor
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:31.960]  He's very blunt and in their face about it. And I think that's the way we need to confront political correctness
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:39.240]  The greatest threat to free speech and free thought in the world today is the political correctness that is being taught in the
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:42.920]  University back to the story they point out of course the bbc
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:49.480]  That now is going to uh portray itself as honoring george orwell. He actually
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:54.840]  Used room 101 as the torture chamber that he depicts in 1984
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:11:00.920]  So they take people to room 101 in 1984 to torture them well 1984 was named after
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:08.120]  The conference room and the bbc headquarters where he had a severe disliking as the rt points it out
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:15.160]  They say in his 1943 resignation letter that you can find on the bbc's online archives george orwell
[03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:18.520]  attacked the corporation's tendency to broadcast
[03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:22.440]  hopeless hopeless propaganda on india
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:28.520]  Well, it's a different issue today. It's not india, but it's still hopeless propaganda remember we had the
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:35.080]  Person at the pentagon briefing who said nobody believes us. This is
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:39.320]  This is just useless propaganda. They know that we're lying to them
[03:11:40.040 --> 03:11:43.480]  Said that at the pentagon briefing remember that was put up on the drudge report
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:45.480]  She said people can look up the information on
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:48.840]  On the internet they can look it up on the drudge report
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:54.520]  They know that we're lying to them and it's not getting us anywhere. Why are we continuing down this process?
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:56.520]  Well, that's the way the establishment works
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:12:02.280]  You know when i'm looking at what's happening in north carolina and i'm thinking about the way
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:05.320]  They push their agenda
[03:12:05.960 --> 03:12:09.240]  It's a story on the new america and talking about how north carolina is being punished for
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:12.120]  Protecting privacy and as i was on my way into work today
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:17.800]  I heard on the news that we now have paypal saying they are going to boycott north carolina
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:24.280]  And we've had mayors from seattle and san francisco saying they're going boycott north carolina now
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:29.160]  You know the new york governor Cuomo has also said the same thing. I don't know what it means
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:31.720]  When you've got a city
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:36.760]  That is going to boycott north carolina. Well, it's traveled to north carolina. Do they really
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:41.880]  Do that much travel to north carolina? Is that going to bring north carolina to its knees?
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:45.080]  And of course the big deal with paypal is they were going to send in
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:47.400]  400
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:52.280]  Jobs into north carolina. So north carolina needs to bow down
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:57.560]  To the demands of the people from san francisco and seattle in new york and paypal
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:03.080]  Look, i've been boycotting paypal myself for a long time because of their complicency
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:05.480]  With the nsa
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:10.760]  They don't respect and understand freedom of any sort and yet they want to lecture north carolina. What are they concerned about?
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:13.640]  Well, maybe you don't know this issue if you're not in north carolina
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:18.120]  The city of charlotte passed a regulation that would demand that
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:23.800]  People of any sex could use any bathroom that they wished because they wanted to cater to
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:25.640]  Transsexuals
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:30.280]  They didn't care about the privacy of women or children or even men for that example
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:36.760]  I I don't want to be in a restroom where women are coming in and women don't want to be in a restroom where men are coming in
[03:13:37.160 --> 03:13:40.440]  And it's not only just the restrooms. That is also locker rooms
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:46.920]  So they decided that they were catered to the lgbt crowd and immediately north carolina said not going to happen
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:48.920]  Not going to happen the
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:54.760]  Senate and the house passed a bill the governor signed it now. There's been a lawsuit
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:13:57.800]  By the aclu
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:05.080]  By a group that was the group that actually put this through interestingly enough. They said you're you're portraying us as child molesters
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:07.080]  And yet the group that put this through
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:09.560]  Had as its head
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:13.960]  a transgender individual who has been convicted of
[03:14:13.960 --> 03:14:19.560]  Of sex with minors or some kind of illegal sexual issue with minors in the past
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:24.280]  So there you go the guy who put this thing through or woman whatever he is at this point
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:27.720]  Okay, actually has a history of this sort of thing
[03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:30.760]  The senate republican leader and house speaker had a statement
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:32.760]  They said this lawsuit that has been filed
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:38.280]  Takes this debate out of the hands of the voters and instead attempts to argue with a straight face that there is a
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:45.160]  Previously undiscovered right in the u.s constitution for men to use women's bathrooms and locker rooms
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:50.520]  And now the attorney general of north carolina roi cooper who is going to be running?
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:55.160]  I would add very unsuccessfully for governor in north carolina. He's a democrat
[03:14:55.720 --> 03:14:59.560]  He has said that he is not going to defend this lawsuit to try to
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:03.560]  uh, essentially overturn the law that has been the
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:09.240]  Uh overwhelmingly passed by the republican senate house and signed by the republican governor
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:16.040]  New american is reporting on this and they say it's simply not credible to argue that this is a constitutional right
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.720]  They say james madison george washington
[03:15:20.120 --> 03:15:26.520]  Ben franklin did not intend to make sure that men could use a little girl's room when they drafted the constitution
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:28.440]  1787
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:32.920]  And one of the people speaking out on this is paul stam somebody that i know personally and
[03:15:32.920 --> 03:15:36.680]  And like david simpson in texas, you know occasionally you run across
[03:15:37.480 --> 03:15:40.120]  an individual in government that has integrity
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:42.760]  not just integrity but
[03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:45.160]  solid solid integrity
[03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:49.560]  david simpson is someone like that here in texas. He's the guy who
[03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:52.840]  offered the bill to stop the tsa from
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:58.040]  Doing what it's doing to all of us at the airport, but you know most of americans don't really care about that anymore
[03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:06.280]  They don't care about their decency or the privacy, but he did. He also offered an amendment to get marijuana completely out of the texas
[03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:08.120]  legal code
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:12.360]  I really respect the man paul stam is one of those individuals
[03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:17.640]  With that kind of integrity doesn't necessarily agree with those same issues, but he says this
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:24.360]  He said we're trying to protect the reasonable expectations of privacy of 99.9 of our citizens who think
[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:30.840]  That they're going into a restroom or into a changing room or into a locker room and that they will be private
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:38.360]  Now as we were reminded this weekend with hillary clinton's gaffe for planned parenthood
[03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:42.520]  Privacy doesn't mean what you think it means
[03:16:43.560 --> 03:16:45.960]  And we've seen this illustrated to us
[03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:48.520]  over and over again
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:53.160]  You don't have privacy when it comes to your papers your personal effects the things that are numerated
[03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:57.400]  And principle and the fourth amendment. No, you don't have any privacy there
[03:16:57.560 --> 03:17:02.200]  You don't have any privacy anymore in restrooms according to what the progressives want to do
[03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:06.200]  No, the only place that you have any privacy the only time that you have privacy
[03:17:07.240 --> 03:17:09.240]  Is when you want to kill a baby
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:11.720]  Then it's an issue of privacy
[03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:15.880]  The only time that you have choice is not how you're going to educate your child
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:20.200]  It's not what you're going to do in your life. No, the only place that you have choice
[03:17:20.200 --> 03:17:22.600]  Is when you choose to kill your child
[03:17:23.640 --> 03:17:26.520]  And of course as hillary clinton was talking about it this weekend
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:30.120]  The planned parenthood people are very upset with her
[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:36.600]  She just threw out all the scripted language that they used to control us. You see they picked the terms
[03:17:37.320 --> 03:17:42.120]  Very very carefully so that they can manipulate you and she didn't say
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:44.920]  terminating a fetus
[03:17:44.920 --> 03:17:51.560]  And as I pointed out last night, it's almost I can imagine like the screw tape letters at cs luis did where he had a
[03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:54.600]  a devil talking to another devil and a
[03:17:55.560 --> 03:18:02.200]  You know fictional thing here where he's basically trying to lay out issues that confront christians in their life
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:06.440]  Talking about how you know, don't don't focus on this person being
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:10.920]  A real person that's sitting in the the pew next to you
[03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:16.120]  Focus on the fact that they have funny hair or that they've got squeaky shoes as they sit down in the church
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:19.800]  Pew that type of thing as though he's he's giving lectures to the
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:24.520]  Lower demon as to how to manipulate people and I thought you know when I saw these these
[03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:29.400]  Protestations from planned parenthood. It's kind of like the screw tape letters to hillary clinton
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:36.440]  Do not talk about a child having constitutional rights or a person having constitutional rights. No, it's not a child
[03:18:36.920 --> 03:18:38.360]  It's not a child
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:40.040]  It's a fetus
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:42.040]  We have fetus is latin for baby
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:44.680]  But people don't think about that
[03:18:44.760 --> 03:18:49.960]  Okay, it really is a child. You can call it a fetus. You can call it a child. You can call it a person
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:52.920]  It is all of those things all of those things
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:55.960]  and yet for her to say
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:19:03.000]  No, no, no, no, no an unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights and the people with planned parenthood
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:06.360]  I could just see them stomping their feet and pulling their hair out
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:08.120]  and yet
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:10.120]  She didn't have a bad week
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:11.880]  Not according to the mainstream press
[03:19:11.960 --> 03:19:19.160]  It was donald trump that had a bad week when he said something about abortion when he got into a strong argument with
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:22.360]  uh chris matthew's
[03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:27.960]  Kept pushing him on this and and I think he got donald trump a bit confused fine. Whatever
[03:19:28.840 --> 03:19:34.360]  Donald trump is not a dictator who is going to be able to tell us what the abortion laws is and we need to get
[03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:40.680]  Over this idea that the supreme court should be a dictator one of the things one of the gaffes that nobody even talked about
[03:19:40.840 --> 03:19:42.200]  It should be a gaff
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:47.160]  But they accept it hillary clinton was saying roe v. Wade is the law of the land. It's the constitution
[03:19:47.240 --> 03:19:53.880]  No, the supreme court does not make law at least it shouldn't and we should not accept that right
[03:19:54.360 --> 03:19:59.720]  That's one of the key problems with ted cruz. He accepts the idea that the supreme court
[03:19:59.720 --> 03:20:03.720]  Legislates and amends our constitution

[03:20:19.960 --> 03:20:21.800]  I said let me see
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:27.560]  Well, I took his pertinent information then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent
[03:20:27.560 --> 03:20:32.520]  And found one who pre approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted
[03:20:32.920 --> 03:20:34.920]  When it comes to term life insurance
[03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:41.080]  No other company touches select quotes experience and expertise and finding the right policy

[03:21:25.960 --> 03:21:31.240]  He simply asks that you pay three dollars to cover part of the shipping and handling cost even better

[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:41.080]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:46.520]  The answer is simple America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless

[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:12.760]  Destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests. How is this even possible?
[03:23:13.320 --> 03:23:18.040]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated
[03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:24.040]  Fountain of Youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[03:23:24.360 --> 03:23:28.680]  That it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing in the past
[03:23:28.680 --> 03:23:32.840]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units
[03:23:33.160 --> 03:23:39.160]  But for a limited time the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs
[03:23:39.480 --> 03:23:43.400]  Specifically for our conservative friends, but you must act fast
[03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:49.880]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard our supply is extremely limited right now to claim your free samples of
[03:23:49.960 --> 03:23:53.800]  Patriot Power Greens go to greens 75.com

[03:24:10.840 --> 03:24:17.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. We're going to talk in this segment about Wisconsin's cheesy establishment politics
[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:19.880]  But before we do
[03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:24.440]  I want to tell you that we now have actually sold out of Anthroplex who warned you about that yesterday
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:27.480]  We would sell out of our new supplement selling very quickly
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:29.960]  Even though it is sold out
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:35.000]  We've held back a small supply for everyone who goes to info wars life.com and chooses auto ship
[03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:40.760]  And that's the way that you can make sure you never run out of the supplements that you like to use in your personal life
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:43.720]  Sign up for auto ship. It helps us to manage our inventory and
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:50.200]  We'd like to make this a win-win situation. Help us manage our inventory. We give you a 10 discount
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:55.880]  Off of everything that you buy when you sign up as a regular auto ship customer again
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:25:01.400]  Anthroplex is sold out. You can still sign up and get that as a auto ship customer
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:04.520]  And that is true of any of our sold out products as well
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:10.920]  We also have vitamin mineral fusion. That's our new drink mix. It's at info wars life.com
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:16.120]  That is still available. It's we'll sell out of that pretty quickly as well because this is a limited first run
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:21.880]  We've worked for years with chemists to create the most powerful affordable great tasting multivitamin formula out there
[03:25:22.120 --> 03:25:24.120]  It gives you a full month supply
[03:25:24.360 --> 03:25:29.000]  Of essential vitamins minerals and amino acids that your body needs and the best thing about this
[03:25:29.320 --> 03:25:34.680]  There's no fillers in it. It's all plant derived or the highest quality lab standards
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:37.560]  So there's no heavy metals or anything in that
[03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:42.280]  It's got the essential ingredients that you're going to need for full months base
[03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:44.280]  of
[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:48.520]  Nutrients. So that's there's something I try today and and it's actually it's very good tasting
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:49.480]  I'm going to try it
[03:25:49.480 --> 03:25:52.760]  Leanne McAdoo was talking with alex jones yesterday and saying that she
[03:25:53.240 --> 03:25:57.720]  Tried it with some mineral water some sparkling mineral water. I think that would really
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:03.880]  Pop it in terms of the taste, but it's very good tasting. It's sweet. It's got the xylitol in it
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:09.400]  Which is one of the sweeteners that I like to always look for. I don't like sugar sugar. Rot your teeth
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:16.600]  Xylitol has calories. It's not one of these synthetic petroleum based sweeteners that's not good for you
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:18.920]  It's also not something that eats your brain
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:22.600]  um, like some of these other artificial sweeteners, but
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:27.720]  Xylitol is a natural ingredient and it is actually good for your teeth
[03:26:27.800 --> 03:26:31.880]  It was actually a dentist who recommended it to me the first time I tried it
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:35.800]  And we started using that as a sugar replacement in our household
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:42.920]  It's got a little bit less calories than sugar, but again, it's something that like everything else in the vitamin mineral fusion drink
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:50.520]  We have carefully selected the ingredients to give you the best quality we can find you can find that at info wars life dot com
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:53.640]  Today, of course, is the wisconsin primary
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:58.600]  And it was interesting today to see a new poll that came out that showed donald trump
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:03.720]  As a 10 lead now the question is is this a real
[03:27:03.720 --> 03:27:05.480]  Uh
[03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:09.640]  Result or is this showing a new trend or is this an outlier poll?
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:11.960]  This came from the american research group now
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:16.120]  This is not a poll company that I was very familiar with so I did a little bit of research at it
[03:27:16.520 --> 03:27:19.000]  I looked at some background one person
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:22.360]  Who went through and analyzed this pointed out that well
[03:27:23.400 --> 03:27:25.400]  In six states for example
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:31.320]  They did a very good job of predicting where trump was going to be even though
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:34.760]  Uh, other polls were not doing that for example in new hampshire
[03:27:35.240 --> 03:27:39.720]  They had predicted that trump would get 33. He actually got 35.3 in south carolina
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:44.120]  They predicted that he would get 34 the actual results are 32.5
[03:27:44.120 --> 03:27:47.400]  So we see this over and over again in texas they predicted
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:51.720]  32 he actually got 26.7 so that was the biggest difference
[03:27:52.360 --> 03:27:57.240]  But then in some other places like florida they predicted he would get 49. He got 45.8
[03:27:57.240 --> 03:28:03.400]  The question is with all these polls and and you know, we look at these polls and they talk about them being scientific polls
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:06.760]  The question is always
[03:28:07.160 --> 03:28:11.560]  How scientific can it be if they get such radically different results?
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:14.440]  That's the thing that always concerns me
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:20.200]  Even though they'll typically say that they've got a margin of error of about four or five percent
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:22.680]  If you look at most of these polls their samples are
[03:28:23.400 --> 03:28:25.400]  About four or five hundred people
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:31.960]  There was one poll that was conducted in wisconsin and it was uh, I think it was uh ended in march 22nd
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:35.240]  So what's almost two weeks old now?
[03:28:36.040 --> 03:28:42.440]  But in that poll you had trump winning by two or three percent that poll though only had a margin of error of one percent
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:48.840]  And they had a sample of 6200 people. So that's why they got their margin of error down
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:53.480]  So there's always a question when you look at these polls just how scientific they are if they're scientific
[03:28:53.480 --> 03:28:58.200]  How do all these different groups get such radically different results? Let's take a look at
[03:28:58.840 --> 03:29:04.840]  Uh, this particular one for example besides the 10 point lead they have trump at 42 percent crews at 32
[03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:12.520]  Hot air looks at it and they say well, okay. Nobody else has predicted this wide lead and everybody else is predicting crews by
[03:29:13.080 --> 03:29:14.920]  three to five percent
[03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:16.600]  so they say
[03:29:16.600 --> 03:29:20.440]  It wouldn't be unusual for ARG to miss big on a primary during the campaign
[03:29:20.440 --> 03:29:25.880]  They say they've gotten some more or less right and I just read to you six of them where they got it very close
[03:29:26.440 --> 03:29:30.200]  But they say that they also missed some other ones. They called
[03:29:31.080 --> 03:29:34.360]  uh one state for kasek and he didn't even come close
[03:29:34.360 --> 03:29:38.600]  So we don't really know exactly where this is going to go. It's certainly interesting to see
[03:29:39.400 --> 03:29:41.400]  that according to this poll
[03:29:41.800 --> 03:29:48.680]  Kasek is taking a lot of the democrats and independents that may be why donald trump is so upset about kasek remaining
[03:29:48.680 --> 03:29:53.640]  And stay with us. We'll be right back. We're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:54.520 --> 03:29:57.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.640 --> 03:30:09.400]  A member of parliament in switzerland says the muslim refugee crisis could trigger a new world war
[03:30:09.640 --> 03:30:17.480]  Swiss people's party member roger koppel is warning everyone that the european migrant crisis is so out of control
[03:30:17.480 --> 03:30:26.200]  That it could lead to a full out world war. He also says that civilizations that fail to secure their borders are doomed
[03:30:26.440 --> 03:30:32.600]  koppel's comments echo those made by numerous other prominent political and military leaders
[03:30:32.920 --> 03:30:41.880]  Norwegian army chief odin joe hannison says europe must be prepared to fight to defend their values against radical islam
[03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:47.800]  swedish army general anders bronstrom has ordered his troops to prepare for war
[03:30:48.040 --> 03:30:53.560]  And swiss army chief andre blotman says the social unrest is intensifying

[03:33:25.880 --> 03:33:29.000]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight in this fourth hour
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:34.200]  And of course tonight is the wisconsin primary we haven't had a primary last week
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:38.280]  So it's been two weeks since we've had a primary. It's a bit of a dry spell here. It's going to be a couple of weeks
[03:33:38.280 --> 03:33:43.720]  I think before we have another big primary in new york. I believe it's coming up april 19th a lot of
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:49.240]  States in the northeast are going to be voting coming up. That's why many people have said
[03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:56.440]  As roger stone tweeted out. He said when or lose Ted Cruz is going to be dead in the water by april the 26th because
[03:33:56.440 --> 03:34:01.480]  He's headed to an area that is very very hostile to him
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:05.400]  He said he doesn't share new yorkers values and they understand that
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:09.720]  They understand he doesn't value new york, but in wisconsin
[03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:15.320]  It's his territory. You got to understand when we talk about wisconsin's politics
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:22.360]  That is the place where paul ryan is it's where ryan's previous the rnc head is from and of course remember
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:26.680]  As the presidential campaign kicked off last summer scott walker
[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:33.560]  Wisconsin's republican governor was the person that the establishment and i'm talking about the GOP establishment as well as the media
[03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:36.200]  Were telling us he was the guy to watch
[03:34:36.440 --> 03:34:40.920]  He was going to be the one that probably would take it possibly would take it away from jeb bush
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:49.400]  Well, the guy was as wooden as ryan's previous and he didn't have a pulse not in the polls probably not in real life
[03:34:49.400 --> 03:34:53.000]  Wisconsin is establishment territory
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:35:00.040]  And if the best that ted Cruz can do is pull off a four or five percent
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:06.920]  When in that area when he's got all of the establishment backing him there where they've had massive
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:09.960]  ads run against him but primarily
[03:35:10.360 --> 03:35:15.720]  The conservative talk radio host if that's the best that he can do in essentially home territory
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:18.200]  Then he is done
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:21.320]  This is something that came out of politico, which i think is very interesting
[03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:27.080]  We've had our info wars crew up in wisconsin for the last week. We've had four people up there
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:30.520]  We've had richard reeves that alex jones was just talking to he's still there
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:35.240]  He's going to be there today looking at exit polls and talking to people. We've also had
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:41.480]  Rob do my son travis night and kit daniels our writer have all been up there for the last week
[03:35:42.280 --> 03:35:47.240]  And they've been going to rally after rally after rally massive rallies
[03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:51.640]  Giant rallies and so then we see this politico story today
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:54.360]  milwaukee snubs trump
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:36:00.840]  Now it may be true what they're saying that he went to a half empty auditorium in milwaukee because milwaukee
[03:36:01.400 --> 03:36:07.640]  is the territory of paul ryan and these talk show hosts like charlie sykes or
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:11.480]  Snikes or something like that. That's a local talk show host who
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:12.840]  uh
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:15.480]  Had a back and forth with donald trump and they've been basically
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:17.480]  Trashing trump
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:19.720]  Around the clock. There's about five
[03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:25.080]  Local radio hosts in wisconsin that have been doing that but they say there was a half empty auditorium in milwaukee
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:28.840]  They don't say how big the auditorium was and they don't talk about how big ted cruz's
[03:36:29.480 --> 03:36:34.440]  Uh auditorium or crowd size were but they just say well everybody was excited for ted cruz
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:38.760]  But things were really kind of drab for trump and that's really not what our reporters saw
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:43.800]  That's why we send reporters to these places so we can give you our first-hand account
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:47.000]  Just as we began the broadcast talking about how
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:52.360]  George Orwell left the bbc saying it was nothing but hopeless propaganda
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:59.000]  That's what we're seeing from the mainstream media. Look at this memo that came out of the trump campaign from the washington post
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:36:59.960]  this is
[03:36:59.960 --> 03:37:06.520]  Uh, the wash headline is internal memo reveals trump campaigns mounting fury with its critics
[03:37:06.520 --> 03:37:10.840]  They say in a private document that was circulated over the weekend and obtained by the washington post
[03:37:10.840 --> 03:37:15.480]  Trump campaign senior advisor barry bennett revealed the mounting frustrations
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:20.760]  Among top aides of trump as they closed what has become a tumultuous week
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:26.760]  That's the narrative that everybody is repeating over and oh, it's been a terrible week for donald trump because you know
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:32.360]  He stood up against some patently false charges against his campaign manager
[03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:36.440]  Don't listen to the narrative from the mainstream media
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  Look at the video
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:44.040]  Look at fields testimony about how she was thrown to the ground. It was the worst thing that happened to her
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:48.760]  Since her father died really really? I mean you talk about
[03:37:49.640 --> 03:37:53.240]  Some feminists getting triggered and of course, that's what we have seen
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:55.880]  with the megan kelly
[03:37:55.880 --> 03:38:01.240]  press corps and that includes some men like that local talk show host and
[03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:07.320]  Uh, wisconsin charlie, whatever his name is. Well, I've got his name in here somewhere, but let me read you this memo
[03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:13.400]  It was entitled digging through the bs and he spelled it out. He says america
[03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:18.280]  This is what a senior advisor to the trump campaign said about the establishment
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:26.280]  He said america is sick of them their idiotic attacks just remind voters why they hate the washington establishment
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:31.800]  He goes on to say the media themselves couldn't wait to label this week the worst week yet ever
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:39.240]  They said yet another pathetic display of the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and our
[03:38:39.480 --> 03:38:44.520]  Causes when reached by phone Bennett confirmed that he wrote the memo and sent it to his colleagues in the campaign
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:47.080]  He said personally it's been a very hard time
[03:38:47.480 --> 03:38:52.840]  You've got republicans in washington saying they're keeping lists of people who work for mr. Trump
[03:38:52.840 --> 03:38:54.840]  Oh, you know kind of like a macartheism
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:39:01.080]  Who say you'll never work in this town again good because we need honest people
[03:39:01.080 --> 03:39:05.880]  Outside of washington. We need people who will shut this criminal
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:12.440]  Cancer that is metastasizing all over this country in every issue washington wants to control our lives
[03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:17.160]  We need to shut that down. We need to have good people not working in that town
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:23.000]  We need to understand that everything is not going to be solved by sending people to washington even a president
[03:39:23.880 --> 03:39:28.040]  We need to fight these issues especially the issues of individual liberty
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:31.960]  We need to fight them at the state and the local level and at the jury level
[03:39:31.960 --> 03:39:39.560]  I just talked last night to lynn olbrecht mother of ross olbrecht the guy who was given two life sentences
[03:39:40.120 --> 03:39:42.120]  for running silk road
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:45.400]  Now understand silk road is a website that was set up on the dark web
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:49.320]  Ross olbrecht was somebody who had
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:54.360]  Very strong convictions about a libertarian society and rather than going through
[03:39:54.360 --> 03:39:59.080]  The political process is that you know, they don't have any right to tell us
[03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:04.520]  What we can buy and sell what we can put in our bodies. I mean he didn't allow
[03:40:05.960 --> 03:40:11.960]  Contrary to the accusations that they had there. He did not set up anything for a an assassination
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:17.080]  That was total nonsense, but he did allow people to buy and sell
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:19.480]  illegal substances
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:25.960]  To violate the war on drugs and to do it over the internet using bitcoin now the people who actually sold
[03:40:26.440 --> 03:40:29.880]  The illegal drugs were getting five to ten years
[03:40:31.320 --> 03:40:33.240]  He had a website
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:38.520]  That these people were using and for running the website. He got two life sentences
[03:40:39.080 --> 03:40:44.040]  Now, why did he get such a despairing such a a different sentence? Oh as a matter of fact, too
[03:40:44.040 --> 03:40:50.840]  I mean not forget two of the key investigating agents one from the secret service one from the DEA one of them
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:52.840]  embezzled
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:54.200]  $800,000
[03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:58.520]  He had the keys to silk road. He could have done any kind of
[03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:01.080]  Put any kind of information in there to incriminate
[03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:03.560]  Ross olbrecht and yet
[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:09.320]  He and another guy who worked for the DEA that were both involved in criminal actions and have both been sentenced to jail
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:15.080]  They got five years. He gets two life sentences and the judge who did it said
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:19.320]  Well, this is in large part due to the fact that he is anti-government
[03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:22.360]  teaching him a lesson
[03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:26.200]  They don't care so much if you're driving drunk on the highway
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:32.520]  You better not drive without a license because then you're challenging their authority
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:35.480]  Ross was challenging their authority
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:38.440]  And you know, we talk about fully informed juries
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:44.520]  And the fact that people need to understand that it is not just the facts of the case that they are there
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:50.360]  To judge but they are to judge the law itself and how it is being applied if it is being applied
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  in an excessive
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:54.760]  Uh punishment way
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:58.440]  Remember that's in the constitution as well, you know, no excessive punishment
[03:41:59.160 --> 03:42:05.160]  If they are creating laws with excessive punishment if they're giving people mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:07.880]  Because there are nonviolent offender
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:12.440]  Maybe even a first time offender, but the quantity of marijuana triggers the
[03:42:13.160 --> 03:42:15.400]  10-year sentence because of mandatory minimums
[03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:18.200]  We ought to have juries who say no, we're not going to do that
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:25.080]  We're not going to let you do that to our fellow citizens. We need to watch each other's backs on this
[03:42:25.560 --> 03:42:29.080]  So that's what fully informed juries are about but let me tell you how bad it really is
[03:42:29.880 --> 03:42:31.640]  it's so bad
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:35.240]  That they wouldn't even tell the jurors about these criminals
[03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:42.520]  That were working for them the criminal government agents who were conducting the investigation who subsequently went to prison
[03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:49.400]  They knew about it and they wouldn't tell the jury about these criminals who are supposedly the police
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:52.920]  So that's how far away we are from all this now
[03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:55.240]  I got off on a tangent, but I want to go back
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:58.200]  To this memo that came out of the trump campaign
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:04.520]  He said when asked whether his ire was directed more at the national media or the GOP's establishment wing Bennett said both
[03:43:05.480 --> 03:43:11.880]  He said all of it is the establishment. The press is printing the narrative that the republican establishment is setting
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:18.280]  What's necessary? What i'm saying here is that we can't let that influence how we see ourselves
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:21.640]  Thank for yourselves
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:23.640]  And people are thinking for themselves
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:24.920]  and they're
[03:43:24.920 --> 03:43:28.600]  Getting beyond these partisan party politics
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:31.320]  Now when we look at this
[03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:35.880]  It's another indication that the people around trump get it
[03:43:37.080 --> 03:43:44.040]  We've got the guy who was uh steven miller. I believe is his name. He was a long-term advisor for senator sessions
[03:43:44.040 --> 03:43:48.600]  The only person who really exposed what's going on with these
[03:43:49.400 --> 03:43:51.400]  transatlantic and trans specific
[03:43:51.400 --> 03:43:55.000]  Partnerships that they call them. They're globalist treaties that will establish
[03:43:55.640 --> 03:43:57.400]  a commission
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:00.120]  Offshore these are treaties that were written by corporate lobbyists
[03:44:00.840 --> 03:44:05.160]  Our legislators were not allowed to be involved in the process. They kept it secret from them
[03:44:05.240 --> 03:44:10.040]  They were not supposed to talk to people when they lifted the gag order only one senator
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:15.080]  Took the time to try to educate his other senators and the public
[03:44:15.720 --> 03:44:17.720]  And that was senator sessions
[03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:22.360]  He started talking to donald trump last august and he endorsed donald trump
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:26.040]  It's the only time he's ever endorsed a political candidate because he understands
[03:44:27.240 --> 03:44:29.720]  That trump gets it on these crucial issues
[03:44:30.920 --> 03:44:35.480]  And the establishment understands that donald trump gets it on these crucial issues too and let me give you an example
[03:44:36.440 --> 03:44:38.040]  Of where this is headed
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:43.960]  WikiLeaks for example reveals an imf plan to cause a credit event in greece and to destabilize europe
[03:44:43.960 --> 03:44:47.800]  This is an article from zero hedge that we have on info wars.com
[03:44:48.440 --> 03:44:54.520]  They say one of the recurring concerns involving europe's seemingly perpetual economic financial and social crisis
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:58.360]  Is that these have been largely predetermined?
[03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:01.580]  scripted and deliberate acts
[03:45:02.600 --> 03:45:05.400]  Now of course, we've talked many times and he lists this in the article
[03:45:05.640 --> 03:45:12.760]  He says on environmental issues. We've got to advance the idea of global governance and of course to fund global governance with carbon taxes
[03:45:12.760 --> 03:45:19.240]  Terrorism is used to increase surveillance. We have global financial crises. We have the emu
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:24.440]  He says however this morning. We got another confirmation of how
[03:45:25.240 --> 03:45:32.760]  Supernational organizations plan european crises and advance to further their goals when licky wiki leaks published the transcript
[03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:35.160]  Of a teleconference that took place
[03:45:35.400 --> 03:45:37.000]  march 19th
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:38.520]  2016
[03:45:38.520 --> 03:45:44.440]  Just a couple of weeks ago between two top imf officials in charge of managing the greek debt crisis
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:45.880]  You thought that was over?
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:52.760]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They're keeping these people on the hook. They've just extended this now. Listen what they are planning
[03:45:53.800 --> 03:45:56.280]  imf staffers that's the international monetary fund
[03:45:57.240 --> 03:45:58.760]  Are caught on tape
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:46:01.800]  Planning to tell germany the organization would abandon the troika
[03:46:02.360 --> 03:46:06.520]  If the imf and the commission fail to reach an agreement on greek debt relief
[03:46:06.520 --> 03:46:11.400]  The imf officials say that the threat of an imminent financial catastrophe as the guardian puts it
[03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:18.760]  Is needed to force other players into accepting its measures like cutting greek pensions and working conditions as bloomberg puts it
[03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:24.760]  Quote considering a plan to cause a credit event in greece and to destabilize europe
[03:46:24.760 --> 03:46:29.400]  Why would they want to create a credit event in greece and destabilize europe?
[03:46:29.400 --> 03:46:36.200]  Well, he goes on to say they believe a credit event is the only thing that could trigger a greek deal and the event
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:44.280]  That they hint at is taking place some time around the referendum that is taking place in europe june 23rd the brexit
[03:46:45.160 --> 03:46:50.760]  referendum where britain is voting on whether or not they're going to exit the eu the brexit referendum
[03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:58.760]  And so what they would do is create a financial crisis at the time of the referendum on britain's exit from the eu
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:02.120]  That's the way they manipulate the process
[03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:05.560]  They've done it over and over again and as bloomberg points out the leak shows officials
[03:47:06.040 --> 03:47:12.200]  Linking the greek issue with the uk referendum risking general political destabilization in europe
[03:47:13.640 --> 03:47:16.040]  Now if you don't understand what's going on understand this
[03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:22.840]  The imf and the people who are controlling the european union who want to consolidate the european
[03:47:23.320 --> 03:47:25.800]  government together into united states of europe that is
[03:47:26.680 --> 03:47:30.200]  An intermediate step to world government consolidation
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:35.800]  And again when you look at these treaties a transatlantic the trans pacific partnership as we pointed out many times
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:43.160]  Of course, they both connect us to a more consolidated. They do the consolidation first economically then they do it politically
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:50.520]  A consolidated asia consolidated europe joined to a consolidated north american union. Okay with nafta
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:53.800]  So we've got our nafta. They've got their european union
[03:47:54.280 --> 03:47:58.680]  They're a little bit farther along in the european union than we have become with the north american union
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:02.760]  We just have the free trade agreement that is bleeding us dry economically
[03:48:03.640 --> 03:48:07.080]  The free trade agreement that john casick helped to pass
[03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:09.880]  And he destroyed the people
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:13.320]  The the factories in ohio, but he still got the votes somehow
[03:48:13.320 --> 03:48:18.120]  I wonder if the people actually voted for him. Nevertheless understand that when we look at what's happening in europe
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:21.800]  They're willing to burn down europe economically
[03:48:22.360 --> 03:48:25.480]  To maintain their plans of global consolidation
[03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:29.880]  They want to keep this thing that is starting to unravel. They want to keep it together
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:33.160]  And of course the open borders the immigration are part of that as well
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:37.320]  Nothing can stand in the way of their constitution
[03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:40.680]  Nothing can stand in the way of their consolidation
[03:48:41.320 --> 03:48:46.680]  And that explains why at this point they would not consolidate around a frontrunner like donald trump in the past
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:52.040]  They would have put pressure on other candidates who might be in there for their ego to get out
[03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:58.920]  Now they're pressuring these people to stay in because they want to try to make sure that donald trump doesn't get the 50% plus one vote
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:00.920]  majority
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:08.520]  To get it and they can take it from him at the convention because why would they do this? They could easily do a deal with donald trump
[03:49:09.080 --> 03:49:13.240]  Donald trump is somebody who has done deals all the time. Of course. It was an article that I just saw
[03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:16.840]  Last couple of days about I think it was on the drug report
[03:49:17.720 --> 03:49:23.400]  About how donald trump has got some information on roger ailes and the fox news corporation
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:26.680]  Maybe that they said is why they're going lighter on him than they have
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:28.760]  I don't think they've been going light on them at all
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:33.960]  Nevertheless, the reason he's got that information is because they called donald trump in to do a negotiation
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:39.640]  About a guy who did an expose on roger ailes and fox news and there was they fired him
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:42.360]  And then there was a lawsuit based on that firing
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:48.360]  They couldn't come to a negotiated settlement and arbitration. So what they do they called in donald trump
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:54.440]  Why because he can make deals with people. Okay, that's what he does now the republicans could make deals with him
[03:49:54.440 --> 03:50:00.680]  On everything except this central issue. They must have
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:02.760]  these
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:07.960]  Consolidations that are coming through the trade treaties through the climate treaties through the open borders
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:11.880]  Those three things are necessary for them to push their globalist agenda
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:15.160]  And if they're willing to burn down europe economically
[03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:22.280]  To keep that consolidation that globalization going you can bet they're willing to burn down the republican party
[03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:24.280]  And you know what so am I
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:29.960]  So am I it is far too long for us to have just these two parties
[03:50:30.840 --> 03:50:34.600]  We need to be looking at third parties. We need to be looking at alternatives to this
[03:50:34.840 --> 03:50:39.880]  We need to understand that there is nothing in the constitution that says we'll only have two parties
[03:50:40.040 --> 03:50:45.160]  There certainly isn't anything in the constitution that says those two parties will be the democrat and republican parties
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:47.160]  Even if you think we need to have a two-party democracy
[03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:49.880]  Let's change the parties. Look at what the democrats are doing
[03:50:49.880 --> 03:50:54.680]  And for hillary clinton the bernie people have to be doing this as well. Stay with us. We'll be right back

[03:54:19.400 --> 03:54:25.240]  I want to take a look at what's really in store for ted cruz even if he wins today
[03:54:25.400 --> 03:54:31.960]  What's going to happen at the convention from some of the insiders as they talk about the way they're going to
[03:54:32.360 --> 03:54:35.640]  Move going forward before we do real quickly. I want to let you know that
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:41.240]  We still have in stock our vitamin mineral fusion. That's our drink mix at info wars life.com
[03:54:41.240 --> 03:54:45.880]  This is new product. It is a limited first run so it'll sell out pretty quickly
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:52.280]  But again, I pointed out earlier in the show. I tried it today this morning for the first time it tastes great

[03:55:41.080 --> 03:55:44.840]  Going back to what's happening tonight with this primary in Wisconsin
[03:55:44.840 --> 03:55:47.800]  We've got a new story that's up from the washington examiner with
[03:55:48.360 --> 03:55:56.360]  Reince previs going on the local radio talk show host charlie sykes. This guy's been in the news quite a bit. This is
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:03.240]  I guess it's 15 minutes of fame during the wisconsin primary because we've got this is the home of the
[03:56:03.240 --> 03:56:05.240]  establishment republicans
[03:56:05.640 --> 03:56:09.160]  Reince previs of course is the r&c chair and he's said it again
[03:56:09.320 --> 03:56:14.840]  We've had these clips going for several months where Reince previs is saying in a very creepy way. No, no, no, no
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:18.040]  No, you don't understand. It's not an election. They are trying to
[03:56:18.760 --> 03:56:23.480]  Join us and he takes his hands and he's like a join us join us. Well, he said it again
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:28.600]  By the way, this is the nomination of the republican party if you don't like our party then sit down
[03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:31.560]  The party is choosing a nominee
[03:56:31.560 --> 03:56:32.680]  and
[03:56:32.680 --> 03:56:39.320]  As some of these other people who are in the GOP establishment have said when asked well, then why do we have primaries and caucuses?
[03:56:39.320 --> 03:56:40.520]  They said well
[03:56:40.520 --> 03:56:42.280]  Good question
[03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:43.800]  I'll tell you why
[03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:48.120]  They want to present the illusion that you have some input into the process now
[03:56:48.120 --> 03:56:52.680]  You can have an input in the process if you show up in sufficient numbers
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:55.080]  if you give the
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:59.480]  If you show up and they've got a 20 lead for one candidate
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:03.720]  They can't rig that election at the ballot box and they can't rig that election
[03:57:04.280 --> 03:57:07.640]  At the convention either if Donald Trump gets a majority
[03:57:08.200 --> 03:57:12.760]  Their plans are to try to stake take it on the second and third ballot
[03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:18.040]  That was made very clear when we had this article that was up on Breitbart
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:24.600]  Last week it was something from a longtime GOP consultant Alex Castellanos
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:27.960]  And he put this out on his mailing list talking about
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:31.000]  Paul Ryan as being Miss America
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:36.360]  And he's going through the whole process now. This is a guy who back in January had said
[03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:42.200]  I'm trying to get an anti trump campaign going but I don't get any takers from the donor class
[03:57:42.360 --> 03:57:45.560]  And he goes it's just too confusing for them. It's getting late in the game
[03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:49.160]  He says if you disqualify trump then you could help Ted Cruz if you help Ted Cruz
[03:57:49.960 --> 03:57:53.400]  If you disqualify Ted Cruz and you could help trump and they don't like either one of these guys
[03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:59.480]  He goes two-thirds of the party isn't one of these guys pockets. One-third is in the establishment lane. Well now he's changed
[03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:02.520]  And he's talking about hey on the second ballot
[03:58:03.560 --> 03:58:06.280]  Trump starts to bleed on the third ballot
[03:58:06.280 --> 03:58:11.160]  He bleeds to death on the convention floor and then he says it's not going to go to Ted Cruz
[03:58:11.640 --> 03:58:16.840]  He is miscongeniality and he's not very congenial. No, why would we go to John Kasich?
[03:58:16.840 --> 03:58:20.520]  Who wants to settle for Miss Ohio when you can get Miss America?
[03:58:20.520 --> 03:58:27.560]  Paul Ryan the guy who's already run for vice president just four years ago. That's their plan to steal it
[03:58:27.640 --> 03:58:32.760]  That's what they talk about having a new face. Join us tonight 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern for the nightly news
