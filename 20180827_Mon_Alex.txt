[00:00.000 --> 00:27.120]  Just 71 days until the most important election in world history, a referendum on nationalism
[00:27.120 --> 00:33.680]  and globalism on the technocrats are a free future for our people on this planet.
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.080]  A pro-human future are the globalist eugenics future.
[00:38.080 --> 00:42.280]  We are the most banned, most hated, most demonized broadcast in the world by the establishment
[00:42.280 --> 00:49.920]  because we're on target looking at their operations and fighting them hard and quite frankly lobbying
[00:49.920 --> 00:56.720]  behind the scenes directly for the people for open free societies, not for our own personal
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.720]  gain.
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.720]  And I've got more top law firms and groups writing up more special reports as we speak.
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.640]  I'm talking about former justices of major supreme courts, you name it, all getting
[01:08.640 --> 01:15.760]  in on getting the president documentation in different ways to counter big tech censorship,
[01:15.760 --> 01:22.080]  which they now admit is 96% of conservative site information is filtered out.
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.560]  The headline is 96% of responses on Google are liberal sites.
[01:26.560 --> 01:31.120]  Well, that's the same thing as filtering out the majority of conservative sites and
[01:31.120 --> 01:34.600]  popular sites or anybody that questions what they say or what they do.
[01:34.600 --> 01:40.240]  And the deception is so intricate now.
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.480]  Remember Oliver Darcy at CNN with Stelter headed up trying to have a city platform removed
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.600]  bragged about how he did it.
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.960]  Then you've got Senator Warner, Murphy, Widen all saying now take off thousands of sites,
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.440]  get rid of all the conservatives, call them all fake news.
[01:57.440 --> 02:04.680]  And then Darcy came out Friday and said that Trump props up false claim that big tech is
[02:04.680 --> 02:07.040]  out to silence conservatives.
[02:07.040 --> 02:15.240]  That is the most asinine lie as if you have no memory, such disrespect for you absolutely
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.120]  incredible, unbelievable predatory activity.
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.120]  Just simply amazing.
[02:24.120 --> 02:29.480]  Now there's a group of reports I did last night that are so critical that I'm asking
[02:29.480 --> 02:35.160]  listeners that are already awake and informed and involved to go to infowars.com and get
[02:35.160 --> 02:44.200]  this text report we'll put back on screen exclusive Trump set to fire sessions purged
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.280]  deep state moles declassified bombshell info.
[02:48.280 --> 02:56.000]  And then the videos selected from yesterday's live broadcast are so critical and they break
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.120]  it all down and what the president needs to do and the fact that senators Grassley and
[03:02.120 --> 03:06.760]  Graham who are key Republicans, Grassley is the most respected in the Senate hands down
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.320]  for integrity are saying no you can fire sessions and maybe it needs to go ahead and happen
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.560]  because sessions is blocking all the criminal activity of the Clintons and of Mueller and
[03:16.560 --> 03:22.560]  of Comey and of Obama and they're just running wild and it's come out that they seek to create
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.440]  a one party system make the Republican Party just a regional group with Homeland Security
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.840]  under the Democrats control federalizing elections Obama signed this in law before he left.
[03:33.840 --> 03:36.000]  Trump has not yet removed it.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.720]  All 50 Attorney General sent letters last year, including some Democrats.
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.160]  Every Democrat at the state level that was in office but all 50 state Attorney General
[03:45.160 --> 03:49.240]  sent letters saying no you want federalized state elections that violates the federal
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.400]  clause, the federalism clause, the separate but equal clause.
[03:54.400 --> 03:59.360]  They are coming in and saying there's no separation of powers and that they're going to run it.
[03:59.360 --> 04:02.760]  Well that's what Venezuela does.
[04:02.760 --> 04:07.920]  So it's simply an astounding time that we are all alive right now.
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.160]  It is an amazing time and I know you know all this information but they are blacklisting
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.480]  us and they are deplatforming us and they are putting us into exile.
[04:17.480 --> 04:20.840]  They're putting us into the Phantom Zone.
[04:20.840 --> 04:26.840]  They're putting us out on Alcatraz or attempting to because what we're saying is the key.
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.720]  I've been telling you for years specifically they have a plan with Senator Wyden, Warner
[04:32.720 --> 04:38.160]  and Murphy to take over the entire internet and kick all conservatives and nationalists off.
[04:38.160 --> 04:39.160]  How did I know?
[04:39.160 --> 04:44.280]  It was in the Obama executive order directing the money in the John Warren Defense Authorization
[04:44.280 --> 04:51.840]  Act that he signed in December of 2016 and then did an order two weeks later.
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.120]  I mean they told us exactly what they're going to do and I'm here telling you I've got their
[04:56.120 --> 04:57.120]  own battle plan.
[04:57.120 --> 05:00.360]  I'm not that smart.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.480]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[05:04.480 --> 05:08.680]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[05:08.680 --> 05:11.680]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.360]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with
[05:15.360 --> 05:16.360]  one system.
[05:16.360 --> 05:22.800]  The Pro Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four stage compact filtration

[06:11.880 --> 06:23.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.520 --> 06:30.720]  Listen deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its
[06:30.720 --> 06:37.560]  Alex Jones.
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, the 27th day of
[06:42.480 --> 06:43.480]  August 2018.
[06:43.480 --> 06:46.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.600]  I'm going to open the phones up throughout the entire four hours of the broadcast today.
[06:50.600 --> 06:53.840]  Allie Alexander is going to be co-hosting the fourth hour.
[06:53.840 --> 06:57.360]  Dr. Keith Moeller is going to pop in for about 30 minutes today with some very interesting
[06:57.360 --> 06:58.360]  findings.
[06:58.360 --> 07:02.200]  But I intend to take a lot of phone calls today about the state of the Union, the state
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.360]  of the world, what should Trump do more and more?
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.760]  He's moving towards firing Attorney General Sessions because Sessions along with Rosenstein
[07:11.760 --> 07:16.120]  created a new power structure outside of the President's control and outside of the Constitution
[07:16.120 --> 07:21.560]  by tricking the President in a housekeeping document to sign authority basically to the
[07:21.560 --> 07:24.840]  executive branch over to Rosenstein.
[07:24.840 --> 07:30.520]  And so now you've got Senators Graham and Senators Grassley and others over the weekend
[07:30.520 --> 07:35.240]  giving interviews, and I covered this extensively yesterday, saying no, he can go ahead and get
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.240]  rid of the Attorney General.
[07:36.240 --> 07:39.080]  If he doesn't like the Attorney General, he can get rid of these other people and he
[07:39.080 --> 07:43.560]  can basically do what he wants in the executive branch because it's clear that Moeller is
[07:43.560 --> 07:47.440]  going to go after Don Jr. for nothing, and they're going to go after everybody else for
[07:47.440 --> 07:53.040]  taxes they didn't pay, and it's not even Trump, it's people around him.
[07:53.040 --> 07:56.840]  If you want to indict a Ham Sam which has been famously said, who said that?
[07:56.840 --> 08:06.800]  I forget who famously said, I think it was, my memory serves, it was Jim Garrison, the
[08:06.800 --> 08:10.720]  individual investigating JFK that it was said about.
[08:10.720 --> 08:20.840]  But let's look up, who said, you can indict a Ham Sam which because it's certainly true.
[08:20.840 --> 08:27.840]  It's a New York State Chief Judge Saul Watcher was famously quoted by Tom Wolf in Bonfire
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.720]  the Vanities that a grand jury could indict a Ham Sam which if that's what you wanted.
[08:32.720 --> 08:38.000]  And I guess, not have been Jim Garrison re-quoted it because I've heard it attributed to him,
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.520]  but that's the point, is that there's no Russia, there's no collusion, you've got the economy
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.840]  coming roaring back.
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.960]  NASDAQ hits 8,000 for the first time as US and Mexico strike a trade deal that Trump
[08:53.960 --> 08:57.800]  has shown is a lot better than what we had.
[08:57.800 --> 08:58.800]  Great again.
[08:58.800 --> 09:07.760]  Dow retakes 26,000 and goes past to an all-time high while S&P 500 NASDAQ carve out records.
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.920]  Atlanta Fed lifts GDP growth estimate to 4.6.
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.520]  Last time they listed it to 4.0, it was actually 4.2.
[09:18.520 --> 09:23.920]  So when the estimates tend to be under, it could be 4.8 or higher when it comes out in
[09:23.920 --> 09:26.080]  just a month or so.
[09:26.080 --> 09:33.000]  Atlanta Fed lifts GDP growth estimate to 4.6 despite interest rates being raised.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.520]  That is spectacular.
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.640]  And yeah, it's built on a bunch of fiat, but at least we're bringing factories back, we're
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.880]  bringing morale back.
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.800]  The globalists are already going to end up going into an inflationary situation.
[09:44.800 --> 09:50.600]  There's an inflationary race from Venezuela to Zimbabwe, to areas of Asia, to areas of
[09:50.600 --> 09:52.120]  Europe.
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.920]  It's going to happen.
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.280]  And the dollar is still the strongest, the US is still the strongest, our bonds are still
[09:59.280 --> 10:06.400]  the strongest, and so we're now in this arena of inflationary warfare.
[10:06.400 --> 10:09.560]  And so we're never going to get out of the massive debt we have without rebuilding our
[10:09.560 --> 10:10.560]  infrastructure.
[10:10.560 --> 10:16.080]  And for the first time, some of the debt growth is starting to slow.
[10:16.080 --> 10:17.360]  But it's a complex issue.
[10:17.360 --> 10:19.000]  We're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't.
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.400]  But at least we're getting thousands of new factories.
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.400]  We're rebuilding our infrastructure when the globalists have made the decision not to rebuild
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.400]  our infrastructure.
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.960]  China has a $900 billion trade deficit, while Trump puts a couple hundred billion on them
[10:31.960 --> 10:35.520]  and notice first they wouldn't capitulate, they're very close to capitulating.
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.640]  Mexico wasn't going to capitulate with their one-sided deal.
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.880]  It's like America cooked the dinner and then we go to dinner with people and we don't even
[10:42.880 --> 10:49.880]  get a quarter of a hamburger and they get five hamburgers and three malts and five french
[10:49.880 --> 10:53.240]  fries and four onion rings.
[10:53.240 --> 10:54.360]  I mean, that's what this is like.
[10:54.360 --> 10:56.280]  So Trump's like, no, you're not going to do that.
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.440]  But the globalists don't like America.
[10:58.440 --> 10:59.440]  It was never great.
[10:59.440 --> 11:00.960]  It'll never be great, they say.
[11:00.960 --> 11:01.960]  They hope the economy crashes.
[11:01.960 --> 11:04.360]  Do I have to attribute who's been saying this?
[11:04.360 --> 11:05.360]  All of them.
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.560]  They can't stop it.
[11:06.560 --> 11:07.560]  It's their religion.
[11:07.560 --> 11:11.920]  And when they say, I hope we have a giant stock market crash to teach these Republicans
[11:11.920 --> 11:13.920]  and these people that voted for Trump.
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.120]  Yay, Bill Maher, yeah!
[11:16.120 --> 11:17.120]  Woo!
[11:17.120 --> 11:18.120]  Woo, yeah!
[11:18.120 --> 11:22.520]  Yay, General Flynn, it says that Trump's a Russian, they're all going to prison.
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.520]  Yeah!
[11:23.520 --> 11:25.520]  None of it true.
[11:25.520 --> 11:26.520]  Mexico was never great.
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.020]  It'll never be that great.
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.880]  They know what they're doing and they're trying to demoralize us.
[11:31.880 --> 11:37.000]  They want a nation of people that they control and everything they do is a fraud and a line.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.400]  And so I went up the phone about the economy, about China, about the massive censorship
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.240]  that's intensified, about the 71 days of the election.
[11:46.240 --> 11:54.440]  Clearly they've been selling a narrative in unison in 350 newspapers last week, week
[11:54.440 --> 11:59.240]  before last, in one day, all in unison saying, you're going to get the press killed, you're
[11:59.240 --> 12:02.080]  calling for violence on the press, that Trump was.
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.800]  They then ran headlines that I said, use weapons on the media, never said it.
[12:05.800 --> 12:10.560]  I said, don't start a war, be peaceful, but defend yourself if Antifa comes to your house
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.480]  as they were doxing law enforcement and members of Congress, it was all clear.
[12:15.480 --> 12:18.720]  But they put out the hoax that violence is coming because I believe they're gearing up
[12:18.720 --> 12:25.600]  for a false flag against their own institutions, against their own operations and they've certainly
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.600]  done it before.
[12:26.600 --> 12:29.960]  So we're going to discuss all these issues.
[12:29.960 --> 12:32.760]  Major Senator's signal is time for Trump to fire sessions.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.360]  The word is he's moving towards it.
[12:34.360 --> 12:37.680]  He needs to fire four deep roses team and then two below that.
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.440]  He needs to then move with commissions immediately on internet censorship.
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.880]  Sherman Antitrust Act, section two on Apple, Google, Facebook, all of them.
[12:47.880 --> 12:49.120]  And by the way, that's being geared up.
[12:49.120 --> 12:56.440]  He's already moved against Facebook with the Unfair Tracing, Unfair Housing Act, where
[12:56.440 --> 13:02.800]  they track everything you do, who you are, sexual preference, race, age, region, medical
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.120]  history to then manipulate what you pay for insurance, other services through Facebook.
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.000]  They're selling it all.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.120]  That's why when I said six months ago, or you're going, that whole thing came out in
[13:14.120 --> 13:23.400]  England with the Analytica, I said they were publicly scraping off public stuff on Facebook.
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.160]  The fact of the Democrats to not let Republicans have access to names off Facebook would burn
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.560]  up the golden goose and chop its head off and eat it for dinner was not well thought
[13:32.560 --> 13:33.560]  out.
[13:33.560 --> 13:39.640]  And I predicted over and over again on air that Facebook going after and the Democrats
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.880]  going after Cambridge Analytica would bring down Facebook, you have to find those videos
[13:44.880 --> 13:48.840]  on somebody else's YouTube channel or on infowars.com because they all got deleted.
[13:48.840 --> 13:54.720]  But it's there and I said it hundreds and hundreds of times and now it's happened.
[13:54.720 --> 13:56.640]  Democrats don't think two or three steps ahead.
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.960]  They just think right in front of their face like bullies.
[14:01.960 --> 14:09.480]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALOX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539,
[14:09.480 --> 14:10.480]  877-789-2539.
[14:10.480 --> 14:14.640]  Do you disagree with me that we're living in an incredibly epic time in our lives?
[14:14.640 --> 14:16.760]  No, I don't think you do.
[14:16.760 --> 14:21.840]  Now, separately, if you don't spread the articles, if you don't spread the videos, if you don't
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.960]  go to infowars.com with this key article and four videos that are posted there detailing
[14:26.960 --> 14:30.440]  it all, and if you don't get it to Congress, another talk show host and to the President
[14:30.440 --> 14:37.200]  and to everybody, the buzz we've already got going to stop the censorship, the buzz that
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.360]  this broadcast in drudgereport.com together in the last six months put out about Apple
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.520]  and Google moving to China, about them censoring all the conservatives, about them shadow
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.520]  batting.
[14:47.520 --> 14:55.720]  I paid and infowars paid in our reach dearly on 26 platforms because I knew we had to do
[14:55.720 --> 14:56.720]  it.
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.160]  You talk about the deplatforming, you expose how they're doing it, you get deplatformed.
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.760]  Well, you can't all then just shut up and hope that everything goes away.
[15:04.760 --> 15:08.120]  So yes, I made the decision, not because I'm a hero, but I made the decision because the
[15:08.120 --> 15:15.440]  right thing to do to hit the barb wire, I made the decision to go ahead and put infowars
[15:15.440 --> 15:22.320]  and everything on the chopping block because if we don't, we're just going to die slowly.
[15:22.320 --> 15:23.320]  They're already strangling us.
[15:23.320 --> 15:24.320]  They're strangling you.
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.720]  People didn't seem to notice like the frog in the pot that you were already 87% restricted
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.000]  just a couple of months ago.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.440]  Now it's 96% for the average Republican in major news articles, Watson's 97%.
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.640]  I'm a hundred percent banned like the new rating, a hundred percent banned.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.800]  You know, it's the best.
[15:41.800 --> 15:43.760]  So they can't do it to drugs.
[15:43.760 --> 15:50.040]  He's got his own website as he understood how key it was to not be living by their system.
[15:50.040 --> 15:55.480]  The top senators back Trump plan to remove sessions, ban videos, infowars.com, upload
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.560]  them to YouTube, Facebook, get them out, just get this out, please.

[18:00.320 --> 18:05.640]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.520 --> 18:26.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.840]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.840 --> 18:37.840]  symptoms.
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.600]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.600 --> 18:46.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.440 --> 18:52.240]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.800]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.120]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.120 --> 19:06.080]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.600]  now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.

[19:12.640 --> 19:20.720]  $25, $50, $100, $250, even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat
[19:20.720 --> 19:26.960]  back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle
[19:26.960 --> 19:56.920]  our first amendment rights.
[19:56.920 --> 20:24.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.120 --> 20:36.720]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com
[20:36.720 --> 20:37.720]  studios.
[20:37.720 --> 20:45.440]  All right, let's look at some of the headlines on infowars.com because they're so Orwellian,
[20:45.440 --> 20:51.080]  not from us, but from the people saying them, South African president, white farm seizures,
[20:51.080 --> 20:53.720]  not a land grab.
[20:53.720 --> 20:55.800]  Here's video and audio of that.
[20:55.800 --> 21:02.160]  That's right, white farm seizures that he ran for president on and he also, along with
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.480]  his deputy, talked about slitting their throats.
[21:05.480 --> 21:11.000]  So taking your land because you're white is not a land grab.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.600]  That just broke on infowars.com from newswars.com.
[21:14.600 --> 21:15.600]  Here's another one.
[21:15.600 --> 21:18.720]  North Korea accuses US of plotting invasion when we're trying to do a peace deal with
[21:18.720 --> 21:22.440]  them because they're scared of China.
[21:22.440 --> 21:25.640]  Then migrants suspected of throwing female tourists off of Cleveland, Italy.
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.880]  It's just, this stuff breaks every five minutes.
[21:27.880 --> 21:33.160]  Again, that huge story with the videos, top senators back front plan to remove sessions.
[21:33.160 --> 21:34.160]  That is going to be incredible.
[21:34.160 --> 21:38.320]  We'll be talking about that next segment of your calls, breaking a major blow to ISIS
[21:38.320 --> 21:39.320]  in the deep state.
[21:39.320 --> 21:42.480]  McCain dies.
[21:42.480 --> 21:45.400]  New nap to deal announcement and it's now been made by the president.
[21:45.400 --> 21:49.840]  We're going to play some of that coming up.
[21:49.840 --> 21:53.080]  Full plan, this is something I need to get into.
[21:53.080 --> 21:57.400]  Document emerges detailing Democrat plans to crush Trump should GOP fail, going after
[21:57.400 --> 22:02.560]  his family, his businesses, everyone and terrorizing them until they submit.
[22:02.560 --> 22:10.040]  And just because I'm a Trump supporter and prominent, believe me, I've experienced it.
[22:10.040 --> 22:11.040]  That's coming up.
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.680]  We'll cover that a little bit next segment before we go to your calls.
[22:15.680 --> 22:19.680]  We have another article, a snapshot of YouTube's incredible censorship of conservatives, only
[22:19.680 --> 22:23.600]  putting liberals and globalist on top.
[22:23.600 --> 22:28.240]  Jacksonville Madden Shooter criticized Trump Tards all over Reddit, said how dumb they
[22:28.240 --> 22:30.800]  were, how much he hated them, how much he loved the Democrats.
[22:30.800 --> 22:33.800]  And you wonder why that story is not bigger.
[22:33.800 --> 22:38.800]  But four dead, including him and 11 others wounded, tragically, in a gunfree zone, it's
[22:38.800 --> 22:42.640]  because he's a globalist, he's a libtard.
[22:42.640 --> 22:46.680]  So every time it's one of them, crickets.
[22:46.680 --> 22:51.480]  Everything gets shut down.
[22:51.480 --> 23:01.800]  Now I have not spent any time since we launched the reformulated, even stronger, even better,
[23:01.800 --> 23:05.240]  ultimate brown broth formula.
[23:05.240 --> 23:06.480]  We've not had it in five months.
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.840]  And I told them, I said, double the last order for the last order before that, like a year
[23:10.840 --> 23:12.680]  ago, was doubled.
[23:12.680 --> 23:13.960]  So they quadrupled the order.
[23:13.960 --> 23:17.440]  So we have a big supply of it, but it is selling very, very quickly.
[23:17.440 --> 23:20.760]  But that's how I'm selling it from really more than 50% off.
[23:20.760 --> 23:24.840]  Other leading brands that are similar, not as strong, cost $50 to $60 retail.
[23:24.840 --> 23:27.760]  We normally retail at a 40, but sell it for $29.95.
[23:27.760 --> 23:29.560]  It's $19.95.
[23:29.560 --> 23:31.680]  That's very close to what it cost us.
[23:31.680 --> 23:35.680]  Very soon I will get rid of this special, but I wanted to spend some time not just reading
[23:35.680 --> 23:39.680]  from the little advertisement about what is in the bone broth.
[23:39.680 --> 23:45.800]  In fact, I left it in there in the podcast to get people to bring me a tag of it, please.
[23:45.800 --> 23:47.800]  Thanks.
[23:47.800 --> 23:52.320]  Introducing ultimate bone broth formula, chicken broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen,
[23:52.320 --> 23:55.840]  goji berry and alfalfa herb powder, and even more.
[23:55.840 --> 23:56.840]  All of those are incredible.
[23:56.840 --> 24:02.960]  But I thought just with chicken broth, everybody knows what it does for folks with the flu.
[24:02.960 --> 24:05.760]  Everybody knows the wives tales, but there's studies out on it.
[24:05.760 --> 24:14.120]  I thought I'd actually go over just some mainline research, bone broth benefits, your health,
[24:14.120 --> 24:18.520]  six common claims backed by science.
[24:18.520 --> 24:26.240]  What nutrients are in bone broth, minerals, collagen, gelatin, and it's in the raw concentrated
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.520]  form.
[24:30.520 --> 24:35.200]  And so many other key things for your skin, especially ladies and gentlemen, especially
[24:35.200 --> 24:39.640]  for women, your hair, your nails, nothing's better.
[24:39.640 --> 24:42.640]  Continuing six bone broth benefits.
[24:42.640 --> 24:48.000]  Bone broth benefits number one, gut health, known for going into the gut.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.920]  For example, this study showed that glycine and the gelatin can with stomach acid secretion.
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.640]  Studies have also been done on gelatin and glutamine showing how they help support and
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.920]  regulate the mucosal lining of the intestinal wall, which could potentially aid inflammatory
[25:06.920 --> 25:07.920]  conditions.
[25:07.920 --> 25:10.320]  And then it goes into all of that.
[25:10.320 --> 25:15.800]  I mean, it's just take hours to go over all of this.
[25:15.800 --> 25:17.040]  Immune boosting powers.
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.080]  And there's the University of Nebraska and all that.
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.080]  This is just a superfood.
[25:20.080 --> 25:21.960]  That's what it is.
[25:21.960 --> 25:28.400]  Other research shows, protroglycins can stimulate the production of different types of immune
[25:28.400 --> 25:29.400]  cells.
[25:29.400 --> 25:30.400]  It's got all the links right there.
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.160]  Bone broth benefits three, joint health.
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.960]  This study, it links to it, done on 100 women between the ages of 40 and 7 that using collagen
[25:39.960 --> 25:44.400]  peptides showed a clear and significant effect on six months of treatment in relation to
[25:44.400 --> 25:45.400]  osteoarthritis.
[25:45.400 --> 25:48.200]  And it just goes on from there.
[25:48.200 --> 25:51.240]  Bone broth benefits four, skin health.
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.720]  Research performed 2014 on 69 women between the ages of 35 and 55 that the supplement
[25:56.720 --> 26:01.560]  with collagen, and I'm pronouncing all this wrong, found a significant improvement in
[26:01.560 --> 26:02.560]  skin elasticity.
[26:02.560 --> 26:04.800]  And again, it's all there.
[26:04.800 --> 26:07.080]  It's the makeup of the body.
[26:07.080 --> 26:11.800]  That's what the bone broth is, the joints, the bones, the marrow, all of it.
[26:11.800 --> 26:16.320]  And then it's mixed with super herbs and super vegetables, all concentrated.
[26:16.320 --> 26:19.560]  You put it in with some whey, put it in with some other stuff, put it in with some ice,
[26:19.560 --> 26:21.080]  some berries.
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.080]  It's great.
[26:22.080 --> 26:29.120]  A study back in 1934 found low levels of calcium in, a study back in 1934 found low
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.240]  levels of calcium in bone broths.
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.640]  Recent research has found low mineral levels.
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.720]  However, there's a lot more to the integrity of bones than just minerals.
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.000]  Bone is a living tissue inside a complex matrix of metabolically active connective tissues,
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.600]  and that's all the trace elements, trace minerals, all these little precursors that
[26:48.600 --> 26:49.600]  go together.
[26:49.600 --> 26:51.360]  How bone broth benefits you?
[26:51.360 --> 26:53.680]  How to make bone broth.
[26:53.680 --> 26:55.420]  How to use bone broth.
[26:55.420 --> 26:56.920]  Go research this stuff for yourself.
[26:56.920 --> 26:57.920]  This isn't even from infowars.com.
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.000]  This is just a page that boils it all down, and I've got stacks of this.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.280]  The point is, is that if you think whey is good, and if you think, you know, taking some
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.440]  calcium pills is good, and you think all that's good, imagine concentrated bone broth where
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.000]  it's not like you boil down some ox tail or some chicken bones, and then yeah, it's
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.440]  really, really good for you.
[27:18.440 --> 27:20.000]  This is whey, whey, whey.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.840]  It's hard to quantify it, stronger.
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.000]  There is a massive amount, and you're not just getting what's boiled off.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.920]  This is done in a treatment where it doesn't get to the boiling point, so you actually keep
[27:32.920 --> 27:37.240]  the trace compounds that they have trouble even isolating understanding.
[27:37.240 --> 27:39.840]  They just know it works really, really good.
[27:39.840 --> 27:46.440]  And you add that to turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[27:46.440 --> 27:47.960]  and even more.
[27:47.960 --> 27:48.960]  Together it's incredible.
[27:48.960 --> 27:53.720]  So we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever offered with an
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.640]  even better ingredients, ultimate bone broth to help you save big on the soup product and
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.640]  stock up.
[27:58.640 --> 28:00.600]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.320]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients that we needed to create
[28:05.320 --> 28:08.680]  it on a regular basis, this formula while keeping the cost low.
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.040]  Since we wanted to make sure you got the best value possible, we've now switched to a new
[28:13.040 --> 28:14.720]  supplier with even more ingredients.
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.880]  That's why it's now the ultimate bone broth formula.
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.200]  Powerful ingredients include the ultimate bone broth formula, chicken broth, turmeric
[28:22.200 --> 28:27.760]  root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and even more.
[28:27.760 --> 28:31.400]  These powerful ingredients will help you get the most of your workout while supporting
[28:31.400 --> 28:35.760]  your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, ligaments, while also supporting the body's
[28:35.760 --> 28:36.760]  fight against free radicals.

[28:41.280 --> 28:43.560]  It's the strongest out there from our research.

[29:10.480 --> 29:11.480]  Remember?
[29:11.480 --> 29:15.480]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.120]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[29:20.120 --> 29:24.120]  They so pride in every stitch

[33:03.840 --> 33:10.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:10.840 --> 33:25.640]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:25.640 --> 33:31.480]  When I first went on access television 24 years ago, I get a little tight in the chest and
[33:31.480 --> 33:33.480]  have a little bit of anxiety.
[33:33.480 --> 33:36.720]  Only because I do it live out of the control room with a camera because I was one person
[33:36.720 --> 33:37.720]  doing the show.
[33:37.720 --> 33:43.640]  But then about six months later, I got a weekend radio show at a new talk station where they
[33:43.640 --> 33:44.640]  couldn't get any calls.
[33:44.640 --> 33:48.920]  They just switched from rock and roll to talk and they were thinking about switching back
[33:48.920 --> 33:53.120]  because nobody was calling their local shows, but my phone lines all loaded up.
[33:53.120 --> 33:54.120]  And then we got ratings.
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.200]  And a year later, I was on weeknights and two years later, I was syndicated by a small
[33:57.200 --> 33:58.200]  syndicator.
[33:58.200 --> 34:08.600]  And the reason I tell that story is only the last month, even before I got shadow banned
[34:08.600 --> 34:16.600]  and then totally banned, de-platformed, so authoritarian, so over the top, so scandalous
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.520]  for the establishment to do that.
[34:19.520 --> 34:27.480]  Now I have a little bit of an anxiety attack on air when I'm on air and my bronchioles actually
[34:27.480 --> 34:39.320]  closing up because my gut, my instincts, my spirit, my intellect at every level.
[34:39.320 --> 34:42.760]  The corrupt globalist pope who used pedophilia to get control of the blackmail, even the
[34:42.760 --> 34:48.240]  Guardian reports, he's about to go down, set to resign, he's being reported.
[34:48.240 --> 34:52.120]  You've got 71 days after the most important election ever, Trump is for real, trying to
[34:52.120 --> 34:58.080]  actually turn the economy back on to show you that he cares and is actually proving
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.360]  that the globalist did this by design.
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.680]  You've got the government trying to sexualize our children because they can't get pedophilia
[35:05.680 --> 35:09.960]  legalized so they can go, oh, well, it's a gender question, let us talk to your kids
[35:09.960 --> 35:11.760]  about what sex they are.
[35:11.760 --> 35:13.920]  This is a full biological attack.
[35:13.920 --> 35:16.960]  The globalist said they're going to have robots completely take over all human jobs
[35:16.960 --> 35:17.960]  to make us obsolete.
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.720]  I've got articles about that right here today.
[35:23.720 --> 35:26.480]  It's just amazing.
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.800]  And meanwhile, there's all these studies out where people are having less sex and less
[35:31.800 --> 35:35.800]  children because all they do is play on their smartphones and watch TV.
[35:35.800 --> 35:38.320]  And people are depressed and they're more unhappy than ever.
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.920]  But don't worry, San Francisco has restaurants rolling out that are all robots and people
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.040]  are fascinated with it and it's so cool.
[35:46.040 --> 35:52.720]  Everything the system sells as cool is pure death.
[35:52.720 --> 35:54.560]  So there's just so much to cover.
[35:54.560 --> 35:56.080]  It's crazy.
[35:56.080 --> 36:08.800]  And to see the hysteria of the controlled left going after everyone who doesn't submit
[36:08.800 --> 36:14.640]  to them and bullying and attacking us.
[36:14.640 --> 36:19.720]  And they're not even getting power or resources out of working with the system.
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.840]  They're just caught in a trance as followers complying with what they believe will actually
[36:24.840 --> 36:27.560]  fulfill them.
[36:27.560 --> 36:30.920]  Trump just renegotiated a much better deal with Mexico.
[36:30.920 --> 36:31.920]  Boom.
[36:31.920 --> 36:35.360]  He's gotten more done in less than two years than I could have ever imagined.
[36:35.360 --> 36:43.640]  And I don't want to just sit up and gush, it's the truth.
[36:43.640 --> 36:44.640]  Trump has now made that announcement.
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.120]  We're going to be playing it next hour.
[36:49.120 --> 36:59.120]  Dow retakes 26,000 while S&P 500 NASDAQ carved out new record highs.
[36:59.120 --> 37:03.840]  NASDAQ hits 8,000 the first time as U.S. and Mexico strike trade deal.
[37:03.840 --> 37:10.280]  Atlanta Fed lifts GDP growth to 4.6.
[37:10.280 --> 37:13.920]  Remember Paul Krugman said, Obama could never get it up to three.
[37:13.920 --> 37:15.600]  You'll never get it up to three.
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.000]  What do you have a magic wand?
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.600]  In fact, can we find Trump saying you watch, I'll get it above 3% and then find the clip
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.280]  for next segment is to come in with Obama saying, what do you have a magic wand?
[37:27.280 --> 37:29.160]  We should do a promo video.
[37:29.160 --> 37:30.320]  What do you have a magic wand?
[37:30.320 --> 37:31.720]  What do you have a magic wand?
[37:31.720 --> 37:32.800]  You can't have air conditioning.
[37:32.800 --> 37:33.800]  You can't have cars.
[37:33.800 --> 37:35.200]  You can't have prosperity.
[37:35.200 --> 37:38.480]  If you built a business, you didn't build that.
[37:38.480 --> 37:39.480]  America was never great.
[37:39.480 --> 37:42.920]  It'll never be great.
[37:42.920 --> 37:45.960]  Inter-sperse all that with it becoming great again.
[37:45.960 --> 37:49.120]  We're with the engine of the world.
[37:49.120 --> 37:50.120]  There it is.
[37:50.120 --> 37:53.680]  If Trump thinks, please print me that, if Trump thinks he can get more than 3% economic
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.800]  growth, he's dreaming.
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.520]  This Paul Krugman said and Bloomberg said, you can't do it and they're God.
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.240]  But why could China have a 10% growth rate on average the last 30 years?
[38:09.240 --> 38:12.680]  But we couldn't.
[38:12.680 --> 38:14.480]  Amazing.
[38:14.480 --> 38:20.960]  So I'm going to go to your phone calls now, but the reason I have this tightness in my
[38:20.960 --> 38:27.200]  chest is it's my future, it's your future, it's your children's future.
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.040]  Our IQs are dropping, cancer is exploding, 1 in 30,000 used to have autism.
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.120]  Now it's 1 in 58.
[38:35.120 --> 38:39.200]  Everywhere they adopt glyphosate, IQs drop, infertility explodes, breast cancer is exploding.
[38:39.200 --> 38:40.200]  It explodes.
[38:40.200 --> 38:44.920]  We're being killed and they know full well what they're doing and we're all in a giant
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.920]  experiment.
[38:45.920 --> 38:46.920]  That's what globalism is.
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.520]  In fact, guys remind me, I'm going to start the show with this today and I just didn't
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.240]  do it because of all the jobs numbers and things got me excited and I got off that.
[38:54.240 --> 38:59.080]  I need to announce to people the two parallel programs for society in the world that the
[38:59.080 --> 39:07.000]  globalists are looking at and where we're going if we don't stop them.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.800]  But we've got to keep Trump in office.
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.400]  We've got to stop these bullies because here's why the Republicans are getting ready to turn.
[39:14.400 --> 39:17.440]  The Republican establishment is getting ready to turn the Democrats and I detailed all of
[39:17.440 --> 39:22.160]  this yesterday in videos that are so incredibly important.
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.520]  I don't have words to describe it and they're up on infowars.com in the article titled Top
[39:26.520 --> 39:31.240]  Senators Back Trump Removing Sessions.
[39:31.240 --> 39:38.320]  And the reason they finally do is because the Democrats, Obama's executive orders before
[39:38.320 --> 39:44.680]  he left office, put a stay behind network in the government and in the different agencies.
[39:44.680 --> 39:50.080]  And they state that once they remove Trump, they're going to hold new elections, have
[39:50.080 --> 39:57.960]  the Democrats federalize them, remove most Republicans, only keep a few for ceremonial
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.280]  purposes and have a new socialist wing of the Democratic Party, a Communist wing and
[40:03.280 --> 40:06.280]  then the establishment wing.
[40:06.280 --> 40:12.080]  They've decided to go one party rule with only Republicans in a few states and that's
[40:12.080 --> 40:13.880]  their admitted stated plan.
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.840]  And now the Republican leadership, a lot of them are establishment, they've seen that
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.160]  and they know how dangerous it is and they realize that the Democrats want to extinct
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.560]  all debate and any form of a republic representative democracy and have decided to go for broke.
[40:28.560 --> 40:31.560]  But they hide it all in double think.
[40:31.560 --> 40:38.320]  You know the articles up on infowars.com right now where the South African Communist
[40:38.320 --> 40:49.640]  president of the ANC says that quote, seizing white farms, which has now begun, not a land
[40:49.640 --> 40:50.640]  grab.
[40:50.640 --> 40:57.840]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[40:57.840 --> 41:01.600]  Trump props up false claim that big tech is out to silence conservatives, Oliver Darcy,
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.880]  the guy that quarterbacked CNN, deplatforming me in hundreds of articles, hundreds of appearances
[41:07.880 --> 41:10.360]  in the last year, everywhere saying ban them.
[41:10.360 --> 41:25.280]  And then I have Senator Murphy, Wyden and Warner all saying remove me off of the air
[41:25.280 --> 41:28.320]  and then I'm on the tip of the iceberg, remove thousands of others.
[41:28.320 --> 41:30.400]  That's a quote from Wyden.
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.900]  So a snapshot of YouTube's new search algorithm, just like with me shows hundreds and hundreds
[41:35.900 --> 41:39.840]  and hundreds of the daily show and CNN and MSNBC all the top.
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.720]  You have to go 22 deep to actually find Ann Coulter talking herself.
[41:43.720 --> 41:44.720]  It's people talking about her.
[41:44.720 --> 41:47.360]  We'll do a search of Alex Jones right now.
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.520]  That's what we should be doing here in Infowars to show this.
[41:49.520 --> 41:51.520]  Type in Alex Jones into YouTube.
[41:51.520 --> 42:00.000]  It's hundreds of every negative lie and thing you can imagine and nothing from me and Coulter
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  is on tomorrow.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.120]  I should add.
[42:03.120 --> 42:10.880]  So survival of our democracy depends on banning sites like Infowars, Dem Senators says.
[42:10.880 --> 42:14.320]  Senator Chris Murphy calls for more Silicon Valley censorship, survival of our democracy
[42:14.320 --> 42:15.320]  depends on it.
[42:15.320 --> 42:23.920]  Making people's speech, taking the most basic form of the ethos of democracy is what's happening.
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.840]  You guys print me the other one about the secret plan they were circulating now in public
[42:28.840 --> 42:29.840]  by Warner.
[42:29.840 --> 42:32.400]  So, again, this is the double thing.
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.800]  Ban everyone, ban Banmors.
[42:34.800 --> 42:36.760]  Conservatives are now 96% shadow banned.
[42:36.760 --> 42:43.080]  It was announced yesterday by Google and then they look at you and they say it doesn't
[42:43.080 --> 42:44.080]  exist.
[42:44.080 --> 42:45.080]  It isn't happening.
[42:45.080 --> 42:46.480]  It's a magical warfare.
[42:46.480 --> 42:48.080]  That's what they think of you and your family.
[42:48.080 --> 42:50.120]  Your calls are only a few minutes away.
[42:50.120 --> 42:51.120]  Newswars.com.
[42:51.120 --> 42:53.880]  You can spread it by hand and nothing can stop you.
[42:53.880 --> 42:54.880]  Newswars.com.
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.320]  This is the Censorship Wars.
[42:59.320 --> 43:00.320]  We knew it was coming.
[43:00.320 --> 43:02.320]  The whole thing was for me leg.
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.560]  First demonize Infowars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[43:07.560 --> 43:08.560]  to that.
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.880]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[43:12.880 --> 43:15.400]  children and Islamophobia.
[43:15.400 --> 43:16.400]  And then wallah.
[43:16.400 --> 43:22.520]  Two weeks later, ban Infowars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.400]  all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[43:26.400 --> 43:32.520]  Go to infowars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link.
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.000]  Whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.160]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.440]  emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[43:44.440 --> 43:45.440]  own platform.
[43:45.440 --> 43:50.440]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.160]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[43:55.160 --> 43:56.160]  and coin out.
[43:56.160 --> 43:57.160]  This is the verboten info.
[43:57.160 --> 43:59.400]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[43:59.400 --> 44:05.200]  Infowarslife and infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.000]  Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.560]  Winner Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[44:13.560 --> 44:18.480]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[44:18.480 --> 44:21.440]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.960]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens, simply put, if you want the best at an extremely
[44:25.960 --> 44:27.440]  low price, this is it.

[44:40.400 --> 44:45.400]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com about Winner Sun vitamin D3.

[47:22.040 --> 47:29.200]  Welcome back folks, Alex Jones here.
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.000]  We're on over 200 radio stations, over 400 TV stations and over 100 cable stations.
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.440]  Some are little, some are big.
[47:36.440 --> 47:39.840]  Some are 50,000 watt AM, some are 100,000 watt FM's.
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.440]  But even little thousand watt pressure stations like folks we got in Tennessee and others
[47:44.440 --> 47:46.880]  have been reaching so many people.
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.040]  And in this atmosphere of total censorship you've got to tell everybody, your friends,
[47:51.040 --> 47:56.760]  your family, your neighbors, the fight for the country's now, 71 days out and the chai
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.040]  comms and the globalists are fun and the Democrats and they are making their move.
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.240]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls throughout the rest of the broadcast now today, interspersed
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.320]  with some of Trump's announcement earlier about the new NAFTA deal, a bunch of other
[48:09.320 --> 48:12.480]  clips, but I'm going to take a lot of your calls but just be ready with your point because
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.640]  you know I'll talk to you for 10 minutes and never get to the next person.
[48:14.640 --> 48:15.640]  I'm as bad as you are.
[48:15.640 --> 48:21.440]  So we're going to Pastor Sam and Jason and Adam and Ben and a bunch of others, a lot
[48:21.440 --> 48:26.880]  of calls coming in about Info Wars blocked at their work, Info Wars blocked at the library.
[48:26.880 --> 48:34.000]  Yeah, they are just really after us folks because we are the beta test.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.240]  It's very serious because we're exposing the Antitrust Act, Sherman Antitrust Act section
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.240]  too.
[48:42.240 --> 48:45.040]  This is all illegal and I've been on the phone with a lot of big law firms.
[48:45.040 --> 48:48.120]  They're all writing briefs to the president, top firms, the president's already gotten
[48:48.120 --> 48:49.640]  two of the briefings from us.
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.320]  I mean even a lot of his own cabinet won't get involved in this because these people
[48:54.320 --> 48:57.480]  are $3 trillion companies together.
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.040]  And so everybody in Washington, the lobbyists, everybody are scared to advise the president
[49:01.040 --> 49:02.200]  right.
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.320]  So we're doing it.
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.320]  You bet because my children are worth it, your children are worth it.
[49:10.320 --> 49:12.640]  So Pastor Sam, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[49:12.640 --> 49:13.640]  Go ahead.
[49:13.640 --> 49:16.320]  Thank you for my call, Alex.
[49:16.320 --> 49:21.720]  Dave Hodges reported in the last week or two that there were Chinese troops in the Sierra
[49:21.720 --> 49:22.720]  Madre mountains.
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.720]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.720]  Back off your phone.
[49:24.720 --> 49:25.720]  I don't know why phones are so bad nowadays.
[49:25.720 --> 49:27.000]  I can't understand you.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  Back off your phone.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  Yes, sir.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  It's an international line.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  Can you hear me now?
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Yes, Pastor Sam, Mexico.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  Go ahead.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  Yes, sir.
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.640]  Dave Hodges reported on the Common Sense show in the last couple of weeks that there were
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.080]  Chinese troops staging in the Mexican mountains called the Sierra Madre Oriental and Occidental.
[49:44.080 --> 49:46.800]  It was really a shocking report.
[49:46.800 --> 49:52.600]  And I'm in Mexico right now, and the truth of this is far worse than far more dangerous
[49:52.600 --> 49:54.120]  than even he reported.
[49:54.120 --> 49:55.120]  Well, sir.
[49:55.120 --> 49:56.120]  Very nearly.
[49:56.120 --> 49:57.120]  Go ahead.
[49:57.120 --> 49:58.120]  Very nearly.
[49:58.120 --> 50:07.720]  There was a candidate run for the presidency who is Chinese, Chinese nationality and probably
[50:07.720 --> 50:09.840]  he was born outside of China.
[50:09.840 --> 50:15.720]  His name is Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, and he was in charge, he was the secretary of
[50:15.720 --> 50:21.080]  the interior, which means in charge of all the federal police and perhaps that authority
[50:21.080 --> 50:22.080]  of the leader.
[50:22.080 --> 50:23.080]  Well, let me just back you up on this.
[50:23.080 --> 50:26.400]  They built a bunch of radio stations, one was in the news last week, on the U.S. border
[50:26.400 --> 50:29.400]  beaming Communist Party propaganda.
[50:29.400 --> 50:34.280]  They own it into the United States on AM and FM radio, and it gets worse than that.
[50:34.280 --> 50:40.840]  I'm fully aware that China has a world domination plan that's public to export.
[50:40.840 --> 50:46.960]  Get ready for this, 20 million men a year, mainly military age that are actually in the
[50:46.960 --> 50:47.960]  U.S.
[50:47.960 --> 50:52.360]  I mean, are actually in the Chinese military or other branches, their intelligence service,
[50:52.360 --> 50:54.640]  and they're sent to Africa, they're sent to Asia.
[50:54.640 --> 50:59.840]  But what you said is true, Mexico is one of the number one zones per capita of sending
[50:59.840 --> 51:01.480]  Chinese men.
[51:01.480 --> 51:06.600]  They then send Chinese women here to have babies, so the baby becomes a U.S. citizen,
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.760]  so they go on welfare, and then send part of the money back to the Chinese government.
[51:10.760 --> 51:12.120]  That's even CNN reporting that.
[51:12.120 --> 51:19.160]  So yes, China is using their giant population to totally exploit us.
[51:19.160 --> 51:22.680]  That radio station, Alex, is an un-cloak.
[51:22.680 --> 51:27.120]  The Chinese are smart enough to buy a radio station and stick with its French language
[51:27.120 --> 51:32.640]  broadcasts and slowly integrate, but they are slapping America in the face by just coming
[51:32.640 --> 51:36.400]  out and saying, we are going to speak to the Chinese community, we're going to broadcast
[51:36.400 --> 51:40.800]  propaganda in your nation, something that's been illegal for decades and decades.
[51:40.800 --> 51:44.720]  They're un-cloaking now, and the fact is, the current president-elect-
[51:44.720 --> 51:48.200]  You've got to back off your phone again, you've got to back off your phone again.
[51:48.200 --> 51:49.200]  Yes, sir.
[51:49.200 --> 51:55.360]  Lopez Obrador met with Dr. Morelle, the leader of the auto-defensive, and he said something
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.200]  that was reported in the news, and then it's very personally been covered up.
[51:59.200 --> 52:05.080]  He said, I am going to reach out for a security solution to the crime and to the drug trafficking.
[52:05.080 --> 52:07.360]  I'm going to reach out to the United Nations.
[52:07.360 --> 52:08.360]  I understand.
[52:08.360 --> 52:10.080]  I've got to go and get to the next caller.
[52:10.080 --> 52:11.080]  Yes, sir.
[52:11.080 --> 52:12.080]  Even though you're making great points.
[52:12.080 --> 52:13.080]  Thank you, sir.
[52:13.080 --> 52:15.280]  Yes, China has 98% of rare earth minerals.
[52:15.280 --> 52:16.520]  They have the Panama Canal.
[52:16.520 --> 52:18.080]  They have Panama.
[52:18.080 --> 52:20.200]  They are taking control of Latin America.
[52:20.200 --> 52:21.400]  They're taking control of Africa.
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.400]  This is all confirmed.
[52:22.400 --> 52:24.160]  They're taking control of everything.
[52:24.160 --> 52:29.040]  Our government has stood back and let it happen, and it strategically, you think America couldn't
[52:29.040 --> 52:32.320]  get half the rare earth minerals if we wanted them?
[52:32.320 --> 52:35.000]  It was given to them in these secret treaties.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  We are wide open.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.320]  They own Hollywood.
[52:37.320 --> 52:41.280]  Every movie I tend to see has pro-communist Chinese propaganda.
[52:41.280 --> 52:43.560]  Yes, that is the issue.
[52:43.560 --> 52:45.040]  But Democrat documents have come out.
[52:45.040 --> 52:47.160]  I'll cover later after I take more calls.
[52:47.160 --> 52:51.360]  The plans on infowars.com, they're planned to take down Trump, and in the plan to take
[52:51.360 --> 52:52.360]  down Trump.
[52:52.360 --> 52:56.160]  One thing they say is they're going to say he's a Chinese operative.
[52:56.160 --> 53:00.400]  So now that we've been exposing that, the new thing's going to be Chinese, and then
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.920]  the Chinese are so powerful and so involved, they are involved in some of his businesses
[53:04.920 --> 53:07.680]  because they're involved in everything.
[53:07.680 --> 53:09.160]  But he's the one taking them to the woodshed.
[53:09.160 --> 53:13.440]  They're going to go, oh, look, he got a trademark dispute done when he got elected president
[53:13.440 --> 53:20.400]  in China for Trump Towers, which he already had, and Trump goods that are sold in China.
[53:20.400 --> 53:22.280]  So see, oh, look, he's sold out to the Chinese.
[53:22.280 --> 53:23.280]  He got a trademark.
[53:23.280 --> 53:24.280]  Oh, my gosh.
[53:24.280 --> 53:25.280]  Oh, my gosh.
[53:25.280 --> 53:30.800]  Meanwhile, the Clintons sold out all our missile secrets and everything else and our infrastructure.
[53:30.800 --> 53:33.920]  You were a great caller, sir, which is very hard for me to understand.
[53:33.920 --> 53:36.200]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller here.
[53:36.200 --> 53:40.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Kansas.
[53:40.360 --> 53:41.600]  Ben, you're on the air worldwide.
[53:41.600 --> 53:42.600]  Thanks for holding.
[53:42.600 --> 53:43.600]  Alex.
[53:43.600 --> 53:44.600]  Yes, sir.
[53:44.600 --> 53:45.600]  All right.
[53:45.600 --> 53:46.600]  There you are.
[53:46.600 --> 53:47.600]  Okay.
[53:47.600 --> 53:48.600]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[53:48.600 --> 53:51.080]  And I want to talk about the censorship.
[53:51.080 --> 53:52.800]  What do they think is going to happen?
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.000]  How many whistleblowers do you think are going to come out of trying to censor the right?
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.400]  You know, this is not going to work.
[54:00.400 --> 54:02.720]  This is going to fail on their face.
[54:02.720 --> 54:03.720]  But hold on.
[54:03.720 --> 54:04.720]  Hold on.
[54:04.720 --> 54:05.720]  Yeah.
[54:05.720 --> 54:06.720]  That's what I used to think.
[54:06.720 --> 54:11.280]  But see, you're operating, Ben, like, oh, it's illegal to censor and it's unconstitutional
[54:11.280 --> 54:16.640]  and it's assuring antitrust violation section two and it's racketeering and it's unfair
[54:16.640 --> 54:21.040]  trade practices and it's discriminatory and it violates campaign finance law to only let
[54:21.040 --> 54:25.040]  Democrats operate online, but nobody else can, which is all admitted.
[54:25.040 --> 54:26.040]  But they don't care.
[54:26.040 --> 54:32.560]  They've got Senator Warden, Wyden and Murphy on TV saying ban all conservatives.
[54:32.560 --> 54:34.760]  It's basically already happened.
[54:34.760 --> 54:36.080]  They've already done it on Google.
[54:36.080 --> 54:37.640]  They've already delisted everybody.
[54:37.640 --> 54:39.000]  They've already shadow banned.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.800]  Now they're totally deplatforming 71 days out and they don't care and they're trying
[54:43.800 --> 54:49.480]  to legitimize the whole thing and it's being quarterbacked by Senator Mark Warner.
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.360]  He's the one in the executive order with Senator Murphy that Obama lists to run the stay-behind
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.360]  network.
[54:55.360 --> 54:57.600]  So, yes, all the whistleblowers are coming out.
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.600]  It's the hell.
[54:58.600 --> 55:00.280]  They're publicly saying they're going to censor it.
[55:00.280 --> 55:03.680]  So what do we do now that it's admitted, Ben?
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.680]  That's the question.
[55:04.680 --> 55:05.680]  I mean, what do we do?
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.600]  We have to have more, I guess we need more whistleblowers to come out with more and more
[55:09.600 --> 55:15.280]  serious things that they've been doing and not just on this, on other stuff, and I know
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.120]  they're out there, you know, so I think that's what we need.
[55:19.120 --> 55:20.320]  Ben, I totally agree with you.
[55:20.320 --> 55:21.320]  Thanks for the call.
[55:21.320 --> 55:22.920]  I said I got a lot of calls when I moved quick.
[55:22.920 --> 55:26.240]  But again, I used to think, oh, we have whistleblowers last year.
[55:26.240 --> 55:30.240]  They're secretly banning info wars and delisting it.
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.520]  Now it's out in the open.
[55:31.520 --> 55:32.520]  They're banning everybody.
[55:32.520 --> 55:33.520]  You understand?
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.600]  96% of the Google news is liberal.
[55:37.600 --> 55:42.920]  They delist and push everybody at the bottom and cultures 20 pages down.
[55:42.920 --> 55:47.080]  My actual videos on YouTube are 20, 30 pages.
[55:47.080 --> 55:48.240]  It's all lies.
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.240]  All attacks.
[55:49.240 --> 55:50.240]  It's all rigged.
[55:50.240 --> 55:52.960]  They don't just ban me so I can't go post stuff and have a voice.
[55:52.960 --> 55:56.560]  They then delist everybody else showing what I really said.
[55:56.560 --> 55:58.760]  This is the move, brother.
[55:58.760 --> 56:00.260]  It's own.
[56:00.260 --> 56:03.320]  And they say when the Democrats get back in control, fairness doctrine shutting down
[56:03.320 --> 56:04.320]  talk radio.
[56:04.320 --> 56:06.240]  They're going to bring in all these regulations.
[56:06.240 --> 56:10.120]  Do you think they harass churches five years ago under Obama, tens of thousands of them
[56:10.120 --> 56:12.000]  audited, harassed, everything.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.920]  They say when they get control, they're just shutting them down or they're becoming state
[56:15.920 --> 56:16.920]  run.
[56:16.920 --> 56:20.640]  My mother used to go to one of the big churches here in town that she went to when she was
[56:20.640 --> 56:21.640]  a kid.
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.440]  It used to be a good classical liberal Methodist church.
[56:26.440 --> 56:31.440]  It is now total new world order and she finally quit it.
[56:31.440 --> 56:39.200]  We don't talk about Jesus.
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.280]  I mean, it's on.
[56:40.280 --> 56:41.480]  They're taking over.
[56:41.480 --> 56:43.240]  It's an authoritarian takeover.
[56:43.240 --> 56:47.160]  The leftist CIA and the globalist support authoritarian regimes all over the world.
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.560]  All right, I got to only got to two colors.
[56:51.560 --> 56:54.560]  And I want to do what I used to do right and take 30, 40, 50 calls.
[56:54.560 --> 57:00.760]  So when we come back, I'm going to go to Jason and Adam and Ann and Brian and Matt and Elijah
[57:00.760 --> 57:02.480]  and Jacob and Victor and Kevin.
[57:02.480 --> 57:03.480]  I'm going to go to all of you.
[57:03.480 --> 57:04.480]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[57:04.480 --> 57:07.720]  We've got a bunch of clips coming up with the president, a part of his brief statement
[57:07.720 --> 57:11.000]  on NAFTA being renegotiated, being a lot better deal.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.480]  Now it's got to be ratified by the Congress.
[57:12.480 --> 57:13.480]  We'll get a better look at it.
[57:13.480 --> 57:17.280]  But if I know Trump, it's going to be a lot better than what we had and he's trying to
[57:17.280 --> 57:18.280]  renegotiate all these things.
[57:18.280 --> 57:24.160]  Notice China had a one-sided $900 billion trade deficit and at first they said, no, we're
[57:24.160 --> 57:25.160]  not doing nothing.
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.120]  Now they're coming to the table because we hold all the cards but not for much longer
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.240]  as long as we're a free, open country and as long as we rebuild our nation, we can have
[57:33.240 --> 57:34.400]  a good future.
[57:34.400 --> 57:39.240]  But Hillary and others were going to close the door on the country forever and they still
[57:39.240 --> 57:40.240]  could do it.
[57:40.240 --> 57:41.520]  We aren't out of the woods yet.
[57:41.520 --> 57:42.920]  Have you figured it out?
[57:42.920 --> 57:53.400]  We're in a much more serious position than we were two years ago as the fight's on.
[57:53.400 --> 57:58.360]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[57:58.360 --> 57:59.360]  yeast.
[57:59.360 --> 58:02.920]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[58:02.920 --> 58:06.760]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[58:06.760 --> 58:12.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.600]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[58:15.600 --> 58:18.200]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.920]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive
[58:22.920 --> 58:27.560]  tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[58:27.560 --> 58:31.680]  Filled by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco
[58:31.680 --> 58:36.280]  bark and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test
[58:36.280 --> 58:39.320]  of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[58:39.320 --> 58:44.080]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[58:44.080 --> 58:50.360]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[58:50.360 --> 58:54.640]  You know if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWars
[58:54.640 --> 58:57.720]  Life, they take hours.
[58:57.720 --> 59:02.000]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics, it
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.320]  knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.800]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months, it's got the preglinone that's the
[59:10.800 --> 59:14.720]  precursor to all the natural hormones in your body, then it's got all the minerals and the
[59:14.720 --> 59:17.360]  vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[59:17.360 --> 59:22.360]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified
[59:22.360 --> 59:28.200]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow
[59:28.200 --> 59:29.200]  it.
[59:29.200 --> 59:34.240]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[59:34.240 --> 59:35.440]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[59:35.440 --> 59:41.200]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsLife.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[59:41.200 --> 59:44.640]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[59:44.640 --> 59:45.640]  the word.
[59:45.640 --> 59:53.480]  So thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[59:53.480 --> 01:00:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:15.240]  Man, I can't help but be wound up, I mean.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.960]  That's why I'm up here all weekend.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.080]  My children go to a birthday party for two hours, I run up here and do two hours videos
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.680]  or they'll go to my parents, go swimming over two hours.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.960]  I was up here twice Saturday, I was up here twice Sunday.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.560]  I just can't stop coming up here because it's all unfolding.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.400]  I mean, history's happening everywhere.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  This is insane.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.360]  And we've actually got a president who's a nationalist, a pragmatist, a patriot, who's
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.000]  pro-Christian, he's trying to get government out of the Christianity's way, he's standing
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.760]  up the chai comms and the economy's coming roaring back and all these people are angry
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760]  at him.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.040]  And now the Democrats have put out new talking points.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.360]  In fact, I had it, I know you guys predicted it's on infowars.com, their battle plan to
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]  destroy Trump.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.600]  I'll find it for the next segment, I'll go to calls now, but remind me to find that
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.600]  during the break.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.040]  That's so many pages.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.080]  Their new thing is that he's a Chinese agent.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.320]  See, just like I say, we're the resistance to globalism and then Trump wins, now they're
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.440]  the resistance.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.960]  These people have no creativity.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.280]  And when you read the stuff, it's all about how he's a Chinese agent.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.440]  Yeah, right.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:36.320]  A Chinese agent would slap hundreds of millions of dollars of tariffs on their ass.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.400]  I mean, how stupid do they think we are?
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.280]  The Chinese say they're an economic war with the United States, not the Chinese people.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.160]  Their people are under attack by the commies and the big tech companies that move to China.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.680]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.400]  It was a caller saying info wars was banned.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.400]  I wanted to talk to them.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400]  I guess they hung up.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  It's all right.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400]  Let's go ahead and go to Elijah.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  Elijah, you're on the air.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:16.240]  Thank you for calling.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.280]  That's that old thing where they keep their radio up.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.760]  So people aren't used to be taking a lot of calls.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.320]  I'm going to try to get back in the swing of it here.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.760]  If people can do it, they can just get on the phone, talk to me, I'll talk to them.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.120]  But man, if you notice, they got rid of landline cell phones are so bad.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.920]  Everybody calls me on cell phones that I can't understand.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]  I'm going to landline.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920]  It's so nice.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.680]  I don't use a landline at my house a lot.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680]  Jason in Georgia.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.680]  You're on the air.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680]  Thanks for holding.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680]  Okay.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.680]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680]  Can you hear me?
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680]  I sure can.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]  Hey, man.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680]  I love you, man.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680]  I love your show.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680]  Everything you do.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680]  Love you, brother.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.280]  My concern was about the midterms like I'm getting increasingly nervous and worked up
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.800]  about it like you are.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.920]  But I follow Bill Mitchell who I love when he's on your show and he keeps saying this
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  slow walker hashtag, he keeps putting it out there saying that he's so confident that Jeff
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.960]  Sessions is there to lay the hammer down this month or next month or whatever.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.600]  Because I really hope it's true, but I'm losing faith.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]  I like Bill Mitchell.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]  I want to get him back on the show.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.100]  I think we've asked him back on the show because they probably think he'll be shadow
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.100]  man.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.720]  So I know we've asked him on a few times and I've got a response back or he says he's
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]  busy.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.680]  He's a really smart guy and he's really positive and he's been right about Trump so far.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.520]  But this whole QAnon that Sessions is great and Mueller is great is a load of horsemener.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.920]  I know the inside baseball.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.320]  It's not true.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.160]  It's delusional and Sessions may get forced into doing his job.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160]  That'd be a good thing.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:51.040]  But when you get Senator Grassley and Senator Graham coming out and saying get rid of Sessions
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.040]  over the weekend, that's the green light that Sessions is dead at the switch.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.200]  So they say, I mean kill Sessions, I mean dead man, not alive at the switch, asleep
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200]  at the switch.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:07.120]  Well, I love Bill Mitchell, but you know, he's right on a lot of things, but it's just
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.800]  so hard to believe him on that.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.240]  Well, I mean, look, here's what's going on.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.640]  Mueller's involved in Uranium One.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640]  He's on Russian boards.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640]  He delivered to Uranium.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.640]  Hillary's up to her eyeballs.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640]  He legal servers.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]  Benghazi.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]  On and on and on.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.920]  Foreign governments give him her billions of dollars.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920]  It's a joke.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.520]  Obama and 84 million in laundered money.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520]  All of it.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.520]  Arab Spring.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.520]  On and on and on.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.480]  And so I don't want to hear it.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.200]  They're getting ready to go after his whole family.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.840]  All this, I'm not going to sit here and stand by and just go, oh, believe in the plan.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.160]  Some anonymous guy on 4chan said, God bless you, Jason.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.680]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680]  That's where I stand.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.160]  Long people say, you know, Karen Mucci's like, oh my gosh, you know, don't get rid of Sessions
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160]  to be a disaster.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.040]  A disaster's having dereliction of duty.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.160]  It's the president's duty to fire him.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.680]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from info wars.com, when you spread the videos,
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.920]  you are changing the world?
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.640]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glovelist.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.200]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.200]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.960]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]  You are the info war.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.040]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:33.440]  go to info wars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.240]  So there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.000]  news, Intel, you name it.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.560]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the info wars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.800]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:55.040]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:24.840]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:33.720]  So ladies and gentlemen, the president has renegotiated to deal with the Mexican government
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.360]  on NAFTA.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.480]  We're going to see the details of it once Congress has to basically agree to the changes
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.640]  and ratify it.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.840]  We've got coming up, start the next segment, I'm going to play some excerpts, what the
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.720]  president had to say.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.960]  That's up on info wars.com and news wars.com right now.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.640]  The tech companies are now announcing plans to censor all conservatives and de-list them.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.760]  This is total discrimination.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.960]  This is the Republicans asleep at the switch with the stupid statement that, well, they're
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960]  a private company.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960]  They can do what they want.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:17.160]  Oh, all meeting in collusion to coordinate the censorship, really.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.600]  And then to go after a certain group and block them so you can steal elections.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.920]  It violates so many things.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.880]  And now they've been caught and now that Trump's moving against them and the Republicans are
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.960]  waking up, now CNN and others are like, no one's censoring.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:38.320]  No one called for anyone to be restricted.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.000]  Nothing's happening here.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.800]  So this is quite a historical thing that's happening with the Dow retaking 26,000 while
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:56.320]  the S&P hits an all time of 8,000, S&P and NASDAQ, NASDAQ at 8,000, S&P also hit a all
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:03.800]  time new high and the big number 4.6 GDP growth.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:15.680]  Paul Krugman of the New York Times and Obama said, said that it's impossible that he'd
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.240]  ever get it above 3%.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.680]  What do you have a magic wand?
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:26.200]  No, China had a magic wand that all the trade deals were one-sided, Mexico had a magic wand.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.640]  Everybody else had a magic wand, but us, no, you were there on purpose, part of globalism
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.640]  suppressing us not to build up the third world, but to literally own and run parts of companies
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.160]  that you sold off.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.880]  So here is famously Obama saying, what do you got a magic wand?
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.920]  That he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.960]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.400]  What are you going to do?
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.920]  There's no answer to it.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.680]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.560]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.240]  What magic wand do you have?
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:06.600]  And usually the answer is, you don't have an answer.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:16.480]  So and of course, now we're at 4.6 projected growth, 4.2 last time official numbers came
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:23.640]  out according to the Federal Reserve and everybody I know, family all over the country,
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:29.320]  some wealthy, some middle class, some working poor, say no, things are better now and gas
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.360]  prices go up too much and Trump puts pressure on Saudi Arabia and the media says that won't
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:41.400]  lower prices and then they go down half a dollar in a week because we've got a managed
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400]  economy.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400]  Make no mistake.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.080]  And it's a crony capitalist system for the elite.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.560]  And Trump's like, why don't you give them something?
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.000]  They're the ones that go to golf courses.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.480]  They're the ones that get their hair cut.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.520]  They're the ones that fly around on airplanes and the globalists go, we want to post industrial
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.800]  world and a collapse society that will manage the collapse.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.960]  And Trump's here and all this is this is mainline policy papers going, manage the collapse.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.280]  We can't have cars or air conditioning and we're teaching our kids they're going to be
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.360]  poor because all the movies show the earth dying and the elite having to kill everybody.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.240]  They're just setting you up folks.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.360]  The establishment doesn't like you.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.920]  They're eugenicists and they've deployed systems to control you and Trump doesn't like it and
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.120]  he wants to release all of the restricted technologies they call disruptive and that
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  means disruptive to their monopolies.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.240]  I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.600]  I promise to not for lack of news.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.120]  There's just so much here, but we're at a critical time.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.560]  They're making the move the next 71 days.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.520]  They've gone from saying they're deplatforming me first denying that they were censoring
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:00.000]  me and shadow banning and then now admitting it and then totally banning me off most platforms.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.840]  And now they're trying to get info wars down and news wars down.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.160]  Now they're trying to get our credit processors shut down.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.840]  They're trying to come after everything.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.640]  They literally have intelligence agencies operating for the New York Times and the Washington
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.560]  Post through this stay behind network Obama set up in the John Warren Defense Authorization
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.800]  Act counter propaganda enemy propaganda that means the American people and they're actually
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:26.440]  paying all these people CIA money that's in the legislation Obama signed to go around
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.960]  and stalk everyone and they're doing horrible criminal stuff making up things threatening
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.480]  people to lie about others or they'll lie about them to bully everyone because they've
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.880]  been told the U.S. governments behind you, Trump's an imposter, he's a Russian.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.160]  Don't worry, he'll be out soon.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.960]  And so they've gotten people on government payroll where they're giving them ID cards,
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960]  everything.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960]  Trump doesn't even know about this.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.200]  And I've gotten to the president and he's aware of it now.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.560]  Trump's just busy going, well, if I turn the economy back on, they'll really appreciate
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.560]  it.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.000]  If you want to look it up, zero headshad of the year and a half ago when Obama signed
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.600]  the executive order, it's the most important thing you'll read to understand all this.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.040]  And the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, it's Obama just signed into law his own
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.040]  ministry of truth.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.760]  And it's all there, countering disinformation propaganda act.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]  That's the December article.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.760]  Go to the January article.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:35.640]  And that one again, please, because it's all and it's the same senators, Warner, Wyden
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.440]  and Murphy are in the bill to direct it.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.480]  The Democrats direct billions of dollars in the defense budget to give to whoever they
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]  want.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:51.160]  And it says through the CIA and board of governors of the FCC.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.920]  And the money goes to Buzzfeed and to Media Matters and the CNN and the New York Times
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:02.160]  to have Oliver Darcy and all these people sit there in their desk, lobbying to have
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.760]  every sponsor taken, have a shutdown and admit they are, and then using classic CIA disinfo.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.480]  Darcy comes out and says, no one's taking anyone off.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.880]  Trump's completely insane.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.520]  I mean, they blow up all this media that's pro-American.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:27.160]  They shut it all down in an act of just horrible draconian criminal activity.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:33.840]  There's hundreds of articles looking at Darcy obsessing with shutting me off the air.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.760]  And then he comes out and says, Trump's crazy.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.240]  No one's censoring anybody.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.800]  No, they're just censoring everybody and meeting in secret to carry it out.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.680]  That's all over the news.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.280]  But Trump, the false claim, nobody's getting censored.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.560]  No, no, no.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560]  And they think we're dumb.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.960]  They think we're dumb animals.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.120]  They think Congress is stupid.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.560]  They think you're stupid.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.480]  They're foaming at the mouth to take Rush Limbaugh off the air.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.520]  By the way, you know why Glenn Beck went from bad, from pretty good to bad to worse about
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.560]  three years ago against Trump?
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.720]  He was told about this whole plan that Hillary was coming in.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720]  There's got to be censorship.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.720]  There's got to be fairness doctrine.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.560]  Everybody else is going to be shut down.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560]  People will never win.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.040]  This was all being announced by Hillary back then and by the foundations.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040]  And you know what?
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.880]  Glenn Beck went to dinner with George Soros, I'm told, a 20-god-off Soros.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880]  You didn't know that?
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.760]  And Glenn Beck went to dinner with all these people and they said, you'll be the token
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:40.440]  conservative when Trump loses and you'll be in charge and you'll be left alone if you
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440]  play ball.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.120]  He got advised by that by some of his managers that are international.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:52.040]  And he went on that beeline to do that, to think he would lead the conservative nationalist
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.000]  movement in America down a rabbit hole off a cliff with, you know, pseudo-religious stuff
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.800]  and about being passive and the Lord's coming back, don't do anything.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:10.440]  Just take it and Alex Jones is dangerous and Alex Jones is bad and Donald Trump's bad
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:17.400]  and of the devil and God's going to defeat him, but anybody with discernment meant, man,
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.280]  I don't like Trump as flamboyance and the stuff, but my spirit tells me Trump's for
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.240]  real and boy, didn't the spirit turn out to be right.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.680]  The spirit told me Glenn Beck is a wicked, wicked little demon.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.200]  And now you see who was right.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.760]  You see, well, my spirit tells me danger, danger, danger, globalist incoming, get ready.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.080]  This is the big push.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.360]  The enemy's about to launch all out of tax, including physical, false flags that demonizes
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360]  and shut everything down.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.400]  And they're already openly killing the First Amendment everywhere by high tech means and
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.600]  that you're too stupid by increment to notice it, even though it's a 96% ban.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.760]  Right now, by election day, it'll be 100.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.600]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.680]  keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.040]  system has become a challenge.

[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:30.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]  radio network.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:38.120]  Listen, I don't want to beat a dead horse but it's really true.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:44.040]  There are thousands and thousands of prominent voices on talk radio, TV, in the U.S. alone,
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.080]  hundreds of thousands worldwide.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.160]  So people kind of hear stuff and they take it with a grain of salt, oh yeah, I'm the
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:21:01.120]  first show in modern U.S. history to be de-platformed off of 26 different systems in one week and
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.280]  then to accurately predict that they would then take everybody else off after me, which
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.520]  they've now done.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.680]  And I can't believe this isn't a bigger deal.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.920]  I mean this is crazy.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.560]  I've got mainstream news here and mainstream tech sites, I covered it yesterday, where
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:23.240]  now Republican sites are dialed back 96%.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.280]  Breitbart did a study two weeks ago with computer scientists and major universities found they
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:33.440]  were 93% dialed back and guess what, a bunch of other sites were as well.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.880]  This is all monopoly done.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.680]  The companies all meet.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.920]  They had BuzzFeed reported on this on Friday.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:45.400]  More than 20 companies met at Twitter headquarters to decide how to basically steal the election.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:54.520]  They said how to protect the election under orders of Senator John Warner.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.520]  Think about that.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.360]  Oh, oh good news, they're deciding who will win.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360]  Thank you.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:08.120]  And again, they have a monopoly, 90% of the internet is them.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.320]  They set us up.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:16.320]  Rudge was right, the good news is we've gotten, just since this ban happened, usually radio
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:21.960]  stations switch over to you at the new year, we've gotten more than 15 big juicy stations
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.440]  just the last three weeks, like Sacramento and a couple others, I'm about to be announcing
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.440]  that tomorrow.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.960]  A lot of stations to announce, a lot of new liners I have to cut.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.760]  So the good news is we're exploding on talk radio and television.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:42.000]  The bad news is they're coming for that next.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.040]  They're coming for everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.760]  That's why they had that hoax story that I was running in a legal radio station I never
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.760]  even heard of.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.160]  And it was some station that hadn't operated for like a year that was a half a watt that
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.160]  nobody could hear.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.800]  And when I saw people on the news, some nice lady or husband that ran to fluoride, I'd
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.120]  met him a few times.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.520]  They had some little thing that went like a mile and but the Jones's studios raided
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.600]  by the feds and then these people weren't even rated.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.640]  They were sent a letter and it was at their apartment complex, a little antenna.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:20.280]  You can buy those kits online for like a hundred dollars, but that's the hoax.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.880]  It's how they do everything.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:33.960]  They set a destroyed evidence when YouTube and Twitter took our tweets down and technically
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960]  Twitter makes you do it.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]  It's like walking the plank.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.080]  They go, we're going to ban you if you don't delete this to get back in your account.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.080]  Delete it.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.080]  I mean, it's like a joke.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.720]  It's like shoot yourself in the head and we'll let you can, you know, it's it's crazy.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.920]  And they do it at every level.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.840]  It's like I said, we're not going to charge attorney's fees in Connecticut or Texas with
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.720]  the Sandy Hook family suing me.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.840]  I'm going to take the high road as an olive branch.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:05.240]  They ran the headline that I sued them, which the statute is even a suit when they sue you
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.680]  under these anti slap laws like in England, we have those now.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.000]  If you lose, you got to pay attorney's fees.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.640]  So if you even defend yourself and file back against them that you're going to answer,
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.120]  it kicks them into a lawsuit.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.800]  It means it's a two way lawsuit now so that you don't have litigious lawsuits like England.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.640]  You sue somebody, you're automatically sued.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.880]  So they sue me.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.160]  They know our lawyers go, they're going to say you sued them as a PR son.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.480]  I go, let's send them off at the past.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.880]  Let's say we're waiving the fees.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.360]  They go, no one's ever done that.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]  I go, do it.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]  We do it.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.880]  The media says I sued the Sandy Hook.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.000]  You understand the dedication of the media and these people to lies.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.920]  The mainstream media and using people.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.640]  I mean, it's next level.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.120]  So I told my lawyers all announced it here.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.760]  I said, you can revoke that revoke it.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.240]  How's the media going to report on that?
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.360]  Jones had said no fees for the first time ever.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360]  No one's ever done it.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:08.000]  We lied and said he sued them and did want the fees, but now he is getting the fees if
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  they lose.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.360]  That's going to be filed Thursday.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.840]  So they won't care.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:21.440]  They won't think you remembered the false story two weeks ago.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.640]  They will simply run the new one that I don't care, they just do it lie.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.960]  It's what mainstream media does.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.720]  You're corporate assassins of the truth.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.320]  Do it then.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.320]  Let's go.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.880]  Glovy, wuvvies are offy and see what that means.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.400]  Little wiggly snugglies Anna in Tennessee.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  You're on the air.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.400]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.400]  Welcome.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]  Yes.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  Thank you.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.400]  I really appreciate you taking my call.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.400]  I want to tell you that you're an American hero.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.560]  You're an American hero, God bless you.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]  Thank you so much.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:58.280]  I have a channel that was shut down because my channel is totally dedicated to info wars
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.880]  and like you trying to red pill America and wake them up, but they're not sheep or led
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.360]  to this slaughter.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:11.080]  And when I broke the story about old Georgie Borsoros being a Nazi sympathizer, they locked
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.000]  me out of my channel.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.240]  And then I had to open a new channel and now I have like 800 followers and I'm shadow
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.600]  banned so nobody's getting to hear any of my stuff.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.640]  And I tried to start a conspiracy theory club.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:31.360]  And when they asked me my interest and I said the Constitution and being a, then they had
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.280]  to know my conservative, my political views, which I said I was a conservative.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.760]  And then they said, who did I like?
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.640]  And I said, I liked info wars.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.720]  And then they sent me back my money and said that my, that voice of conservatives is not
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.160]  allowed on their platform.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.360]  And that was so that I could link up with like minded other conservatives.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.320]  And so what I think you're saying is you wanted to advertise on Facebook to get back on or
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.320]  wherever.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.160]  And then they told you, no, that's why Trump's suing them.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.400]  They say your sexual preference, any illnesses you have, they have it all.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.920]  They're watching you in their internal dashboard.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.360]  Then they sell that to big companies and they're literally spying on you and discriminating
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.480]  against you.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.120]  And yes, the Republican party tried to advertise on my Facebook a few months ago and they were
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:20.000]  told, as of this date, I want to say it was something like July something, you're no longer
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.560]  allowed to advertise on info wars.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.720]  So they already were getting us ready for banning.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:30.800]  Then they ran their PR campaign with CNN run openly out of the CIA and out of the group
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.240]  that Obama set up with his executive order.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.160]  In fact, let's put that back on screen again, I will sprint it from zero heads.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.920]  We're just going to keep showing it and showing it and showing it.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.080]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.560]  And you can pull that whole thing up and see that right there for yourself.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.560]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.880]  And to say they're coming out on the news locally and everywhere else.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.360]  And they're saying that people that are conspiracy theorists and people that follow Alex Jones
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.040]  are a threat to society and to democracy itself.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.520]  And that's so frightening.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.840]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.760]  We are all Alex Jones.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.360]  They are threatening us all.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.560]  They're saying that to have a viewpoint that is contrary to the secret government and the
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:18.520]  shadow government's views is a danger and that we are a threat.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:24.320]  And so now they're mirroring their own crimes onto us and saying that to have any other
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:28.720]  viewpoint is criminal and that something has to be done about it.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.840]  That's what Hillary just said in a recent convention that she was in a couple of weeks
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840]  ago.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.320]  No, I know she says ban all conservatives or quote American democracy will die.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:44.720]  Ban all their opposition, shut everyone down or they'll be destroyed because they're destroying
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]  America.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720]  They're the enemy.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.720]  And keep it up.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.720]  God bless you.

[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.960]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.920]  against us so we need your support.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.520]  to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:13.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:28.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:33.240]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.240]  get.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:42.320]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:47.560]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.400]  prayers together.

[01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:19.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.240]  You know, I'll have the Washington Post, the New York Times, you name it, chase me
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:28.800]  down the street and I'll say, Alex, one thing, why'd you use to be anti-establishment?
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.600]  Now you're pro-establishment.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:34.200]  Rick Linkletters, big director, friend of mine, he lives here in Texas on a Hollywood
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.200]  director, and people say, you know, you put him in your movies and all this, and now he's
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.840]  such a pro-establishment guy, he used to be anti-establishment.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.400]  That's their favorite thing.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.760]  I wanted America back.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.640]  I wanted a president who was president.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.280]  I wanted a Congress that was Congress.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.640]  I wanted state governments that were in charge.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.480]  I want PTAs that are in charge.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.640]  I want you in charge.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.280]  I want power transferred back to you.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.880]  And then whatever your politics are, what you want as a community, I respect that.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.920]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.680]  The media always acts like I'm this super right-wing guy that hates gay people and blah,
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:16.680]  blah, blah, and it's all made up, ladies and gentlemen, just like it is with Trump.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  He doesn't hate Mexicans.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:18.680]  He never said that.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.160]  Do they ever show you a clip?
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.160]  No.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]  It's a hoax.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.960]  And look, I knew they lied before, but I've come to grips with how they lie about me because
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.240]  I know what I've done.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.360]  I know what's happening.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.840]  I see the things they do.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.080]  They photoshop things.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.240]  They edit video.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.240]  They edit audio.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.400]  They superimpose things.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.240]  And people are always saying, well, respond to it.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.200]  I can't respond to 500 articles a day on average.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:51.800]  Yeah, sometimes 10,000.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.320]  They'll take one fake article and put it in half the newspapers in the country.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.560]  I'm on the news every night in Austin.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.560]  Some lie about me.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:02.040]  I cannot walk down the street.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040]  Okay.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.400]  Well, everyone pointing and staring now before it was like every third or fourth person.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400]  Oh, it's Alex Jones.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.160]  Now it's mobbed.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.280]  But here's the problem.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:23.760]  My voice, what I actually say, who I am is been cut back and it has been so.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.640]  So that I can't say who I really am so they can misrepresent who I am and I can't counterpunch
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.360]  like the president does.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:37.960]  Yes, I can speak to you directly on AM and FM stations and thank God for them and TV
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.320]  stations and cable and thank God to everybody around this country.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.640]  Thank you.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.400]  No assistance from Chicago to Houston from New York City to LA.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400]  Thank you.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.800]  But this is a war and my war is your war.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.400]  If they can shut me down, you're next.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.920]  And now you've seen it and I'll be honest with you.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.840]  I'm pretty freaked out by the fact that three, four weeks after I got banned everywhere, people
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.880]  are just now getting around to going, what happened to Alex Jones is wrong.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.240]  It could happen to us.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:12.600]  It already happened to you, but they think you have no memory.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.200]  So your Facebook used to get 10,000 people when you posted, even if you were small.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.640]  Now it gets 10.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.080]  You've been shadow banned.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.880]  You go to YouTube, they put nothing but anti-American crap on top.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:37.560]  If you search Trump or Alex Jones or Ann Coulter or Matt Drudge, they've gone pure evil.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.720]  They've chosen pure censorship.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.960]  We've got a special guest joining us for 15, 20 minutes, someone will go back to your calls,
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  toll free number to join us is not that we really need to give the number up, but I'd
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.680]  like to 877-789-2539.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:55.800]  We have a special guest on the imminent resignation of Pope Francis for the pedophile rings.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:59.040]  Oh, remember, I told you that I said he'd be stepping down for pedophilia when Trump
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  first got elected.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.160]  We've got the inside baseball folks.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.920]  That's why they want to shut down out of all the media in the world.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.960]  Remember, I finished this point last segment, it's always wander off in my thoughts out
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:18.240]  of all the media in the world, all the voices they wanted us shut down and why is it?
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.480]  Because we got their number folks.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:24.520]  I know what I'm talking about and believe me, you know how frustrating it is to know,
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.240]  you know what you're talking about because you go off their own documents, their own
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.560]  white papers, their own admissions, and then everyone else kind of gets a little bit of
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.880]  it that doesn't get it and just thinks you're some loudmouth.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  Oh, yeah, right, Alex, you know what's going on, yeah, I do.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.720]  And people don't want to believe it because it's so horrific.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.240]  I get it, I get it, I get it.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.840]  I don't want to believe the globalist plan, but look what they're doing to us, look what's
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.280]  happening in society and then you read their own papers, they're doing it to control us.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.400]  This is a modern takeover.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:06.040]  We've got ways to fight back, we're just struggling here like you are as well, but the enemies
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.640]  made their move and Trump sees it and says millions have been censored, it's wrong, will
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.920]  not be tolerated.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.800]  He's got a Justice Department totally compromised, he's fighting as hard as he can, we've got
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.360]  to support him and you've got to vote and get everybody else you've got to vote.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.400]  I want every Christian, every conservative, every libertarian, every God-fearing, pro-free
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:29.000]  market person to understand, you better go knock, especially in battleground states,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.920]  on 500 doors.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.040]  You better get out of your comfort zone and you better go vote yourself and you better
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.480]  get involved, you better ride up and down the street with your pickup truck, blaring
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.840]  that the globalist are here and the globalist are here and Trump's trying to stop because
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.840]  it's that close.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.320]  All right, we're going to go to our guest here.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:52.120]  I want to just play a few minutes of President Trump announcing the renegotiation of NAFTA,
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.480]  nothing he promised he'd do, he got it done very, very quickly.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.120]  Now, it's got to get to the House of Senate, that's great.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  Here it is.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.880]  This has to do, they used to call it NAFTA, we're going to call it the United States,
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.600]  Mexico trade agreement.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.560]  We'll get rid of the name NAFTA as a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:18.080]  by NAFTA for many years and now it's a really good deal for both countries and we look very
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.080]  much forward to it.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:38.760]  I believe the President is on the phone, Enrique, yeah, you can hook him up, you can tell me
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760]  what.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  How are you?
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.760]  It's a big thing, a lot of people waiting.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:40:06.320]  Do you want to put that on this phone, please, hello?
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.200]  A little awkward while I'm playing it, this is what Trump really does all day, get stuff
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:16.200]  done.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:25.960]  Thank you.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:30.000]  Thank you, Enrique, congratulations, that's really a fantastic thing, we've all worked
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  very hard.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.760]  Your brilliant representatives are sitting right in front of me and I thought we would
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.160]  congratulate each other before it got out and I know we'll have a formal news conference
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:41:10.560]  in the next two days in the future.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:16.800]  And the first reason for this call, Mr. President, is first of all to celebrate the understanding
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:30.920]  we have had between both negotiating teams, an interest we have had for quite a few months
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:47.800]  now to renew it, to modernize it, to update it and to generate a framework that will boost
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:42:01.880]  the potential productivity in North America.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.760]  All right, we're going to come back with our special guest for two segments and back to
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.640]  your phone calls and a special guest from Rome on the imminent resignation many are
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:17.400]  saying of the pedophile Pope, again a pedophile ring used, this Pope and others to get control,
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.880]  now all of his top officers are getting busted with children or traveling him for control,
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.840]  that is all coming up, that's how the global is trying to take over the Catholic Church,
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:29.920]  I know a lot of classical Catholics who are great people, conservative Catholics are very,
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.480]  very happy to see all this happening, Pope Francis, pedophile scandal, resignation,

[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.280]  What's a special guest from the Vatican on the huge repercussions for the left worldwide
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.680]  and their big leftist pedo supporting pedo covering up hope.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.040]  And I told you when Trump got elected that this pope would go down and the pedophiles
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.040]  were going to get busted.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.520]  We've been proven right again next year's news today at info wars dot com.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:04.360]  Now joining us is Dr. Keith Moeller who's highly respected.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.360]  He was a CEO and manager director of American biotech labs.
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.840]  That's a big company prior to his position in ABL.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.640]  Keith serves as director of proprietary development three different mining companies.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.680]  He's almost 35 years of experience working in the silver industry and holds a BS in business
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:22.800]  management finance international business from breaking on universities also certified
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.640]  natural health practitioner and holds a doctorate in natural patty is co authored many papers
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.880]  on silver and a number of which have been peer reviewed and published.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.080]  He's also co authored a number of US international silver developments and holds patents helping
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.080]  to pioneer new medical uses for silver.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.560]  I'm not going to go over his 18 years as managing director and head of sales for ABL and all
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.640]  the rest of it.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.760]  And the fact that he's brought to market and gotten patented and trademarked ABL currently
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.560]  holds 56 patents relation to their silver saw.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.960]  Everybody has heard is the best technology has more patents pending ABL currently has
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:59.800]  more than 400 major studies and test series on products for more than 60 different government
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.600]  labs universities private institutions.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:07.160]  ABL is one of the largest private libraries on silver information that exists today.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.320]  And that's the silver use Institute dot com.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.160]  Now, they had to pay a lot of money to get this for this was approved over the counter.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:20.640]  And we're the only company out there that's been authorized a private label of super silver.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.440]  And dressing gel is our name for their product itself for $40 over the counter that's used
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440]  in hospitals.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:28.440]  You name it.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.080]  Anything stronger becomes a medical device in his prescription.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.720]  This is nano tech silver.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.200]  And several of our products, the ultimate mouthwash immune gargle has it in three different
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.760]  sizes that but this is even stronger than that.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:47.720]  And believe me with all of the resistant bacteria and all the rest of it, everyone knows to
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.920]  have different things in your arsenal is critical.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.160]  This is the next level.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.640]  It's available discounted for $29.95 and that supports our broadcast and info or store.com.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.560]  But I've been wanting to get him on for months.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:03.280]  He's been busy, but he's able to come on the day for just a few segments and get into why
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.440]  this is such a game changer, why it's patented, why it's the best, why I remember folks like
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.440]  you talking about this.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:14.080]  I know you were 15 years ago and oh, silver, but now you go into a CVS or whatever you see
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.760]  a bunch of stuff for 20, 30, 40 bucks that isn't even strong as this or you'll see your
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.680]  brand, but we just have a different name for it.
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:26.240]  So again, this is next level and part of the cost and it was actually going through obviously
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.360]  all the approval and years to get this approved and to be over the counters and be able to
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.680]  make all the claims you could make.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.680]  So that really makes the establishment mad because they love to say if I say you need
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.640]  vitamin C, I say that snake oil or if I say humans need oxygen, they go, that's not true.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640]  You do need oxygen, folks.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.640]  You'll die without it.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.000]  Please don't try to put a tourniquet around your neck.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.840]  But this stuff, silver, what it does.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.360]  Dr., thanks for joining us and let's just give people the highlights of this amazing
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360]  development.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360]  Okay.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.200]  And Alex, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:01.280]  I think the biggest part about this is we need to have people prepared.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:07.600]  We need to have people be able to have a first line of defense that's in their house right
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.160]  now.
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:17.760]  You have about, I was on the CDC website and it said that 33% of the population of the
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:24.440]  U.S., that's two out of every three people you're looking at, carry staph aureus bacteria
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:31.320]  in their nose, two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin resistant
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320]  staph.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:39.120]  Now, what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:47.800]  There's an article out, more U.S. deaths from MRSA than AIDS that's out from the web, MD.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:54.000]  And they talk about the fact that MRSA is now killing more people than AIDS.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.920]  And what you're talking about is something that you need in your house to be able to
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.920]  protect your family.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:05.960]  And so what we do is we work really hard with mass amounts of research and we found that
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:11.520]  our gel, your gel, as a first line of defense is amazing.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:17.920]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:20.640]  will last up to three days.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:28.000]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph E. coli, candida, aspergillus niger in minutes.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:42.160]  and ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.320]  staph bacteria from that soccer field.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:52.200]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephone,
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:54.200]  in subways.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:53:00.720]  And this gel that you have access to is a first line of defense for everybody to be
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:07.360]  able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria and all the other bacteria.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:13.120]  The cool part is, crap happens, you gel it up and you don't worry about it because we
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:19.520]  have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now in your
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:23.920]  house where you can easily take care of it.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:29.440]  It talks about the fact that MRSA is now in schools.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:35.200]  And I was reading on the CDC and it says students with MRSA should not be excluded from attending
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:40.280]  schools or from activities as long as there isn't pus coming out.
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:45.280]  Well, let me ask you this question, Dr. Let's get into it because my dad is a chemist and
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.680]  oral surgeon and a lot of other things and he just has been raving about this for years.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:52.400]  We're glad to have it in the mouthwash, the immune gargoyle you name it because almost
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.680]  no one else has it.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:54:00.160]  But across the industry, the particular technology that your company has developed, SilverSol,
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.120]  is recognized as the strongest and the best.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.120]  How is it different?
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.640]  Because you talk about it topically beforehand, but I'd also think about once something happens
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:08.800]  too you could use it then.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:14.080]  But I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time because explain why the
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.280]  super silver wound gel dressing from InfoWarsLife.com that we've probably labeled from your top
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.680]  of the line, your top selling product nationwide.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.920]  Why is it so special?
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.160]  Well, I think one of the big things is that almost anything that will kill these really
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:34.560]  heinous bacteria, it really, most of them will kill you.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:40.480]  And this gel, if it goes on your skin, will make it incredibly soft in like two minutes,
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.840]  which is why women love it.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.960]  They just put it on because it makes their skin incredibly soft.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:53.560]  But more importantly, that protection level, the covering that goes on there is huge.
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:58.520]  Now we were trying to make ionic forms of the silver stable.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:05.360]  And what we ended up doing is we ended up actually inventing and then later being able
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.400]  to patent a new type of silver.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:13.600]  Now this silver, we actually make claims on the label that it is more effective or as
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:18.320]  effective as products of the 3,000 PPM silver.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:26.440]  So our 24 PPM and head to head test against products that were 3,000 PPM silver, we slaughtered
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.440]  it.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.800]  Now, let's explain what that means because let's explain because when I've read the
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.120]  super medical gravest prescription that hospitals now use, scoffed at 20 years ago, now it's
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.760]  their front line of defenses, it works, is toxic that you guys have learned how to nano
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.640]  a silver that's not as toxic at a lower level that works even better.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.280]  So this is why you're the number one seller in the country now.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.280]  Explain this.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.560]  Okay, so our silver is actually not metabolized.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:58.600]  So when you drink it in the liquid, in the breath spray or when it's used in the gel,
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:04.440]  it goes into your system, it does what it's supposed to and it washes out within 24 hours.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:11.280]  We actually have three human ingestion studies, which are IRB board control, means internal
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:17.080]  review board control and published and peer reviewed in PubMed and those are like the
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.080]  highest type of quality science you can get.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:26.640]  But these studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes out in 24 hours with
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.400]  no negative effect on any system in your body.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.160]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:40.520]  Yeah, oh yeah, all of them actually accumulate to a certain level and most of them are pretty
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.120]  safe, but they can build up over time and cause what's called Argeria, which means the
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.120]  blue man effect.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:50.720]  Sure, like the one guy drank hundreds of bottles of it as a joke and turned blue.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.600]  So again, this is the safest, best strongest without a prescription, but what I was reading
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.960]  is what you were saying is, Dr, is that this stuff's from your research and you've done
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.320]  the studies better than even the so-called medical grade?
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:10.280]  Oh yeah, I mean, we actually have this same stuff in hospitals and prescription and we
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:18.440]  have it as an over the counter OTC and it is classified as a device, but we also have
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:23.720]  it in all these other forms and the important part is that over the counter, which is what
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:31.600]  you have available to your people is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.600]  Almost nothing you have will kill MRSA and this stuff will kill it in minutes.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.600]  I was about to say, no one can really say this and it's a whole bunch of other stuff,
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:43.160]  believe me, I have stockpiled it because the number one thing threatening us is automobile
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.240]  accidents and flesh eating bacteria folks and you need to get this product.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:53.200]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.200]  now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:07.400]  a contribution, 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.960]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:16.320]  want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:21.000]  Hey, how would you like to take info wars with you wherever you go?
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.560]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official info wars and here's the best part.

[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:53.360]  The scientists at info wars life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.080]  and joint support.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:58.240]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:02.040]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.400]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:10.560]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:14.800]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:20.040]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.840]  so much more.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:26.280]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:32.040]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:38.040]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:40.880]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:47.880]  Buy bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:16.720]  America from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:18.240]  This is really important information.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:21.560]  You know the old wives' tales about silver bullets for werewolves, but in reality the
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:25.920]  elite ate off silver plates because they knew it was associated with being more healthy.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.400]  They put silver dollars in big things like buttermilk or milk that wanted to last longer
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.480]  back in frontier days because of its known antibiotic use.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:41.640]  But then I set out to get the very best healthy types of good silver in our immune gargle
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:49.080]  mouth washes, in our other systems like the mouthwash and so that's what we've done here
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.080]  with the super blue products at infowarslife.com.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.240]  I wanted to get Dr. Keith Molar on because let me explain something.
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:59.320]  Like you said, they sell the stuff that's in all the hospitals because I guess they
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.320]  want it even stronger.
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:04.760]  But he's saying the over-the-counter stuff is just as good or better and it's what, 24,
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:09.520]  they're 30 something and it's super silver, we're able to discount it because we private
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:11.880]  label it at infowarslife.com.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:18.640]  It's been FDA approved to be over the counter and so that's a big deal and it's key in this
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:19.640]  arsenal.
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:26.360]  So the time we have left, I want to thank you for coming on Dr. and just get more into
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:33.120]  why this is so important as it says it kills outdoor and odor-causing bacteria and yeast.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.640]  It goes after molds, I mean it goes after a whole bunch of stuff and you're saying there's
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.360]  no reviews yet because we just started selling it.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:40.720]  Well that's a five pack.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:41.720]  Let's show the single pack.
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:46.140]  There are, I think there should be some reviews for that now.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:50.440]  When you're sitting there looking at all of this, yeah, there is 92% reviews, 12 reviews.
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:53.960]  We just started selling it about a month ago.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.360]  When you look at this, I mean is this mainly something you put on your hands before you
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:04.800]  go out as a shield or is this something you can put on once you have the scratch or whatever?
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:10.520]  Well what you have is you have one of the only products in the U.S. that can like make
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.120]  a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:20.680]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about probably three or four minutes.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:25.320]  You can put it on things like coughs.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:28.160]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.800]  I had a little girl that was two years old that put her hand on a stove and she had a
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:40.040]  severe burn on her hand, a second degree burn, the whole hand blistered.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.880]  We donated products to the parents so that they could just use it because they didn't
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:48.200]  have what they needed at that time anyway.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:56.120]  So I sent them the stuff and in 28 days, instead of having skin grafts and all the stuff, we
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:01.120]  were able to help this little girl regrow all the tissue and it wasn't the shangiest
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  dry-aid scar tissue.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.480]  It was nice pink tissue and I thought, man, what a blessing to have something that you
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.760]  have in your house right now you can use.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.960]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this, but for all the stuff that happens,
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.360]  I mean, crap happened, you're going to get scraped, you're going to be caught, you're
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:21.360]  going to get scraped.
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:22.360]  Sure, let me ask you two quick questions.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.360]  I want to have you back for a full 30 minutes soon.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.160]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.080]  Why were hospitals with medical systems putting their noses up 20 years ago with silver?
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:30.080]  Now it's all the rage.
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.560]  They admit it's the best thing ever.
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:32.560]  A, why is that happening?
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.640]  And then B, why are we seeing bacteria getting more virulent?
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.640]  Is it the overuse of antibiotics?
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:46.920]  Yeah, so hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were causing them.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:52.240]  It was in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:57.040]  That's why they're going back to the silver products because our silver is proven to kill
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.040]  those.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:04.640]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are methicillin-resistant staff and one called BRE.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.640]  And BRE is vancomycin-resistant enterococcus focalis.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:12.440]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.000]  And so the cool part is this gel kills it in a minute.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.160]  So you don't have to worry about your kid getting an amputation on a wound or you don't
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:25.520]  have to have a funeral for somebody you love.
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:28.600]  And the bottom line is you guys get years and years and years and years and years and
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.280]  years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies and you finally found out the perfect
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:37.000]  silver, the most effective and it's available at infowarstore.com and you helped save the
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.480]  country and defeat the globalist, 361.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.280]  Everybody needs this in their arsenal.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.880]  Everybody needs this for their children.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:47.320]  Everybody needs this for themselves, especially working in a hospital where there's super
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.120]  silver wound-dressing gel at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.040]  Dr. Keith Muller, God bless you.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:55.040]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.040]  Great job.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:00.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:04.840]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:10.280]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:15.680]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:23.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:27.720]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.040]  in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:34.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:40.520]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:46.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:51.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:06:08.920]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:29.860]  So, here's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:35.380]  the board. I'm right again. I was the first domino. Wasn't hard to figure that out folks.
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:39.140]  That's what's frustrating. This is outrageously criminal. The president's saying he's about
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:44.100]  to act. He's taken some action. We need maximum pressure on Congress, maximum pressure on the
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:48.420]  White House, maximum pressure. Forget big tech. They think you're done. They're committed to
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:53.940]  stealing this election. They're going to have to be dealt with politically. I've got to add that
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:58.420]  to everything or they say I mean violence. It's unbelievable. They're such liars. Let's go ahead
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:05.140]  and go to Greg in Utah. Then we'll go to Nick in Florida and others. Greg, thanks for holding
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:10.500]  it on the air. Mr. Ellis Jones, how are you doing today? Man, I'm living in the middle of history.
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:13.460]  I'm not really worried about myself now. I'm worried about the whole country. I mean,
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:17.700]  I knew they'd start censoring, but almost all conservatives are either banned or shadow banned
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:24.020]  now. This is unbelievable. Well, we got bigger problems on our hands. Jerome Corsi was doxed
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:31.060]  last night. For folks that don't know what dox means, I guess let's get him on. You mean somebody
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:35.780]  gave out his address? Yes, his whole address, his phone number, everything.
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:44.580]  Well, there's a lot of that stuff going on. Yeah, I know. And I know who did it. And not only that,
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:49.780]  but I did a whole entire report on Robert Mueller under Operation Exposure.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:57.300]  Well, you're being a little bit cryptic here. It said you called in about Dorsey and Twitter.
[02:07:57.300 --> 02:08:01.700]  You want to get into that? I said, Jerome Corsi, I apologize.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:05.060]  It's all right. We're going to, we don't take a lot of calls anymore. We're trying to get back
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:07.540]  into it. It's going to take everybody working together. I appreciate your call, Greg.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:13.380]  You know, I'm a rice take calls and my callers were on topic. They had points to make.
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:18.420]  And I'm not mad. It's just, these are just kind of like, now if I say one subject
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:23.460]  and I say military, they're all great callers or, you know, whatever, but this is, this is great
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:27.700]  today, but it's, it's, it's a little bit of a train wreck. Nick in Florida, Nick here on the year.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:35.060]  Go ahead. All right. Well, I'm going to talk to that caller. This is just the way my phone
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:39.300]  system works. Thank you, Nick. We'll say bye-bye to you now. Okay, let's go to another caller
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:43.300]  here. I'm just going to go at the top here. Okay, we're not taking Nick now. Nick's going.
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:50.660]  In a minute or two, I'm going to go to Jacob. Okay. Let's flush all the calls. Kill the phone
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:57.620]  lines. Kill them. We're going to kill the lines. Just kill the lines because I'm not mad at anybody,
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:04.180]  but this is getting weird, man. It's like sometimes the calls are the very best in the
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:09.380]  universe on this show. And then other times it's not, it's like their name's wrong. The subject's
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:13.860]  not the clear. The phones don't sound good. They're not, you know, it's like they're having a private
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:18.500]  conversation with me and I've got to figure out myself what they're talking about. There's total
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:23.620]  censorship coming down. World government, they're trying to implode the economy. All this stuff's
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:27.300]  happening. I love all you to death. I'm asking, what do you think's going to happen the next 71
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:30.420]  days? You think they're going to stage a false flag? They're certainly hyping that we're all
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:38.420]  calling for violence when we're not. What do you think of Grassley, very respected and other big
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:43.380]  Republicans saying that Trump should remove sessions? Where do you think all this is going?
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:47.220]  Here's the toll free number. If you can call it back in, that's great. But so I know you're reset
[02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:57.700]  and I know you're there and I know you're ready to talk. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539 on that big
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:04.740]  raft of topics. That's a lot of topics. And I want to think, you know, that you've got something you
[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:09.780]  want to say about those things. The calls I can't take are, and I'm not mad at anybody is,
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:17.060]  this happened to somebody. I know who did it. And then they just kind of pause. And I'm just like,
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:25.460]  that's what goes on. And I'm not mad at anybody. I'm just like, there's so much going on. What are
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:31.060]  we going to do about the Democrats censoring everybody? What are we going to do about them
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:35.540]  totally shutting down freedom on the Internet and moving to China and Apple and Google,
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:39.380]  helping round up political dissidents? That's outrageous. What are we going to do about top
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:43.460]  Democrats everywhere saying they're going to censor everybody's free speech now?
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:47.540]  And shut down talk radio. It's all being announced.
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:56.580]  I mean, it just absolutely panics me that this is going on. And in fact, here's the subject.
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:11:01.140]  Listeners, what should we do about the Internet censorship and big tech? What should President
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:06.100]  Trump do? You know, I've sent off anti-trust letters. I've sent off all sorts of stuff. I got
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:10.340]  law firms ready to file lawsuits for free, but I realize that'll take time. And he's to be the
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:15.380]  president with executive orders and action and calling these groups out in Congress has to
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:21.460]  show and act like they know what's going on. The Democrats know America's awake. The deep
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:25.380]  state knows they've committed all these crimes. They want to bring in an authoritarianism. It's
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:31.140]  here. It's do or die for the country. We've got a real president that means well
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:36.980]  and is really trying to actually restart the economy. He's betting on you. He believes that
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:50.020]  if he restarts the economy. Anyways, getting back to what I was saying, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:56.180]  is that is that we have to get out of the trance. Most people are in a trance watching TV on their
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:01.220]  smartphones all day. Most people are real passive. They barely can talk. And we've gotten in this mode
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:06.660]  now where people need to wake up. You know why I've been taking off all these platforms? Because
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:12.020]  I'm saying wake up and they wanted to take me off first. So people would just think, oh, it's just
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:18.180]  Alex Jones. So let's take a phone call. I'm going to take a phone call from a man named Chris.
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:25.300]  I'm going to go to Chris right now. Chris, where are you calling from and what do you want to talk about?
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:36.500]  Am I on? God almighty, you are brother. Your name is Chris. Where are you calling from?
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:42.820]  Jesus. I'm calling from Washington, brother. Please, please just one caller one time.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:48.980]  Okay. So the internet censorship, please don't get upset. Go ahead. No, I love you. Just please go
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:57.300]  ahead. Okay. So censorship. I've been getting censored. You've been getting censored. Everybody's
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:03.380]  been getting censored horribly. Uh, I went down to bury a Cantwell where Corey Booker's event
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:08.020]  was that last night here in Tacoma. And I thought for sure it was going to censor me from going
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:12.020]  live, but they definitely censored me from going into the event after I paid for a ticket and
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:18.660]  everything. And I did live stream and I got kicked out. But, um, yeah, it was ridiculous. I don't
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:23.060]  know how they basically dox me or if they looked on social media and seen that I said I was going
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:28.020]  to go to that. Um, but yeah, I definitely got kicked out. Well, it's so awesome to hear your
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:32.820]  clean phone and you have a great point to make. And I apologize. I'm just being irritated with
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:37.940]  this phone system or the 22nd lag time it's got or whatever. I'm going to get an old fashioned phone
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:42.500]  system for myself in here where I'll see the calls and then I can take them because I know it's
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:47.140]  this digital thing. I don't like it. Uh, it's got, I mean, that's why I don't take calls. It drives me
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:51.060]  crazy. I mean, I should be good at taking calls decades ago when I had my own phone systems to
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:55.060]  do it myself. And I love the crew. I just don't know what's going on. I can't handle it. It's
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:58.580]  torture for me to do this because I don't know when there's going to be a caller there. I don't
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:02.740]  know if they're going to hear me. It's almost always a train wreck and it's horrible because the
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:08.180]  callers are such a good part of the show. You know, they're such an important part, but you
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:13.700]  absolutely right, sir. They, they take everybody and run you through a database with data mining
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:17.700]  off your name when you go to Democrat events to make sure they rigged those town halls.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:21.940]  They wouldn't let the conservative kids in after Parkland. They only and they gave everybody
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:26.180]  else questions that they were supposed to ask. So what was it like for you to see that? Well,
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:30.020]  at least you went out there and stood up and live streamed and you got the truth out. Tell us what
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:37.540]  happened. So I got there, they checked my bag and I had a, you know, I had like a selfie stick in
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:42.420]  there and a little tripod, just a little mini table one. And, uh, you know, I was just going to catch
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:46.420]  some of the footage and try and find a good time to say something. You know, I eventually obviously
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:50.980]  was going to get kicked out anyways. I mean, that was probably ultimately not, not the point, but I
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:56.100]  knew what had happened because I was going to, you know, say something, not anything too crazy, but
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:00.420]  but the bottom line is, you know, you got Tory Booker, race baiter there and Maria Cantwell,
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:06.580]  who a lot of people may not have heard of much, but, um, so they checked the bag for one upstairs
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:11.460]  and no big deal. And then I went up there and I found out I need to get in line to,
[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:16.180]  to register or whatever. So I went over there and stood in this big old long line
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:21.940]  and then I had to move down to another one after I went through that line to a guy that
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:25.140]  had a computer and he had to look at my ticket because I literally bought it like two hours
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:29.700]  earlier. I was like, okay, I got to buy a ticket. I got to be able to go in, you know, and, um,
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:35.060]  after he looked me up on that and handed me my table assignment and I had a little card in my
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:39.140]  hand, the table 50. So as I turned around there like, sir, sir, what'd you do with your bag?
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:43.540]  I'm like, okay, sit it down in the ballroom there or whatnot. And so when I'm in there,
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:50.100]  I got to get your bag, sir. So I got my bag and he, I'm following him. Well, while I'm following
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:56.340]  him, I'm lagging behind and I got two beers in one arm that I just bought. If you like alkaline

[02:19:56.260 --> 02:20:02.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:22.660]  Live, raw and unfiltered. It's the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:29.860]  All right, your phone calls are coming up next segment and if I blew up earlier,
[02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:32.660]  it's not at the callers. I'm going to be honest, I'm really stressed out.
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:38.180]  Not about them censoring me and all the lies. It's that the country is in deep trouble.
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:41.380]  It's coming back from the dead, but they're trying to throw the president out. They're
[02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:46.740]  preparing false flags. Trump's got to move against sessions. You've got this evil pope
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:52.260]  that Leo Zagami predicted five years before he was pope would be pope that used pedophilia to
[02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:56.580]  blackmail him in. I've been to Rome, that was Zagami. Zagami has been up, you know, working
[02:20:56.580 --> 02:21:00.740]  at the highest levels with Bertelskone and others. And he's really the permanent expert
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:06.260]  on this. And the word is they're saying he may resign anytime. He's tried the consolidation
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:09.780]  of the Catholic church. He's tried to kick the real Christians and Catholics out.
[02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:14.820]  I'm not here to demonize the Catholic church. It's a lot of good things and pro life, you know,
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:20.580]  pro family and things, but this new guy is a globalist pope. And so with all the pedophilia
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:24.260]  that's come out with all these top people covering it up, I want to talk about what
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:29.860]  Leo Zagami joining us from Rome thinks is about to be breaking next and happening next.
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:33.860]  There's nobody's got their pulse on it like Leo Zagami. Leo Zagami, thanks for coming on.
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:41.060]  Hello, Alex. It's good to be back with you even if in this age of censorship that is clearly
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:46.660]  manifesting because they want to shut us down and they don't want us to talk about these things.
[02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:52.900]  And one of the main topics, of course, of the moment is Pope Francis and the fact that he knew
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:59.380]  all along his papacy about cardinal mechanic and about many other scandals, but especially
[02:21:59.380 --> 02:22:08.100]  the fact that he's now been accused by Bigano, who is a top Vatican figure who was the highest
[02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:16.020]  levels of the Vatican and who was also the ambassador for the Vatican in Washington for a long time.
[02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:22.500]  It's an unprecedented thing that might push really the pope this time to resign. And we here
[02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:28.020]  at Infowars, as you know, Alex, were the first ones to talk about resignation of the pope.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:36.820]  And now there is also another situation that is unfolding because they are trying with pushing
[02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:43.940]  pressure both on Donald J. Trump on your side of the ocean and on Salvini, an interior minister
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:50.820]  with this new affair of this ship, the dichotty ship with his immigrants that finally yesterday
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:58.340]  the Vatican basically forced the Italian government to accept. In exchange, they picked up 100 of
[02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:05.220]  these immigrants. There were 177 on this ship, illegal immigrants, of course, that are now
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:11.700]  being taken care by the pope himself in a place called Rocca di Papa here near Rome.
[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:20.180]  He took 100 of these refugees because, of course, he wants to make the part of the good person
[02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:27.380]  against the interior minister, Salvini, who is instead being indicted, actually. He's being
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:34.420]  accused of keeping hostage on the ship these immigrants. So now the pope is coming back
[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:39.220]  from Ireland where he attended this world meeting of families where he just spent all his time
[02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:46.580]  apologizing on the scandals of pedophilia. And after this pedophilia scandals also that
[02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:56.180]  came out with the grand jury of Pennsylvania with this report, which is also totally unprecedented
[02:23:56.180 --> 02:24:03.860]  because we have details about things that are too shocking about what the clergy did and did not.
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:12.660]  But Vigano, this figure who is top figure in the Vatican, who is accusing the pope,
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:20.020]  he said that even Donald the War and others in the US Catholic Church knew all along
[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:27.300]  that McCarrick was a pedophile. And actually, Pope Ratzinger himself has already denounced him
[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:35.060]  because and had limited before the arrival of Pope Francis Cardinal McCarrick and limited even
[02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:41.300]  the places where he could go. He couldn't actually go out of his seminary. So when Pope Francis arrived
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:48.580]  instead, they raised the McCarrick. Let's be clear. The previous pope had him on house arrest,
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:53.620]  but then the new pope comes in and erases all this. His deputy's been busted in a secret trial
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:57.700]  over hundreds of traffic boys. Let's get to the bottom line. Do you think the pope is about to
[02:24:57.700 --> 02:25:02.820]  resign A and B? Explain to people how these pedophile networks work because if you're talking
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:08.180]  301 priests in Pennsylvania, that's most of the priests admitting they were raping little kids.
[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:12.900]  I mean, that means chances are if you're looking at five Catholic priests, two or three of them
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:18.180]  are pedophiles now. And again, it's other major institutions. It's public schools. It's colleges.
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:25.620]  It's Protestant groups. It's the liberals. The left, if I criticize the LGBT community,
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:28.740]  I've had the pedophile thing on the ink is now an ambulance part of that. They promote it.
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:34.100]  I'm now anti gay. If I say don't have access to kids, don't sexualize kids. I don't care if it's
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:39.700]  head of a sexual homosexual. Don't go into schools and talk about sex with kids when they're five
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:45.220]  years old. I mean, clearly there's an obsession in this global cult with children. Who runs it?
[02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:52.580]  Who is it? Because it's all being exposed. The Vatican has definitely been at the highest level
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:58.660]  of this global pedophile network that now Donald J. Trump is really fasting and fighting
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:04.340]  in an unprecedented way. So we are happy with what is going on because Trump is forcing the
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:11.140]  Catholic Church on in a corner now. And the pope might even resign. But at the moment,
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:18.180]  the Raymond Burke is very close to being a no and both of them as you know, Cardinal Burke,
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:23.300]  Raymond Burke is also very close to Donald J. Trump. So there is a direct involvement here
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:29.380]  of Trump in this Vatican affair because. Oh, let's be clear. Let's be clear. Clearly,
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:34.500]  this is a sign of a deep state war that from Brazil to the US to Italy to Australia,
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:38.020]  they're busting these people. And we said that what happened. That's what my sources said.
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:41.460]  Trump and others also, patriots in Europe are moving against this network.
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:48.980]  Well, yeah, sure. They are moving against this network. We have even nuns now that got arrested.
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:56.740]  That even a 93 year old nun in Scotland is investigated because of molesting children
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:02.100]  and making them eat their own vomit and participating to satanic rituals with nuns.
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:07.940]  And this is happening in Scotland just now. So it's not only happening with priest or with Cardinal
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:13.940]  Bishop. It's happening also with nuns. So the Catholic Church is deaf. Definitely has a problem
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:19.060]  because it's at the top of this hierarchy of pedophiles. Of course, we have also Anglicans.
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:26.740]  We have various Protestant churches involved. But the fact is that on top of this pedophile
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:32.340]  network, we have, of course, the royal families, the elite of the world. That's where I wanted
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:36.420]  to go next is I'm not giving the Catholic Church a pass. As you said, they're at the top of it.
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:42.100]  It's just that we can't limit it to that. It's this giant subterranean thing that's now being
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:47.540]  pushed. And I would say that it's a form of psychic vampirism. Whereas, you know, it's not
[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:51.620]  just sex. Sometimes they kill the children, eat the pituitary, drink the blood after they've been
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:56.180]  terrified. It goes back to the old Middle Ages and the black magic rituals, the things that
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:02.180]  were done that we know of. This is really going on. Yes. And I mean, now it's coming out because
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:08.500]  also in the grand jury report that was published in Pennsylvania, it's all over the place. The
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:16.100]  satanic practices of this priest. I mean, to sodomize a child made to kneel down with the seven-inch
[02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:23.380]  crucifix or acting satanic rituals around him, where they exchange this child amongst priests.
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:29.220]  I mean, this is a sick and deviant church. It's actually a satanic church. And so we need...
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:33.380]  Let's come back a new five more minutes and I promise the calls. This is the key. Hiding in
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:37.380]  plain view in the Pennsylvania papers and the indictment is, and then they'd make them read out
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:41.300]  of the Bible while they had sex with them. Then they do this with crosses and they do that with
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:49.060]  blood. They're doing satanic rituals in pentagrams in the church. This is what satanists do. It's
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:56.340]  called blasphemy and the satanists have taken over the Catholic church. Most of you know that

[02:32:54.900 --> 02:33:06.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:23.460]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:43.780]  I want to explain something before we go back to Leo Zagami and then take your phone calls and I
[02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:49.860]  appreciate everybody calling in. I grew up reading a lot of history books. This is my parents were
[02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:53.620]  into history. My mom had a degree in history and they didn't let us have a lot of television.
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.380]  And I learned about how ancient cultures operate and that every ancient culture had child
[02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:06.260]  sacrifice at one time or another during their decline periods. And then as we're getting to politics like
[02:34:06.260 --> 02:34:11.300]  26 years ago, a couple years ago on air, I would talk to people that have been in military intelligence
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:16.100]  and wealthy people and you name it and they'd say, no, no, no. At the top, it's all a cult. And I'm
[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:19.540]  like, you know, that's funny. When I went to a few years of high school in Dallas, then I came down
[02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:24.820]  here, did the senior cult stuff. But in Dallas, we lived in the richest county in Texas. And, you
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:30.340]  know, we were poor folks, a pair of the billionaires that lived out there. And man, you'd scratch the
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:37.060]  paint on something, it'd be a satanic operation or Luciferian sex cult, you name it. And I was
[02:34:37.060 --> 02:34:43.780]  never involved in it, but I certainly ran into it. And I certainly saw stuff you'd only think you
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:47.940]  see in movies, people out in the middle of a field at night, you know, in black robes, you know,
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:53.140]  having sex with a woman up on an altar. I mean, I've seen stuff like that with these two eyeballs,
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:35:00.260]  okay? And that's what goes on. And if you look at the Catholic Church and all this, it's been,
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:08.900]  whenever it happened, totally taken over by this. And it's a fact and it's back and they use it for
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:15.460]  control. It's the currency of the realm. And if you read what went on at Penn State, and with
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:19.300]  the priests and not just the college, they had houses where they took disadvantaged children
[02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:24.580]  that had already been raped before. And then they would take them for celebrities to come visit with
[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:29.060]  them and help them with their problem. And the truth was they were just child sex slaves. And
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:35.060]  that's all come out. And I mean, and that's why I said Mueller, carried up, carried up, covered up
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:39.140]  for Jeffrey Epstein on Alita Express, hundreds of flights with politicians and people on it,
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:45.380]  everybody from Kevin Spacey to, you know, folks like the monster Harvey Weinstein,
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:50.260]  with underage boys, girls, you name it. And that's what they do. Bill Clinton 26 flights we know of.
[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:54.740]  Secret Service says it's over the top bad. And the average person goes, that can't be real. That's
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:58.980]  because you're not demon possessed or whatever it is. Whatever's in these people wants to hurt
[02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:04.660]  innocence. They are sucking energy. They believe defiling the child, taking their innocence,
[02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:10.020]  doing this to them. They give energy and they're sucking energy to form a vampirism.
[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:13.380]  Now, whether you believe that or not, when it gets to the British royal family level,
[02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:17.780]  this is documented, they kill kids and eat their pituitaries. The Queen of England and her mother
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:22.420]  get whole, before she died, whole blood transfusions from children. That's in the news. They say,
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:25.700]  Oh, certain families volunteer their kids, give the blood for the Queen mother.
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:31.300]  And then you can't make it up. They're the house of Dracula. Prince Charles just moved back there
[02:36:31.300 --> 02:36:34.980]  half the year. They're the direct bloodline of the Austrian and Hungarian Empire. They're not
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:40.180]  even German royalty. So finishing up, Leo, I appreciate you coming on. You talk about this,
[02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:44.420]  we're not just being sensational. And this is what they don't want us talking about on air.
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:48.420]  This is one of the things I've been told, not just the pedophilia, but what's below that
[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:52.340]  is the torture and the killing of children. We know what they've caught them all over Europe,
[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:56.420]  the judges, the politicians, they have fine old torture dungeons with a bunch of dead babies,
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:37:02.340]  toddlers and cages. And it all just gets quieted down. And finally, there's a move in the world
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:06.980]  against this. And when you see CNN and others make fun of me and say, Jones claims there's pedophile
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:13.060]  rings where they're being busted, think about it. They're defending that. These people will do
[02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:16.660]  anything. And I'll tell you right now, when you look at these people, don't put anybody on screen.
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:22.420]  But people figure it out themselves. When you look at a lot of people, especially CNN or MSNBC,
[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:32.660]  these people are in the cult like James Gunn in the cult folks. And again, a lot of them are just
[02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:37.620]  procures. A lot of them are just aware of it. A lot of them are around while it's going on.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:44.420]  And they celebrate the upper caste that the vampires, the Dracula's, the Wrenfields celebrate
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:48.820]  Dracula. And that's, I give the analogy of that because that's what Ram Stoker was giving the
[02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:53.940]  allegory of five minutes left. I really appreciate your work. Leo Zagami will put your website up
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:59.140]  on screen. Tell me about your books. That's Leo Zagami.com. But I mean, am I accurate in this?
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:03.540]  Because you've been in the P2 Lodge. You've been in the secret societies. You've been in it all
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:08.340]  over there. I've been in the Vatican with you. Obviously, I mean, you've been an insider,
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:11.380]  and you've gone public against it as a Christian. But at the end of the day,
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:14.180]  is not the world cult a group of spiritual vampires?
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:22.900]  Absolutely. Spiritual and energetic vampires. We really need Alex to support Archbishop
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:30.260]  Carlo Maria Vigano, who has made this bold move with this 11 page statement to ask the
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:36.100]  resignation of Pope Francis. We really need to support him because behind him, of course,
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:42.820]  there is also Trump, but there's also all those Catholics that are fed up with a religion which
[02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:50.020]  is being disfigured, manipulated by Pope Francis. And that is evidently and obviously
[02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:54.740]  corrupted by pedophilia, left, right, and center. And Pope Francis knew it. Now,
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:39:00.020]  it's the first time, Alex, that the Pope got actually cornered on the plane coming back
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:06.340]  from Dublin. He said, well, I have read the accusations of Carlo Maria Vigano.
[02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:15.300]  You make your own decisions about it. I will not say anything more. Now, this is a very unusual
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:22.900]  statement. He was actually admitting that the accusation is true. But then he invited the
[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:27.540]  journalists to make their own decision. Well, everybody here in Italy around the world is
[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:33.860]  demanding for the Pope's resignation. And this time is because of a direct involvement with a
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:42.100]  cover up of a case of pedophilia. So I mean, we can't make this up. This is true. And of course,
[02:39:42.100 --> 02:39:49.220]  they wanted us off the major social networks. They wanted us censored before all this was
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:56.100]  coming out into light. And that's why they want to get Donald Trump out of the way. And they want
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:40:02.900]  to impeach him with all this rubbish, mule and all this investigation. This is the point of it all
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:10.180]  is that the Jesuits have always commanded in the United States of America. And if now, for example,
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:22.340]  only in one state in Minnesota, in St. Louis, I mean, I really can't say more, Alex. I'm just
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:30.260]  so disappointed that the major media are not now are starting against Carlo Maria Vigano.
[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:35.620]  They are saying that this guy is not serious here in Italy. They are saying, of course,
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:42.100]  they are downplaying the accusation. So we need instead to say, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano
[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:47.860]  is a hero because he's a let's be clear, they're criticizing in the media, bishops and people
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:52.180]  that say, no, the pedophilia is real, it needs to stop. So that shows you who's on what side.
[02:40:53.300 --> 02:41:00.100]  Absolutely, absolutely. And as I said, this is also a case is the beginning that could become
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:05.940]  also impossible for the Catholic state to manage future payments all across the United States of
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:13.860]  America. Because if they start giving 500 million here, 500 million in another state and a billion
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:18.900]  here and a billion there, in the end, the Catholic Church will have to sell or their belongings,
[02:41:18.900 --> 02:41:23.460]  everything they have in the United States and close down the whole thing. I mean, this is the
[02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:29.940]  level that we are living. But they can't help it because these psychic energetic vampires
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:37.060]  they must feed. And what percentage would you say of the hierarchy of the church are actually raping
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:50.420]  children? I think that 70% 70% children, then of course, you have a lot of homosexuals that
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:58.260]  are not necessarily pedophiles. But I think that we are over well over 50% sure they use
[02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:02.500]  that as the first level of compromise. That's why I'm not against anybody that's gay or whatever.
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:07.940]  But then the LGBT community for pedophile community, not saying the whole LGBT is like that, but
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:12.020]  that now the ones that attack me want to talk about pedophilia say you're being anti gay because
[02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:17.780]  they're sexualizing kids. I'm like, whoa, this is all going to come out. So, you know, it's amazing
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:22.820]  to see how if you stand up against pedophilia, you get the LGBT community coming after you
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:29.140]  and lying about you. And it's very upsetting. Well, we can see that James Martin in this
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:36.340]  Jesuit is a prominent also defender of the LGBT community. I was authorized to talk in
[02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:42.580]  Ireland for the whole meeting of families. So I mean, this happened today, Alex. Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:47.300]  And these people just recurring children for rape as young as two years of age. Thank you,
[02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:50.900]  Leo Zagami. Leo Zagami.com. We'll talk to you again soon as this unfolds. Phone calls three
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:58.500]  minutes away. Stay with us. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:04.020]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us
[02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:08.660]  through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic
[02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:14.740]  Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:18.660]  nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:24.340]  info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:29.940]  over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:34.100]  as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family and you owe it to the
[02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:39.860]  future of this country in the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:45.540]  you can be because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next
[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:49.620]  level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:55.140]  together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield, infowarslife.com.
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:44:00.580]  We knew it was coming. The whole thing was for me leg. First demonize info wars, lie about us,
[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:06.340]  build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube
[02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:12.260]  and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia. And then voila,
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:19.220]  two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in

[02:46:55.620 --> 02:47:08.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:40.180]  You know, I saw a PSA this weekend when I was watching one of the clips of Owen Schreuer
[02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:45.380]  and Roger Stone last week on the War Room that I'd missed. Something that the White House had put
[02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:52.260]  out that was very, very touching. And the name of the video is at WhiteHouse.gov. But the name is
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:59.620]  that I got separated from my family forever. And that's because you've got Pocahontas and you've
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:05.380]  got a talk show host on MSNBC and CNN saying big deal. You got this woman killed by an illegal
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:09.700]  alien or this lady shot in the back or this woman kidnapped or, you know, there's a lot of crime
[02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:13.220]  coming up out of Latin America and other parts of the world. A lot of people fleeing justice.
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:18.020]  You know, the real problems, kids being separated from their parents, something that started decades
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:22.820]  ago, most of these kids show up unaccountable without adults. You don't just throw them in
[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:28.900]  general population. In fact, it was actually the ACLU 20 years ago that got it where they
[02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:33.540]  started splitting them up because some of the kids were being sexually abused.
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:40.020]  But the media knows how to lie and they know how to manipulate and still people walk to
[02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:44.740]  the street and they go, how dare you? I've always found one from my phone to shoot video and they're
[02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:48.420]  like, I'm like, what have I done wrong? They go, well, you're mean to Sandy Hook and you're mean to
[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:53.460]  the kids at the border and just none of it's true. And so they just come back with that like
[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:59.940]  that's what they're for. But the Democrats want to be able to abort you before you get born.
[02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:07.140]  Then once you get born, they want you on as much Prozac and Ritalin and Aspartame and GMO and MSG
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:15.940]  and fluoride as they can. And it's just a six, six, six, six group of people. So here's that
[02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:21.220]  piece that the White House put out, I thought was important to play here at us. We were permanently
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:27.380]  separated, not just for a week or a month. I was at home when I got the phone call from the hospital.
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:33.780]  He was hit head on by a repeat illegal alien criminal. Known gang member came in the back and
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:40.580]  he fired the gun and struck my son in the arm. Trying to get away, he drove over my son's body.
[02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:46.580]  He backed up driving over him a second time. Rear ended his estimated 62 mile an hour.
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:50.900]  He strangled him and let him go to see if he was breathing. Strangled him over and over and over
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:57.860]  until death. And he dragged Matthew a quarter of a mile to his death. He rear ended her killing her.
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:05.060]  He went to a field and put Josh out and the gasoline one and let him on fire. Previously
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:09.700]  deported about a year and a half to two years before. This man wasn't supposed to be here.
[02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:15.540]  My separation. My separation. My separation. My separation. My separation. My separation. My
[02:50:15.540 --> 02:50:22.260]  separation is permanent. Permanent. Permanent. Permanent. Permanent. Permanent. Our separation
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:31.220]  is permanent.
[02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:35.540]  And it's great to see something like that put up at the White House, personalizing what's
[02:50:35.540 --> 02:50:41.620]  happening because the idea that citizens can get killed, tortured, murdered and that's okay.
[02:50:41.620 --> 02:50:47.620]  And then MS-13 does satanic rituals. Look it up. They call it gang rituals where they torture
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:57.780]  little girls and little boys to get power from Diablo. El Diablo. And then Nancy Pelosi says
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:05.060]  they're God's children in all this insanity. You feel that the devil is helping you MS-13.
[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:13.940]  When you do these bad horrible things, it's an energy. It's a vampirism. And we have legends for
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:17.620]  what's happened in every culture. The Greeks thought there were vampires. The Japanese thought
[02:51:17.620 --> 02:51:23.700]  there were vampires. The ancient African cultures. The Greeks would have hunting once a year
[02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:28.580]  in the hillsides and things quote to kill vampires.
[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:36.500]  Every culture thought because there were crazy people that wanted to kidnap and murder people
[02:51:36.500 --> 02:51:40.260]  and drink their blood statistically in a certain percentage of the population.
[02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:47.620]  Well, now they just get in control. And if you look at Jeffrey Dahmer, any of these guys, they
[02:51:47.620 --> 02:51:52.900]  tell you they were doing it for the devil. Charlie Manson. But then the news never picks that up.
[02:51:52.900 --> 02:51:57.780]  And I just keep going back to what we're fighting here. I said I'd take calls. We've had a phone
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:02.740]  system issue, but I'm going to get back into calls. I used to take calls, used to love calls.
[02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:06.420]  When I say first time callers and go to callers quickly, we have great calls when I just kind
[02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:10.020]  of give the number. I'll make sure they're an hour folks are away from the phone or whatever. And it's
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:14.820]  just not good. But I really do want to open the phones up tomorrow at the start of the broadcast,
[02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:19.540]  specifically for first time callers on what do you think 70 days out tomorrow is going to happen
[02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:24.340]  in the midterms? Do you have the concern in your gut that I do? Are you upset like I am? Because
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:27.060]  all the reason I'm upset on air is I've been working seven days a week and
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:32.340]  I'm not mad that we're being deplatformed. I'm mad that they've deplatformed everybody basically
[02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:38.260]  now with shadow bands and it's not a bigger deal. And then conservative sites go, is Trump right
[02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:43.860]  that millions are being censored? I mean, get with the program, man. God almighty.
[02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:50.340]  I mean, you talk about Nairduel scum over at Buzzfeed that teach people that milk is racist
[02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:56.900]  because it's white. And just all the crap these people pull, we shouldn't be ruled by this trash
[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:03.380]  at the New York Times and CNN that has a will to try to dominate
[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:13.540]  and run our lives. There's a clip right here. I want to play Roger Stone. Trump has to make his move.
[02:53:16.180 --> 02:53:22.820]  And I think that's what this all comes down to is that Trump has to make his move
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:27.780]  because they're going to make their move on him in America. And he's got all the cards right now,
[02:53:27.780 --> 02:53:32.740]  but in 70 days, he won't have all the cards if they steal that midterm. And all intents and purposes,
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:38.980]  they're going to try it. So far too many conservatives and patriots are in a coma right now
[02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:43.380]  because they think, oh, Trump got in and the economy's better. And I get Trump wanted to get the economy
[02:53:43.380 --> 02:53:47.540]  better to show that he's a faithful president, show that the suppression of the economy was
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:56.260]  suppression of the economy was artificial. But this is the real war.
[02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:01.380]  And think how far we've come and we've gotten the president to talk about it and take action against
[02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:08.420]  Facebook with the Unfair Housing Act. But that's not enough. This is a clear and present danger.
[02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:12.660]  Hyping up that we're going to be violent to the media and lying about it. That means they're going
[02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:20.260]  to do it. And so I'm asking you, what do you think we should do? Are you watching your area?
[02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:24.500]  Are you focused? Here's a key clip from Roger Stone boiling it down yesterday.
[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:41.140]  Even prior to the appointment of Mueller by Rod Rosenstein, in this matter, the acting
[02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:47.220]  attorney general, he and then White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus put a piece of paper in
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:52.900]  front of the president for his signature telling him it was a housekeeping matter which changed
[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:59.540]  the line of succession, the transfer of power at the Justice Department under this president.
[02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:07.700]  So after Attorney General Sessions, power then flows to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:14.660]  Then instead of flowing to the Solicitor General, who has always been third in command under previous
[02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:23.300]  administrations, it goes to a U.S. Attorney in Texas, then a U.S. Attorney in D.C., and then a U.S.
[02:55:23.300 --> 02:55:30.580]  Attorney in North Carolina. Now, not surprisingly, those three individuals are reliable, deep state
[02:55:30.580 --> 02:55:36.340]  Bush Republicans. So the president made to clean house in his own Justice Department and to get
[02:55:36.340 --> 02:55:42.420]  control of this rogue investigation, which is most interested in the activities of Mr. Cohn,
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:47.860]  but has no interest in the activities of Hillary Clinton laundering money through a law firm to
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:55.140]  pay for that fake dossier that is then used as the illegitimate basis for surveillance of the
[02:55:55.140 --> 02:56:01.300]  Trump campaign, the president may have to fire for deep into his Justice Department.
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:04.740]  Trump has everybody support now. He must move decisively now.
[02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:12.660]  I could not agree more because they are moving on his family. The president needs now to nationalize
[02:56:12.660 --> 02:56:19.620]  this question. He should fire Mr. Sessions. He should fire Mr. Rosenstein. He should fire as
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:24.580]  far deep as he needs to to get an attorney general who is both loyal and committed to the rule of
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:31.380]  law. He then needs to discharge Mr. Mueller because his investigation has been entirely biased and
[02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:38.820]  one-sided. He doesn't want to look into the massive corruption of either Obama and Hillary or their
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:41.380]  abuse of the process or their unconstitution.
[02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:43.460]  Or his own uranium tarmac meetings.
[02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:49.780]  While he's covering up his own crimes in numerous areas, the deep state is making their move.
[02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:54.500]  The surging economy bothers them because they know as the economy gets stronger,
[02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:57.860]  it will be much tougher to remove the president.
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:01.780]  People get in. I think that's why the Democrats are so panicked. They're going to try to steal
[02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:08.180]  this election is because they know that the realignment has happened, my friend.
[02:57:08.180 --> 02:57:11.460]  The realignment has happened and they are totally panicked.
[02:57:11.460 --> 02:57:17.540]  The Democrats don't really want to run on impeachment because their own polling shows it's a loser.
[02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:23.140]  But they're planning to put enough criminal pressure on Trump's family and associates
[02:57:23.140 --> 02:57:27.940]  to push the 25th amendment. That is the plan announced last Friday on Bill Maher with the
[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:33.620]  trader Brennan. All right, coming up ladies and gentlemen, Ali Alexander always on fire.
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:38.020]  Then the war room and so much more. Whatever you do realize, we're trying as hard as we can.
[02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:42.580]  We've got a fighting chance to turn this around but we've got to keep our heads in the game.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:45.460]  Thank you all for what you do. Thank you all for your support. Great job, the crew.

[02:59:42.980 --> 02:59:58.900]  being part of the second American revolution. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:58.900 --> 03:00:17.380]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:29.540]  Welcome. Last hour of the Alex Jones show here on info wars.com. You can't find us anymore on
[03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:35.140]  YouTube or on Facebook, but you can find us on periscope and info wars.com. And there's the app,
[03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:41.060]  the ever popular app now on the Android and Apple store. I am Ali Alexander. I will be
[03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:46.180]  guest hosting and we're going to do a deep dive into the Mueller probe. I'm actually going to explain
[03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:51.460]  how the Mueller mandate has turned into malicious prosecution. We're going to have a good friend
[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:57.140]  of mine, Ron Coleman. He is the constitutional lawyer who took the Asian band, the Asian rock band,
[03:00:57.140 --> 03:01:01.460]  the slants all the way to Supreme Court and won on the issue of free speech. We're going to
[03:01:01.460 --> 03:01:08.900]  ask Ron, is my gut right? Is Mueller violating the civil rights of 65 million plus Americans?
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:14.420]  Or is this a conspiracy theory, as our critics will say? And then it's been a while since we've
[03:01:14.420 --> 03:01:21.540]  taken calls. It's always an honor to fill this slot for Alex and his team. And now I've got my
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:26.740]  team, Cole and Jesse. And so I think that what we'll do is we'll take calls for the second half,
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:30.980]  the last half of this hour. And I can't wait to talk to you all about anything that you want to
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:35.620]  talk about. So we'll be giving that number here shortly. And I want you guys to call in early
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:39.860]  if you want to reserve your spot because as we know, whenever Ali Alexander is on,
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:44.020]  there's a lot of colors. So let's jump right into it. I want the info wars team to first play
[03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:48.500]  a video. This is, I call it a memo to the president. The White House is very familiar with my work.
[03:01:48.500 --> 03:01:52.820]  I work with them on a number of issues like Silicon Valley censorship. But this video,
[03:01:52.820 --> 03:01:57.220]  I don't normally do videos like this, but I put this video out on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook.
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:02:01.940]  And we're going to play this two minute video of why, what I think,
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:04.980]  what are three steps the president can take right now? So let's roll that.
[03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:10.500]  Mr. President, as one of your supporters who asked for an outside investigation to be given
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:14.980]  time so that we could root out those who interfered with the 2016 election,
[03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:20.020]  I'm disappointed to report, I'm dead wrong. Whereas we were supposed to have a counter
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:24.820]  intelligence investigation that turned independent. Now we have a phishing expedition that seeks to
[03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:29.700]  accomplish what looks like two goals. First, Trump up charges against your supporters,
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:35.460]  and two, more legitimize a flimsy case for impeachment against the duly elected president
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:40.580]  yourself. Mr. President, these are the three steps that you can take immediately to ensure
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:46.740]  our national sovereignty. First, pardon General Flynn. Secondly, once Paul Manafort has been
[03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:52.660]  sentenced, commute that sentence. Third, establish a war room and now bring the Mueller investigation
[03:02:52.660 --> 03:02:58.580]  back inside the DOJ where it is traditionally housed and it can be held accountable to Congress
[03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:03.940]  and we the people. After all, Mr. President, you and the Attorney General are no longer
[03:03:03.940 --> 03:03:09.620]  implicated with any ties to Russia. There's no question, you two officials must
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:14.420]  unrecuse yourselves and bring the Mueller investigation back inside the DOJ.
[03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:22.340]  Look, I'm serious. I'm dead serious. Pardon General Flynn. He was pursued maliciously.
[03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:26.260]  They found charge that had nothing to do with the Russian investigation,
[03:03:26.260 --> 03:03:31.460]  nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with civil rights abuses or nefarious deeds.
[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:36.420]  He didn't report something and he's alleged to have lied and it looks like it was actually
[03:03:36.420 --> 03:03:41.140]  entrapment. And if it was entrapment, then Jeff Sessions needs to absolutely prosecute
[03:03:41.140 --> 03:03:46.340]  those people in the DOJ like Bruce Orr, Peter Struck and other people who entrap General Flynn.
[03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:52.740]  But I want General Flynn pardon. I want Paul Manafort who did violate the law absolutely.
[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:59.140]  I want him commuted. And then I want Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump to get before the nation
[03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:05.220]  on a 9 p.m. address and say, James Comey and Bob Mueller have told us that we are no longer
[03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:10.980]  subjects of this investigation. As such, and you're duly elected representatives,
[03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:16.260]  we're bringing this investigation back in-house. Thank you, Bob Mueller, for doing your job.
[03:04:16.260 --> 03:04:21.060]  Thank you so much. I think that that's what the president needs to do. I think that you all,
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:26.740]  on Facebook, on YouTube, on Paris, on Twitter, need to share this message. It's so important
[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:31.220]  that we show the president that we're behind him. It's not going to hurt midterm turnout,
[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:37.220]  that we want our duly elected constitutional republic back. Absolutely. When we come back
[03:04:37.220 --> 03:04:42.260]  after the break, we're going to read the Rosenstein memo to Mueller. What is Mueller's mandate?
[03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:57.140]  And was it always baked into the cake? We'll be back right after this sponsored ad.

[03:06:23.060 --> 03:06:31.380]  Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to InfoWars.com. You're listening
[03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:37.060]  to the Alex Jones show. I am the guest for the rest of this hour. Ali Alexander. You can find
[03:06:37.060 --> 03:06:44.740]  me at twitter.com slash ALI on Patreon, YouTube, Facebook, all of them. But who knows? It's said
[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:49.940]  that once you appear on InfoWars enough, you get banned from social media. So maybe they'll take
[03:06:49.940 --> 03:06:55.220]  me out. They don't like black conservatives. They don't like black conservatives with Arab
[03:06:55.220 --> 03:07:00.340]  sounding names. And they don't like articulate black conservatives with Arab names. I think we
[03:07:00.340 --> 03:07:06.180]  just hit the trifecta and we're going to get banned from social media. But going back to Mueller book,
[03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:12.740]  it is my, I wanted the president to give Bob Mueller and the DOJ an opportunity to do whatever
[03:07:12.740 --> 03:07:18.420]  they needed to do, assuming that it would not interfere with the next election. But guess what?
[03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:23.540]  Labor Day, which happens to me, my birthday is going to be the kickoff for campaign season.
[03:07:23.540 --> 03:07:28.980]  And if Mueller is still conducting his investigation, it hangs over the head of the Republican Party,
[03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:34.100]  this false meme from cable news that we colluded with Russia to seal the election.
[03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:39.060]  Now, mind you, the intelligence community has said that the outcome of the election
[03:07:39.060 --> 03:07:44.500]  did, would not have changed with or without minor interference from several state parties,
[03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:48.580]  but all the attention is on Russia. So we know that this didn't change the outcome,
[03:07:48.580 --> 03:07:52.260]  but Bob Mueller's investigation could hurt Republican turnout.
[03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:56.820]  Principally, it could hurt the Republican suburb, soft conservative turnout.
[03:07:56.820 --> 03:08:02.980]  What I want to go to is the memo. This memo from Rosenstein to Mueller, which establishes,
[03:08:02.980 --> 03:08:07.300]  I call it the Mueller mandate, kind of bakes into it that I was always wrong,
[03:08:07.300 --> 03:08:12.260]  that I never should have given Bob Mueller an opportunity, that Donald Trump's first instincts
[03:08:12.260 --> 03:08:16.900]  were correct. So let's throw that document up on the air for the viewers to read with us.
[03:08:16.900 --> 03:08:22.660]  I'm going to read a very crucial section of this document, okay? So this is subpoint B.
[03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:28.340]  This is Rod Rosenstein writing this. He's the acting attorney general because
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:32.260]  Jeff Sessions had recused himself and he's number two. It says,
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:38.820]  the special counsel is authorized to conduct the investigation confirmed by then FBI Director James
[03:08:38.820 --> 03:08:45.380]  B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20th,
[03:08:45.380 --> 03:08:50.180]  2017, including, and here are the three subpoints. These are very, very crucial.
[03:08:50.820 --> 03:08:55.860]  This is the one everyone knows about. One, any links and or coordination between the Russian
[03:08:55.860 --> 03:09:00.580]  government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:05.380]  So not everybody, not the Hillary campaign, not the NRA, not anybody else,
[03:09:05.380 --> 03:09:10.900]  just the Donald Trump campaign. Now this seems reasonable. The second point is the point that
[03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:18.660]  was baked corruption into the cake. Two, any matters that arose or may arise directly from
[03:09:18.660 --> 03:09:24.660]  the investigation. Wow. And we're going to talk with Ron, the constitutional lawyer of how open,
[03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:32.260]  how open of a field that is. And then lastly, any matters within the scope of 28 CFR, etc., etc.
[03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:37.540]  Now here, think about this. What happens, I'm going to take you back to the OJ trial, okay?
[03:09:37.540 --> 03:09:42.020]  I don't want to date myself. I'm not that old. I watched it in elementary. But essentially,
[03:09:42.020 --> 03:09:47.220]  look, you pulled whites and they said OJ was guilty. You pulled blacks and they said OJ was
[03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:51.940]  innocent. It actually turns out if you believe in the rule of law, if you believe we have a legal
[03:09:51.940 --> 03:09:57.860]  system and not a justice system, then the blacks were right. OJ was not guilty because the police
[03:09:57.860 --> 03:10:02.660]  there acted as a thug unit instead of law enforcers. And when they collected evidence,
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:07.140]  they collected it improperly. Some would go further and say that they actually planted
[03:10:07.140 --> 03:10:12.180]  some of that evidence. And OJ got off because there wasn't enough evidence to convict him
[03:10:12.180 --> 03:10:16.980]  beyond a reasonable doubt. So now imagine you go into the OJ trial with this mandate,
[03:10:16.980 --> 03:10:24.500]  the Mueller mandate says, well, we're going to investigate OJ Simpson for this crime.
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:29.220]  But if we find anything else, it's going to be admissible and we'll prosecute them.
[03:10:29.220 --> 03:10:35.140]  We live in an over-criminalized country. Of course, not everyone dots their eyes and crosses
[03:10:35.140 --> 03:10:41.620]  their teeth. This is why intent matters. And lawyers get disbarred all the time
[03:10:42.180 --> 03:10:46.580]  for malicious prosecution. I want people to Google this term. This isn't a term that we're
[03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:52.340]  making up here on info wars. This isn't a conspiracy term. This is a tenant inside of
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:58.340]  common law, inside of the American legal system that says if a prosecutor turns into a thug,
[03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:03.300]  we're going to let the guilty off because it is better to live in a world where innocent people
[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:08.260]  aren't prosecuted if we are letting one or two guilty people off. That's the world that we have
[03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:12.820]  chosen to construct. That is the legal system we have chosen to corrupt. So it's always been
[03:11:12.820 --> 03:11:18.100]  baked into it. Think about it. There aren't collusion charges or meddling charges or criminal
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:23.220]  conspiracy charges or sedition charges or treason charges against Manafort,
[03:11:23.220 --> 03:11:30.580]  Papadopoulos, Flynn, or even Cohen, this stupid lawyer, this really, really stupid lawyer.
[03:11:30.580 --> 03:11:35.540]  If Donald Trump is guilty of anything, it's valuing loyalty over competence and it's being
[03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:40.820]  a little bit of a cheap state escape. And so I think that the Mueller mandate has always had
[03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:46.580]  baked into it. We're about to bring my friend Ron on a little bit early. But I think that the
[03:11:46.580 --> 03:11:53.380]  Mueller mandate was always going to lead to malicious prosecution.
[03:11:53.380 --> 03:11:59.060]  And I was not wise enough to see this last year. But I will tell you, Donald Trump was furious
[03:11:59.060 --> 03:12:05.460]  Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve when it became apparent that Bob Mueller, who otherwise has conducted
[03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:08.980]  himself as a patriot, others would argue. Some would say, well, you got to look at Boston,
[03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:13.940]  you got to look at 9-11. The guy doesn't have a stellar record, but the guy has
[03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:18.820]  done things that have benefited our country. But it looks like now he hopes to tip the scale.
[03:12:18.820 --> 03:12:23.460]  It's the only good cop in town syndrome. Well, what I got to do is punish the Republicans to
[03:12:23.460 --> 03:12:27.860]  add balance back into it and let instead of you the people, we the people choosing.
[03:12:27.860 --> 03:12:32.820]  So let's bring on my friend Ron Coleman. Ron Coleman is a constitutional lawyer.
[03:12:32.820 --> 03:12:36.740]  He has been there for bloggers, conservatives. He's has been there for the Asian rock band,
[03:12:36.740 --> 03:12:41.700]  The Slants. He has won time and time again. Ron, how are you doing this Monday?
[03:12:41.700 --> 03:12:43.780]  Ron Coleman Pretty good. Thanks, Ali. How are you?
[03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:46.740]  Ali Karpak You know, I'm excited to be doing
[03:12:46.740 --> 03:12:50.580]  Infowords again. You know, we're not supposed to touch this third rail. So I thought, you know,
[03:12:50.580 --> 03:12:54.180]  I'm going to bring my friend Ron down with me. We're all going to suffer together.
[03:12:54.180 --> 03:12:55.700]  So I'm really excited. Ron Coleman
[03:12:55.700 --> 03:12:58.900]  You know, if we don't hang together, we will almost assuredly hang separately.
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:00.820]  So we may as well get together now. Ali Karpak
[03:13:00.820 --> 03:13:04.820]  Yeah. And you know what, Ron? You know, I really want to talk about this Mueller stuff,
[03:13:04.820 --> 03:13:09.940]  but free association is important, not in my opinion, not just in, okay, well,
[03:13:09.940 --> 03:13:16.980]  I don't believe Alex Jones should be banned. But what if Alex and I agree on something?
[03:13:16.980 --> 03:13:22.340]  Why should we not in that limited context be able to share a stage, to share a platform?
[03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:26.420]  You know, why are we living this schizophrenic ADHD culture where,
[03:13:26.420 --> 03:13:28.980]  you know, you appearing with me means you endorse all of my views.
[03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:31.540]  Ron Coleman Yeah, it's crazy. It's almost impossible
[03:13:31.540 --> 03:13:35.380]  to live that way. Certainly in terms of the, you know, you have all this nonsense with people
[03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:40.820]  wanting to boycott this person because they're an advertiser or they refuse to not be an advertiser.
[03:13:40.820 --> 03:13:46.500]  The world is immensely interconnected and complex today. And the suggestion that everyone who does
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:53.300]  anything in cooperation with anyone else must be endorsing everything about that person is,
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:57.780]  it's, it's, it's merely branding. It's, it's manipulation. No one really believes it.
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:14:02.260]  And what's happening is that everyone who is playing that game is finding themselves very
[03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:06.580]  quickly to get bitten in the, in the rear end by it. It's an impossible way to go. And on the
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:11.940]  internet, you know, and it's transparent. I mean, you can see, you can see, I'm saying
[03:14:12.900 --> 03:14:18.660]  who people are is transparent and people, people form coalitions. And in a time when,
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:25.540]  you know, you have this, everything happened in communications and memes and concepts and
[03:14:25.540 --> 03:14:31.940]  threads occurring in real time constantly. Coalitions build and fall apart in real time
[03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:35.460]  as well. Nothing wrong with it. But you and I agree on absolutely everything anyway. So no
[03:14:35.460 --> 03:14:39.860]  issue. Yeah, you and I are fine. You and I are fine. You know, but who knows, maybe we'll get
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:44.500]  kicked off, off social media. You know, we've got a minute and 10 before we reach the break.
[03:14:44.500 --> 03:14:50.180]  So what I want people to do is, Ron, you have been in the trenches of the free speech fight
[03:14:50.180 --> 03:14:54.660]  and of the right of center fight, you know, for, for decades to brag on yourself a little bit.
[03:14:54.660 --> 03:14:59.700]  So I don't have to, because I can do it privately. But here we are. We got a couple million listeners.
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:03.700]  Who is Ron Coleman? And why did, why did I bring him on to talk about civil rights?
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:08.500]  Well, I've been in, I'm really a commercial litigator. I, most of my work is really very
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:13.940]  ordinary. You see, look stacks of papers, discovery, disputes, trade, trademark cases.
[03:15:13.940 --> 03:15:18.500]  But I've been involved in on the rights of online free speech and started out with defending
[03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:22.500]  bloggers against stakeholders like the New York Times, who were trying to shut them down. You
[03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:25.940]  got on the, on the screen there, my likely to confusion blog, which is about
[03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:32.180]  trademark and intellectual property use on the internet and free speech.
[03:15:32.180 --> 03:15:36.900]  I've gotten involved in a lot of stuff. I ended up among those stuffs being that I was involved in
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:38.180]  was the slants.
[03:15:38.180 --> 03:15:39.380]  The slants, yes.
[03:15:39.380 --> 03:15:40.340]  Went up to the Supreme Court.
[03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:44.340]  Pause there, pause there. After this break, we're going to talk about the slants. We're going to
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:47.700]  talk about civil rights. We're going to talk about what you've done. You blog yourself.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:51.860]  I can't wait. After the break, we got Ron Coleman to talk about the Mueller investigation and civil
[03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:53.300]  rights.
[03:15:53.300 --> 03:15:56.900]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:16:01.620]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:16:01.620 --> 03:16:06.660]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.

[03:20:24.020 --> 03:20:28.180]  This is Ali Alexander. I'm filling in for Alex Jones during this last hour. We can't wait to
[03:20:28.180 --> 03:20:31.540]  take your calls. So here's the number that you want to write down. Let me make sure that I have
[03:20:31.540 --> 03:20:38.500]  this number correct. 877-789-2539. That number again, if you want to call during that, we're
[03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:42.740]  going to do a half hour calls. And I'm actually going to keep Ron on with me and we'll answer
[03:20:42.740 --> 03:20:48.580]  any calls that you have about America's growing civil strife, the Mueller investigation, civil
[03:20:48.580 --> 03:20:56.740]  rights, the Cohen stuff, the Manafort stuff. So the number again is 877-289-ALAX. So 2539.
[03:20:56.740 --> 03:21:01.860]  And you guys can sit on hold until we take your calls here at the half hour mark. But for the
[03:21:01.860 --> 03:21:06.980]  next eight minutes, I'm going to talk again to my friend Ron Coleman, the successful constitutional
[03:21:06.980 --> 03:21:13.060]  lawyer behind the slant, also does a lot of corporate litigation. Is it?
[03:21:13.060 --> 03:21:17.540]  Sure, litigation, trademark litigation, internet related, technology related.
[03:21:18.500 --> 03:21:25.540]  All the cool stuff, all the cool stuff. So Ron, I was for the Mueller investigation because I wanted
[03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:32.340]  this country to come together even at the expense of the party's favorability rating.
[03:21:32.340 --> 03:21:37.940]  I'm a Republican. And I thought, okay, well, it's going to extend this false rumor that Donald
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:42.980]  Trump was colluding with Russia, but we would get over it by the midterms. And all of my conspiracy
[03:21:42.980 --> 03:21:47.700]  nut friends were like, no, no, no, this is a bad thing. They're looking more correct than incorrect
[03:21:47.700 --> 03:21:51.460]  now. Would you define for the, I want to get your opinion on the Mueller investigation,
[03:21:51.460 --> 03:21:56.500]  but as a lawyer, because I'm not one, my mother is, but I'm not a lawyer. What is malicious
[03:21:56.500 --> 03:22:03.700]  prosecution? What is the Barr Association and what standards are lawyers and members of the court
[03:22:04.340 --> 03:22:11.460]  held to? Oh gosh, more inadequate for an eight minute long answer. I mean,
[03:22:11.460 --> 03:22:19.540]  malicious prosecution is really a tort concept. It is something that you may as well forget about.
[03:22:19.540 --> 03:22:24.820]  It's not an issue. I mean, to the extent that you're using it as a way to stand in for,
[03:22:24.820 --> 03:22:31.220]  can I go after prosecutors for unfairly, wrongly, fraudulently,
[03:22:31.220 --> 03:22:39.060]  favoritously prosecuting me? The answer is, it's virtually impossible. The extent to which the
[03:22:39.060 --> 03:22:54.180]  courts have stood by the concept of prosecutorial discretion and beyond that, absolute non-liability
[03:22:54.180 --> 03:23:00.500]  for anyone from investigators, through prosecutors, through, of course, judges,
[03:23:01.860 --> 03:23:06.500]  that's not going anywhere. That's not going to change. The best a citizen can hope for,
[03:23:06.500 --> 03:23:10.260]  or in the case of the President Trump or anyone else who's in the crosshairs of a
[03:23:11.860 --> 03:23:18.020]  coordinated multi-faceted political hit investigation like this can hope for,
[03:23:18.020 --> 03:23:24.180]  is for it to be over. I mean, basically, consider the Ken Starr investigation.
[03:23:24.180 --> 03:23:29.060]  And I think that's what everybody had in mind who said, look what happened. Look what happened
[03:23:29.060 --> 03:23:36.180]  there. It didn't end up going so great for the Republicans. It didn't really end up doing Bill
[03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:45.060]  Clinton any favors, but it was an out of control situation. I mean, the sort of broad, broad
[03:23:45.060 --> 03:23:52.260]  discretion that's given to special prosecutors, well, it's problematic for a lot of reasons.
[03:23:52.260 --> 03:23:56.660]  And we're seeing what a lot of them are here. I mean, you have people on all the time. You
[03:23:56.660 --> 03:24:00.340]  don't have to be a lawyer to see what the problems are. Certainly, from the point of view,
[03:24:00.340 --> 03:24:05.460]  you asked me about bar associations. I think what you were basically referring to was one
[03:24:05.460 --> 03:24:10.580]  of the ethical obligations of an attorney with respect, especially a prosecuting attorney.
[03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:15.700]  And there are special canons that govern the obligations and the duties of a prosecuting
[03:24:15.700 --> 03:24:20.340]  attorney, whether it's for a state, a county, well, the state and the counties are essentially
[03:24:20.340 --> 03:24:27.540]  the same level of jurisdiction or a federal prosecutor. And ask anyone who practices criminal
[03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:35.220]  law, which I don't, but not too many of them are particularly comforted by the existence of these
[03:24:35.220 --> 03:24:42.260]  canons. They are, it's extremely unusual for prosecutors to even be disciplined, much less
[03:24:43.060 --> 03:24:47.460]  held responsible either of civil or criminal law for misconduct as a prosecutor.
[03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:52.260]  Yeah, and I want to translate this for the viewers. What Ron is essentially saying is like,
[03:24:52.260 --> 03:24:58.100]  I'll leave your principles behind, believing that these people have been targeted for political
[03:24:58.100 --> 03:25:02.980]  persecution and malicious persecution may be valid in some spirit of law, but in any sense,
[03:25:02.980 --> 03:25:05.620]  we're never going to get this prosecuted. And he's absolutely right.
[03:25:05.620 --> 03:25:09.380]  We have a political problem right now. And this is why we have elected officials.
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:15.300]  The president or Jeff Sessions have to step in because we need broad judicial reform when a
[03:25:15.300 --> 03:25:22.420]  prosecutor, the black community has the same argument for police who end up not getting
[03:25:22.420 --> 03:25:26.500]  charged. First, they have to fight for an investigation. So black people get in the
[03:25:26.500 --> 03:25:33.700]  streets, rightfully so, I believe, to get an investigation started, to get charges brought
[03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:37.780]  against police officers who shoot people, and then let a jury decide. I think that that's what
[03:25:37.780 --> 03:25:42.980]  makes the legal system great. If a jury wants to convict the cop, then let them. If they want to
[03:25:42.980 --> 03:25:48.660]  let a cop off, then don't. But for the sake of the broader system, for the sake that we're not
[03:25:48.660 --> 03:25:52.260]  having the haves and the have nots, some special, some badge makes you,
[03:25:52.260 --> 03:26:00.500]  it gives you the ability to form some legalized gang, I think is very dangerous for the system.
[03:26:00.500 --> 03:26:04.580]  And but I think you're right, politically speaking, that's the only route is Jeff
[03:26:04.580 --> 03:26:08.260]  Sessions has to step in and say, I'm not the target of this investigation.
[03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:13.220]  I've clearly demonstrated that I'm not on the president's side. The rule of law is being
[03:26:13.220 --> 03:26:16.900]  threatened. Can someone unrecuse themselves?
[03:26:16.900 --> 03:26:26.340]  I would think that a person could, especially when in the case of the attorney general,
[03:26:27.620 --> 03:26:34.180]  he accused himself in connection with a specific question, a specific investigation
[03:26:34.180 --> 03:26:38.900]  that was resolved. But as you point out, Ali, it's really a political question. It's not a
[03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:42.660]  constitutional or even strictly speaking, a legal question. And I think that both
[03:26:42.660 --> 03:26:49.380]  President Trump and and the attorney general, at this point, can see themselves quite
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:56.420]  understandably as hemden politically. There is this, I mean, gosh, you know, you're too young
[03:26:56.420 --> 03:27:02.100]  to remember it, but I was okay. I was a kid myself during Watergate, the sense that Nixon had
[03:27:02.100 --> 03:27:09.700]  crossed a Rubicon when he fired Archibald Cox has had this really, you know, there just,
[03:27:09.700 --> 03:27:14.820]  there's this cultural resonance about Watergate, which is, you know,
[03:27:14.820 --> 03:27:20.740]  preposterous because it's used so casually and so recklessly. But there is this sense that-
[03:27:20.740 --> 03:27:24.660]  Almost like it's a legal standard, almost like it's a legal president that, you know,
[03:27:24.660 --> 03:27:28.900]  you can't fire the attorney general or you can't talk to anyone in the DOJ because they're
[03:27:28.900 --> 03:27:32.740]  independent. It's like, well, the Constitution puts this in the executive branch.
[03:27:32.740 --> 03:27:36.980]  Well, I mean, it's amazing how much and the people with blue checks, you know, and not just
[03:27:36.980 --> 03:27:40.900]  like me, you know, but people who really you think know better and don't seem to have the
[03:27:40.900 --> 03:27:45.220]  basic civics that against civics, I think is really taught in high schools anymore. But
[03:27:45.220 --> 03:27:53.300]  basic concepts about the branches of government and who has responsibility for what. And on the
[03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:58.260]  other side of the scale, people have to recognize that impeachment is also is a political process.
[03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:05.460]  So if, you know, we can fight all day about what constitute high crimes and misdemeanors,
[03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:09.460]  we can also be confident the Supreme Court will not decide that for us. It will be decided by
[03:28:09.460 --> 03:28:14.980]  the House and the Senate if, you know, if it ever gets to that point with regard to any president.
[03:28:14.980 --> 03:28:20.260]  So that is the, you know, the president in theory and certainly technically speaking,
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:25.300]  as a constitutional legal matter, can manage this process as a political matter. It's almost
[03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:30.180]  impossible to manage it once it gets started. But, you know, he really had a hostage choice.
[03:28:30.180 --> 03:28:34.500]  If he didn't appoint a special prosecutor, he would have been accused of hiding something.
[03:28:34.500 --> 03:28:37.380]  And that would see the Southern District of New York seems to be acting like it.
[03:28:38.660 --> 03:28:43.380]  You see, anyway, so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, right after the break, we're going to take your calls
[03:28:43.380 --> 03:28:49.620]  877-789-2539. Ron and I are going to be on the line to take any of your calls about the

[03:32:52.100 --> 03:33:21.940]  Welcome back. We're in the last half hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:21.940 --> 03:33:30.420]  Here on info wars.com my friend a great great great lawyer Ron Coleman is on with me and I'm
[03:33:30.420 --> 03:33:35.780]  Ali Alexander. You can find us both on Twitter. You find me by Ali. You can't find Ron by Ron
[03:33:35.780 --> 03:33:42.660]  but you can find him at Ron Coleman and it's a great follow because Ron's not just a lawyer
[03:33:42.660 --> 03:33:47.620]  lawyer. He's not just a lawyer who defends bloggers. He's also a lawyer who has blogged and we're
[03:33:47.620 --> 03:33:52.260]  going to be answering your questions for the next the next half hour. Does that sound fun, Ron?
[03:33:53.300 --> 03:33:55.540]  Yes, like it's a lot more fun than work. That's why I'm doing it.
[03:33:56.820 --> 03:34:00.820]  Yeah, I bet your partner is like, what are you doing? Let's do James from North Carolina. James
[03:34:00.820 --> 03:34:07.140]  from North Carolina saw a tweet that he liked and he wants to talk about James. What's up? What's
[03:34:07.140 --> 03:34:17.700]  the tweet? It's the one you said. As of August 21, 2018, everyone needs Bitcoin, pistol, ammo, gas, reliable
[03:34:17.700 --> 03:34:37.620]  food, water, bulk up and stretch. To that, we need to protest peacefully. Go to Twitter, social media,
[03:34:38.500 --> 03:34:42.100]  but then they're going beyond taking away our free speech and they're trying to take away our
[03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:49.620]  right to choose our own leader and they're taking away the revoking our vote because we took a
[03:34:49.620 --> 03:34:57.540]  revolution in 2016. We revoked corrupt politicians like Hillary Clinton and we said we need somebody
[03:34:57.540 --> 03:35:02.980]  that's going to fix this country and put these corrupt politicians in prison where they belong
[03:35:03.780 --> 03:35:08.260]  and then we had this corrupt coup where it was a vicious conspiracy to overthrow him.
[03:35:08.260 --> 03:35:11.940]  And what's going to happen if they move forward on Trump? There's going to be a revolution.
[03:35:11.940 --> 03:35:14.420]  There's going to be a bloody revolution and they're all going to pay.
[03:35:15.220 --> 03:35:20.340]  Which we want to avoid. I mean, we all lose. Let me interrupt you, James. Thanks for calling
[03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:27.460]  in James. I think we all lose in a civil war. I think that people who believe in the principles
[03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:34.740]  of free speech and in chilling censorship and wanting prosecutors that go after people for
[03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:38.580]  the right reasons and not the wrong reasons and turn into an interfishing expedition,
[03:35:38.580 --> 03:35:44.420]  want peace. We want to avoid that stuff, but there's nothing wrong with preparing for worst case
[03:35:44.420 --> 03:35:51.540]  outcomes. Ron, you're a man of the times and a well-read man, so a man of all time.
[03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:59.940]  Haven't you seen kind of the texture of America change for the worst? And what is up with the
[03:35:59.940 --> 03:36:06.180]  media calling the right violent when it's Antifa out here? They're the ones shooting Steve Scullies.
[03:36:06.180 --> 03:36:11.860]  They're the ones in these bullying games. They're the people who are violence. Even the shooter
[03:36:11.860 --> 03:36:16.100]  yesterday was a Trump hater who lost a video game and went on a shooting spree. I'm very,
[03:36:16.100 --> 03:36:22.660]  very concerned that real reality and the reality that we see on mainstream media is not real.
[03:36:22.660 --> 03:36:26.180]  And I'm scared that we're moving closer and closer to a civil war.
[03:36:26.180 --> 03:36:36.740]  Well, you know, Ali, it's not just the media. The public sense of the factual world in which
[03:36:36.740 --> 03:36:45.380]  we live in, the empirical universe of the facts has really become siloed into areas where there's
[03:36:46.340 --> 03:36:52.100]  virtually no agreement over some of the things that everyone took for granted once, the scientific
[03:36:52.100 --> 03:37:01.540]  method, the number of genders or sexes of human beings, what words mean, what the roles of what
[03:37:01.540 --> 03:37:07.620]  judges are as opposed to what the roles of legislatures are. You have police departments
[03:37:07.620 --> 03:37:13.860]  that have acculturated themselves to not enforcing the law in some of the most violent
[03:37:14.500 --> 03:37:21.780]  situations where, I mean, what's the fundamental premise of any civilization is that you start
[03:37:21.780 --> 03:37:28.180]  out being able to respect physical safety. You give up a certain amount of liberty for a modicum
[03:37:28.180 --> 03:37:32.500]  of physical safety. And, you know, we have major metropolitan police departments that are absolutely
[03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:38.020]  announcing that they're not making, they're not part of that deal anymore. They're going to retain
[03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:42.980]  the liberty that you've given up, in other words, their portion of your liberty, but not protect
[03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:48.500]  you. We're dealing in a world where people don't even understand, a world that people don't even
[03:37:48.500 --> 03:37:54.660]  understand. In the ways that are so fundamental, and you say, boy, you know, Ron, I don't want to
[03:37:54.660 --> 03:37:58.660]  put it in those words. What you're saying is, Ron, you're an old guy. You don't have too many old
[03:37:58.660 --> 03:38:05.060]  bull guys, you know, on info wars. Yeah, let me tell you, you don't have to go back to when I was
[03:38:05.060 --> 03:38:10.900]  a kid. I think we're both old enough to know that things have really run off the rails over the last
[03:38:10.900 --> 03:38:16.980]  several years. I have argued several times via Twitter that I really believe a decision was
[03:38:16.980 --> 03:38:21.860]  made, again, not sitting in a conference room or out of the table, but that collectively speaking
[03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:27.300]  in terms of consciousness and in terms of preparation, a decision was made by certain
[03:38:27.300 --> 03:38:36.340]  and very important and powerful elite groups that several things that happened 10, 15 years ago,
[03:38:36.340 --> 03:38:43.940]  we're never going to happen again. Clinton's humiliation, right? Where the press went after
[03:38:43.940 --> 03:38:49.700]  a Democrat, a popular Democrat, a Democrat that I voted for, he was he was seen as a centrist
[03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:55.300]  and someone actually who had offered something different. That was in the wake of HW's lies too,
[03:38:55.300 --> 03:39:02.340]  in the wake of HW lying to the right. That's right. Exactly. Precisely. And that was that was what
[03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:07.620]  drove me in that direction. The decision was a decision was made. We don't go after no more enemies
[03:39:07.620 --> 03:39:15.860]  to the left. We will not go after we the press will not go after Democrat leaders. And secondly,
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:19.220]  a decision was made. We're not losing another election. And a lot of the stuff that's coming
[03:39:19.220 --> 03:39:27.540]  up now about the absolutely mortifying lack of respect for the rule of law that took place
[03:39:27.540 --> 03:39:35.780]  in the previous administration was part of the emplacement of systems and personnel and
[03:39:35.780 --> 03:39:43.540]  policies and approaches to managing the government that was proprietary. In the sense that Democrats
[03:39:44.180 --> 03:39:48.820]  own the government now. Yep. You can't win elections anymore. So we're going to depend on
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:53.300]  non elected institutions, parts of government that are not elected.
[03:39:55.060 --> 03:40:01.780]  We have to really think about it. Academia is 90 something percent Democrat versus Republican
[03:40:01.780 --> 03:40:05.940]  when you when you when you compare their donations, their federal. That's good. All smart people are
[03:40:05.940 --> 03:40:10.340]  liberals. Well, Ali, come on. That's a you seen those studies, right? Right, right. And then it's
[03:40:10.340 --> 03:40:15.060]  not just academia, but then it's media. And then what you're what you're talking about is exactly
[03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:19.860]  what I was talking to my intern about last night. And that's that government workers, these bureaucrats,
[03:40:19.860 --> 03:40:26.260]  these people who are in government now, it's a culture of left. And it's not liberalism or
[03:40:26.260 --> 03:40:30.980]  progressivism per se. It's not a philosophy that they're touting. It's our team wins. The other
[03:40:30.980 --> 03:40:36.100]  team is only allowed to win, you know, on a very limited basis, congressional, but certainly not
[03:40:36.100 --> 03:40:40.420]  the White House. And they're certainly not allowed to govern any of the agencies. And this is why
[03:40:40.420 --> 03:40:46.980]  you've seen these holdovers do absolutely maddening. Except the Supreme Court cited with the Trump
[03:40:46.980 --> 03:40:51.860]  administration, not Sally Yates. And you didn't have a media to say, oh, wait, the whole reason
[03:40:51.860 --> 03:40:56.900]  she protested and resigned was wrong. She was wrong. The state of Washington was wrong. The
[03:40:56.900 --> 03:41:02.260]  state of Hawaii was wrong. Legally speaking, she was unqualified to make the decision she made.
[03:41:03.260 --> 03:41:09.060]  There's no accountability. It's impossible to fire almost any government worker, certainly a
[03:41:09.060 --> 03:41:15.780]  federal employee. I can't, at this point, it seems that every extreme has already been
[03:41:16.660 --> 03:41:20.100]  breached. So I don't even know what it would look like in order to actually, I mean, think of the
[03:41:20.100 --> 03:41:25.940]  people who are on this in the Department of Justice still collecting salaries. It's
[03:41:25.940 --> 03:41:30.340]  unbelievable. And you mentioned academia. I don't think there's any single, you know,
[03:41:30.340 --> 03:41:36.740]  and I spent seven years in higher education. I don't think there's anything worse right now
[03:41:36.740 --> 03:41:44.180]  than what's going on in the universities. It is by far, I mean, the ability to critical thinking
[03:41:44.980 --> 03:41:51.140]  and the ideal of, you know, radical chic. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you, Ali. You
[03:41:51.140 --> 03:41:56.740]  know, I hope this isn't the last episode of this program that's ever aired, but I wouldn't be shocked
[03:41:56.740 --> 03:42:04.980]  if it were. I wouldn't either. The hour is 11.56 and I'm really scared of the run-up to the midterms,
[03:42:04.980 --> 03:42:09.460]  and I'm even more scared for the result. And it's not about my party winning or losing.
[03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:15.460]  It's we are fundamentally approaching a couple of scenarios, you know, where the House Democrats
[03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:19.780]  now are locked into impeachment and Senate hearings are really quick. So you have half the country
[03:42:19.780 --> 03:42:24.420]  that feels deprived of the rule of law, or we go before the Supreme Court to rule whether or not
[03:42:24.420 --> 03:42:29.220]  you can indict a sitting president or not. I don't know. Things are getting really scary.
[03:42:29.220 --> 03:42:33.780]  After the break, we're going to bring on Billy to talk about Twitter and shadow banning. I know that
[03:42:33.780 --> 03:42:39.540]  Ron has a lot of views on this matter too. So right after the break, we will get to Twitter,
[03:42:39.540 --> 03:42:51.700]  shadow banning, speech, civil strife. You're listening to info wars.com.
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:16.980]  Two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all
[03:43:16.980 --> 03:43:23.780]  in the top five or top 10 news feeds. Go to info wars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the
[03:43:23.780 --> 03:43:28.420]  free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll
[03:43:28.420 --> 03:43:33.860]  pop up there. It's also critical to go to info wars.com, forward slash newsletter, and give us
[03:43:33.860 --> 03:43:38.420]  your emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own
[03:43:38.420 --> 03:43:43.940]  platform. But whatever you do, tell folks about info wars.com, forward slash show, how they can
[03:43:43.940 --> 03:43:48.980]  download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[03:43:48.980 --> 03:43:53.780]  and point out this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see. I want to plow
[03:43:53.780 --> 03:44:00.340]  into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand
[03:44:00.340 --> 03:44:08.180]  that when you buy t shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[03:44:08.180 --> 03:44:14.900]  from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[03:44:14.900 --> 03:44:19.220]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I don't want to
[03:44:19.220 --> 03:44:23.860]  thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver and
[03:44:23.860 --> 03:44:29.140]  with high quality atomic iodine. And you cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the
[03:44:29.140 --> 03:44:34.020]  best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:44:34.020 --> 03:44:39.700]  infowarslife.com or AAA 2533139. And your purchase of the products
[03:44:40.260 --> 03:44:44.100]  stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and
[03:44:44.100 --> 03:44:48.260]  their satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are. And they know we know who they are.
[03:44:48.260 --> 03:44:50.260]  And they're coming back against us. So we need your support.
[03:44:53.860 --> 03:44:58.900]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[03:44:58.900 --> 03:45:03.780]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detox
[03:45:03.780 --> 03:45:09.620] ify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's
[03:45:09.620 --> 03:45:15.300]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[03:45:15.300 --> 03:45:21.060]  detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula
[03:45:21.060 --> 03:45:25.940]  that I personally have been taking for over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to
[03:45:25.940 --> 03:45:30.660]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe
[03:45:30.660 --> 03:45:35.780]  it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as
[03:45:35.780 --> 03:45:42.020]  healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:45:42.020 --> 03:45:46.340]  to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.340 --> 03:45:50.500]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change
[03:45:50.500 --> 03:46:00.340]  our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLife.com. Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful
[03:46:00.340 --> 03:46:05.860]  MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped
[03:46:05.860 --> 03:46:10.340]  into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support
[03:46:10.340 --> 03:46:16.100]  your gut health. MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula
[03:46:16.100 --> 03:46:20.740]  designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms. There's no better
[03:46:20.740 --> 03:46:25.940]  product to help your body fight back. MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the
[03:46:25.940 --> 03:46:30.740]  body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems
[03:46:30.740 --> 03:46:35.620]  if it goes unchecked. Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract,
[03:46:35.620 --> 03:46:40.980]  poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of
[03:46:40.980 --> 03:46:46.340]  time as powerful microbalancing properties. Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus
[03:46:46.340 --> 03:46:59.780]  today at InfoWarsLife.com. That's InfoWarsLife.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:46:59.780 --> 03:47:18.660]  Welcome back. It's Monday, but boy, it feels like hump day. It feels like Wednesday. So much high
[03:47:18.660 --> 03:47:26.260]  energy here on InfoWars.com. And I'm joined by my high energy lawyer, Ron Coleman. And we're taking
[03:47:26.260 --> 03:47:30.500]  some questions. We're going to talk about an issue that we both are passionate about. We're both
[03:47:30.500 --> 03:47:36.580]  passionate about speech in general, both free speech on the governmental and legal end and
[03:47:36.580 --> 03:47:43.540]  speeches that relates to corporations and practicality. So let's talk to Billy in Florida.
[03:47:43.540 --> 03:47:50.340]  Hey. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Oh, great. Thank you for taking my call. One of the issues
[03:47:50.340 --> 03:47:54.660]  that I feel the most strongly about is the shadow bank campaign that's affected people that use
[03:47:54.660 --> 03:48:01.700]  Twitter like myself. I use the Twitter handle Red River Report and I'm a very big pro Trump supporter
[03:48:01.700 --> 03:48:07.140]  and I believe in the freedom of speech that our forefathers gifted us with in this nation.
[03:48:07.140 --> 03:48:13.620]  The way I see it is that by shadow banning the people that elected Donald Trump, they are effectively,
[03:48:13.620 --> 03:48:18.500]  they're striking us right in the stomach against our ability to propagate our message
[03:48:18.500 --> 03:48:24.100]  against for pro-life, for border security, for the wall, for everything that we stand for.
[03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:28.820]  They are one shot striking us all down. I'm talking millions have been affected by this.
[03:48:28.820 --> 03:48:33.780]  They're blanket silencing us and that the president doesn't make this as campaign focus
[03:48:33.780 --> 03:48:37.220]  moving into the elections. I'm afraid we're going to be just forgotten and lost because we
[03:48:37.220 --> 03:48:42.100]  effectively can't even communicate back and defend ourselves. We have been silenced. So what is the
[03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:46.900]  way forward to reach the president to let him know that Americans like your voters, we need your
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:51.780]  help on this. We can't fight back. I have 9,000 followers and I'm only getting around 40 interactions
[03:48:51.780 --> 03:48:57.460]  per tweet. So Ron, what do you think? Because I mean, there is what's interesting is I predicted
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:49:02.500]  this. I predicted that it would be less about the constitutional argument for free speech
[03:49:02.500 --> 03:49:09.540]  and more about social, cultural and corporate speech. What do you think the movement as a
[03:49:09.540 --> 03:49:15.620]  whole is moving towards regulation? It is. I am. I know I have and I was very reluctant a year ago,
[03:49:15.620 --> 03:49:20.740]  even several months ago. And now I'm like, this is the world that we live in. I don't think I'm
[03:49:20.740 --> 03:49:25.780]  changing my principles. What would you say to conservatives out there and this administration?
[03:49:26.660 --> 03:49:32.500]  Well, I mean, I think content regulation is a non-starter. In fact, some people have suggested
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:39.060]  that the whole thing, the big conspiracy to shout a banning and everything is actually
[03:49:39.060 --> 03:49:46.180]  part of a left wing plot to get the right wing to be in favor of government censorship or government
[03:49:46.180 --> 03:49:52.740]  regulation of content. Then the people who really know how to take over government come in and
[03:49:52.740 --> 03:49:56.820]  shut us down once and for all. I think that's a little bit out there. But I do think there are
[03:49:56.820 --> 03:50:01.620]  two approaches that are not getting the kind of attention from the White House that I would
[03:50:01.620 --> 03:50:04.900]  like to think they were, which is a very polite way of saying that being ignored as far as I can
[03:50:04.900 --> 03:50:12.100]  tell. One is there's, you know, and you and I have discussed this going back to the period of
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:21.060]  the gavel litigation. I don't understand why there is no serious talk about at least looking at
[03:50:22.500 --> 03:50:31.220]  platforms like Twitter and resources like Google from a monopoly perspective. And I know that
[03:50:31.220 --> 03:50:36.340]  we've come a very long way in terms of the development of anti-trust law. But either it's
[03:50:36.340 --> 03:50:43.780]  on the books or it's not. And if it is, we should be looking, there are very respected academic voices
[03:50:43.780 --> 03:50:48.660]  who think that from a monopoly and anti-competitive this point of view, and if you take a look at
[03:50:48.660 --> 03:50:55.540]  the sort of things that are going on, the extent to which Google acquires potentially competitive
[03:50:55.540 --> 03:51:02.340]  technology and the relationship among these platforms, someone should be taking a look at it.
[03:51:02.340 --> 03:51:05.620]  If someone is, it's a secret to me and it probably shouldn't be a secret to anyone.
[03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:09.940]  Another issue that I'm surprised that the president or his allies have not taken up is that
[03:51:10.580 --> 03:51:15.540]  a lot of what we're seeing, even if you want to give the greatest possible benefit of the doubt
[03:51:15.540 --> 03:51:19.940]  to the people who run these platforms and who are responsible for the silencing that our call
[03:51:19.940 --> 03:51:24.900]  are quite accurately described, giving them the benefit of the doubt to some extent,
[03:51:24.900 --> 03:51:30.740]  there's no question that they are responding to legal concerns and legal requirements that
[03:51:30.740 --> 03:51:37.620]  have been placed on them by foreign governments. And I have researched this extensively and it's
[03:51:37.620 --> 03:51:43.140]  pretty clear that there is no doctrine right now in the First Amendment law that says the First
[03:51:43.140 --> 03:51:52.580]  Amendment has anything to say about how foreign government tells a private actor how to conduct
[03:51:52.580 --> 03:51:56.660]  itself, but it's something we should be talking about because that doesn't have to be the case.
[03:51:56.660 --> 03:52:01.780]  If the Europeans can censor American expression, which they can do and are doing.
[03:52:01.780 --> 03:52:05.700]  They are doing. Absolutely. No question about Europeans and others around the world,
[03:52:05.700 --> 03:52:12.340]  including China, then we as a nation, especially the nation that brought the First Amendment
[03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:16.580]  into the world, want to be thinking about what is the appropriate policy, legal, technological
[03:52:16.580 --> 03:52:21.140]  response to that, regulatory response. That's not happening. There's no reason there shouldn't
[03:52:21.140 --> 03:52:26.580]  be and can't be. I don't know why the president has been absent on this, but it's a great opportunity.
[03:52:27.380 --> 03:52:31.860]  Yeah, we got to make our voices known on this issue.
[03:52:31.860 --> 03:52:36.820]  Ron, I want to thank you for joining me for this past half hour. So where can people find
[03:52:36.820 --> 03:52:43.540]  you and your work and your pithy thoughts? Well, so we're pithier than others. I mean,
[03:52:43.540 --> 03:52:46.980]  as you know, I have a blog. It's called likelihoodofconfusion.com. It's mostly
[03:52:46.980 --> 03:52:50.980]  of interest to people who are interested in trademarks and branding and copyright.
[03:52:52.420 --> 03:52:57.220]  It's sometimes people are amused by it, even if they don't follow all the legal issues.
[03:52:57.220 --> 03:53:03.940]  But if in doubt, you can default to my Twitter handle at Ron Coleman with an E-R-O-N-C-O-L-E-M-A-N.
[03:53:03.940 --> 03:53:11.060]  Take it or leave it. Some people like it. Yeah, yeah. We'll have to have you back.
[03:53:12.020 --> 03:53:16.660]  Yeah, I was going to say we have to have you back again. Assuming you have that Twitter
[03:53:16.660 --> 03:53:22.340]  handle forever, people absolutely need to follow Ron Coleman on Twitter. Thanks for joining me,
[03:53:22.340 --> 03:53:27.700]  my friend. Thanks for the pleasure. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thank you. There is a caller who's been on
[03:53:27.700 --> 03:53:32.020]  the line for a while. So I want to talk about, I thought this would be a good way to kind of end
[03:53:32.020 --> 03:53:37.780]  the show. Jacob from Wisconsin wants to talk about the midterms. Jacob, thanks for holding for 32
[03:53:37.780 --> 03:53:42.820]  minutes. You're a trooper. Thank you very much. You hear me all right? Yes, sir.
[03:53:42.820 --> 03:53:48.340]  Yeah. Basically, I think you guys said it right on the nail the head. From a
[03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:54.260]  sessions in Trump, from a constitutional perspective, basically are impeded really with the
[03:53:54.980 --> 03:54:01.540]  they could directly fire everyone they wanted to. But I think the midterms are very, very important
[03:54:01.540 --> 03:54:07.700]  for this year. It's kind of like a battle of dreams. Like we have one dream where we want to
[03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:13.620]  respect the Constitution, the Republic, and we want to uphold the rule of law. And if we lose
[03:54:13.620 --> 03:54:20.580]  the midterms, then that might be Trump at all. And also, they've kind of overreached this year,
[03:54:20.580 --> 03:54:25.380]  I feel like they've been censoring everyone with their shadow banning and now completely banning
[03:54:25.380 --> 03:54:32.420]  info wars. And I think they're just really exposed right now because we got the defamation lawsuits
[03:54:32.420 --> 03:54:36.980]  and anti-trust laws coming in. And I think they're really betting on weighing these midterms.
[03:54:36.980 --> 03:54:39.700]  For what he means. So I like your opinions on that.
[03:54:39.700 --> 03:54:46.340]  Yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right. I mean, people do not understand how close we are. I
[03:54:46.340 --> 03:54:53.860]  say it's 1156 on the doomsday clock is if the Democrats win the House, they have to impeach
[03:54:53.860 --> 03:54:59.460]  Trump now because Michael Cohen has asserted that there was criminal conspiracy. So it's no
[03:54:59.460 --> 03:55:04.580]  longer a policy debate. We don't like Trump because XYZ. They are alleging that he committed
[03:55:04.580 --> 03:55:09.940]  criminal conspiracy, okay? So this will lead to the impeachment. Mitch McConnell,
[03:55:09.940 --> 03:55:14.340]  which he'll keep the Senate, the Republicans will keep the Senate, aren't going to let that last.
[03:55:14.340 --> 03:55:19.940]  So that provides two parallel realities for Republicans and Democrats that's more stark
[03:55:19.940 --> 03:55:25.620]  than it is now. Worse, Silicon Valley has put itself in an all-in position. They are ready
[03:55:25.620 --> 03:55:30.660]  for regulation. If we push back against them, they're ready for it. They'll accept it. It's no
[03:55:30.660 --> 03:55:37.060]  spilled milk. But if Democrats win and regulation cannot make it through Congress because two
[03:55:37.060 --> 03:55:41.220]  different parties have two different chambers, then Silicon Valley will be able to determine the
[03:55:41.220 --> 03:55:47.540]  2020 election. And we cannot allow this. People, this is all a political problem right now.
[03:55:47.540 --> 03:55:53.700]  There is a famous Prussian military theorist who said politics is war by other means.
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:57.060]  And I think we really need to study this. We really need to understand that
[03:55:57.060 --> 03:56:02.980]  economics is a transfer of goods. Well, that's only ever happened through conflict and force
[03:56:03.540 --> 03:56:10.340]  or people engaging in a relationship as either equals or acknowledged some mutual benefit
[03:56:10.340 --> 03:56:14.580]  relationship. It's called a social contract. That's what Ron Coleman was talking about,
[03:56:14.580 --> 03:56:19.780]  is you give up a little liberty for the guarantee of a modicum of safety. But now when you have
[03:56:19.780 --> 03:56:24.740]  police departments that won't arrest Antifa, prosecutors who won't prosecute Antifa,
[03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:29.220]  we have now given up our liberty and we have not gotten that security back.
[03:56:29.220 --> 03:56:34.340]  Worse, they tell us they need more of our liberties. So the doomsday clock is 1156.
