[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:36.520]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 12th day of March 2013
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.720]  and I am going to cover all this news today we have a famous lawyer joining us
[00:42.720 --> 00:48.080]  on the broadcast who has beaten the Food and Drug Administration trying to ban
[00:48.080 --> 00:53.520]  vitamins and minerals seven times and he's more responsible than anybody else
[00:53.520 --> 01:01.760]  out there with allowing food freedom what's left of it in this country
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.280]  Jonathan W. E. Mord will be joining us in the third hour now you know Professor
[01:07.280 --> 01:11.320]  Griff is in the Obama deception one of the more famous individuals and hip-hop
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.640]  out there and one of the founders of Public Enemy and I know that he's an
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.080]  off-and-on listener because I've heard shows where he's talked about the
[01:18.080 --> 01:21.760]  broadcast he's plugged the Obama deception and some of his big concerts
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.200]  because I've seen it in the LA Times and we're talking to one of his managers
[01:27.200 --> 01:32.640]  cohorts friends and he and reportedly he's on at noon today but we haven't been
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.680]  in contact with him in a few days and they're on tour and there's much stuff
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.840]  going on so we'll see if that happens in the second hour today Professor Griff
[01:40.840 --> 01:44.880]  90% coming on the show I mean it's pretty much a hundred percent but I don't
[01:44.880 --> 01:47.800]  like saying that we've got a contact of plus I've noticed with entertainment
[01:47.800 --> 01:52.160]  people whether it's it's it's it's Willie Nelson or whether it's people like
[01:52.160 --> 02:02.400]  Professor Griff or KRS one or even getting getting a few weeks ago a mortal
[02:02.400 --> 02:08.120]  technique in here he was supposed to be on the Wednesday and then they got caught
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.920]  up in another city I think it was Houston and so he was on Thursday was on
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.360]  another day late he wasn't on the radio he was on the nightly news so I've just
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.960]  learned about half the time with music people it doesn't happen but that's no
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.480]  big deal we'll see what happens I'm kind of excited about the interview because
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.040]  he's all about exposing the Illuminati and the rest of it and really has some
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.800]  interesting perspectives on it and where the whole world's going so regardless
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.800]  we're very close to landing Professor Griff here on the broadcast and again
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.520]  it's not a celebrity hunt on the show I want to get interesting celebrities on
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.120]  and interesting people I mean I found out about this lawyer I was like you
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.000]  know we talk about the lawyer the ungevity hired back in the 90s and
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.280]  in the 2000s and then Ron Paul's talked about the guy his big ghost a guest on
[02:57.280 --> 03:03.560]  Coast to Coast AM I said why don't we get the lawyer who keeps beating the FDA
[03:03.560 --> 03:07.760]  trying to ban vitamins minerals on it's just to me that's a really interesting
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.280]  person you know the head of the small business league that's trying to keep a
[03:12.280 --> 03:15.760]  few jobs in this country that's an important person to have on as it's
[03:15.760 --> 03:19.520]  pretty much whatever I think's important and a lot of times also what you end up
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.480]  recommending you know a lot of the guests you recommend in fact we should
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.960]  add an email that goes into the producers inbox I know Coast to Coast does
[03:29.960 --> 03:36.720]  this I meant to do this years ago like guest at info wars.com where you can
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.200]  just email us but can we create that email right now I just ask the IT guys
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.440]  guest and and then it's and then assign it to all your emails guys all for you
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.000]  and then because I mean it's a lot of great ideas and then you can run those
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.080]  past me who listeners want to hear on the broadcast now all of that said this

[09:30.280 --> 09:37.240]  me not even start with the top stories here's one city billboard urges
[09:37.240 --> 09:43.600]  Hispanics to revolt in Austin Texas it shows a massive people with black flags
[09:43.600 --> 09:53.600]  running across the Texas US border saying a riba mijente or basically up
[09:53.600 --> 10:00.520]  rise or rise or revolt my people and of course it's paid for about taxpayer
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.800]  money and they have billboards paid for by Spanish speaking companies white
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.280]  guys I've noticed that own them and run them saying lottery conquista or the
[10:11.280 --> 10:23.480]  reconquering or the law in fissura the invasion and and and it's all racist it's
[10:23.480 --> 10:28.080]  all whites are evil whites are the devil blacks are evil blacks are the
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.960]  devil that that's part of it my atta and I sit here and I'm somebody who's gone
[10:32.960 --> 10:39.560]  out and I don't say this to like oh I'm a good white person I have guilt I'm I'm
[10:39.560 --> 10:46.000]  I like you be my friend it's all mind control the global is to run in this I
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.560]  want you to have success no matter what color you are I want your progeny to
[10:51.560 --> 10:58.160]  touch the stars I know it comes around goes around I'm into the spirit and we've
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.640]  all got one I'm looking way past the color of your skin but we're forced
[11:03.640 --> 11:09.120]  into this and it's a forced collision to make you see the left isn't actually
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.520]  trying to create unity they're actually trying to create division and I'm gonna
[11:14.520 --> 11:17.120]  be breaking this down at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna stop right there a
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.200]  special report at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna get into this because the Ford
[11:23.200 --> 11:27.360]  Foundation the big banks they have imploded Mexico and Latin America and
[11:27.360 --> 11:32.720]  they are going to now have Hispanics or try to force Hispanics to racially
[11:32.720 --> 11:41.360]  identify to racially identify with socialism and communism in a in a race
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.560]  based political system so that Hispanics cannot be reached with the message of
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.880]  liberty and freedom and the globalists are gonna merge all of our countries in
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.880]  the North American Union and make us all slaves and then the government will
[11:55.880 --> 12:00.840]  play the part of the arbiter of the referee over all this so I'm gonna be
[12:00.840 --> 12:04.200]  breaking that down at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna stop right there and I'm
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.040]  gonna re-air a short film I did six years ago that's an extra on the film
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.880]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement that never got the attention it deserved
[12:12.880 --> 12:19.320]  and it is titled battle for the Republic it's 16 minutes long and so I'm gonna
[12:19.320 --> 12:24.560]  break all this down at the bottom of the hour and then air that 16 minute film
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.360]  we're gonna skip that network break at the end of the hour I'm so out of
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.080]  control folks I don't plug my own sponsors I refuse all this advertising
[12:32.080 --> 12:34.680]  money because I just will not even mention the stuff on air even though we
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.680]  need the money I skip network breaks even though the network says please stop
[12:39.680 --> 12:42.880]  doing it I just can't help it you understand that's thousands dollars
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.440]  every time I do that because I'm just so dedicated to covering info and I get
[12:47.440 --> 12:53.400]  so wound up I'll just have the show go back to four or five hours but then I
[12:53.400 --> 12:59.320]  get completely burnout and then can't it's just it's insane it's insane wanting
[12:59.320 --> 13:02.920]  to really free humanity and knowing all the globalist tricks and knowing I'm
[13:02.920 --> 13:08.800]  right and and and and knowing the globalist wheels behind wheels plans
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.560]  with implants knowing their playbook and it's so frustrating I just want the
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.600]  general public to have the playbook so you can be empowered I want you to win
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.760]  when you win I win we grow the pie I love winners I love success I love
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.480]  everybody's children I love innocence and everything good and that's a weird
[13:29.480 --> 13:35.160]  thing nowadays I don't get jealous by guys that have super gorgeous wives I
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.160]  just sit there and admire them I don't get jealous of men that are incredibly
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.680]  handsome I just admire them I don't get jealous of people that are incredible
[13:42.680 --> 13:46.480]  artists I admire them I don't get jealous of people who are successful that
[13:46.480 --> 13:50.680]  did it themselves I admire them and you know that's a rare thing now this is a
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.120]  screwed-up society man the globalists have really taught us how to fail I
[13:56.120 --> 14:05.400]  admire amazing people I want you to be amazing but I'm not gonna sit here and
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.360]  watch the system brand selective I mean I was rereading you know a judge ruled
[14:10.360 --> 14:14.120]  in California that kids will be sent home for wearing American flags I have
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.600]  the newscast coming up the American flag is now said to be evil now of course
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.000]  America's run by the globalist so the flag does represent the new order now
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.320]  because they've taken it they've captured it but the fact that at the same
[14:27.320 --> 14:30.040]  time the globalist use it to take over the world and take the blame for
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.720]  everything and then they're demonizing it or you can't even wear it because the
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.480]  quote Hispanic kids say you can't and it's Hispanic kids mainly being sent
[14:38.480 --> 14:41.720]  home wearing American flag they're going to force Hispanics to join the
[14:41.720 --> 14:47.440]  socialist globalist system to break up the US not to create some wonderful
[14:47.440 --> 14:54.560]  Mexican homeland Mexico's imploded but to destroy all our countries and it's so
[14:54.560 --> 14:57.840]  frustrating to know I'm a hundred percent right because the Ford Foundation
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.080]  the Carnegie Endowment are public about it and to know that people are so
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.360]  confident in their race consciousness that it's going to drive whites into
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.120]  their race consciousness group it's going to drive blacks into their race
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.960]  consciousness group Hispanics all of it and then there won't be a unifying
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.720]  culture of the Bill of Rights Constitution private property the
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.040]  family freedom of religion what really makes us successful let me tell you I
[15:23.040 --> 15:29.600]  can look at all the angles there's not there's not a lot of good waters ahead I
[15:29.600 --> 15:38.560]  hope we can make it through it I hope people can get reality but we are being
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.920]  converted through massive reeducation through the prison system and through
[15:42.920 --> 15:47.320]  the schools America is a giant prison now biggest prison population in the
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.040]  world and they segregate everybody into racial groups in the prison and then
[15:51.040 --> 15:55.880]  and then and then encourage the race gangs and the rest of it and then to
[15:55.880 --> 16:01.240]  then feed that culture out of the public MTV pushes it on record to break up and
[16:01.240 --> 16:09.760]  create division while at the same time when the crisis erupts saying give up
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.640]  all of your culture white people you're inherently bad and it's your fault all
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.840]  this is happening while the social engineers are creating the entire
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.840]  witches brew I guess I'm already getting into the subject it just blows my
[16:24.840 --> 16:29.800]  mind that my taxpayer money in Austin's put up billboards saying rise up
[16:29.800 --> 16:34.540]  Hispanics rise up my people and we've got a link to the video of the artist
[16:34.540 --> 16:41.000]  saying that that's basically if it's okay to be Mexican and it's okay to be for
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.080]  your people in Mexico Mexico was just a Spanish colony Mexico only had the
[16:46.080 --> 16:50.600]  United States for a few years of the Southwest wasn't wrong the French had
[16:50.600 --> 16:55.200]  it to the Russians had California or the Russians gonna I mean can the Spanish
[16:55.200 --> 17:01.320]  come back and take over Texas it's all baloney and America isn't perfect but
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.920]  compared to the government culture in Mexico it's light years better and
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.880]  that's why the globalist want this and I'm already digressing let me just read
[17:08.880 --> 17:14.280]  to you the headlines as I said I would do okay city billboard urges Hispanics
[17:14.280 --> 17:25.280]  to revolt can you imagine of the Austin city said whites rise up can you imagine
[17:25.280 --> 17:28.960]  I ought to try just to just to illustrate it but the media would misrepresent it
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.160]  say I was serious I'll try to go buy a billboard from Reagan billboards that's
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.520]  who this is I bet this billboard probably cost ten thousand dollars
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.560]  conservatively just to paint it probably cost three or four thousand so let's say
[17:40.560 --> 17:43.600]  fifteen thousand dollar billboard because I've looked in the billboards I've paid
[17:43.600 --> 17:48.680]  for them before fifteen thousand dollar giant billboard on I-35 in Austin hundreds
[17:48.680 --> 17:52.000]  of thousand people a month will see it and and the great part about it is

[23:57.320 --> 24:14.320]  com this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I went down
[24:14.320 --> 24:22.100]  down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns the ring of
[24:22.100 --> 24:29.560]  fire you know the taste of love is sweet and hearts like ours mean all right
[24:29.560 --> 24:32.240]  let me just try to go over some more of the headlines here they're too insane
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.800]  so I told you this guy was under mind control it all came out in the news a
[24:36.800 --> 24:40.720]  piece here a piece there that was definitely a staged event and just like
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.480]  Larry Pratt said of governors of America if they stage fast and furious that
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.040]  killed thousands they'd stage anything remember they staged Oklahoma City the
[24:49.040 --> 24:53.520]  very same crew the same Justice Department crew here's Bloomberg nice
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.120]  headline for you California seizes guns as owners lose right to bear arms
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.160]  they're now seeing misdemeanors they're gonna take your guns they're now saying
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.080]  if you ever went to a psychologist who said you had PTSD or depression boom
[25:09.080 --> 25:14.560]  the SWAT teams come take your guns it's all described and and and now they're
[25:14.560 --> 25:17.360]  gonna take basically anybody with a misdemeanor's gun all over the country
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.320]  they're coming they're coming for your guns a Colorado sheriff's Senate Dems
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.980]  threatened pay freezes over gun control opposition and they've now gone public
[25:27.980 --> 25:31.960]  because in that state I guess it's controlled by the state what sheriffs
[25:31.960 --> 25:34.880]  are paid it shouldn't be that way sheriff should be more independent at the
[25:34.880 --> 25:38.240]  county level what the county wants to pay them it is a division of the state
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.200]  though and they were told and they've now gone on record multiple sheriffs you
[25:42.200 --> 25:45.520]  will have your pay cut and so will the deputies if you don't take the guns I
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.920]  mean that is so criminal ladies and gentlemen I mean that's that's bribery
[25:49.920 --> 25:56.120]  right there here's another one out of AP enterprise AP enterprise over that
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.000]  means president Nixon wished for total handgun ban this is run in every paper
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.800]  I've seen Houston Chronicle Dallas morning news Austin America station right
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.720]  here in Austin I looked it up Politico ran it they're really pushing this that
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.320]  hey it's conservative Nixon wanted you to turn in your handguns Nixon was a
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.200]  eugenicist New World Order globalist who opened up communist China to get all
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.320]  our jobs and had price controls but because Democrats went after him
[26:22.320 --> 26:27.600]  conservatives worship him Richard Nixon out Clinton Bill Clinton if you really
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.880]  knew who he was now he was actually in charge he was a globalist but he was
[26:32.880 --> 26:36.520]  running things so they destroyed him then because there's a lot of power you
[26:36.520 --> 26:40.720]  know in fighting going on but that's why we're in so much trouble and it shows
[26:40.720 --> 26:44.800]  how far we've come though back in the 60s and 70s they almost got all the guns
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.240]  they almost got rid of our military then as well to put it under UN then
[26:50.240 --> 26:58.240]  under State Department memorandum and public law 7277 so that's the type of
[26:58.240 --> 27:04.120]  stuff going on look up 7277 the manuals online where we have no military our
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.320]  police are disarmed and UN troops are here that's why you've always heard oh
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.200]  that's coming but we've held it back the old-timers by warning people bought us
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.360]  a lot of time so they've incrementally put a lot of it in but not all of it so
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.040]  that's why you can read what the John Birch Society said in the 60s people
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.640]  like this is crazy now it's all come true basically we held it back they wanted
[27:25.640 --> 27:29.920]  this stuff by the 70s Brzezinski's written books on that he's one of their
[27:29.920 --> 27:37.760]  top statisticians so I'm begging you to become aware of all of this and again a
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.360]  UN department of peace sounds great but it means everybody else has their gun
[27:41.360 --> 27:48.200]  stake and but them including governments okay here's another one share of homes
[27:48.200 --> 27:54.240]  with guns shows four decade decline a New York Times baloney piece they have a
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.520]  poll where they call people up and ask if you own guns and they say a record
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.480]  number say they don't but then I have the numbers in the last three years
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.840]  they've seen I meant to cover this we guys print gun sales triple because I
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.880]  saw I think was Reuters yesterday gun sales have tripled the last three years
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.200]  and they're and they're set to more than triple again when the numbers come out
[28:15.200 --> 28:18.120]  for this year but they're always a few months behind the first few months of
[28:18.120 --> 28:22.160]  this year I mean everybody knows the guns are sold out everybody knows every
[28:22.160 --> 28:25.920]  liberal I knows gone out and woken up and bought guns you know it's coming out
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.800]  that Gabrielle Giffords husbands by an AR-15 so they caught Mayor Bloomberg's
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.840]  top anti-gun guy you know out buying AR-15s and in shooting them I mean it's
[28:35.840 --> 28:42.200]  all coming out you constantly catch Michael Moore with guns or shooting on
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.240]  his property the photos get leaked or bodyguards with guns and he says you
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.040]  should have a dog though they're gun obsessed Barbara Boxer Diane Feinstein
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.040]  they both got multiple bodyguards up to six they've all got concealed carries
[28:57.040 --> 29:03.920]  in their cities they are gun they don't want you to have a gun and that brings
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.800]  me my next article DHS to purchase more firearms is armed buildup intensifies
[29:08.800 --> 29:13.240]  info wars.com Ford's ask if huge ammo buys should become national conversation
[29:13.240 --> 29:16.760]  and again the reason we know this is their chink in the arm or one of the
[29:16.760 --> 29:20.520]  big ones that they got a quite a few armored scales missing and there's pink
[29:20.520 --> 29:24.600]  dragon belly right there we'll just use it they run screaming saying this doesn't
[29:24.600 --> 29:28.640]  exist but now a lot of mainstream media is going but it does exist what let's
[29:28.640 --> 29:32.680]  talk about it well what is going on this is 10 12 15 times now what you ever
[29:32.680 --> 29:36.320]  bought in one year well what's the armored vehicles for what's the doesn't
[29:36.320 --> 29:40.480]  exist doesn't exist don't look over here no no no no me thinks you protest too

[33:52.720 --> 33:59.040]  there's the six flags of Texas but it's taught Mexico is poor because the
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.240]  Southwest was taken the truth is Spain and Mexico couldn't hold the Southwest
[34:03.240 --> 34:09.920]  so they invited the Anglo settlers predominantly which were experts at
[34:09.920 --> 34:15.760]  taking over and killing everybody into the area okay for giant Indian wars and
[34:15.760 --> 34:21.240]  that's what went on and it was pretty much toe-to-toe it's not like it was just
[34:21.240 --> 34:24.280]  one group ganging it up on the other it'd be one native group coming and
[34:24.280 --> 34:27.880]  saying help us kill the other native group so it's just all humans acting the
[34:27.880 --> 34:34.040]  same way barbarism and it organizes around race or culture okay in fact a
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.080]  lot of native tribes would hate the next native tribe a lot more than they
[34:37.080 --> 34:43.800]  hated the you know the round-eyed fork at tongue whites so the worst would rise
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.520]  to the top Balkanization and the same reason the natives couldn't unify and
[34:48.520 --> 34:53.480]  hold North America was the same reason that the globalists are engaging in
[34:53.480 --> 34:57.240]  divide and conquer today it's called divide and conquer it's called
[34:57.240 --> 35:00.720]  Balkanization the British call it the great game so if you want to actually
[35:00.720 --> 35:04.120]  know how the world works instead of getting in your racial group and feeling
[35:04.120 --> 35:08.200]  powerful then I'm the man for you to listen to if you want to actually be
[35:08.200 --> 35:13.160]  informed here's the article up at info wars.com and prison planet.com it went
[35:13.160 --> 35:16.480]  up yesterday evening I'm gonna have it's in the tiles right now I'm gonna have a
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.800]  Don Salazar curtain emma we asked one of them to repost this up to the top
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.800]  there's one people to go see this city paid for billboards $15,000 roughly a
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.320]  piece that's and they've had a bunch of these a riba how do you pronounce it
[35:30.320 --> 35:35.760]  Chris because Richard Reeves is breaking it down for me mehente so up my
[35:35.760 --> 35:44.040]  people rise up my people okay and it shows the border Mexico and the people
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.840]  rising up coming across it with a heart you know say basically which which
[35:49.840 --> 35:53.800]  symbolizes the heart of the people have the heart to rise up and then she says
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.240]  in a video why she did this so the city of and I have to put up with this
[35:57.240 --> 36:02.000]  everywhere I go that there's there's murals there's art and I can read a
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.280]  little Spanish you know my wife obviously can and you know members of the
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.880]  crew that speaks Spanish bring this stuff to me and it's just ongoing when I
[36:10.880 --> 36:16.640]  was in high school in art class they said let's take a art trip to the
[36:16.640 --> 36:19.880]  University of Texas to see an art display it was one of the professors and
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.240]  it was America's bad white people are bad this country's evil and I knew some
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.480]  history I was a senior in high school and I said well wait a minute I said
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.720]  Mexico had a lot of tyranny against the natives as well and there was a lot of
[36:33.720 --> 36:37.840]  oppression and you know Santa Ana was a dictator I mean Guatemala threw him off
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.640]  and you know there were revolts against him in Mexico and and you know over a
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.000]  third of the founders of Texas were Hispanic and you're not that's not
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.920]  taught what's your agenda here and it was basically communism the guy was up
[36:49.920 --> 36:57.200]  there preaching communism in a race-based liberation theology so see I'm
[36:57.200 --> 37:01.720]  against aborting Hispanic babies and having forced abortion in Mexico which
[37:01.720 --> 37:06.640]  is now going on I'm against Hispanics having a what is it 3,000% increase
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.840]  over that in type 2 diabetes the last 20 years it I mean aspartame wood alcohol
[37:12.840 --> 37:17.280]  just hits Hispanics genetically I mean I don't like driving by and seeing
[37:17.280 --> 37:20.520]  Hispanics at every bus stop and I've seen this before with with their legs
[37:20.520 --> 37:24.840]  sawed off young ones you know some evil racist white guy I'd like to go tell
[37:24.840 --> 37:28.560]  them how to not have their legs sawed off but as long as I said Loreca and
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.080]  Keista hell I could blow their houses up if I wanted to and they thank me for it
[37:32.080 --> 37:35.440]  if I gave them a pat on the head and said oh I'm evil white that's right
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.760]  you'll take over now let's saw your legs off it's it's it's social engineers the
[37:40.760 --> 37:43.840]  same ones that took over the black community Margaret Sanger saying 80
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.720]  years ago you pull up her letters online we cover my film in game she says you
[37:48.720 --> 37:52.160]  know these are black weeds these are subhuman but they don't trust whites
[37:52.160 --> 37:57.240]  we've got a higher educated blacks pay them off and get control of these people
[37:57.240 --> 38:00.960]  so we can abort them and kill them and they kill 52% of blacks are never born
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.940]  so actually all the white supremacists and people out there you should love the
[38:05.940 --> 38:09.920]  liberals in Planned Parenthood and I guess you do that's why you hate me so
[38:09.920 --> 38:15.000]  much but again whenever I point this out it's racist Hispanics just going
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.240]  crazy in the comments on YouTube and info wars I mean I I showed in a piece
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.720]  some guys that'll sing songs for you down on the border through the mountains
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.360]  I and I put a clip of that in my big bin thing and I thought it was super
[38:30.360 --> 38:33.120]  romantic I didn't want to leave I wanted to just keep paying the guy five
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.520]  dollars I didn't sing I put a clip of that in there that I just thought was
[38:36.520 --> 38:40.720]  beautiful singing and they said look at the racist showing a Mexican singing no
[38:40.720 --> 38:45.320]  you're the racist against your own people you're the people that are idiots
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.120]  that have bought into this whole mind control I want you to succeed and I
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.040]  want you to get up off your mind control butts and realize that when the
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.280]  globalist engineer this anywhere they play groups in Africa they'll play one
[38:57.280 --> 39:01.400]  group of animus off against the other animus same genetics look almost you
[39:01.400 --> 39:05.040]  know like each other like cousins but they live across the river from each
[39:05.040 --> 39:08.680]  other and they hate each other all day and they'll come and beg white you
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.280]  know mercenaries will give you all the diamonds just kill all of them it's
[39:13.280 --> 39:20.600]  it's racial division it's gang mentality it's putting humans in gangs and
[39:20.600 --> 39:29.800]  that's the type of stuff we're talking about here ladies and gentlemen so where
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.880]  to where things are so racially heightened and there's so much tension
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.240]  that if I put a clip of somebody who sings from the side of the Mexico border
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.440]  through the bokeh is canyon and it sounds magic cameras can't pick it up
[39:44.440 --> 39:50.240]  he knows it sounds beautiful I can't show a minute of somebody singing without
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.280]  Mexicans saying it's racist I'm making fun of Mexicans you have a bad view
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.680]  of yourself you think you're ugly you think you're bad you think you've got
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.440]  a score to settle in as long as you can pull me down you're going to succeed
[40:02.440 --> 40:09.240]  that's not how this world works not in the 21st century especially this is the
[40:09.240 --> 40:13.880]  global technocrats against all of humanity and that's what we're facing
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.160]  you look at the prisons they didn't naturally get like this where we have
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.560]  four plus million people in prison more than communist China has over billion
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.560]  300 million people they create the Hispanic gangs the Asian gangs the
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.200]  white gangs the black gangs and they're run by the warden and the gang racial
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.960]  leaders all report to him and if you don't want to be in a racial gang and
[40:36.960 --> 40:43.480]  get all the tattoos and get bent over and submit to this you get thrown in
[40:43.480 --> 40:51.040]  solitary confinement or stab to death and again they they let the criminals
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.640]  run fraud out of the prisons so they can then buy drugs from the jail guards I
[40:54.640 --> 40:58.720]  mean this is all on record and this is converting our culture with MTV and all
[40:58.720 --> 41:02.720]  of it to the tough guy you're not tough unless you're a criminal you're not
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.440]  tough unless you know when you become a criminal it's designed to lose your
[41:06.440 --> 41:13.280]  rights it's designed to make you a slave reject the criminal gangbanger culture
[41:13.280 --> 41:18.800]  rejects the white supremacist gangbanger culture the Hispanic gangbanger
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.840]  culture the black gangbanger culture the Asian gangbanger culture rejected all
[41:23.840 --> 41:28.080]  but notice what the globalist attack they attack people fleeing to the
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.480]  countryside black white Hispanic believe me I live in the countryside trying to
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.240]  have gardens trying to raise their kids right they just want to raise their
[41:35.240 --> 41:38.840]  kids right you know black homeschoolers live out in the countryside near near
[41:38.840 --> 41:41.920]  where I do they just want to have some horses and chickens and and they know
[41:41.920 --> 41:44.720]  what's going on and their listeners as I've talked to them ran into them at the
[41:44.720 --> 41:47.440]  store hey we're listeners blah blah blah and then I remember they lived and
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.640]  run people like that they're just like me they're just they care about their
[41:50.640 --> 41:55.120]  kids they want a future but they say oh the racist whites are fleeing to the
[41:55.120 --> 42:01.200]  countryside well my gosh if you don't like being stalked and and and having
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.960]  racial epi-pats yelled at you at the gas station when you go into a minority
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.120]  neighborhood or you don't like being physically attacked or mug see you're a
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.480]  racist if you're white you should take your kids out and have the have the the
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.960]  the racial gangs kill them to prove you know you're bad you should say I love
[42:19.960 --> 42:27.120]  the city of Austin paying $15,000 for each billboard that says arise my people
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.680]  showing an army flooding over into Texas and then show the young woman being paid
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.600]  to do this saying yes I want us to be proud of our people of Mexico and I'm
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.440]  from Laredo well why don't you move to Nueva Laredo where thousands die every
[42:42.440 --> 42:45.480]  year on this rocket attacks on newspapers because you won't have to though
[42:45.480 --> 42:49.000]  because we're going to be a narco-terrorist state just like Mexico and
[42:49.000 --> 42:57.280]  that's the globalist plan you'll never hear la raza which means the race you
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.040]  imagine if I started a group called the race we're starting a group called the
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.200]  race for white people I mean I have the articles here but I have a newscast right
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.960]  here California students sent home for wearing US flags on Cinco de Mayo
[43:09.960 --> 43:15.560]  remember that AP judge back school that sent home students wearing American
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.040]  flag shirts on Cinco de Mayo and by the way they were Hispanic and it turned out
[43:20.040 --> 43:25.400]  most the kids were spent they said like not was it nine kids on one day and it
[43:25.400 --> 43:29.000]  turned out they didn't even wear them on purpose the American flags on tons of
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.960]  apparel it turned out it was I think one of them was an American apparel shirt I
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.800]  mean I got stuff with American flags on it because I know what the real good
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.000]  parts of America stand for that flags mine I'm not giving it to the globalist
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.840]  look there's American flag was just behind me and so this is what it's
[43:44.840 --> 43:48.960]  gotten to we're all over the country they pull down American flags and stomp on
[43:48.960 --> 43:56.360]  them at postal service post offices and and it's crazed it's crazed racial
[43:56.360 --> 44:01.080]  garbage and then no one's supposed to talk about it as they run TV ads we've
[44:01.080 --> 44:06.080]  shown these on on by the way white-owned you know you know big Spanish cable
[44:06.080 --> 44:09.000]  systems and stuff in the US you can look these up I think I'm gonna have Watson
[44:09.000 --> 44:15.480]  one of the guys wrote a whole article on it going over the fact that if you look
[44:15.480 --> 44:23.240]  at it they have these big billboards saying LA USA Crossout USA Mexico
[44:23.240 --> 44:29.560]  remember that a few years ago or big billboards that say la infusora or the
[44:29.560 --> 44:35.120]  invasion or la reconquista the reconquering and this is what I was
[44:35.120 --> 44:45.400]  taught at Anderson High School by actually my social studies teacher and
[44:45.400 --> 44:50.840]  then by the art teacher who by the way were white and and they were there as
[44:50.840 --> 44:55.480]  technocrats knowing full well what they were doing you see that's the thing they
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.840]  know they want they do you think they want Hispanics who by the way it's done
[44:59.840 --> 45:03.840]  deal for all the white supremacists out there Hispanics are the future over half
[45:03.840 --> 45:08.920]  the kids in America are now Hispanic in America but you know what the new old
[45:08.920 --> 45:13.160]  order can't have them going I want guns I want private property I want to raise
[45:13.160 --> 45:16.400]  my family I don't want to have forced inoculations I don't want forced abortion
[45:16.400 --> 45:25.720]  you're gonna have dirty leg dirty toe cheese sandal fake hippie beatnik garbage
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.320]  shoved down your throat just like Latin America has as communism is the only way
[45:30.320 --> 45:34.680]  you got global corporate monopolies that love communism at the grassroots and
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.040]  that's what you're gonna be forced to have and that's your future and that's
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.520]  what you get and folks I've sat there at demonstrations in Austin where they
[45:43.520 --> 45:47.920]  were where where there are guys that look just like Che Guevara you know I
[45:47.920 --> 45:53.320]  mean they're they're into it with the hat the the beard the whole deal and we
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.400]  tried video this we've shown it and there weren't shirts remember a few years
[45:56.400 --> 46:02.960]  ago that said plan to San Diego which was a plan to kill all whites over the
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.640]  age of 16 look up the plan of San Diego UT endorses it on their website and I
[46:08.640 --> 46:11.760]  go over and I go you don't care about the abortion of Hispanics no I don't
[46:11.760 --> 46:18.600]  we're gonna get you you don't care about about all the GMO the tyranny no we
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.000]  don't we're gonna get you we know your races because you're white and it's
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.640]  just all part of this imaginary dressed up like soldiers we're gonna get you
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.280]  know get you but then at the same time people say well then why would you have
[46:31.280 --> 46:34.200]  something like a mortal technique on well he says that he understands
[46:34.200 --> 46:37.720]  communism as a system but doesn't think it's good and as part of the control
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.920]  mechanism and he says he wants to empower everybody and that he gets a lot of
[46:41.920 --> 46:47.560]  what I'm saying so I'm trying to reach out to people but the larger issue is is
[46:47.560 --> 46:51.320]  that at a at another level when whites are attacked and whites are told their
[46:51.320 --> 46:54.720]  scum or white kids are beat up at school and then told by the school that's the
[46:54.720 --> 46:59.840]  way it is they they run not out of even racism and so what's happened is they
[46:59.840 --> 47:03.960]  use the leftist movement to make whites all guilty for social engineering not
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.080]  for general equality and empowerment then whites have figured that out and so
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.040]  instead of realizing a larger game plan they are running in droves and becoming
[47:14.040 --> 47:18.600]  super militant and and can't even call it racist they're just tribal they're like
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.400]  well I want other people to do good you know overall and average are
[47:23.400 --> 47:26.440]  sophisticated enough from education and things to get it but it doesn't matter
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.640]  I'm still not wanting and so whites get that and and again that's meant to have
[47:31.640 --> 47:37.560]  them be scared as a main gang with the government who will be the referee in
[47:37.560 --> 47:42.280]  all of this you see the government doesn't want the people together under
[47:42.280 --> 47:45.760]  Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence which has never even
[47:45.760 --> 47:49.360]  been fully realized but produced more wealth than anything that earth's ever
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.200]  seen they don't want that they don't want that they want liberation
[47:55.200 --> 47:58.440]  theologies you know I said that to a mortal technique I said well a lot of
[47:58.440 --> 48:01.360]  this is liberal liberation theology you're putting out that was put up with a
[48:01.360 --> 48:06.120]  globalist he goes well regardless it still has some good points well anything
[48:06.120 --> 48:13.120]  seductive does but do the globalist want to help Mexico do the globalist want
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.040]  to help Latin America the answer is no do the globalist want our guns to take
[48:17.040 --> 48:20.280]  care of the kids no they want to enslave us has Mexico taken all the guns and as
[48:20.280 --> 48:24.320]  the highest crime rate in the world yes do the glow are the globalist funding
[48:24.320 --> 48:28.280]  forced abortions in Mexico are they funding for sterilizations in Mexico
[48:28.280 --> 48:33.440]  and you can say well there are too many people okay so I don't want Mexicans
[48:33.440 --> 48:38.520]  dead I mean I want you to have kids you would lighten their eyes who love
[48:38.520 --> 48:43.040]  liberty because then they're a human being that's that's a soldier for
[48:43.040 --> 48:48.120]  freedom in the future but you know what it is it is an absolute even if I have
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.680]  good will even if I have a good heart I still know that this message will not
[48:52.680 --> 48:56.440]  get through to most whites most blacks most Hispanics most Asians you name it
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.720]  just we just feels too good to just say whites are the devil and then whites

[54:26.320 --> 54:29.600]  be a powerful interview I'm gonna try to shut up and let him roll with his
[54:29.600 --> 54:35.000]  answers you know on the subject of what's happening the globalist are scared
[54:35.000 --> 54:41.000]  to death of Latin America full of really smart hard-working people ever
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.560]  getting a 1776 ever figuring out private property not having L hefes you know
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.080]  strong men over them that's what everybody fled from Europe and then of
[54:51.080 --> 54:54.200]  course they just rebuilt the tyranny they lived under here but still there was
[54:54.200 --> 55:00.320]  that kernel of the Enlightenment and the Renaissance and freedom and when you
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.960]  when I see the big global corporations and the big white-owned it's very
[55:04.960 --> 55:13.480]  interesting you know Anglo owned Jewish owned you name it major media this is
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.040]  different owners but we've done whole reports on it pushing hey LA is Mexico
[55:18.040 --> 55:24.320]  hey Texas is Mexico hey revolt hey get white people race shells in a primitive
[55:24.320 --> 55:27.960]  level for everybody and it makes sense and everybody's been wrong one way or
[55:27.960 --> 55:32.160]  the other and so then you start blaming whole groups and they say hey support
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.920]  Democratic Party support socialism support gun control you'll show whitey
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.640]  take his guns that's gonna be your guns that are taken the globalist everything
[55:42.640 --> 55:47.080]  they do is anti-human I'll assure you if you're a quote minority which is really
[55:47.080 --> 55:51.520]  the majority now in this country the globalists do not have your best
[55:51.520 --> 55:54.520]  interest at heart and they don't have my best interest at heart and white people
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.240]  do not get a memo saying don't drink hydrofluorosalic acid they don't get a
[55:58.240 --> 56:02.800]  memo saying don't eat GMO soy they don't get a memo saying don't put your kids
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.280]  in public school they don't get a memo they get a memo saying you're evil
[56:06.280 --> 56:12.080]  cuz you're white if you marry a white person it's cuz you're racist and blah
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.960]  blah blah and and and again they forced a gangster gangster culture on to
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.600]  everybody whatever you see done in the black community is a beta test on record
[56:20.600 --> 56:24.440]  they test everything in the black community they don't just inject black
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.200]  people syphilis folks they've been caught injecting everybody that doesn't
[56:28.200 --> 56:31.360]  lessen what happened to blacks they've gotten the the really bad end of the
[56:31.360 --> 56:37.040]  stick because they were a group seen as inferior and oh it's okay the globalist
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.760]  could get away with more of that everybody's being hit by this we're in
[56:41.760 --> 56:48.440]  this together and I really want to beat the globalist I really do and you know
[56:48.440 --> 56:51.360]  I'll be honest with you wouldn't be such an issue of 30 million illegal aliens
[56:51.360 --> 56:54.760]  were here if they weren't on welfare a lot of them and if they were constitutional
[56:54.760 --> 56:57.800]  it would support the Second Amendment and support property rights the problem
[56:57.800 --> 57:02.720]  is I see the polls they vote over 90% you see all the illegal voting going on
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.040]  but even once they're citizens to take guns for socialism I mean my god they
[57:07.040 --> 57:10.200]  had a whole bunch of the Hispanic Congress people endorse Hugo Chavez when
[57:10.200 --> 57:17.520]  he died and Shea Guevara and socialism and total gunbands I mean whoa whoa I
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.480]  mean go talk to conservative Cuban Americans how about all the communists
[57:22.480 --> 57:25.360]  from Cuba that are pro-comy come to Florida they'll turn into a communist
[57:25.360 --> 57:29.840]  state overnight I mean this is a serious issue they attach communism and
[57:29.840 --> 57:35.520]  socialism that's a globalist control tool on the racial liberation theology
[57:35.520 --> 57:43.320]  agendas I want us all liberated I want everybody empowered I genuinely know
[57:43.320 --> 57:47.080]  you reap what you sow man if I even think about doing something bad to
[57:47.080 --> 57:52.840]  somebody it isn't social conditioning it's my gut it's my spirit it's my it's
[57:52.840 --> 57:56.760]  my programming from the Almighty that that that that I shrink away from it
[57:56.760 --> 58:00.840]  even if I have the thought that's not even you know my own thought of my heart
[58:00.840 --> 58:05.000]  but just a thought my brain is looking at different angles I go and actually
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.520]  shake inside that's what God fear is I don't fear man I don't I mean they could
[58:10.520 --> 58:13.960]  kill my wife my kids kill me I'm not happy about that but if that's what
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.920]  happens that's God's will because I don't have fear of man I have God fear I
[58:18.920 --> 58:24.640]  have but it's not like even conscious it's overwhelming I don't want you to
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.080]  kill your kids and I talked to all these minority groups they're like oh
[58:28.080 --> 58:30.720]  abortion's great we got to do it I'm like that's killing your people they're
[58:30.720 --> 58:35.080]  like shut up whitey I'm like I don't want you to kill yourself like oh yeah

[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.320]  year is paying over 65% in some form of tax and that's not enough and then you

[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:08.360]  jack diddly squat and they're lobbying for more of the people that make a
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.120]  hundred and $25,000 a year of their money because the big mega rich get it

[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.280]  hiding under a rock or if they don't they'll recognize his voice but the point
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.600]  is is his website we're also going to be giving that out for everybody it's P
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:15.640]  griff dot info we're gonna have that up on screen for everybody as well just the
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.280]  letter P griff dot info and they're on tour right now they're going
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.640]  into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year and I've been following Professor
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.080]  Griff since I was about 11 years old as I grew up in Dallas and you know was on
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.400]  the football team a lot of my friends you know introduced me to you know the
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.640]  first rap that was coming out I really loved it along with rock and roll and
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.880]  everything else out there but I really loved public enemy and just the sound
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.880]  and so then over the years I kind of followed along with what Professor Griff
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.560]  was really saying and then would see how the media would spin and distort and
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.640]  also some of the government stuff he's gone through but he can get into that if
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.480]  he wants to we'll get into the Illuminati and hip-hop which is just
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.640]  constantly thrown in our face but also in rock and roll so many hip-hop and
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.240]  rock and roll folks have now gone public and said they're told to do that by the
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.200]  business I've talked to a former high-level people from MTV and major rock
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.480]  stars who were in the meetings when they said we're gonna stop pushing all this
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.040]  grassroots rock and hip-hop you know rap we're gonna go with gangster kill them you
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.320]  know all this garbage so that that was on purpose we're gonna get into all that
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.200]  with him we're gonna talk about so much more here today with Professor Griff on
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.560]  the broadcast with us I've got a lot of questions he's got a lot of points he
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.760]  wants to make we were just talking during the break Professor Griff first
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.640]  it was great to hear your voice over the line and it's great to have you here
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.240]  with us today oh give thanks likewise um I just want to let you know that um I've
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.720]  been an info warrior for a minute unbeknownst to a lot of people I was
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.440]  an info warrior when it wasn't even popular to be one in the hood
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:57.640]  wow wow especially in rapping hip-hop because there's not too many people like
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.600]  myself that was disseminating information and it's not connected by any
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.080]  means necessary but we say by any all that every means necessary well you were
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.760]  an info warrior before I was an info warrior well I was there or I was there
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.640]  on the scene disseminating the information however I could get it
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.480]  it's just that I didn't have access to a lot of information I could get away if I
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.240]  could pick it up from well I've been fascinated in my off time listening to a
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.640]  lot of underground interviews you did also some big ones you know just laying
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.960]  you know down a lot of deep knowledge let's let's give you the floor here you
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.520]  first off you want to get into getting the info out let's talk about it well
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.480]  disseminating the information and I think it's a three-step process first of all
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.720]  you have to be awakened aware to even want to seek the information out then
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.040]  there comes the time where you you you don't have to quote unquote believe it
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.120]  I don't get into the whole concept of belief and then faith and I know some
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.960]  religious people that are listening please go look those two words up and
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.040]  then you can oh professor grip directly we can talk but you have to have some
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:08.040]  courage to disseminate the information on this certain degree of courage that
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:15.400]  you have to have in order to disseminate the information not only in this small
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  group of people that surround us that are ready to listen to it but take it out
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.400]  to the 85% of the masses of the people that really are not checking for it so
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.280]  we have to be able to put it in a language that the people understand it
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.280]  with public enemy first came out coming out of Long Island New York people were
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.680]  not checking for a small rap group speaking truth to power talking about
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.680]  the government talking about local and global issues it was very very difficult
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.000]  thing so that threats came from sometimes from within the side of the
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.200]  black community but the threats came from some ignorant white folks some
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.720]  threats came from from abroad especially when we were internationally we started
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.720]  making the connection because as you know Alex that the news that we get from
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.080]  America is not the same news you get from abroad no it's in it's from all
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.440]  different angles so you start really seeing the propaganda when you see the
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.160]  foreign news exactly so then you start to tie the two together then when you
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.920]  start meeting people from different cultures you start to get a well-rounded
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.560]  view on what this thing is actually actually about and I've seen it at a
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.120]  young age and by the time by the time the public enemy thing happened we were
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.840]  abroad the shocking thing that that shocked me as you just admitted that
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.880]  you've been following this thing and since 11 12 years old but now it's being
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.720]  older white men bringing their sons and their grandchildren to the concerts and
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.440]  it's a beautiful thing and that's I told you during the break the public
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.480]  enemy it's never been about a white and black thing always been about human
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.720]  family well I want to expand more on that but at its core what is the a new
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.840]  world order what is the Illuminati what is its end game because it's carrying
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.880]  out as you know eugenics operations against everybody but the apple of its
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.360]  eye is Africa and that's where in some countries you know they've they've
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.960]  carried out bio weapons attacks and killed more than half the people and and
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.880]  and so many quote liberal yuppies they're like well there are too many
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.720]  people well wait a minute I thought you're this big liberal I mean you're
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.560]  really gonna sign on just make a joke about and and tacitly admit that you
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.560]  know this stuff's going on but it's something we're just gonna keep in the
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.000]  back of the room I mean huge things are going on is my point what is at the heart
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.280]  from your research all the books you've written the videos everything you've got
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.400]  on your site what is at the core of this the end game I think the end game
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.000]  once again is this um it's three or four different things but I think the end
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.680]  game simply is population control and if we can probably control the population
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.920]  by controlling certain individuals in certain aspects on what was going on a
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.480]  global scale then I think they will they will be successful but I truly believe
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.960]  in my heart of hearts that they will not be successful at all we are we have set
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.920]  them back several times for them to go back to the growing board so the end
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.760]  game would be population control the end game with controlling the population
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:22.080]  would be my control the end game would be even if we're we're existing on the
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.760]  planet that's all we're doing is existing we're useless either to them we're
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.360]  units as they wrote about us in Rex 84 the king offer plan we're useless we're
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.120]  useless eaters we're sheeple we're just we're just here almost like like zombies
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.840]  and they actually have a drug on the street now I don't know if you've heard
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.480]  of the Molly it's definitely happening in the black community where you see these
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.720]  guys it's almost like you meet you're meeting them you seeing them it's like
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.680]  the lights on but no one home that's what they want they please in this
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.040]  place over their eyes and you really can't even reach them with this kind of
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.400]  drugs like this on the street it buys it buys into the whole idea of the end game
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.160]  be my controlled kind of Manchurian candidates sort of speak kind of
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.160]  zombies that are operating out here you know it's funny you mentioned that
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.400]  trance I came across videos that I'd seen at the time when they were first
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.560]  leaked 15 years ago or so of Clinton when makeups being put on him or during
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.800]  interviews and I've talked to people that knew Clinton had him on the show you
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.840]  know had on girl friends old friends people attacked by him that Clinton
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.800]  would like go into these baby like trances whenever he'd get on the
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.360]  telephone and get orders and that sounds crazy to people that haven't
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.280]  actually watched it but later I'm gonna show TV viewers will post on info wars
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.320]  a couple clips of Clinton during satellite feeds when he wasn't live
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.360]  shifting into something that's not a joke he's clearly in like a three year
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:17:00.640]  old mind control trance exactly and then and now it's not only with the
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.160]  Bill Clinton of the world these are the actual these are actually averaged
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.040]  every day citizens black white and everyone in between and they're doing
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.640]  it with higher frequencies by of the music that's right by other food by the
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:21.160]  drugs by a these are the truth of these people see these low-frequency admit
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.360]  that televisions and thousands of studies will literally thousands as you
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.480]  know but for listeners he's not joking here is rewiring kids brains making them
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:35.600]  highly suggestible and most people are now in a sleep state a waking oh what's
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.800]  the proper term sleepwalking state right we did a song called night at the
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:47.000]  living bed head yes when this was when track cocaine had hit and it was our
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.760]  answer to it and if functional functional zombies functional crackheads you
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.480]  know they're under this they a lot of times they don't even know it and when
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:02.080]  you make them aware of these particular things that they call you crazy it's
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.640]  amazing I've done a test where you actually give people commands on the
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.000]  street and if you do it confidently they'll start abating like robots even
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.560]  police and it's really freaking me out because what you're saying is true the
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.720]  public more and more is going into deeper and deeper levels of a trance how
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.320]  do we break them out of that I think what we need to do is make people awake
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.880]  and aware that we have to put living food in a living body this is the only way
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.520]  we have to put living living information when I say food I mean on a
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.840]  spiritual level intellectual level mental level and a physical level when I
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.040]  say food I just don't eat physical food but you have to put food living food in
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.760]  a living body there's no other way to keep the human being alive we have to
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.880]  feed the human being living living food if this information that you and I and
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.960]  all of the info warriors that are out there trying to disseminate to the
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:00.560]  people not five on a live we should not possibly continue this particular work
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:07.440]  simply because it's a dead information it's dead information so today 2013 if
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.000]  we're having a conversation on the Alex Jones show and we regurgitate and do the
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.080]  Obama Decepticon remix it has to be viable to today what's going on with
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.360]  Eric Holder what's going on with drones do we need to talk about this debate
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.200]  and what does that have to do with the music of the mass of the people I want
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.160]  to get into that let's talk about your book we'll put it on screen dealing with
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:36.440]  the CIA covert war the psychological covert war on hip-hop and how they've
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.640]  branded it and how they've taken it over and turned it into the culture killing
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.920]  thing that it is today again the Minister of Information for Public
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.120]  Enemy being inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year Professor
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:55.440]  Griff is our guest and the website is pgryph.info please continue
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.440]  well you didn't there wasn't a 40 and you said it right the CIA
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:07.080]  back in 1976 I don't know if you familiar with a young lady her name is May
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:15.160]  Brussels yes well in her operation chaos as she called it on the moderate pop to
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.000]  the different festival that we're on doing this doing the doing the 60s she
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.280]  said that there was a CIA war against the 60s counterculture and after reading
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:30.200]  that document it said it said something off in my mind I'm thinking well that's
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.040]  the same thing that's going on now May Brussels said this back then so when I
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.040]  started putting together the psychological covert war on hip-hop I had to go
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.000]  back and re-vamp the book and I had to talk about the Illuminati's takeover of
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.600]  hip-hop now some people thought I was crazy but when I looked inside of hip-hop
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.760]  and I started seeing some of the information that you talk about on your
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.840]  show some of the information that Jordan Maxwell Michael Tessarian and David
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.040]  I can some other people talk about I'm like wow I'm seeing that those things in
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.240]  hip-hop so I wonder if I can make the connection so when I did make the
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:10.000]  connection once again it took a lot out of me to present it to relatively a
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.960]  group of people that was just close to it so I had to become civil literate and
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.400]  when I started explaining what was going on it landed me in some trouble on some
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.920]  things that I don't care to speak about right now because of a more suit but I
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.440]  can just kind of hit around it right now they're attacking me
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.920]  simply because I'm pointing out the the affiliation of the African male inside
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.800]  of hip-hop and because of that we have some high some people that are on high
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.440]  so to speak they're probably high but they're on high so to speak that want
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.080]  to shut professor Griff down but they're doing it by trying to attack public
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.080]  enemy as a whole and I don't want to threaten the brothers chances of getting
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.640]  into rock and roll hall of fame to this actually to handle this kind of
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.120]  conversation with kid gloves I said I don't mind because this is not about
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.880]  professor group it's no big I and little you this thing is a lot larger than
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:09.720]  professor Griff but I can't say this if we are walking around today and you're
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.360]  walking through the malls and you you're seeing young people and the
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:20.440]  feminization is going on especially among young black kids from the ages of 12
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:28.600]  to 21 should I not speak on it because it's STDs on the rise if homosexuality
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.160]  and bisexuality is on the rise I'm not I don't care what people sleep with in the
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.320]  privacy of their own homes I'm saying to you that's affecting the masses of the
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.320]  point is when they're pushing for folks to have 200 sexual partners in a week
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.880]  and that's no joke ladies and gentlemen these people are gonna end up dying of
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.320]  HIV and hepatitis and all this it is extremely destructive the lifestyle of
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.320]  drugs and sex and all of this being pushed and it's everywhere where they
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.960]  are pushing this on little kids everywhere as is in the documents for
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.000]  population control because once they've gotten rid of masculinity and men the
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.560]  state is now the daddy and he can kill mommy and the kids Hitler said first you
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:13.440]  get the women then you've got the children so follow the men they've got
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.120]  to get rid of men basically that's why they feed us estrogen in the food and
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.920]  the plastics it hyper feminizes women so they're the big you know boss you know
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.240]  the house slaves what I call it white women black women it doesn't matter the
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.360]  Romans figured it out with their white German slaves you put the women in the
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.120]  house the men as slaves outside the women will oppress the men and then you
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.400]  hyper feminized them the women with the estrogens and it turns the men into the
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.040]  little M or little W women go ahead
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:47.880]  I just got a text from my other line someone apparently is listening I just
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.920]  got a text when they said just be a little bit more transparent you have to
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.680]  go ahead so I'm thinking that this is someone listening that's handling this
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.240]  case so let me be a little bit more transparent these two people that I'm
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:08.560]  speaking of I'll be particularly crazy Jones and Will Smith the information
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.360]  came to me it came to me in confidence and I gave my words to individual that
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:20.920]  I will not review my store but when I put it out I didn't want Percy Jones
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.520]  I was actually attacking them when you just say it was beautiful because I
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:32.960]  see me feminization a practice we're on in the hip hop along with that with
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:36.240]  the faith it went through the first phase was you had to be there to
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.960]  understand it pop wasn't too many people out in the dark in the park with us
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.240]  you understand the same with hip hop we're giving birth to that's what the
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.240]  phase of hip hop was a golden era the caucus ever era which gave birth to a
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.360]  poor right this question rise intelligent new brand new beings public
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.320]  enemy big daddy came care as one somebody other somebody of the group that
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.080]  were very positive at that particular time shortly after that thanks to rap
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.440]  kick in the neutralized conscious hip hop with a neutralized conscious hip hop
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.320]  when the car that album that dr. Drey put out this kind of hip hop was dead at
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.600]  that point we started the city of feminization process and bugging and
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.640]  balling and pimping and all these negative things into hip hop and we
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.960]  see hip hop on the decline now we don't even have it but we just have a wrap and
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.320]  I think you listen to me to understand difference between the two hip hop is
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.080]  the umbrella rap is one of the elements that's got it yeah and we need to
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:42.120]  understand that well breaking this down when you said your phone got tapped into
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:47.280]  we just heard the audio change someone is listening in the quality is not as
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.960]  good are are you saying someone broke into your phone or what's going on no
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:58.760]  well I just got a message I don't know who the message came from and the
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.040]  message is came through the phone that I need to be a little bit more
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.600]  transparent well that's crazy that that actually heard audio change on the phone
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.960]  when you said that somebody broke in on the phone expanding on this how have you
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:29.120]  seen yeah that's definitely not what I do I don't do lectures and beat up on
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.240]  homosexuals and anyone else the information that you stated that's
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:38.640]  already sure the point is is that when I pointed out that that all over the
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.400]  western world the fish are becoming bisexual and so are the frogs we are
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.480]  biologically being manipulated and and I don't get up here and bash people on
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.760]  race or sex or any of that the point is the point is in women it's accelerating
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:59.160]  breast cancer on record that's a fact the best phenol a so so so let's I mean
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.000]  they call me a homophobe per saying hey little kids juice boxes are changing
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.480]  their sexual persuasion but also giving them cancer that's in major studies and
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.840]  they're scared to death when I bring that up they don't ever ask why are women
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.600]  dying of breast cancer at record numbers it's always let's find a cure why not
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.040]  let's find out why this is happening exactly and that's precisely my point
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.240]  so when I when I mentioned two of two of of music icons and entertain icon of
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.200]  Will Smith and put the Jones in my lecture all of a sudden now I'm a
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.840]  hater all of a sudden now I'm all these other kind of evil nasty names and then
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.360]  I get phone calls from their assistant saying that they want to see me well
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.720]  I'm available you have my number I put my number out on YouTube millions of
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.600]  people have my number only one can call me but I got the phone I received a
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.160]  phone call from there I said well let's get up and take the face I never got a
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.800]  phone call back so this is not anything personal against Quincy Jones
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:02.520]  there's not anything personal against Will Smith I laid out the agenda that I
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.520]  put in my book the psychological covert war on your top it is a war going on
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.600]  it's on a covert level and they're using the music to get with the people well
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:16.320]  look I don't want them teaching six-year-olds in school any type of
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.600]  sex period I mean that is absolutely out of control that's going on worldwide
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.720]  you've heard about where they teach in US schools I can pull up guys type in
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.720]  six-year-olds taught to masturbate in public schools I mean period that is
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.280]  pedophilia and so you're talking about it I don't know about the beef going on
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.640]  I hadn't you know read your book yet but I do want to read it what we've been
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.400]  showing it on screen so I'm not aware of the things you're raising but
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:47.280]  specifically I am aware of moves that I was told by executives to make it
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.200]  gangster to make it violent to make it anti-woman to make it thuggish to make
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.880]  it look like a big joke as a cultural poison things that KRS one has talked
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.680]  about also in the Obama deception what is your take on that Professor Griff one
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.040]  of the founders of public enemy well you see that is very very key simply because
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.480]  I've read the same document that's been put out there and it's true because some
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.680]  of the same record execs and some of the people that are tied into the multi
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:21.080]  national corporation apparatus for Vindi and other companies are the same
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:26.520]  people that own and invest in and have stocked in private prisons so they have
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.560]  to fill the prison cells they have to fill the prison base stay there we got

[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.520]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.080]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.160]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.640]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely

[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.880]  digress right now but talk about persecution the stuff that professor
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.440]  griff's gone through the things that I've seen behind the scenes but for me it
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.880]  only makes you stronger because fighting is in fighting for truth is what really
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.680]  empowers you and so I just appreciate people that have courage and the system
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.520]  can misconstrue and twist what I say they can do the professor griff and
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.080]  none of us agree with each other a hundred percent because I don't agree with
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.040]  myself every day with some things I hear myself say because I wish I would have
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.520]  said it better you know there's so much knowledge in the world we learn more

[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.200]  coming out we're going to be talking about that as well but you got cut off by
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.600]  the break and that was intriguing so really I mean I lay it out for us here
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.400]  I mean it's your show for the next 10 minutes or so before I get into some
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.440]  other topics and maybe jam in a few calls professor griff founder of public
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:34.240]  enemy hip-hop rap icon expanding on this professor griff you were getting cut off
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.440]  in the break talking about the agenda of the takeover of hip-hop and rap what the
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.080]  system wants because they're invested in the prison complex with the biggest
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:48.800]  prison population they're now having folks can look this up prison guards from
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.080]  the big companies as guards at public schools literally inducting the kids
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.880]  into prison the new slavery everything is geared to get you into prison that
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:02.000]  way they take your rights away for petty crimes so so break it down professor
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.200]  griff and lay out what you were saying during the break to me about the
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.840]  takeover of hip-hop because this is inside knowledge people need to know
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.320]  because control of music is the control of culture go ahead
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:20.160]  conversations that I often have with Chuck D when I run into a mortal
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.360]  technique and wise intelligence a poor range of teachers and other brothers
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.240]  that are here and that are doing hip-hop that's involved in it that speak truth
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.400]  to power and our eyes are open we had a discussion in reference to the
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.280]  anonymous letter that was put out on the internet the anonymous letter too long
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:46.760]  to read but an ingest or this is it said that these executives had owned and
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.920]  have stock in private prisons and these are the same record execs that green
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.000]  life certain projects the open comment others that you may see they control
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.680]  their entire careers based on these new contracts that's been in place for the
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:10.280]  last I'd say 10 years which is this contract these deals call the 360 deal and
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.600]  what the 360 deal is is the fact that if you could if you take a certain major
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.240]  circle and cut it up into eight pieces of a pie put your CD or your album in the
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.160]  middle of that pie all the other pieces of the pie are ancillary properties
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:28.260]  based on the music that you put out so pieces of the power consists of
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:33.200]  merchandise deal live shows endorsements yada yada yada until you fill up the eight
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.560]  pieces of the pie that is your whole entire life that is a 360 deal so
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.960]  regardless of however you have make income money coming in they will they
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:50.880]  get a piece of that that they control your entire life listen they have you
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.240]  for a lifetime because they are the ones responsible for new renewing your
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.680]  contract and then they have not only international rights and domestic rights
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.840]  now they have a new thing in the contract it says universal and global
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:10.200]  rights dealing with the universe so I read an article on how will I am it's
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.760]  gonna record something and send a song down from Mars it's kind of mad yet
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.120]  dealing with holograms and see these people know what they're doing they're
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.160]  putting the things in the apparatus in place and they maneuvering the artist to
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.760]  buy into these 360 deals look at the Super Bowl it's openly
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:34.000]  Illuminati with Madonna and then the other lady this year I mean it's openly
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.360]  Illuminati with Janet Jackson with all of it now with Lady Gaga with other
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.600]  women wearing you know people's teeth around their neck talking about killing
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:52.160]  kids 666 what is the point behind all this I think to galvanize the the energy
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:57.640]  radiating from us as human beings to get everyone on the same table it says the
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.640]  Big New Brzezinski made a statement he says in earlier days we can control a
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:09.400]  million people as opposed to killing a million people but I think Benny said
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:14.440]  then in latter day today we're talking about I think he said that we will it's
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  easier to kill a million people as it is to control them well that's what he said
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:23.080]  exactly I mean the actual quote what guys pull up it's something like you know
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:28.000]  20 years ago it was cheaper to to control and buy off a million people now
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.960]  it's cheaper to kill them but if they felt that they could just control one
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.800]  individual like Jay-Z and if Jay-Z has a million two million fans then we could
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:43.760]  control those two to three million people pretty much pretty pretty much so
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.560]  but you have to keep that one individual in check but since the advent of the
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.960]  internet and this information out there people have been coming awake and the
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.480]  way to the schemes in the games and they even said themselves recently that
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.160]  there's only six percent of the population that believe that the news media is
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.200]  strong this madness that comes from the media is multi-emic destruction in
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.960]  America we know there's only a handful of people that control the media everything
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.040]  you touch taste smell and see on TV the big screen and the small screen is being
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.920]  controlled absolutely and look at the message now gun owners are racist the
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:27.040]  militia guys are going to start a race war and there's no real proof or truth
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.040]  there believe me I know I'm in it and it's everybody in and of all racist
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.240]  colors and creeds wants freedom and knows the system the man wants our guns
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.360]  but they're running a script just like they did before Oklahoma City and
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.120]  they're getting ready to stage false flag attacks in this country what's your
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.760]  take on that professor Griff I think it's very very very true and it's not
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:51.160]  anything that we have to run around and and wear on our sleeves and convince
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.320]  people that this is true because it's happened in history before only we have
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.240]  to do is study history and we talked about that on the break about the
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.640]  Aegean dialectic principle they control both sides they can exacerbate the
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:09.360]  tensions from extreme to extreme different camps and make it appear with a
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.560]  video or as they did in a wag the dog and some of these other movies what was
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.880]  the movie that they just got an award for the last week
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.720]  yeah zero dark Easter Bunny and Argo all of it Argos more true than zero dark
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.280]  Easter Bunny as I call it but it's all a bunch of fiction made up garbage
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.080]  exactly so they can control both sides and then they get they can put it in you
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.560]  throw it in your subconscious mind and trigger it when they want to trigger it
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.480]  and they can trigger it with entertainment trigger it with food trigger it
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:47.000]  with with the music with the vibrations in the music it'll make you think that
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.920]  there's a race war going on and it's nice bright and sunny outside and this is
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:59.080]  sad because we thought that once upon a time that we were making progress as
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.880]  far as the human family is concerned coming together on then they made it
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.440]  they made it appear that we needed Barack Obama but the whole idea of the
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:14.720]  Barack Obama was like you said was just a broad sweep of deception they use
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:20.040]  Barack Obama to get back into Africa to sign off on Africa multi-national
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.080]  corporations can go back to Africa to colonize to recolonize Africa to get
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.440]  the precious minerals they think that they need to continue to make
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:35.600]  phones that I've had you're right and it was my own research Webster Tarpoli's
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:38.040]  countless others but we said they're gonna take out Libya they're gonna take
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.120]  out Syria Africa's gonna invade at least 10 countries they made up that whole
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:45.920]  Coney thing has been dead for six years to say that they can invade any country
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.680]  in Africa now they are and even came out in several African countries last month
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.680]  that the presidents came out and said they're running al-Qaeda to attack their
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.560]  own refineries as a pretext to invade it's totally fake Mohammed Karzai came
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.000]  out and said the US runs Taliban al-Qaeda two days ago more and more though the
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.760]  facade is falling when you say they're behind they say they're behind their
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.040]  own internal stuff that leaks you're absolutely right so how do you see this
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.880]  professor grip unfolding these people aren't God sure they have power as long
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.640]  as they're invisible and we don't know they're there but when we throw sand on
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.120]  them we can then see their outline more and more they're operating like
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.000]  they're invisible but they're not their old lives aren't working anymore where
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.400]  do you in your gut because I've heard you on other shows really roll with it
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.560]  you know me and you know what you're talking about where do you see this
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:38.140]  going in your 25 years of fighting the Illuminati how do you see it all
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:44.880]  shaken out I think my gut is telling me that the masses of the people are
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.040]  becoming awake in a way we just need to get over some of the hurdles we have to
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:54.760]  begin to start trusting one another and trusting the information that we share
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:45:01.320]  with one another I can't I can't begin to say to the people I mean just from
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:07.000]  just just from my gut and the work I've done with Chuck Flavor the rest of the
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.200]  guys in the group that we've been reaching out and then reaching millions
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.560]  of people in the face of adversity we must begin to act like it's impossible to
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:22.720]  fail and the information how many times Alex Jones professor grip and other
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.360]  people have to say the same thing for the people to understand that this is
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:30.240]  what's going on in the world and these are the games and the tricks that they're
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.120]  playing we must begin we must begin to educate that those next
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.520]  warriors coming behind us you understand how beautiful would it be if
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.840]  everybody just got that all the fake hip-hop and establishment music that
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.120]  they sell us is meant to hurt us the message is obviously destructive
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.200]  couldn't people just flip and get it and understand it people say hey we want we
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:59.200]  want you know easy solutions well politicians are gonna tell you that
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:04.080]  but it is an easy solution it's wake up start resisting in little ways it will
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.120]  grow into big things what always frustrates me professor griff and I
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.360]  want to get your take on this is that every time I stand up nine times out of
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.800]  ten the system freaks out and runs in fear because they're not used to
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.040]  anybody standing up to him but but more people aren't standing up it's that the
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.120]  individual who's doing things for the right reason has incredible power and
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.440]  we're like hundred foot tall monsters to these neural order people they are
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.640]  scared of us yes they are but I often said if there was a thousand
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.360]  professor Kristen we can kind of turn the tide I could say we could say some
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:43.680]  things and everywhere I go I meet someone that's like minded like myself but
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.440]  it's just that one person that may be in Vegas or the two or three the two or
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:54.840]  three people in a study group in Wisconsin somewhere so it's not
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.920]  enough of us but I think what they do they understand our strategy and our
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:03.120]  strategy is taking advantage of technology and reaching as many people
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.920]  as we can you know how many times my local app had been shut down corrupted
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.920]  false messages sent sent out in the middle of the night by the time the
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:18.200]  people wake up and they said grip I didn't know you was in the porn I said
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.960]  well I didn't send that message this is what it came from all I know they do all
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.440]  sorts of dirty tricks and edit things well now we've confirmed I mean we've
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.880]  had it happen everybody in our office you send out a pro-gun message they ban
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.560]  you or suspend you on Facebook Twitter starting it and they're doing it to little
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:37.680]  guys though not big guys so much in the others and under the radar but then they
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.440]  also do the false flags on big guys like yourself when they go after a big guy
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:44.000]  they do something like a misrepresentation and people don't know
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  you don't know how real the New World Order is that's one reason I say get
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.720]  involved get involved and run up against it then you'll know for yourself how real
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:59.360]  it is I release the book analytics where I put the Obama deception in my book I
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.680]  release the psychological covert war on hip hop which is the next book and my
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:09.160]  new book the acapella revolution I released a few weeks ago and they're
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:13.400]  stepping up their attack but now on different levels websites have been
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:19.560]  corrupted like I said the cell phone app people are being harder to reach
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:24.720]  but the technology was designed to reach more people at a faster pace what it
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.520]  seems like miles is going down for some strange reason I think that's
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.960]  deliberate I think that's deliberate here's an example they they've taken
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.160]  speeches I've done I warned of this a decade ago because under the technology
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:41.240]  was already there they'll take speeches that are mine my show no music no nothing
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.680]  and claim copyright on particularly powerful things and it'll be like MTV and
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:50.920]  it's me talking no music no nothing it'll be weird Canadian companies and
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.760]  I've got a threaten to sue them and have lawyers actually send them tort letters
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:01.240]  to stop and it's always key stuff about real unity they know what breaks through
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:06.520]  and they go completely ape right this is why I will be a copula revolution
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.200]  because the revolution is complete constructive conscious cosmic change
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:15.440]  we're going to bring about a change but it starts with the individual the
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.240]  individual spirit and the individual's mind so the whole idea of a couple of
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.440]  just speaking is without the music let's just have a conversation and create
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:31.720]  and start the dialogue and I think this is this is on my my attempt to put this
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.240]  information out there to slow these people and their agenda down this new
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:41.240]  world order Illuminati agenda just slow it down to a grinding halt because if we
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:45.680]  had the dialogue at least we're coming together to at least have the dialogue
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.600]  their part of their agenda is that you and I don't talk have you seen how
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.640]  Google admits this now they look at what your profile is and only keep you in
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.960]  your little group now yeah yeah I noticed that and not to say anything
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:05.480]  against flavor slave beautiful beautiful spirited guy but when you Google
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.880]  public enemy play of slave comes up and they look at public enemy through the
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.560]  eyes of VH1 and we know VH1 is connected to we know we know that it we
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:19.720]  know that agenda VH1 it's supposed to be video hits one but they never play
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.160]  videos so we know what their agenda is well it's it's the ruin and the food
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.800]  entertainment television BET well I mean I mean if you look at it you watch
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.320]  any TV I don't care what it is it's to destroy families and hurt little kids
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.160]  and screw people up because they know if somebody's got their head screwed on
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.080]  they're gonna find the truth they're gonna stand for the truth we're gonna
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.600]  have a good civilization and a future but if they can screw everybody up I'll
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.480]  talk about their super end game why they want to get rid of most the
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.680]  population so they can have the life extension technology but professor

[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:27.920]  actually been around a lot of media people and let me tell you I don't know
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:31.680]  notice the Mickey Mouse kids all those women that ended up being the big stars
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.560]  who were in Disney and I mean let me tell you there's something to this I mean
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.520]  now they want to drug the Aurora reported shooter with truth serum to make
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.840]  him admit he did the murders so now they're gonna drug you till you confess

[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.720]  that whole story under DARPA control getting DARPA money multiple shooters
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.840]  saying he was under mind control putting him back on the drugs all these guys
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:04.280]  has the same MO I've there been cases it was one guy in like 99 who killed a
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:07.600]  bunch of people at church in Fort Worth and neighbors said they saw them
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.200]  dragging him out and putting him in a white van two days before and he'd been
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.280]  in Navy Psyops and I talked to his neighbors and people I mean it's it's
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:21.080]  it's insane but side issue here's that mind control video first it's just video
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.400]  of Clinton having makeup put on looks like a doll you know totally in a
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.880]  trance and the next is him acting like a three-year-old here it is in covertly
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:32.440]  recorded off-air transmissions from the Bush Clinton presidential election
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:38.280]  campaign in the 1990s we can see that Bill Clinton was nothing more than a
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:45.160]  puppet to the puppet masters which placed him in the White House Bill
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:51.760]  Clemson's demeanor seems to be similar to a person who is under a hypnotic
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:59.600]  trance definitely this is great I love it
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:08.080]  he's not on drugs there he is under mind control that is hypnotizing
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:19.000]  unbelievable good God that's enough of it it just goes on and on professor Griff
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.760]  I mean the problem is is that you're gonna be leaving it's not in the same
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.240]  with the next and you say you'll come back in two weeks which we're very
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.720]  honored to have you to just take phone calls but once you're gone from here I
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.400]  know you'll think oh I wish I would have said that what else do you want to talk
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:38.760]  about today that's important I was talking I was saying to myself two
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:44.840]  seconds ago I wonder if I should bring up the whole idea of the people that I
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:50.960]  have in my laptop that that you when you mentioned about putting him in office I
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:57.880]  don't think people understand the whole dynamic of the city-states and I don't
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:01.720]  think they understand all right I dynamic of grooming these men to be
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:07.920]  president and then the people that are put in place to put these people in
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:13.840]  office so I in my lecture I talk about the black pope who's is who's part of
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.920]  part of the society of the Jesuit order I talk about the big new presence key
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:24.920]  George Soros and other people in the in Rupert Murdoch and we go on and on who
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:31.800]  is Joe Biden and I talk about these things and how Barack Obama Barry
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.360]  gave us whatever you want to call him today
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.320]  he's going to be the president but he's not the president of the United
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:44.600]  he acts like he's hypnotized at times I mean I mean something it's that same
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.800]  programming I don't think the programming took too well on Bush no it
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:54.920]  didn't I think it backfired and the whole double-speak and the whole training him
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.640]  on how to use the English language but just to speak to only a certain group
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.800]  with people this is this is very real Stephen Jacobson in his book on mind
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.920]  control in America he talked about these particular techniques in depth and
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.160]  this is something that Stephen Jacobson laid out that needs to be studied his
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.520]  whole idea back with masking and double-speak and these kind of put
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:24.120]  the use in and out of the music industry and people could say it's all
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.280]  mumbo jumbo but we know the globalists are all into the occult the point is
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.080]  they're getting the power just incredible professor Griff final statement
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:34.280]  with him we're back in one minute third hour coming up and we've got the lawyer
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:40.760]  who's sued multiple times and beaten the FDA stay with us

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.600]  confrontation I'm not trying to be mean nothing against them individually to
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.680]  repeat what you said to me and I don't even know about all this so I'm not
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:04.000]  even involved in it but I respect you and believe you said listen I had
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.240]  conversations with Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam living people and then you said and
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.040]  Tupac and they told me about what's going on and I've seen other people talk
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:25.360]  about this stuff what do you think happened with Tupac
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:55.320]  well you know you do the math man this is cool wow I did not know this
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:00.280]  was gonna happen today you're on the air man wow so I'm asking questions that's
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.560]  all I'm doing because I'm asking the questions and I'm putting it out there
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.120]  all of a sudden they want to attack me and confront me but I'm saying okay I'm
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.920]  going to bring my information here is the information now the conversations I've
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:16.560]  had with certain individuals that don't want to be revealed I can't tell you
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:20.160]  about that but I can't tell you what Tupac told me that Quincy Jones
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:26.000]  proposition Tim well I did not sure sure specifically just man I tell you I I mean
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.640]  all I know is every time I study any group the French the Chinese the Russians
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:35.800]  the you know what's happening at the Vatican everywhere it's all the occult
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.520]  and it's what's going on and that's what the Illuminati is into is these sex
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.640]  cult rights as you know and that's what the fallacies in DC all of this it's
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:52.400]  just so crazy exactly and so we shouldn't be pushing up the thing that's
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:58.280]  not going on in an industry like hip-hop and like the music industry that
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.360]  controls people but I mean look at Lady Gaga look at all of it it's rituals on
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.640]  the television I mean they're doing it openly and they think they're getting
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:09.960]  power from it well well is there any way that Tupac could have been wrong about
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  what he was telling you there's a powerful chance that he could have been wrong
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:18.880]  but the events that happened after Tupac's death especially with this
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.840]  anonymous letter and making a connection with private prisons to hip-hop and to
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:28.120]  rap music and criminalization and enicorization rap music I think he was
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.680]  right what about Dave Chappelle he said a stuff like this and then disappeared
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.680]  and then later said it was a joke but then said it wasn't I mean why did Dave
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.960]  Chappelle said similar stuff about mafias and things exactly Dave Chappelle
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.920]  went so far to give back $50 million now what black man you know gonna give back
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:52.600]  anybody $50 million and go to Africa what are you running from so we need to
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:56.400]  understand he didn't say that when he was on Oprah no listen I've been told
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:00.360]  stuff I've been told stuff by some pretty big movie stars off record that
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.280]  just it's it's it's totally insane if people knew who ran things just and by
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.840]  the way satanic rituals is the tip of the iceberg exactly and so everyone from
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:17.280]  Bob Dylan down to them a little way so they're confessing they can't keep it a
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:21.680]  secret too long you know the cat is out of the bag wait even Bob Dylan I mean
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.760]  he speaks out against the New World Order and signed out on America but how
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.160]  did he know that back in the 80s their whole new order planets it's in the
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:33.800]  songs well I was wondering right something was going on then that we didn't
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:39.640]  know about he put it in the song some of the songs well I know some folks that
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.000]  know Bob Dylan and they say he's he knows about the New World Order that's
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.640]  what I'm not gonna man I tell you Professor Griff let me say bye to you

[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.120]  dot com coming up briefly with a news brief at the bottom of the hour a lot of
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:06.000]  stuff breaking on the whole Vatican front man where to start here I like to
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.720]  get people on that I think you're interesting and just like professor
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.960]  griff last hour man that was I didn't know it was gonna go there that was
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.320]  wild he's back on with us in two weeks to take your phone calls that'll be
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:25.200]  newsmaking or maybe not it'll scare the system so much but I had a chance a
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.360]  while back to hear this gentleman on coast to coast a.m. and I've been wanting
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:31.800]  to get him on and I've kind of told my producers but then forgotten about it a
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.160]  while back and I guess it fell through and then Richard Reeves came in and he
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:39.160]  said you know dr. Glendon who we're a big fan of and he's here on the Genesis

[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.680]  news but if you've got 200 plus thousand people dying from bad drug
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:12.560]  interactions or from overdoses a prescription drugs it's never even in
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.080]  the news and they they try to hide it when some mass shooters on two or three

[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.720]  Jonathan good to be with you Alex well what do you make of the attack I mean I
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.480]  know you talk about all the attacks on liberty not just vitamins and minerals
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:07.040]  what is the state of our republic right now oh it's horrendous I mean we're
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:13.880]  looking at around 20 22 a circumstance in which medical care in this country will
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:19.080]  be very hard to get as far as quality care is concerned and of course with a
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.240]  sixteen and a half trillion dollar debt with a 23 trillion by the time Obama
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:29.960]  leaves office it's not far before we experience a collapse in the ability of
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:34.320]  government to supply services the good news about that of course is that we may
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.120]  have a chance of restoring a limited federal republic and a constitutional
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:42.240]  system of government we now have a bureaucratic oligarchy ruling this
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:47.600]  country when nine-tenths of all federal laws not the product of those we elect
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.800]  but rather the product of the unelected heads of these agencies like the FDA we
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:58.480]  no longer have a republic you're right and we're having more and more of this
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:03.200]  imperial rule where Congress is told hey the UN and NATO's over our military hey
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.320]  Obama's over the FDA and EPA is gonna shut down the power plants
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:10.640]  Obama you know Mayor Bloomberg he's gonna tell you what you can drink and do
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:15.800]  they're really trying to get us used to really stuff that's like dark satire out
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:20.240]  of a Kurt Vonnegut novel well that's true there's been a fundamental shift in
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:24.800]  sovereignty at the time of the founding of the republic the core value of the
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:29.840]  constitution meant to be protected by it was liberty an individual liberty and
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:34.280]  sovereignty was to be paramount government was to be our servant not our
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:39.320]  master and here we are in the 21st century we're acting like we're in the
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:45.200]  16th century we've got an environment in which the sovereign is the king or the
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.280]  government and we are the serfs again I mean we really are victims of
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:55.960]  circumstances beyond our control and increasingly every decision we make no
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:01.160]  matter how intimate is being affected by a decision made in Washington by
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:06.160]  someone we can't affect because they're unelected Congress since the 1930s has
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:11.080]  delegated governing power to the administrative agencies there used to
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:15.720]  be a concept in the law known as the non delegation doctrine and the Supreme
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:21.360]  Court in the 1930s struck down many pleat pieces of legislation because they
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:24.960]  violated this doctrine which is consistent with article one of the
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:31.440]  Constitution that Congress make all law and now it is the case that since the
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:37.000]  1930s not a single piece of legislation that has delegated power from Congress to
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.640]  the agencies has ever been held unconstitutional for violation of this
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.960]  doctrine it's essentially a dead letter that in a separation of powers which is
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:52.400]  gone agencies are both the accuser the the trier and the and the prosecutor so
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.120]  when you have it ahead of an agency that says okay let's go get this company
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:02.920]  let's go get this person that agency head will ultimately also decide your
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:08.400]  fate so you don't have a separation of functions essential for liberty and then
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:13.200]  you see the Senate trying to act like that as well not calling a hearing but
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:16.880]  you know what we've seen Lieberman and others say we should be able to send a
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:21.400]  Senate order to YouTube to have videos we don't like take him down where their
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:27.760]  staffers now are judge jury and executioner no due process no you know
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.560]  restraint just off with their heads take them away to the dungeon where do you
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.280]  see all this going because I see a new poll out today most Americans see
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.480]  government as threat to their rights for first time trust and establishment
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:44.400]  institutions continues to plummet and the system's answer is to buy two billion
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:48.120]  bullets armored vehicles and put cameras up on every street corner and get
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.840]  citizen spies I mean it looks like the system is on a power trip well it is as
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:59.600]  I explain in restore the Republic all of the essential checks on the expansion of
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:04.000]  government have been eroded away to nothing all of the constitutional checks
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.360]  all of the structural checks inside our government that were required by the
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:14.840]  Constitution to restrict government have been eliminated and so you have
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.080]  unfunded mandates to the states absorbing the states into this mass
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:24.280]  federal entity you have no separation of powers with all the power that is
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:29.000]  difficult to wield out of the hands of Congress and into the agencies by active
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.400]  Congress you have people you elect to office who are virtually powerless to
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:39.080]  affect any change except with a supermajority and all of the day-to-day
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.080]  changes are taking place by those who really have the control of the agents
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:49.920]  all right stay there attorney Jonathan W. Emored is our guest Emored.com and he

[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:14.560]  well we've got the FDA dragons player on with us and I was just thinking about
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:17.800]  the last few years it first started in Chicago where the White House controls
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:23.120]  things then Denver and then all over the country they're saying parents can't pack
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:28.040]  lunches you've got to buy the GMO overpriced garbage and it's federally
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:33.560]  controlled and you've got to let your children eat that and you can't pack
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:38.000]  your lunch I mean it's a giant prison America is turning into a prison
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:45.800]  Jonathan W. Emore of famous lawyer beating the FDA let's talk about let's
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:48.840]  bring in Dr. Peter Glidden who recommended you to the show and I'd already
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:51.440]  wanted you on and forgotten about it you know that is you're driving listening
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:54.360]  to somebody late night you know Coast Coast AM one of my favorite shows and
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:57.800]  I heard you on there a while back a few months ago and then forgot about it and
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:02.080]  then Dr. Glidden said you got to get this guy on Dr. Glidden tell us about I
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:06.360]  mean you know tooting this guy's horn so people realize there's folks fighting
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:11.200]  for us and that we can win tell us about the guy we've got on the line right now
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:16.440]  Dr. Glidden well I can't say enough about Jonathan Emore at Alex I mean of
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:20.240]  all of the lawyers in the United States right you know there's the old joke you
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.600]  know what what's up what do you call a hundred lawyers in a bus at the bottom of
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:28.520]  the ocean a good start right everybody hates lawyers but not Jonathan Emore
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:33.840]  Jonathan Emore is the exception that proves the rule and he is the guy more
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:39.120]  than anybody else in the United States who has gone to bat for holistic
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.240]  medicine for vitamin companies to keep health freedom alive he's one of the
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.840]  main speakers at the health freedom expos that are in Los Angeles and in
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:57.280]  Chicago and Emore has done more for the pragmatic lawful practice of non-drug
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:01.720]  medicine in the United States and anybody else I'm telling you I knew you're
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:06.720]  gonna love this guy you you get you too you and Jonathan are like you know twin
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:12.080]  sons of different mothers coming at the same subject from different angles I
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:16.220]  just really can't say enough about him and and the game is still a foot
[02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:19.720]  gentlemen the game is still a foot there is so much more that needs to be done
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.240]  here and we have a long segment coming up we can break down the current attacks
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:27.320]  that's why we've got him on today so people know it's coming down the pike so
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:30.520]  we can defeat it as we've done in the past but now because we have been
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:33.800]  defeating him with the Constitution they're just as the attorney was saying
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:38.880]  as Jonathan was saying just bypassing that how do you expect this to play out
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:42.800]  I mean I know the future is fluid it's up to us but if they're going purely to
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:47.000]  a dictatorial mode is there anything we can do to stop them now that they're
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:54.560]  setting up an imperial federal bureaucracy and presidency well my firm
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:59.760]  is attacking them at every juncture wherever they take a move to violate
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:04.160]  the rights of people or to create a guild protect one industry over another
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.120]  my firm has been very aggressive in filing comments on behalf of clients
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:14.160]  that are injured by those activities and particularly in the area of free speech
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.960]  in the past but more so now on the structural regulations I think what's
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:21.520]  going to happen is that they're going to break the back of the private sector
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:27.200]  Thomas Jefferson referred to government as a parasite and in the early days of
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.040]  his administration when government really was virtually nothing compared to
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.120]  today he was worried that the seeds of its own destruction lay in its ability
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:40.720]  to sap from the private sector its lifeblood and that's what's happening
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:46.080]  we're overtaxed and overregulated which is another form of taxation this is
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:51.800]  largely responsible for the enormous difference in wealth of the extreme
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:57.240]  poverty and extreme wealth the absence of an upwardly mobile middle class is
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:01.480]  largely due to structural barriers that government puts in place through
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:05.480]  regulation they just make it too costly for people open a business and keep it
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:12.960]  going over time as the debt increases as regulation pours down upon the American
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:18.240]  people and makes it apparent to them that they are having difficulty functioning
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:23.720]  unemployment rises and continues to rise and then what happens ultimately is
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:29.120]  that the welfare state entitlement programs which are now continue to
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:34.360]  which continue to be so attractive to people will be unaffordable for the
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:39.120]  government to maintain they'll break down doctors won't provide Medicare
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:43.280]  services because they can't afford and that's already happening it's doubling
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:46.520]  the premiums this year my dad is in health care management he said my god
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:51.400]  this is written to wreck America I mean did they know what they're doing they
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.040]  assume that the private sector will carry more burden than it actually will
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.960]  but as we approach that tipping point when people start realizing gee I can't
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:07.400]  reliably get medical care gee I my social security check is simply inadequate to
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:12.840]  afford even basic sustenance gee all these promises government has made to me
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:19.840]  over the years are simply untrue because they can't be fulfilled well at that
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:25.600]  point of necessity people start turning back to the private sector this is like
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.840]  the collapse of the former Soviet Union well I agree with you stay there the
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.600]  author is with us I've got to read his books and I don't know how I didn't know
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:36.000]  about this guy for the last few months and we've also got Peter Glitton there
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.320]  so so so we'll finish up with where he sees it going solutions but also the big
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:44.640]  current attacks this is key information and I'm gonna ask the lawyer the
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:50.400]  attorney about the attacks on our free speech here in Austin stay with us we're

[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:05.520]  tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:09.720]  weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:14.320]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:19.240]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied

[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:46.200]  lawyer and I want to talk to him about that dr. Peter Glidden's with us to
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:50.040]  bring up some of the current stuff and where we're going with this but let me
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.760]  raise this to you now sir you can't see it you're on video Skype with us but
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:57.560]  we're not sending you video so that we don't you know degrade the quality of
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:02.360]  your video we found but I handed out and had a street crew that I hired hand out
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:07.080]  10,000 copies of my info wars March magazine that is about the police state
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:13.440]  takeover and selectively anywhere downtown and I'm showing photos to people
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:19.160]  right now police gave tickets tickets but but notice they were warning so it
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:22.520]  made it even more racketeering because it was just all intimidation they said
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:26.760]  next time you'll be ticketed for real and then arrested for blocking right of
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:34.200]  way which they weren't doing just handing out just handing out magazines and so
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:37.960]  here are the photos we actually were able to get these of our street team then
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.600]  South by Southwest had shaved head nothing in skies with shaved heads but
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:46.560]  you know big bouncer type guys come over to say get off the streets it's a big
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:50.840]  corporation owned by the Chronicle local newspaper big successful film music
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:54.680]  festival we decided to hand out 10,000 magazines just one small part of what we
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:58.560]  do and I've always heard these stories about them and they literally had the
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:02.480]  police code enforcers and then goons who claim they were with them we don't know
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:06.040]  that's the case come up and the news went down there on Saturday and they
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:10.200]  admitted it to them then the police backed off and the code enforcers backed
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:14.240]  off so my question to you is they they're conscious about this you can't
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.560]  feed the homeless will arrest you homeless can't dig in dumpsters and get
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:25.080]  apples will arrest them you can't you can't hand out magazines then we fight
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:30.240]  back okay you can but then they just come right back it's a conscious always
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:34.360]  moving against us against basic rights what would you do about something like
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:39.880]  this and why are we seeing things like this across the board sir well I think
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:44.480]  there's a general disregard for rights that comes with the growth of government
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:48.600]  and the assumption of greater government power it's inevitable and we're at a
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:52.880]  point now where it's become an epidemic across the country but in your case
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:59.120]  there's an unquestioned right first amendment right to distribute which is
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.640]  recognized since the turn of the 20th century in Supreme Court precedent and
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:09.320]  it is there are many cases including Jehovah's Witnesses cases in which the
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:14.080]  right to distribute information is fully protected there's a time place in
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:19.080]  manner restriction that the courts recognize in instances where it would
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:23.480]  have an effect on obstructing traffic or preventing ingress or egress to
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.560]  buildings but if people are in the streets particularly and they're not
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:32.520]  obstructing traffic they're on the sidewalks and so forth they have an
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:36.600]  undoubted right to distribute pamphlets other literature of any kind
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:40.920]  provided it's not pornographic or otherwise not protected by the first
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.000]  amendment but clearly political views are entitled to the strongest first
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.640]  amendment protection the Supreme Court has said and the right to distribute
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.640]  them is fully protected so what would you do well I would get an injunction
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:57.520]  against the local authorities that would preclude them from taking those
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:03.120]  actions to stop the distribution of these publications and they really should
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.280]  be mindful of the fact that that can happen in short order this is a federal
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.520]  question you're dealing with the first amendment and they can be enjoying from
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:15.280]  preventing you from doing it and the courts I still would do that sure
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:20.520]  exactly the issue I'm getting at is there's the consciousness of that every
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:25.040]  time they do this they back off and when the media shows up then they come back
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.640]  and do it again and then play stupid and the police I ran into later apologized
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.200]  and said we didn't want to follow orders but high-up said do this and it was
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:38.120]  selectively only against us because it's based you know it's hardcore free
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:41.920]  speech stuff about everything you and I are talking about and also the people
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:45.600]  that own the South by Southwest have a long beef with me because they're
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:50.600]  basically collectivist fake liberal tyrants it's just that how do you respond
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:55.760]  when they like the mafia back off when you stand up to them but as soon as you
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:59.680]  then leave the field they come back how do you deal with something like that
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:05.000]  well I think you're doing a wonderful job by exposing it as you are right now
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.080]  but in addition I would make clear to the authorities what's going on and
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.880]  that it is their duty to protect your right of free speech that's what I did
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:17.640]  yeah yeah and they should be signing officers to prevent these people from
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:20.560]  interfering with your right to distribute that literature that's their
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:24.760]  obligation well that is how it ended what was actually us calling the police
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:29.000]  over or the ladies we hired a local street team we had to get the cops over
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.800]  to stop those guys so so when the cops and others stop following their little
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.280]  orders and then the code enforcers wouldn't follow unconstitutional orders
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:45.240]  then they actually sent guns out showing the essence of this well it's sounds
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:49.720]  like an awful situation but I think the law is plainly on your side at least in
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:53.800]  this instance exactly but I think it just shows the mindset of Chicago or
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:59.280]  New York style muscling now is even in Texas I mean how bad is the tyranny growing
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:04.680]  oh it's horrendous for example with Obamacare the promulgation of
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:08.600]  regulations under Obamacare you thought the statute of over a thousand pages was
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:12.520]  bad take a look at what's coming out of the regulatory agencies particularly
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:18.960]  HHS and CMS and and the rent-seeking or corporate protectionism activity is
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.640]  just running rampant with more lobbying than I've ever seen because this is
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.760]  going to create an army of tens of thousands of new bureaucrats and huge
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:34.640]  opportunities for protectionist regulation and so for example there's a
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.040]  new regulation out by CMS that would make registered dietitians the only
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.320]  people in hospitals that can prescribe medical nutrition therapy and they can
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:50.720]  do that independent of physicians under this thing it's a plum that they were
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:55.680]  able to snatch through lobbying the CMS and this will have dire consequences
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:01.000]  because registered dietitians have oftentimes just a bachelor's degree
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.680]  that's all that's required in science and a bachelor of science but it creates
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:08.880]  a monopoly guilt as you were saying earlier but I mean what about the fact
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:14.000]  they now admit it does have the death panels right that's that's an amazing
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:18.440]  horrific aspect of this too and it's going to come to pass it's not going to
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.840]  come to pass not only because of the inherent power to allocate resources
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:28.520]  that they've assumed but also because we're going to see a shortage of both
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:37.120]  physicians and of specific services for example the 2.3 percent excise tax on
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.320]  medical devices under Obamacare is destroying the medical device industry
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.880]  that is comprised largely of small and medium-sized companies that cannot
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.600]  afford the enormous tax it's on gross receipts not on profits so unbelievable
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:57.080]  it's it's really ruinous so that's more like 10 15% of their profit and most
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:01.520]  people are operating on a 5-10% profit and the bureaucrats just want more more
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.040]  more and we've seen this in hundreds of cases the last two centuries with
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:09.520]  collectivist they will wreck the society is there anywhere to reverse the
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:13.640]  cancer I mean they've got payroll taxes on poor people and the poor are now
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:17.240]  learning they're going to be hammered what did they think insurance companies
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:21.240]  were going to do of course they compel people to buy their product and then the
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:26.320]  product goes up in price well CBO is estimating that medicated ranks are
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:31.360]  going to grow by about 16 million people in the short term and up to 30 million
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:35.920]  people in the long term when you look at the long-term prospects for insurance
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:40.280]  companies many companies can't afford the requirements that are being placed
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:45.080]  upon them for under Obamacare and are dropping insurance entirely CBO
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.120]  estimates that that will result in 30 million people being uninsured so what
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.560]  do we have a system of Obamacare that was designed to take uninsured people to
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:58.560]  the tune of some 30 million and give them insurance what it's really doing is
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:04.040]  redistributing the right to insurance so that middle-class people who had health
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:07.080]  insurance through their employers are going to lose it to the tune of 30
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.320]  million people and 30 million people who had who were in poverty stricken are now
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:17.200]  going to be on the insurance roles largely through Medicare and Medicaid but
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:20.520]  largely through Medicaid and that will bankrupt the system then they fully
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:25.760]  nationalize it right and that's really consistent with the overall underlying
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.720]  plan here they wanted a single-payer system they built into Obamacare means
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:36.360]  to achieve that and their expectations are coming to pass the exchanges are
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.360]  being rejected by many states Medicare is expand Medicaid is expanding as a
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:47.080]  result and the people are falling off of this system are ending up on public
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:50.440]  systems of support that the federal government is operating and that's
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:54.160]  creating the socialized medicine system they wanted after all they really looked
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:43:00.080]  at this insurance system as an interim measure the ultimate measure was all
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:05.280]  along to create socialized medicine in his purest form and by the way there's
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:09.000]  really not much difference between an insurance company bowing to the will of
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:14.700]  HHS as to coverage and socialized medicine anyway we really do have
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:19.920]  presently a cancer socialism that's running throughout the medical system
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:25.440]  and is destroying quality care it's just accelerated to a massive degree with
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:31.080]  Obamacare and I hear this mindless meme that oh European health care so great
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:34.880]  and I watch C-span of Parliament where they admit it's 18 months to get a
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.560]  brain surgery that's a hundred percent fatal basically if you don't get the
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.880]  surgery within six months for a tumor and they just admitted and then they
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.120]  have old people just dying and they're now practicing euthanasia and then Bill
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:51.120]  Gates goes well that's needed kill grandma hire ten teachers we're now in
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:54.200]  this collectivist pot where they're gonna tell us what to eat insurance
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.800]  companies are getting from the grocery stores what we eat to then put it into a
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:03.520]  database I mean they really know what they're doing I want to bring in Dr. Peter
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:09.480]  Glidden to comment on this because and they get your take on it Jonathan
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:13.800]  because you've got the perfect storm here of as they socialize medicine as
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:17.400]  they bring in death panels as they lower quality of care which is what the
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:20.480]  insurance companies want a government guarantee to do this so they lower care
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.400]  now they can you know nix out the doctors and say you don't get that eye
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:28.320]  surgery as Dashiell wrote in his book and that's a great thing as all this
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:31.920]  happens they're coming in against the supplements the vitamins the nutrients
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:37.320]  in the health revolution that can keep you out of these hospitals so at the
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:40.920]  same time and they're trying to shut down the free speech of doctors and
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:45.840]  others who are wanting to expose what's happening so let's bring in Dr. Glidden
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.480]  Dr. Glidden break down what I was just talking about they're giving your take
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:54.720]  on that well here's the way that it is Alex you know I could have a thousand
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:59.800]  patients who had definitively diagnosed type 2 diabetes a thousand patients and
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:03.920]  I could treat them with non-drug therapeutics with science-based clinically
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:08.760]  verified that science-based clinically verified medical nutrition and they
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:12.800]  could all recover from their diabetic condition no more type 2 diabetes it's
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:17.680]  gone and I can't post that testimonial on a website I can't make a
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.160]  testimonial about that I can't even say it in public that we can cure the
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:25.520]  illness because according to the Food and Drug Administration the only thing
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:30.720]  that can cure anything is a drug this is a big bad voodoo daddy you know and quite
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:35.840]  frankly Alex I couldn't be happier if the medical system collapses because we
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:40.040]  have taken the wrong dog to the hunt I mean the medical system doesn't need to
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:44.880]  be streamlined the drug companies don't need to be rained in there doesn't
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:48.800]  need to be more checks and balances less regulation or more regulation the
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:53.640]  reason that our health is going to hell in a handbasket is because we've taken
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:46:00.240]  the wrong dog to the hunt MD directed pharmaceutical centrist allopathic
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.840]  reductionistic treatments for chronic disease don't work this is the trillion
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:09.240]  pound gorilla in the middle of the country that nobody is talking about the
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:14.880]  best possible thing that we can do for our health is not to tweak the system not
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:19.480]  to try to perfect the system not to try to streamline the system it's abandon
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:23.960]  the system the only thing that MD directed medical therapeutics are good
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:28.640]  for is surgery when surgery is absolutely necessary and emergency care
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.480]  medicine but the alternative practitioners the nature pass the
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:37.880]  homeopass the herbalist the acupuncturist everybody who's not an MD has
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:42.320]  been kicked off of the bus of medicine for goodness sake the state of Illinois
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:46.920]  sued me for $5,000 because I used the word doctor on my website and you can't
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:51.320]  do that now I've been a licensed physician for 20 years but it's not okay
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:55.160]  for me to use the word doctor let's stop right there let's stop right there I
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:00.840]  remember having dr. Blalock is a retired brain surgeon but other people on 16
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:05.480]  years ago saying you're gonna see giant increases in diabetes as they put
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:09.520]  aspartame in thousands of products not just soft drinks you equal nutris wheat
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:13.480]  brand names we knew this the studies were there in the 70s when they couldn't
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:18.640]  get it approved until 80 and here here it is CBS News last week new study has
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:23.520]  wake up call for diet soda drinkers and let's punch this up for TV viewers CBS
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:28.720]  News and it goes over all of it artificial sweeteners tied to obesity type 2
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:33.040]  diabetes it's an excitotoxin it makes you more hungry and tricks your brain and
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:38.000]  fries your pancreas they knew it they know it's deadly poison diet soda
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.840]  associated with higher type diabetes no one's asking why is it up by two three
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.320]  thousand percent why are Hispanics dying left and right especially because
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:48.560]  genetically it really targets them because it's what alcohol we know what
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.600]  that does the Native Americans that's what Hispanics are Spanish mix with
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:55.680]  Native Americans it's killing them in mass but you can't come out and say
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:01.600]  Nobel Prize for medicine Linus Pauling mega dosages of vitamin C massively
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:05.720]  kills cancer is a great treatment you can't say that even though it's Nobel
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:10.920]  Prize but they can push 10,000 plus products with aspartame in it that
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:19.160]  kills people deader than a hammer 500 million people die from viox 500,000
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:24.120]  500,000 a half a million people die from viox nobody goes to jail the leading
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:28.360]  cause of death in the United States right now to the tune of 780,000 people a
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:32.760]  year is MD directed medical therapeutics it's the leading cause of death it's the
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.960]  leading cause of bankruptcy while the MDs have been driving the bus of medicine
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.440]  autism is skyrocketing Alzheimer's is skyrocketing life expectancy is flat
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:46.440]  line it's unbelievably poor outcomes and nobody bats an eyelash
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:50.200]  well going back to Jonathan W. E. Mord sir you know I've been thrown a lot of
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:53.400]  questions Eddie a lot of points what are some of the big attacks we've got on
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:56.800]  the supplement front going on I mean I know they've been pushing that as well
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:01.120]  because big medicines in there what patenting you know fish oil changing a
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:04.680]  molecule and then they want their competition that's 20 times cheaper
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:10.960]  banned well people need to really understand is that the censorship regime
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.560]  that the FDA operates is profound and there is absolutely prohibited by
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.680]  federal law to make any treatment claim for a dietary supplement even if it's
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.720]  true so for example if you put on and that's true of foods as well if you put
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:33.720]  on the label of water treats dehydration you've just transformed the water by
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:38.840]  operation of law into an unapproved drug and it is illegal to sell you sell it
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:43.480]  you can be thrown in jail you put on any other thing prune juice you put on
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  there treats chronic constipation you just transform the prune juice into a
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:54.400]  drug and you're thrown in jail that's so even if the statements are true if you
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:59.360]  say cranberries are good for the stones in your bladder or your kidneys can't do
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:05.200]  it can't do it and the reason why this regime is in place is that it is an
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:10.520]  anti-competitive system that ensures a monopoly on the right to make therapeutic
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:15.200]  claims for drug companies they're the favored regulatory the whole food drug
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:20.360]  and cosmetic act is designed to put the government in the place of protecting
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:27.560]  the drug approval process and thereby protecting an exclusionary system that
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:31.360]  limits to drugs the right to make therapeutic claims a drug is not
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:37.600]  defined as a drug based on its chemical composition it's defined as a drug
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:42.640]  based on the claims that are made that is therapeutic claims so anything that
[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:46.720]  makes a therapeutic claim is automatically categorized as a drug so it's a
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:51.360]  pharmaceutical monopoly wow Jonathan W. E. Moore we're gonna come back with him

[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:13.440]  streams at prisonplanet.tv but the three or four minutes we have left sir why
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:19.800]  have you been so successful against the FDA not EPA FDA why have you been so
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.640]  successful when other people have it because you know I cover the news I
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:27.480]  know how hard it is if you actually have a case and go to court against them the
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:32.280]  feds have like a 97% conviction rate just to show how corrupt things are and
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.320]  when you're suing them it's I mean I saw human experimentation we exposed and
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:39.480]  broke here with researchers in North Carolina where they were gassing
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.080]  college students and not telling them just two months ago we broke that and
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.640]  the Obama administration said we're allowed to do this we're gonna stop the
[02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:51.840]  program but nobody gets in trouble that's Nuremberg stuff I mean you know
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:57.120]  it's amazing so so where is it going
[02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:07.160]  where is it going yeah well I think on the question about success I think the
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:12.760]  reason for the success is entirely one of strategy we were very careful in how
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:18.280]  we position these cases and how we chose to take them we didn't take every case
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:24.840]  that came along and we we really had two things working for us excellent argument
[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:32.800]  and then also a persuasive ability with the judges that we had it's very hard
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:38.200]  to win against the federal government I would say that 99% of all cases
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.680]  involving the federal government the federal government wins these days so
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:47.080]  defeating the an agency as powerful as the food and drug administration does
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:51.840]  require considerable amount of work and sometimes the amount of time for example
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.000]  with Pearson versus Shalala which was a landmark decision that held FDA
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.360]  censorship of the folic acid neural tube defect claim and omega-3 fatty acid
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:06.960]  coronary heart disease claim and other claims unconstitutional that case took
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:13.000]  a decade to build and to present through the administrative process on to the
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:21.320]  courts so it's it's very hard to defeat the abuses that the government puts on
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:25.880]  the American people well I love that little life ring you have behind you
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:28.440]  says save the Constitution this is a one-minute break

[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:27.680]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I tell you we just
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:30.880]  started getting into the intriguing stuff where he was bringing up the court
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:34.160]  cases that was the first question I had written down I wanted to ask him talk
[03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:38.240]  about some of the cases you want where you know you can't say folic acid has
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:42.600]  been shown to cut back on birth defects and you need it then you know that it's
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:47.040]  not drugs it's a lot of simple nutrients so just in the time we have left
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:51.320]  Jonathan please break down a few of the other victories you've had just so people
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:54.840]  get an idea of how serious this is because you know I get excited about
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:59.520]  tyranny taking over I get excited about resisting it and I think people need to
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:03.760]  find that instinct again of really being territorial about our liberties that
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:07.280]  Thomas Jefferson talked about but spend a few more minutes I mean not toot in
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:12.000]  your horn it's important to talk about these rare victories you've had well I
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:17.520]  think I might mention one that is really an example of just how far the
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:22.080]  government goes and then also once you get the tiger by the tail how you can
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:26.840]  succeed in flipping it and we had a we had a client that wanted to say that
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:33.520]  vitamin B6 B12 and folic acid could reduce the risk of vascular disease and
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:38.880]  that is backed by enormous science that combination of vitamins has the effect
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:45.240]  of lowering a caustic amino acid called homocysteine and the CDC had announced
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:51.000]  to the physicians of the United States that they ought to test for homocysteine
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:56.440]  in addition to cholesterol because homocysteine was determined by CDC to be
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:02.480]  an independent risk factor for vascular disease so we presented this petition to
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:07.560]  the FDA for approval of the claim showing the evidence and the CDC's
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:14.000]  position on lowering homocysteine and the FDA made the extraordinarily arrogant
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:19.280]  statement common with this agency that it is that the agency of the federal
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:23.000]  government that will decide what constitutes an independent risk factor
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:28.440]  not CDC that even though CDC made this determination it had no bearing on its
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:33.120]  own assessment that it didn't think that homocysteine was an independent risk
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:36.880]  factor that it didn't think that all this science showing a lowering of
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:42.720]  homocysteine with these three vitamins was necessarily proof that it would
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:48.080]  lower your risk ultimately of vascular disease so it denied the claim and that
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:54.040]  came on the heels of about six victories that we'd won over them in cases of
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:03:00.320]  censorship and the courts were very willing at that time to strike the
[03:03:00.320 --> 03:03:05.440]  agency for failing to abide by these orders so we pursued a different
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:09.560]  strategy in that case with a client willing to support it where we went
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:15.000]  after the commissioner of the FDA directly and laid a foundation for a
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:22.160]  contempt action where the commissioner could be held responsible directly for
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:28.120]  violating these court orders these are constitutional mandates and so
[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:32.080]  immediately after it became clear that that was our direction the government
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:37.600]  capitulated allowed the very claims we had asked for and disappeared because they
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:41.320]  didn't want to be hit well that's what I was about to say I'm no super star
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:45.120]  lawyer like you but 17 years on air and fighting a lot of corruption I'll go
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:49.560]  after the people who have conflicts of interest I'll go after the people that
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:53.400]  are getting the payoffs I'll go all the way around and then suddenly they leave
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:57.960]  you alone and and so it really just shows that there's more than one way to
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:04.000]  skin a cat that's true you know one thing one example I think characterizes the
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.680]  corruption and the control of the drug industry over the FDA perhaps more than
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:14.360]  any other there are many many instances but in the case of san avia ventis's
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:20.600]  drug key tech that company was found by the FBI and by the medical reviewers at
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:27.040]  FDA to have come up with a fraudulent clinical trial as a principal basis for
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:33.840]  its drug and despite the fact that the FBI prosecuted the investigators who for
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:38.760]  the san avia ventis who did the trial and despite the fact that there was no
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:43.800]  question that the evidence did not exist of there ever being the clinical trial
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:49.040]  the FDA commissioner overruled the medical reviewers and approved key tech
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:52.080]  incredible we're gonna have to have you back up about your books very soon

[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:20.320]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:24.960]  all right I got dr. glidden on because he recommended the last amazing guest
[03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:30.840]  who we had on who I first heard on cus to cus to him with George Norrie but by
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:36.880]  the way is George is on tomorrow isn't it George Norrie is on the show tomorrow
[03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:42.320]  I forgot I we set that up last week that's gonna be a big interview and so I
[03:08:42.320 --> 03:08:45.520]  got glidden on kind of right shotgun but I wanted to go into overdrive the day
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:48.920]  which some stations do carry and some days we do live sometimes it's the first
[03:08:48.920 --> 03:08:53.240]  hour reared for stations that have to miss that upon the different satellite
[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:57.920]  systems we have but you just heard the lawyer that's beaten them eight times in
[03:08:57.920 --> 03:09:03.640]  court in sometimes decade-long litigations and you heard him criminally
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:08.320]  about 98% of the times the feds convict it was about 95 a few years ago it's
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:14.560]  like 98 now 99% of the time you heard him you lose because it's so rigged the
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:18.600]  only reason he wins is he'll show the conflict of interest and judge are
[03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:23.360]  don't you want a bunch of stock in blah blah blah you know or you because it is
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:27.640]  a bunch of crooks up there and I love the fact we got that lawyer on I mean I
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:30.400]  could have guessed that's how they're winning because that's pretty much only
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:33.440]  way you win with these crooks no because they're so busy they got other
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:36.880]  people to rob you know like they'll tell you we're not letting you take your
[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:41.240]  kid home until you've taken 14 vaccines you'll go but there's no law and they'll
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:46.600]  go uh police are standing by don't resist and if you say I'm calling talk
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:50.560]  radio I know somebody they go whoa oh we apologize I mean that actually happened
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:56.280]  one of my crew just a few weeks ago whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I can make one
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:00.000]  phone call hi yeah I'm Alex Jones oh you're gonna not do that oh you know
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:04.560]  if there's no law I'll never forget about six seven years ago everyone's
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:08.040]  seeing into the big PR thing with the kids made to take the shots in Maryland
[03:10:08.040 --> 03:10:11.680]  Baltimore they had 2,000 kids and their parents lined up with barking dogs and
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:15.360]  SWAT teams because the right wingers were saying don't take the shots and the
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:19.160]  judges like it's the law yet I'm outside gaveling and I had the state of
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:22.440]  turning on who ran it all and I go you know that in the law and you tricked him
[03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:28.520]  the truancy isn't the law you triggered truancy by kicking him out which you
[03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:32.160]  can't do and then charge him with truancy plus you couldn't kick him out
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:37.560]  because it's only policy it's not law and the guy goes you ought to be a lawyer
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:41.720]  like me that's right my kids don't take it I ought to find that radio interview
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:46.440]  he was laughing on here it's like funny yeah a lot of people my kids don't take
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:52.720]  it I wouldn't give it to him for nothing like it's fun he's con in a bunch of mainly
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:55.600]  black people and he was a black guy to take a bunch of deadly shots that don't
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.160]  even protect them and it's just messes with me it's like all these weirdos
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:03.120]  think it's fun to con somebody
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:08.800]  you know it's fun it's painting an oil painting and selling it for $10,000 on
[03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:12.480]  the open market because people admire my work by the way I'm gonna get back into
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:19.360]  that because I want to what's fun is a woman to like me not to rape her I just
[03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:23.320]  man I don't get it I mean I got him and I'm not some good guy by the way I mean
[03:11:23.320 --> 03:11:26.760]  I got a lot of bad thoughts and I'm not am I saying that's like I'm cool but then
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:31.200]  I you know I have a violent streak a lot of the things but I just Dr. Glidden I've
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:33.960]  been ranting I'm gonna give you the floor here and I've got some breaking news
[03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:36.480]  here in a moment but you heard all we talked about now are the few things you
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:40.760]  popped in with I just don't get how everybody works in this system and
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:44.800]  screws everybody around them and doesn't think it's gonna come back on them I
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:48.560]  mean even if they're not moral people don't they know that if you go to a
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:52.960]  city pool and excuse my French crap in it that pretty soon nobody can get in
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:59.200]  the pool I mean don't they don't they get get that sir well it's been
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:03.000]  experienced Alex there's basically two types of people in the world there are
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.600]  people that are self-centered and there are people that are other centered and
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:10.720]  generally speaking the people like you and the people like me the people that
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:14.320]  are involved with actually helping people right where other people centered
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.880]  and we'd never even consider doing that I mean we'd we'd be the ones the first
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:23.480]  ones through the door to get bloody right helping to shake down some type of
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:26.960]  tyrannical thing helping to stand up for the little guy but there's a whole
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:31.040]  contingent of society that they're self-centered and that's just the way
[03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:34.520]  that they look at things and you know like the fella said he can't fix stupid
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:39.200]  and this is just the way that it is in the world and by the way Jonathan
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:43.280]  Emoret oh my god this is one of the reasons Alex I've been involved with
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:47.120]  holistic medicine for over 20 years the reason we can have info wars health
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:53.160]  calm he's the people don't know it would all be banned right now and this is why
[03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:57.920]  I love dr. Wallach so much and dr. Wallach's company young Jevity he's one
[03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:03.360]  of the way Emoret didn't tell you yeah he dr. Wallach introduced to Jonathan
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:07.560]  Emoret to his current wife for goodness sake because they've gone out of their
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:11.200]  way dr. Wallach's gone out of his way to sue the Food and Drug Administration on
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:16.320]  your behalf for goodness sake and he's one of Wallach's lawsuits yeah he won he
[03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:20.840]  won a qualified health claim petition around the nutrient selenium which
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:24.640]  allows us to legally say and I want you to think long and hard that we had to
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:29.040]  sue the Food and Drug Administration so that we can say this legally one
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:33.840]  selenium capsule at 200 micrograms a day which is cheaper than dirt for
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:37.200]  goodness sake because it's made from dirt selenium is a mineral supplement
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:41.960]  like calcium 200 micrograms of selenium reduces the occurrence of breast
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:49.160]  cancer by 82% reduces the occurrence of prostate cancer by 69% colon cancer
[03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:55.400]  64% and lung cancer 39% even if you're a smoker and we had to sue the
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:59.640]  colon cancer it's on record they admit now because the lawsuits were able to
[03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:05.280]  say what about the big university study on what beyond Tangierine and ultimate
[03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:09.960]  the a different longevity products here for the colon kills cancer cells kills
[03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:13.800]  cancer cells but the only people that can treat cancer in the United States are
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:18.360]  oncologists the people that screw it up I want you to think about this long and
[03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:23.040]  hard medical doctors bless their hearts are not trained in how to cure disease
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:26.880]  it's not in their wheelhouse for goodness sake they don't even know how to
[03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:30.920]  cure a heartburn right they can't cure a heartburn they can manage it with a
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:35.400]  little purple pill they can manage it but they can't cure it to the profession
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:39.880]  that does not even know how to cure cancer a secure heartburn we have given
[03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:43.680]  a trillion dollars of money to come up with a cure for cancer and now they're
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:48.440]  coming out with cancer vaccines which they admit will actually give some
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:54.360]  people cancer it's crazy I mean the chemotherapy and the radiation treatments
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:59.160]  that they give for cancer give people cancer chemotherapy from Mary Tyler
[03:14:59.160 --> 03:15:05.040]  Moore who had lung cancer beat it but now the chemo is giving her brain cancer
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:09.880]  exactly right nobody goes to jail can you imagine what would happen if Dr.
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:14.160]  Glidden or Dr. Wallach or an herbalist or an acupuncturist or a chiropractor or
[03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:17.960]  a homeopath somewhere in the world gave one patient one herb and it killed them
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:22.840]  we'd be pilloried in the town square but the FDA the pharmaceutical companies
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:27.240]  do it all the time and we give them a pass this is how deeply down the rabbit
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:31.680]  hole we have gone here in this country we have become culturally conditioned to
[03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:35.880]  believe that when it comes to medicine the MD is the muted king and it's
[03:15:35.880 --> 03:15:40.120]  simply a lie it's not true there's room in the world for MDs and you know in a
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:44.160]  perfect world we'd go to see them for emergency medicine and for surgery when
[03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:48.160]  surgery is absolutely necessary and for everything else you'd use young Jevvie
[03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:53.520]  because as God is my witness Wallach's therapeutics make produce more consistent
[03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:57.720]  physiological change produce better results than anything I've ever seen
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:01.960]  it is the best kept secret in medicine it's the best thing to happen to medicine
[03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:04.720]  since the sterile technique quite frankly you know what the only way I'm
[03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:08.200]  gonna be able to shut up and let you actually cover all this is to give you
[03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:10.640]  the floor you want to host the rest of the hour I know you got your own show

[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:28.360]  gonna come back from break and give me the last 40 minutes of the show but but
[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:31.720]  let me throw a few other news items at you real quick I hope people will go to
[03:16:31.720 --> 03:16:36.960]  infowarself.com I hope they will call the number I look I would wrote what I
[03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:40.000]  believe in you know you'll hear some ads in the network I might say they're good
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:43.480]  or bad I just haven't endorsed them I turn stuff down all the time every once
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:46.000]  while I catch ads that go through that I don't totally agree with and I get
[03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:49.840]  hopping mad like I did yesterday I caught one in the magazine but the point is
[03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:54.040]  maybe lost their job over by the way but the point is is that we really try to
[03:16:54.040 --> 03:16:57.720]  do the right thing because that's what I want that's that's the karma I want
[03:16:57.720 --> 03:17:02.240]  repurchase so I want good mojo not bad mojo and it's not because I'm even
[03:17:02.240 --> 03:17:07.520]  superstitious at like I am really in to promoting what I believe in and I'm
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:11.560]  telling you infowarself.com all the young Jevity products the lowest prices

[03:17:55.800 --> 03:18:01.420]  school calls cops on water pistol vows to track down owner using surveillance

[03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:14.000]  here it is free speech ban reversed in my city of Austin when I told people
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:17.080]  about this Saturday in a video when I learned of it they said it couldn't be
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:22.680]  true they said no info wars bumper stickers allowed in park cars downtown
[03:18:22.680 --> 03:18:26.640]  this is some of us we even caught on tape which guys have been encoding it
[03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:32.240]  right here we already heard some and and giving people tickets for handing out
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:37.160]  my magazine but everybody else was allowed to free speech ban reversed in
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:42.160]  Austin that's up on infowarch.com and they actually caught the cop writing
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:47.200]  one of the info war street team there's local companies people that hand out
[03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:50.440]  stuff and it turned out they were fans we hired them they were handing out our
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:55.560]  stuff a team of five women and one man one man and they literally first said
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:58.400]  move down the street we won't ticket you and then okay now we're gonna ticket you
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.520]  and then next we're gonna arrest you and then by the time I got there the cops
[03:19:02.520 --> 03:19:05.800]  were already refusing to follow the orders of the city so they tried to have
[03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:10.320]  code enforcers out there who I named on air but for anybody listening already I
[03:19:10.320 --> 03:19:15.680]  go to infowarch.com and it is the top story because we finally got the photos

[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:48.560]  the point is they tried to say we couldn't have a bumper sticker on our

[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:21.960]  Info Wars Network check out my website fireyourmdnow.com that's fireyourmdnow.com
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:26.640]  now let's continue this line of thought that we were talking about with
[03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:31.400]  Jonathan E. Mord and Alex in the last hour like the fellow said folks you
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:35.320]  don't know what you don't know right I mean I know that I can't speak French I
[03:24:35.320 --> 03:24:40.080]  know that I know that I can't that flying airplane I know that but there's
[03:24:40.080 --> 03:24:44.240]  some stuff that is so far outside of my wheelhouse and yours that you know I
[03:24:44.240 --> 03:24:47.240]  didn't know why didn't know that and it's the same with you that that's just
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:55.320]  life well I've got to tell you after 20 plus years of boots on the ground
[03:24:55.320 --> 03:25:00.000]  primary care holistic medical work is God as my witness the stuff that you
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:04.880]  didn't know you didn't know concerning your health is either gonna kill you or
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:13.040]  heal you and my job and I'm happy to do it is to educate people about the stuff
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:17.640]  around medicine and health that so far outside of their wheelhouse they didn't
[03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:21.880]  even know they didn't know that because it's very very very important like the
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:26.720]  fellow said you know if you're lost in the wilderness you go to a survival
[03:25:26.720 --> 03:25:29.240]  school what's the first thing they're gonna tell you you're lost in the
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:33.960]  wilderness what do you need perspective you got to climb to a high tree climb to
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:38.000]  a high hill get perspective on where you're at to try to plot your course
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:42.360]  out of there well we desperately need perspective when it comes to our health
[03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:46.400]  and our well-being and well-being and we don't have any in this country we
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:51.680]  do not for the last 100 years the medical theater in the United States has
[03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:56.320]  been completely dominated and monopolized by the MDs I'm not MD
[03:25:56.320 --> 03:26:00.600]  bashing I'm not I have a lot of friends who are MDs and I have respect for the
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:05.520]  MD medical profession but the MD medical profession is just one piece of the pie
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:10.120]  of medical science but the drug companies and the insurance companies and
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:16.840]  the Illuminati and the powers that be who own the world have convinced you for
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:22.000]  the last 100 years that the only person to pay any attention to when it comes
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  to anything medical is the MD and that everybody else is a back of the bus
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  alternative quack right that's the party line right oh don't see that chiropractor
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:35.960]  heaven forbid oh no don't go to see the nature path oh don't take those vitamins
[03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:42.200]  you're gonna get sick and die right well it's nonsense perspective shows us that
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:47.000]  met the medicine that MDs practice is just one small piece of the greater pie
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.200]  of medical science and the piece of the pie that MDs are trained in is referred
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:57.520]  to as allopathic medicine MDs don't practice medicine nobody does I don't
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:27:00.480]  practice medicine I practice nature-opathic medicine right there's
[03:27:00.480 --> 03:27:05.840]  osteopathic medicine homeopathic medicine chiropractic medicine acupuncture
[03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:10.760]  Ayurveda traditional Chinese medicine and what MDs do which is referred to as
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:16.640]  allopathic now look Republicans have their own philosophical view Democrats
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:20.360]  have their own philosophical view libertarians have their own philosophical
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:24.520]  view Buddhists have their own philosophical view born again Christians
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:28.680]  have their own philosophical view somebody's philosophy informs how they
[03:27:28.680 --> 03:27:33.680]  move through the world the philosophy of healing that MDs are trained in is
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:39.840]  referred to as reductionism and reductionism argues that the human body
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:47.760]  is a soup a machine made of parts and that it is the doctor's job and the
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:52.240]  human body has no inherent healing capacity once you're sick you're screwed
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:57.040]  according to the MD and it's the doctor's job once you're sick to march in
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:02.360]  and deliver to your body man-made synthetic drugs the intention of which
[03:28:02.360 --> 03:28:08.360]  is to suppress and manage your symptoms this is MD allopathic philosophy your
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:12.800]  body is a machine there is no inherent soul force present in your body why
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:16.640]  because nobody's ever dissected the soul out of the corpse if nobody's ever
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:20.760]  dissected the soul out of the corpse therefore doesn't exist because according
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:24.680]  to reductionistic medical philosophy if you cannot measure it it doesn't exist
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:29.760]  so according to the MD your consciousness is a function of biochemistry
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:34.440]  and your body has no innate ability to fix itself and once you're sick you're
[03:28:34.440 --> 03:28:39.680]  screwed and so your only option when you're suffering with an illness is to
[03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:45.560]  let the MD the allopathic drug centrist MD deliver to your body medicines which
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:51.840]  suppress your symptoms override and control the workings of the human body
[03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:58.640]  now I want to learn about this what political system believes that the
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:02.080]  people are not smart enough to take care of themselves that every aspect of
[03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:07.080]  society must be controlled by the state communists right and you know you can
[03:29:07.080 --> 03:29:11.200]  argue we're going that way here in the United States but communist regimes
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:16.720]  their whole thing is people are not smart enough to take care of the state to
[03:29:16.720 --> 03:29:21.000]  take care of themselves the government knows best you know it's the nanny state
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:25.560]  the government has to do everything for you well this is the MD's philosophy of
[03:29:25.560 --> 03:29:30.080]  healing your body doesn't know how to fix itself the only person that can is
[03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:34.160]  your medical doctor by suppressing and managing your symptoms with drugs I'm
[03:29:34.160 --> 03:29:37.640]  gonna tell you the other side to this coin when we come back stick around I'm

[03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:03.960]  lack of knowledge lack of knowledge right I mean before we knew how to purify
[03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:08.280]  water we didn't have long life expectancies before we knew how to
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:13.360]  eliminate our sewage we didn't have long life expectancies before we knew how to
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:17.520]  shelter ourselves from the elements and heat our homes and cool our homes we
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:22.000]  had relatively short life expectancies right these are things that we've all
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:26.560]  had to do in order to just survive on planet earth we got to find water and
[03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:31.200]  purify it we have to eliminate our waste responsibly we have to shelter our
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:34.360]  our bodies live in houses and heat them and cool them while there's one more
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:38.880]  thing we need to do that your medical doctor failed to tell you in order for
[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:44.880]  your body to maintain and to regain and maintain optimal health your body needs
[03:34:44.880 --> 03:34:51.760]  90 essential nutrients 9 0 essential nutrients 60 minerals 16 vitamins 12
[03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:59.280]  amino acids and 2 essential fatty acids the only problem is unless the 90
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:04.800]  essential nutrients are not present in the food they're just not the lion's
[03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:08.680]  share of our bodies nutrient needs the stuff that your body needs to keep its
[03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:12.520]  heart healthy keep its joints healthy keep its kidney healthy keep its gallbladder
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:17.720]  healthy keep its skin and brain and everything healthy our minerals 60 of
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:23.720]  the 90 essential nutrients are minerals that's two-thirds that 66% of your
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:27.400]  body's nutrient needs are minerals things like calcium and selenium and
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:32.160]  sulfur and zinc the only problem with minerals is the only person that can
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:37.520]  make minerals is God plants can't make minerals animals can't make minerals for
[03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:42.080]  goodness sake if plants could make minerals we could bioengineer lettuce to
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:47.760]  make gold and we'd all be rich minerals are only found in the soils there
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:51.480]  they're found in the water table also but that's because they've washed there
[03:35:51.480 --> 03:35:57.520]  from the soil right minerals come from rocks erosion grinds down the rocks and
[03:35:57.520 --> 03:36:00.440]  then the minerals are in the soil the only problem is the minerals are not
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:05.200]  evenly distributed in the soil they're spread out in veins you know like the
[03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:08.920]  chocolate and chocolate ripple ice cream there's nowhere on God's green earth
[03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:13.360]  where all 60 minerals exist in the soil and farmers aren't paid to mineralize
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:17.440]  the soil especially not in the industrial agriculture world that we live
[03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:24.040]  in thank you very much Monsanto I don't think so the 90 essential nutrients
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:29.440]  that your body needs simply to maintain its function are no longer present in
[03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:35.480]  the food that you're eating period they're not there so that means unless you
[03:36:35.480 --> 03:36:39.440]  are actively supplementing your diet with vitamin and mineral and
[03:36:39.440 --> 03:36:43.960]  nutritional supplements unless you were doing this it's only a matter of time
[03:36:43.960 --> 03:36:48.160]  until something in your body breaks until something wears out until something
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:53.080]  goes south and then you have a health concern you have a chronic disease you've
[03:36:53.080 --> 03:36:56.920]  got asthma you've got type 2 diabetes you've got high blood pressure you've
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:37:02.120]  got congestive heart failure you have fibromyalgia you're infertile your
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:07.040]  children have Down syndrome or autism you have insomnia or fibromyalgia or
[03:37:07.040 --> 03:37:14.080]  eczema or whatever you're in the weeds so what do you do well you go to the
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:18.520]  only medicine that's practiced in your town you go to the only medicine that's
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:23.240]  legal in your state you go to the only medicine that your insurance pays for
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:28.560]  that's MD directed medicine the MDs in the pharmaceutical companies have a lock
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:33.000]  on medical practice in the United States we don't have a free medical market
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:38.120]  here we do not have a free medical market my profession naturopathic medicine
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:42.640]  is only licensed and regulated in 16 states and the stuff that I know big
[03:37:42.640 --> 03:37:48.720]  pharma does not want you to know period for goodness sake your body needs 90
[03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:51.920]  essential nutrients all right you didn't have them so now something breaks and
[03:37:51.920 --> 03:37:57.280]  let's say you've got asthma so you go to your MD and he throws a drug at it now
[03:37:57.280 --> 03:38:02.320]  from our point of view asthma has its roots in nutrient deficiency the
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:08.360]  deficiency of essential fatty acids omega-3 6 and 9 omega-3 6 and 9 you
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:13.560]  don't have asthma or chronic disease because you have a bad gene you don't
[03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:18.120]  have a chronic disease because you have a voodoo curse you have a chronic disease
[03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:23.000]  because you have the wrong doctor your body has simply run out of the nutrients
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:28.200]  necessary to maintain and regulate its health it's that simple for goodness sake
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:33.080]  if your car runs out of oil what happens the engine seizes right does that mean
[03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:37.680]  there was anything inherently wrong with the mechanics of the engine no you just
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:41.600]  ran out of oil you run out of transmission fluid the transmission
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:45.560]  seizes you run out of power steering fluid you can't turn the wheel you run
[03:38:45.560 --> 03:38:49.840]  out of air in the tires well forget it and it's no different with the human
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:54.200]  body the biggest problem that we have here in the United States though is
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:58.280]  because medicine has been monopolized by the pharmaceutical industry and the
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:06.440]  MDs for the last 100 years your medical doctor has no training in nutrition no
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:10.880]  respect for nutrition no appreciation for nutrition and certainly no clinical
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:14.680]  experience with medical nutrition your medical doctor blesses heart is trained
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:18.800]  in drugs and surgery now drugs and surgery are great if you have a bullet in
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:22.920]  your arm if you have a bad tooth if you get your leg blown off heaven forbid in
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:27.520]  Iraq you have a third-degree burn if you have some type of trauma that's the
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:32.640]  wheelhouse of the MD that's the domain of the MD that's what they are excellent
[03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:36.640]  at for goodness sake if you were wounded in Vietnam you had something like a
[03:39:36.640 --> 03:39:41.720]  17% chance of survival if you're wounded on the battlefield today over 80% of our
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:45.240]  soldiers are going to come home because that's the domain of MD directed
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:50.440]  allopathic reductionistic medicine but where they stink is everything else
[03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:55.600]  everything that you go to the doctor for obesity you want to know the solution
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:40:02.040]  to obesity that not even Oprah knows here it is your body has wisdom this is
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:07.560]  the fundamental difference in the in the philosophies of holistic medicine which
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:12.000]  is what myself and my colleagues are trained in and the philosophy of
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:16.040]  reductionistic medicine that your MD is trained in the MD believes that your body
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:20.760]  is a coincidental combination of biochemicals that happened back in
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:25.920]  dinosaur days and that was excited by a thunderbolt from a passing thunder
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:29.680]  cloud you've got to be kidding me according to the MD there is no
[03:40:29.680 --> 03:40:33.520]  inherent vital force there is no inherent soul force in the human body
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:39.120]  once you're sick you're screwed your body cannot fix itself it's the doctor's
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:43.120]  job to manage things with drugs until they get so bad that you have to march
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:47.240]  in and get a new knee and then three years later when that knee fails you
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:53.280]  get a refund no you get another knee for goodness sake if you can afford it for
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:41:00.320]  goodness sake obesity is caused by the wisdom of your body the wisdom of your
[03:41:00.320 --> 03:41:04.800]  body and here's what I mean by that weight gain obesity obesity is weight
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:11.760]  gain on steroids your body knows how to fix itself your body wants to fix
[03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:17.480]  itself for goodness sake your body was so smart it grew itself all by itself from
[03:41:17.480 --> 03:41:21.680]  a single-celled organism into you you think if it could do that it can fix
[03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:26.680]  itself where you're darn right it can fix itself it also knows how to regulate
[03:41:26.680 --> 03:41:32.160]  its affairs so your body knows that it has the need for nutrients it knows it
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:36.600]  needs calcium and zinc and sulfur and vitamin a and vitamin b and vitamin c
[03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:42.680]  it knows it needs the 90 essential nutrients it knows it but because the
[03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:48.560]  nutrients are not in the food that we eat your body is running out of
[03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:53.680]  nutrients now after a time your nutritional tank gets so low that your
[03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:58.840]  intelligence of your body freaks out your body knows that if you continue to
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:03.120]  run on nutrient fumes your heart's gonna break your gallbladder is gonna break
[03:42:03.120 --> 03:42:07.160]  your joints are gonna break your brain's gonna break something's gonna break so
[03:42:07.160 --> 03:42:15.880]  your body freaks out and forces you to eat your body forces you to eat in the
[03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:20.240]  desperate attempt to fill its nutritional tank up but holy smokes the food
[03:42:20.240 --> 03:42:24.760]  that you're eating doesn't have the nutrients you need so you go to Olive
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:30.520]  Garden you eat 3,000 calories two hours later you're hungry again so you eat you
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:34.560]  eat you can't stop eating and then you go to your medical doctor your 150 pounds
[03:42:34.560 --> 03:42:39.120]  overweight and they tell you you're lazy even though a United Nations study done
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:45.560]  a couple years ago showed there's no relationship between over between exercise
[03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:51.040]  and weight gain has nothing to do with it has nothing to do with it your medical
[03:42:51.040 --> 03:42:54.840]  doctor tell you oh you need to have your stomach cut out that's your problem
[03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:59.320]  your stomach's too big we need to do a gastric bypass oh you have the fat gene
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:05.640]  that's your problem what's nonsense again because your medical doctor blesses
[03:43:05.640 --> 03:43:09.840]  heart is a colorblind art critic he does not know what we know your medical
[03:43:09.840 --> 03:43:13.920]  doctor has no understanding and no appreciation for medical nutrition the
[03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:18.640]  only thing that makes people gain weight is that we eat too many calories
[03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:22.440]  well was there anybody in the death camps of World War two that was overweight
[03:43:22.440 --> 03:43:26.520]  anybody I don't care what their pre-existing medical condition was I
[03:43:26.520 --> 03:43:32.560]  don't care what their age or their sex or their race was when you don't eat you
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:37.280]  lose weight the only thing that makes people gain weight is we eat too many
[03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:42.960]  calories period the only thing that makes you eat too many calories is the
[03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:48.240]  wisdom of your body your body knows it's running on nutrient fumes so your body
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:52.160]  forces you to eat in the desperate attempt to fill that tank up but the
[03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:56.200]  food that you're eating doesn't have what you need it just doesn't so you eat and
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:43:59.720]  you eat and you eat and you eat and then you eat some more and you never feel
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:05.000]  full and then your medical doctor tells you your stomach's too big you've got to
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:12.520]  be this is a tragedy of biblical proportions no pun intended now you
[03:44:12.520 --> 03:44:16.800]  want to know how to fix this well it's easy so in order to get on the other
[03:44:16.800 --> 03:44:21.440]  side of obesity the other side of weight gain you need to support and promote
[03:44:21.440 --> 03:44:25.120]  the nutritional status of your body that's all that you need to do you need
[03:44:25.120 --> 03:44:30.240]  to fill your body's nutritional tank up to the brim fill it to the brim with the
[03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:36.320]  90 essential nutrients now not all vitamin supplements are created equal
[03:44:36.320 --> 03:44:41.480]  vitamins are like wine there's a great deal of difference between any boonsprings
[03:44:41.480 --> 03:44:46.320]  green apple wine and a nice you know California Cabernet well they're all
[03:44:46.320 --> 03:44:50.640]  made from grapes what's the difference the recipes the difference I've been
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:54.560]  involved with naturopathic medicine the clinical application of naturopathic
[03:44:54.560 --> 03:45:00.040]  medicine as a primary care naturopathic physician for over 20 years and as God
[03:45:00.040 --> 03:45:04.560]  is my witness the recipes of the vitamin supplements offered by the young
[03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:09.160]  Jebedee company formulated by Dr. Wallach Eclipse anything else in
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.560]  efficacy that I have ever seen Dr. Wallach's nutritional supplements
[03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:18.080]  produce more consistent results than any other nutritional supplements why
[03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:23.320]  because their recipe is better it's that simple yeah well you're gonna spend
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:26.320]  harder and money on vitamins you got to buy them somewhere you might as well get
[03:45:26.320 --> 03:45:29.520]  the best ones in the world for goodness sake if your kid wanted to be coached
[03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:34.200]  in basketball and you had the option to get him coached by what by Michael
[03:45:34.200 --> 03:45:37.600]  Jordan or by your high school basketball coach for the same amount of money
[03:45:37.600 --> 03:45:43.840]  you'd go with Jordan right why because he's the best if Albert Einstein was
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:47.560]  still alive and your son wanted to learn science and you could hire Albert
[03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:51.320]  Einstein as a tutor or your high school science teacher who would you hire you
[03:45:51.320 --> 03:45:57.200]  hire Einstein well if you want advice with nutritional supplements quite
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:00.440]  frankly your knucklehead if you don't lean on Dr. Wallach's clinical
[03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:05.440]  experience in Dr. Wallach's research resume Dr. Wallach's knowledge base
[03:46:05.440 --> 03:46:11.960]  about science-based clinically verified non-drug treatments eclipses anybody
[03:46:11.960 --> 03:46:17.840]  else Dr. Wallach is the Michael Jordan the Wayne Gretzky the Albert Einstein of
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:24.760]  holistic medicine his stuff works better than anything I've ever seen so guess
[03:46:24.760 --> 03:46:30.000]  what in his wisdom Wallach has put together the 90 essential nutrients in
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:34.860]  one package it's called the healthy start pack it's available here at info
[03:46:34.860 --> 03:46:39.640]  wars health calm it's called the Alex pack info wars health calm the
[03:46:39.640 --> 03:46:46.240]  recommendation is one Alex pack per 100 pounds of body weight per month if you
[03:46:46.240 --> 03:46:51.240]  take one Alex pack one healthy start pack per 100 pounds of body weight per
[03:46:51.240 --> 03:46:56.000]  month into your body into you add that to your diet every day it's a game
[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:02.560]  changer because when you do that guess what happens it's the first time in your
[03:47:02.560 --> 03:47:09.200]  life your body has been nutritionally satisfied the first time switches start
[03:47:09.200 --> 03:47:13.440]  turning on in your brain that have been turned off for decades if you're
[03:47:13.440 --> 03:47:16.960]  struggling with weight gain you take the 90 essential nutrients every day and all
[03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:22.080]  of a sudden you go to Olive Garden there's 3,000 calories on your plate you
[03:47:22.080 --> 03:47:28.000]  eat 800 and you're full you take the rest home in a doggie bag it's as simple
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:33.680]  as that ladies and gentlemen give your body the raw materials necessary to fix
[03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:39.120]  itself get out of the way and let the body fix itself you have no idea what
[03:47:39.120 --> 03:47:43.800]  you're missing by the way this isn't old-fashioned medical nutrition this is
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:50.720]  new-fashioned science-based clinically verified stuff delivered by holistic
[03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:57.840]  physicians who are licensed and trained in how to do this as God is my witness
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:01.200]  this is the best kept secret in the wonderful world of medicine it really
[03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:06.240]  is our basic premise here is your body knows how to fix itself and your body
[03:48:06.240 --> 03:48:10.600]  wants to fix itself and that most chronic diseases have their roots in
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:15.520]  nutrient deficiencies did you know that there are over 275 illnesses caused by
[03:48:15.520 --> 03:48:20.440]  not enough calcium high blood pressure is one of them menstrual cramps bad
[03:48:20.440 --> 03:48:25.360]  menstrual cramps that's often a calcium deficiency inability to fall asleep at
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:30.040]  night is a calcium deficiency most of the time has its roots in a calcium
[03:48:30.040 --> 03:48:34.840]  deficiency high blood pressure has its roots in a calcium deficiency muscle
[03:48:34.840 --> 03:48:39.440]  ticks and twitches have their roots in calcium deficiencies ringing in the ears
[03:48:39.440 --> 03:48:44.200]  has its roots in a calcium deficiency you don't have a bad gene you don't have a
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:48.760]  voodoo curse you have the wrong doctor you've taken the wrong dog to the hunt
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:52.680]  why because your medical doctor and your insurance company and your
