[00:00.000 --> 00:10.320]  Just on the opposite side of the main closet, in front of it, me.
[00:10.320 --> 00:22.880]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[00:22.880 --> 00:28.880]  that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[00:28.880 --> 00:35.600]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:35.600 --> 00:36.600]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.600]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the
[00:41.600 --> 00:45.600]  80s, he's the boogeyman they need, and this were welly and phony system.
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.440]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.240]  I've been on your fire.
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.800]  Babylon, Mr. Religion, ceremony.
[00:56.800 --> 01:01.880]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalists.
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.720]  Prison-planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[01:05.720 --> 01:09.000]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.600]  And most of you are about to stink in Paris!
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.520]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[01:18.520 --> 01:21.520]  Valley.
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.400]  They falsely edited him.
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.440]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.000]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.560]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.400]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:46.400 --> 01:50.240]  And then we get hit, say, you no longer use our software.
[01:50.240 --> 01:53.080]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.400]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[01:54.400 --> 01:55.400]  They just killed our stream.
[01:55.400 --> 01:56.400]  Right, are they?
[01:56.400 --> 01:57.400]  Yep.
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.880]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:01.880 --> 02:04.400]  This is America in 2018.
[02:04.400 --> 02:13.680]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:13.680 --> 02:18.160]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:18.160 --> 02:20.240]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.320]  Or will you do your own research?
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.480]  For the truth and stand for freedom.
[02:28.480 --> 02:57.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:02.360 --> 03:06.840]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06.840 --> 03:13.200]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:13.200 --> 03:19.840]  Well, these are the times that try men and women's souls.
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.200]  I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to really try to do the very best
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.000]  job I can for you today.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.680]  I talk a lot about things that I call skeleton keys or rosetta stones, basically events that
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.520]  if you understand those events, you understand the big picture.
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.680]  Beyond teachable moments.
[03:41.680 --> 03:49.520]  And this whole Notre Dame fire, as I watched it burn while we were on the air yesterday
[03:49.520 --> 03:54.480]  and almost completely destroyed, just a husk of the historic beautiful 900 plus year old
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.720]  building left built in the 1100s.
[03:58.720 --> 04:01.840]  I wasn't even thinking political things at the time.
[04:01.840 --> 04:04.720]  But obviously we said, could it be arson?
[04:04.720 --> 04:05.920]  Could it be construction?
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.000]  But for them to say we think it's construction in the first hour of the blaze, that's suspicious
[04:11.000 --> 04:21.840]  because you know if an RV park burns down, you know, I had a old bus and we used it occasionally
[04:21.840 --> 04:25.720]  and it was at a covered RV facility.
[04:25.720 --> 04:27.360]  And a few months ago it burned down.
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.640]  There's still a criminal investigation of that big fire in North Austin that burned
[04:32.640 --> 04:35.040]  it up over 200 boats and RVs.
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.400]  There's still a criminal investigation.
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.920]  But oh my gosh, we're not supposed to investigate this day one when 800 plus churches have been
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.320]  burnt up or blown up in France alone in the last 12 months.
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.000]  And ISIS, by the way, is pretty much taking responsibility for it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.920]  But don't you dare even question, nope, open and shut before the fire is even out, nothing
[04:57.920 --> 05:00.840]  to see here move along.
[05:00.840 --> 05:06.680]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[05:06.680 --> 05:11.040]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.040]  damage.
[05:12.040 --> 05:17.120]  We took on Hillary Clinton, we stopped her, we got a national stand.
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.040]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[05:19.040 --> 05:20.040]  We are winning.
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.480]  But those of us who are at the very front line, the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented
[05:25.480 --> 05:26.480]  attack.
[05:26.480 --> 05:30.960]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[05:30.960 --> 05:36.240]  This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors
[05:36.240 --> 05:37.360]  they've taken, everything.
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.320]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands, I need financial support and I got products
[05:41.320 --> 05:42.880]  you and your family need.
[05:42.880 --> 05:43.880]  It's that simple.
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.520]  Thousands of great products, whatever is award winning, whatever is best selling, what
[05:47.520 --> 05:51.520]  folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at infowarsore.com.
[05:51.520 --> 05:56.080]  So please go to infowarsore.com today, look at all the great products because we're in
[05:56.080 --> 06:05.400]  your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical, thank you.
[06:05.400 --> 06:11.960]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[06:11.960 --> 06:23.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.600 --> 06:40.680]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:40.680 --> 06:44.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[06:44.040 --> 06:50.840]  On this Tuesday, April 16, 2019, Global Broadcast, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:50.840 --> 06:58.080]  Obviously, the tragic fire of a very important historic Christian site in Europe in what's
[06:58.080 --> 07:06.600]  left of Islamic-occupied France burned not to the ground but into an empty husk to a
[07:06.600 --> 07:13.720]  great extent, and we are seeing the incredible response by European news, U.S. news, even
[07:13.720 --> 07:21.160]  Fox News, of trying to take anyone offline that says it should be investigated for arson.
[07:21.160 --> 07:28.240]  Well, under French law, under EU law, under U.S. law, under U.K. law, under common law,
[07:28.240 --> 07:33.680]  any big fire is investigated.
[07:33.680 --> 07:40.320]  Shep Smith and Caputo and all the rest on Fox, when they have head of the Catholic
[07:40.320 --> 07:44.560]  League on, or a French government official on, saying, well, actually, we don't know
[07:44.560 --> 07:47.200]  if this was just construction.
[07:47.200 --> 07:49.320]  That's just being put out by the news.
[07:49.320 --> 07:50.320]  It may have been arson.
[07:50.320 --> 07:55.120]  We've had 800 churches burn the last 12 months.
[07:55.120 --> 07:57.920]  Shep Smith shuts it down.
[07:57.920 --> 08:02.320]  You can see the video at infowars.com and newswars.com and a Jamie Smith article.
[08:02.320 --> 08:03.320]  It's very important.
[08:03.320 --> 08:05.200]  It's very disgusting behavior.
[08:05.200 --> 08:08.440]  Meanwhile, France is the main epicenter.
[08:08.440 --> 08:11.000]  Thousands of cars burned a month.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.800]  People screaming a la hot bar and that they're on a jihad.
[08:15.800 --> 08:25.680]  The UN reports that there have been in Europe 11, 1063 churches attacked or burned down
[08:25.680 --> 08:28.440]  or defaced that have been reported.
[08:28.440 --> 08:30.880]  And most of those are in France.
[08:30.880 --> 08:36.080]  And I've got the report here where the UN reports that Christianity is the most persecuted
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.520]  religion in the world.
[08:39.520 --> 08:47.320]  So you can't have churches in the Middle East used to be Christian, but Islam came along
[08:47.320 --> 08:50.040]  1400 years ago.
[08:50.040 --> 08:58.680]  And so whether it's in Egypt or whether it is in places like Iraq, you can't have a
[08:58.680 --> 09:01.480]  church because they'll fire bomb you or suicide bomb you.
[09:01.480 --> 09:05.520]  And then in places where you supposedly can be Christian like Egypt, it was formerly
[09:05.520 --> 09:12.080]  almost 100% Christian just a few hundred years ago, or in places like Syria, if you try
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.800]  to show up for Easter or Christmas or Palm Sunday, you get blown up again by a truck
[09:17.800 --> 09:18.800]  bomb.
[09:18.800 --> 09:24.160]  And when I cover that, they have mainstream media writing articles saying, Jones is making
[09:24.160 --> 09:27.480]  up that Islam attacks churches.
[09:27.480 --> 09:33.280]  It's like saying, Jones is making it up that foxes will try to get in a hen house and eat
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.640]  chickens or Jones is making it up the great white sharks like to eat seals.
[09:38.640 --> 09:41.440]  No, I'm not.
[09:41.440 --> 09:43.320]  So that's what's going on.
[09:43.320 --> 09:50.640]  ISIS has pledged on Palm Sunday and on the days leading up to Easter, as I said, what
[09:50.640 --> 09:57.440]  a few months ago, I said, Islam is attacking churches all over the world.
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.640]  And I said, Islam has said on Palm Sunday through Easter, they're going to burn up and
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.640]  bomb churches.
[10:03.640 --> 10:04.640]  And guess what?
[10:04.640 --> 10:09.560]  They said, just last week, we're going to blow up more churches in France.
[10:09.560 --> 10:17.120]  ISIS had a public plot to blow up Notre Dame, but the talking point has gone out that you
[10:17.120 --> 10:18.120]  don't let them talk about it.
[10:18.120 --> 10:27.280]  In fact, just what three weeks ago, when we saw the Christ Church Mosque attacked, I said,
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.000]  the media won't cover it when we see churches being fire bombed and blown up and shot up
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.360]  or Islamists running over people with cars or trucks screaming Allah Akbar.
[10:42.360 --> 10:48.640]  And now you've got Easter week and you know you're going to see more churches torched.
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.500]  You know you're going to see cars running people over.
[10:53.500 --> 10:57.240]  You know you're going to see churches blown up and shot up and they're going to try every
[10:57.240 --> 11:03.560]  time to say it wasn't Islam, even though you're going to hear Allah Akbar.
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.480]  Now maybe this is construction at Notre Dame.
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]  Maybe it is.
[11:09.480 --> 11:13.960]  But when you suddenly have the head of the Catholic League being cut off, Fox News for
[11:13.960 --> 11:20.320]  saying we should look at Islamic terror, there have been a lot of threats.
[11:20.320 --> 11:25.480]  And you've got government officials in France on Fox News being kicked off and all their
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.000]  channels are doing the same thing and they're saying there's no way Islam ever touched the
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  church.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.720]  No, they just drive Christians out of wherever they live, whether it be North Africa, Central
[11:33.720 --> 11:40.640]  Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, whether it be the East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.640]  Asia.
[11:41.640 --> 11:47.440]  I mean my God, the Muslims have been trying to take over India for 1200 years since they
[11:47.440 --> 11:54.400]  got there, took a few hundred years to get there, and they've killed reportedly 145 million
[11:54.400 --> 11:55.880]  Hindus and Buddhists.
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.880]  It's estimated.
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.960]  In fact, until then, the Buddhists and people really weren't even training in warfare until
[12:01.960 --> 12:02.960]  the Muslims showed up.
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.800]  That's where you get Kung Fu and all that.
[12:06.800 --> 12:10.320]  Was the Buddhists and the Hindus said, okay, let's get weapons, let's get trained.
[12:10.320 --> 12:13.120]  What do you think the Sikhs come from?
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.800]  Arch enemies of radical Islam and Orthodox Islam.
[12:15.800 --> 12:20.520]  And of course, it's always some redneck dumbass in a real hate attack that goes in a liquor
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.960]  store or a gas station or to seek temple and shoot 20, 30 people, thinking they're Muslims
[12:25.960 --> 12:28.720]  because they're wearing turbans and have brown skin.
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.800]  It's a religious sect to fight Muslims, you morons.
[12:33.800 --> 12:43.000]  One of the only real white on brown organized attacks I keep seeing is dumb white people.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.040]  Not all white folks are bad.
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.040]  I'm not saying that.
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.080]  I'm saying the left's always making stuff about the whites doing this, whites doing
[12:49.080 --> 12:57.640]  that, but the only real terror crimes I see on a routine basis is there's been some black
[12:57.640 --> 12:59.560]  people attack them too and some Hispanics.
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.000]  The point is, folks see that big turban and they think that's a Muslim.
[13:03.000 --> 13:13.560]  No, that is a Hindu military order to defend Hindus from 145 million of them being murdered.
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.560]  Murdered.
[13:14.560 --> 13:21.360]  There were no Muslims 1400 years ago in India.
[13:21.360 --> 13:22.360]  Now what are they?
[13:22.360 --> 13:27.360]  37% of the population and most experts agree of real World War four ever breaks out between
[13:27.360 --> 13:28.360]  India and Pakistan.
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.400]  Hell, they were just bombing each other a month ago.
[13:32.400 --> 13:35.880]  So imagine this, we'll come back and play all the clips.
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.680]  You've got government officials, the head of the Catholic League, others saying ISIS
[13:39.680 --> 13:42.680]  and others said they were going to target Notre Dame, which I've got the articles they
[13:42.680 --> 13:45.640]  did just a week ago.
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.080]  And then you've got Muslims celebrating and doing selfies and smiling.
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.600]  Paul Watson wrote about it and Buzzfeed, the kings of fake news, the kings of fake Russian
[13:53.600 --> 14:00.640]  dossiers and PP gate, they came out and said info wars.com and summit.news, Paul's great
[14:00.640 --> 14:10.200]  site were fake news, even though there's video, video on Paul's article and images of the
[14:10.200 --> 14:18.000]  people celebrating in mass and doing selfies with it burning Buzzfeed caught a huge lie
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.240]  about Notre Dame fire claims video showing people reacting with smiling emojis was a
[14:24.240 --> 14:26.800]  hoax when it was completely legitimate.
[14:26.800 --> 14:35.440]  Many of them prominent leftist professors, a weird self loading Jews, there's a bunch
[14:35.440 --> 14:38.760]  of leftist Jews in there.
[14:38.760 --> 14:40.920]  I mean, this is crazy.
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.680]  Same Jews that want to get rid of Israel.
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.120]  It's just whack job level, not so it.
[14:46.120 --> 14:52.960]  So we come back, Shep Smith, Caputo, all of them on Fox News, you don't bring that up.
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.840]  There's no way Islam ever armed to fly.
[14:56.840 --> 14:58.200]  They didn't harm a flea.
[14:58.200 --> 15:00.880]  They didn't hurt a hair on anybody's head.
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.600]  Islam's a religion to peace.
[15:02.600 --> 15:08.120]  They hand out flowers and don't you in the big Islamic command base of Paris, they've
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.840]  already burned up and blown up a bunch of churches and run over people with cars by
[15:11.840 --> 15:17.760]  the hundreds and stab people and shot people and attacked rock bands and murdered in mass
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.040]  and everything else screaming Allah Akbar.
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.960]  Don't you dare say radical Islam even exists because Shep Smith says it doesn't and you
[15:26.960 --> 15:33.240]  don't even before the fires are out question that it could have been arson by anybody.
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.920]  You've heard the official story not from the fire department, but you've heard it from
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.720]  Fox News, who's taking a big giant turn to the left as the globalist panic and think
[15:42.720 --> 15:44.040]  they can't be Trump.
[15:44.040 --> 15:50.080]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, fury at Fox News for hosting Bernie, audience cheers, Medicaid
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.480]  for all.
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.520]  Everybody wants some free stuff and Bernie is ready to do it.

[17:28.440 --> 17:33.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:33.840 --> 17:34.840]  the world.
[17:34.840 --> 17:37.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.840]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.640]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[17:47.640 --> 17:48.640]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.640 --> 17:50.200]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.200 --> 17:56.760]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[17:56.760 --> 18:03.760]  at Amazon Books.
[18:56.760 --> 19:07.760]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market,
[19:07.760 --> 19:10.960]  pro-western speech all across the world.
[19:10.960 --> 19:15.680]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last
[19:15.680 --> 19:18.800]  year to be the platform, then they set the precedent.
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.680]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they
[19:23.680 --> 19:25.160]  take you off the internet.
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.600]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of
[19:30.600 --> 19:35.960]  most types on their platform, because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[19:35.960 --> 19:41.840]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist,
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.800]  anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[19:46.800 --> 19:51.840]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco and many of these
[19:51.840 --> 19:56.780]  big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet, humanity must awaken
[19:56.780 --> 20:03.480]  and say no to these control freaks.
[20:03.480 --> 20:12.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.040 --> 20:30.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.320 --> 20:33.320]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide from the ATX.
[20:33.320 --> 20:40.600]  I am Alex Jones, your host, infowars.com, newswars.com are the websites, okay.
[20:40.600 --> 20:48.800]  So we have a whole stack of articles here from the Guardian, from the Associated Press,
[20:48.800 --> 20:53.880]  from Wikipedia, from the New York Post about bombing attacks, terror attacks, attempted
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.240]  attacks on Notre Dame the last year.
[20:57.240 --> 21:02.080]  We have ISIS just last week saying we're going to target churches in Europe over Palm Sunday
[21:02.080 --> 21:03.080]  through Easter.
[21:03.080 --> 21:08.560]  And of course, we've had a thousand plus churches fire bombed or attacked in just last year
[21:08.560 --> 21:10.960]  in Europe.
[21:10.960 --> 21:17.480]  Everybody knows that thousands of cars a month get burned all over Europe by Muslims.
[21:17.480 --> 21:23.040]  And of course, even the Daily Beast has to report an ISIS plot to blow up Notre Dame
[21:23.040 --> 21:25.040]  Cathedral and rule the world.
[21:25.040 --> 21:30.960]  And of course, they make jokes about it because they're there to make sure we don't get warned
[21:30.960 --> 21:33.040]  about what's happening.
[21:33.040 --> 21:41.440]  And I was just here in the break, back in the coffee room, in the kitchen, and there
[21:41.440 --> 21:46.960]  was Fox News saying, well, soon as all the fires are out, they're going to have arson
[21:46.960 --> 21:51.080]  experts get in and in the fire department to find out what happened.
[21:51.080 --> 21:56.240]  But we know it's not arson, and we know it's not terrorism.
[21:56.240 --> 21:59.680]  So he says, there's no investigations been done.
[21:59.680 --> 22:05.040]  The government, the fire department say they don't know what did it, but it's not Muslims
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.320]  and it's not arsonists.
[22:08.320 --> 22:11.800]  Even though the reporter goes on to say, though there was no one in there at the time that
[22:11.800 --> 22:15.360]  the fire started, no renovation going on.
[22:15.360 --> 22:17.520]  That is, the renovators weren't in there at the time.
[22:17.520 --> 22:21.160]  Now, you're going to hear and see this for yourself.
[22:21.160 --> 22:25.840]  So this is an attack on logic.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.840]  They've not looked at the evidence.
[22:27.840 --> 22:33.200]  The fire was only going for an hour and they said, no Islamic terror because Islamic terror
[22:33.200 --> 22:34.200]  doesn't exist.
[22:34.200 --> 22:41.200]  Remember, Obama said that ISIS is the opposite of Islam and that Islam is peace and that
[22:41.200 --> 22:43.360]  Islam has never done anything wrong.
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.600]  But all you hear all day is about how bad Christianity is from our corporate media.
[22:49.600 --> 22:56.680]  And now Fox News is taking a giant sickening turn to the globalist left.
[22:56.680 --> 22:57.880]  It just never ends.
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.920]  So here's part of that Fox News report.
[22:59.920 --> 23:00.920]  It's shocking.
[23:00.920 --> 23:04.800]  This structure will be examined to make sure it's safe.
[23:04.800 --> 23:09.840]  And then firefighters will go in, they'll try to retrieve anything they can from this
[23:09.840 --> 23:11.960]  and also really assess what happened.
[23:11.960 --> 23:15.320]  There's going to be a team of 50 inspectors going in.
[23:15.320 --> 23:21.480]  The source of the fire, it is thought that it was the renovation work around the spire
[23:21.480 --> 23:24.120]  in the rear part of the nave.
[23:24.120 --> 23:29.600]  Somehow it set off this fire, but we've just learned that in fact all the renovation workers
[23:29.600 --> 23:32.360]  had left well before the fire started.
[23:32.360 --> 23:33.520]  So that raises questions.
[23:33.520 --> 23:37.360]  But no arson, absolutely no terrorism.
[23:37.360 --> 23:38.680]  That's being ruled out.
[23:38.680 --> 23:41.160]  And all of that is a good thing.
[23:41.160 --> 23:44.280]  Right now, outpouring of grief, I'm here, right along the-
[23:44.280 --> 23:46.440]  Let's stop right there.
[23:46.440 --> 23:51.120]  Now that just happened minutes ago live from Paris.
[23:51.120 --> 23:55.760]  We're a radio listener with what's left of Notre Dame, one of the most important religious
[23:55.760 --> 24:00.120]  sites for Christians in the world, beautiful piece of architecture and history regardless.
[24:00.120 --> 24:07.600]  And people risking their lives to get in and get the artifacts out that are priceless.
[24:07.600 --> 24:09.760]  And he says, they have to go in and assess.
[24:09.760 --> 24:12.480]  They don't know what happened.
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.640]  No one's even gone in yet to assess things, but as soon as it's safe, they'll go in to
[24:18.640 --> 24:19.920]  find out what happened.
[24:19.920 --> 24:24.720]  But we know it wasn't arson and we know it wasn't Islam.
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.080]  It's like they find a dead body with bullet holes in the back of your yard and the police
[24:29.080 --> 24:33.120]  go, well, we know it wasn't foul play, but we don't know what happened.
[24:33.120 --> 24:37.200]  So we don't know what happened, but we know it wasn't foul play, excuse me.
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.440]  So now while a building's on fire, you're told not to ask questions.
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.520]  And all over MSNBC, CNN, they're attacking info wars on MSNBC and CNN.
[24:48.520 --> 24:54.320]  Surprise, surprise, they're attacking Paul Watson and saying no one's celebrated this
[24:54.320 --> 24:55.320]  on Twitter.
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.600]  No one's celebrated it.
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.160]  No Islamic groups celebrated it.
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.800]  And I have all their celebrations that are even in other newspapers.
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.200]  That's up on info wars.com.
[25:04.200 --> 25:07.800]  These people are just incredibly hubris filled.
[25:07.800 --> 25:16.720]  So let's go to Shep Smith, old Shep Smith on Fox News yesterday.
[25:16.720 --> 25:26.520]  And he's sitting there interviewing folks, and of course they both, Kabuto and he interviewed
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.840]  leaders of the Catholic community, head of the Catholic League, government officials
[25:30.840 --> 25:32.520]  in France.
[25:32.520 --> 25:38.400]  And when they tried to ask a question, when they tried to say anything, they were shut
[25:38.400 --> 25:39.400]  down.
[25:39.400 --> 25:40.400]  Here it is.
[25:40.400 --> 25:45.600]  Jamie White in full wars.com, Shep Smith cuts off French official for alluding to Islamic
[25:45.600 --> 25:48.200]  arson of Notre Dame Cathedral.
[25:48.200 --> 25:50.920]  No, sir, we're not doing that here.
[25:50.920 --> 25:51.920]  Not now.
[25:51.920 --> 25:52.920]  Not on my watch.
[25:52.920 --> 25:53.920]  Snaps.
[25:53.920 --> 25:54.920]  Smith.
[25:54.920 --> 25:56.480]  Not on his watch.
[25:56.480 --> 25:59.920]  He gets someone on that's a French official.
[25:59.920 --> 26:01.200]  The cathedral's been targeted.
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.280]  It's been attacked before by Islamists.
[26:04.280 --> 26:06.520]  Those Islamists say they're targeting it.
[26:06.520 --> 26:08.400]  They don't know the cause.
[26:08.400 --> 26:14.600]  But the official story from Macron, who's opened the doors to Islamify France is it's not that.
[26:14.600 --> 26:18.200]  The official story, as you're being told, you're not going to look at what it is.
[26:18.200 --> 26:19.200]  That's right.
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.040]  At this point, when you're told don't look at something before the fires are even out,
[26:23.040 --> 26:26.440]  you've got Islamic groups saying we're going to target this and they have before.
[26:26.440 --> 26:27.520]  You've got to then default.
[26:27.520 --> 26:28.520]  There's a cover up.
[26:28.520 --> 26:31.160]  But they don't want you to be able to ask questions.
[26:31.160 --> 26:32.960]  That's the cardinal sin.
[26:32.960 --> 26:36.120]  Here is the clip.
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.600]  Felipe Carcetti is on the line with us, a French elected official who is in Paris now.
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.200]  Felipe.
[26:44.200 --> 26:47.880]  What have you seen and what do you know?
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.200]  Well, I was close to the scene when it happened.
[26:52.200 --> 26:57.120]  And now I left the place because we want to let people work around it.
[26:57.120 --> 27:00.160]  Everybody's really under shock now in France.
[27:00.160 --> 27:03.000]  I would tell you something.
[27:03.000 --> 27:11.040]  Even if nobody died, I mean, it's like a 9-11, it's a French 9-11, you know, and it's a
[27:11.040 --> 27:12.040]  big shock.
[27:12.040 --> 27:18.560]  This church was there for more than 850 years.
[27:18.560 --> 27:22.160]  Even the Nazis didn't dare to destroy it.
[27:22.160 --> 27:27.640]  And you need to know that for the past years, we had churches desecrated each and every
[27:27.640 --> 27:31.000]  week in France, all over France.
[27:31.000 --> 27:38.880]  So of course, you will hear the story about the political correctness, which will tell
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.760]  you that it's probably an accident.
[27:40.760 --> 27:47.200]  Sir, sir, we're not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don't know.
[27:47.200 --> 27:54.280]  If you have observations, or you know something, we would love to hear it.
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.800]  I'm just telling you something.
[27:55.800 --> 27:58.160]  What do you need to be ready to do?
[27:58.160 --> 28:02.280]  No, sir, we're not doing that here, not now, not on my watch.
[28:02.280 --> 28:06.360]  Felipe Carcetti, it's very good of you to be here.
[28:06.360 --> 28:11.480]  Now, they're all on the news with no proof saying it's not Islamic and it's not arson.
[28:11.480 --> 28:16.800]  So they're speculating, they're lying, they're being definitive with no proof.
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.600]  They're engaged in fraud, regardless of what happened.
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.840]  This man says, we've got 800 churches burned up in the last year.
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.760]  That's what it is in France, attacked.
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.680]  You've got that church being a major target.
[28:30.680 --> 28:34.200]  And he's saying, we're looking at this, and he's a French government official in the
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.320]  federal government, and Shep Smith hangs up on him.
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.800]  We've got Kabuto doing it too.
[28:40.800 --> 28:43.200]  They got the memo, folks.
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.040]  They got the memo, Islam's religion of peace.
[28:46.040 --> 28:50.360]  Let them run your life, convert your Sharia law, bring them in just like Minnesota, and
[28:50.360 --> 28:55.360]  elect an Ilhan Omar, and just everything to be happy as you know what, pigs and you
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.520]  know what, until, of course, they...

[32:56.680 --> 33:03.000]  Those news today started right here.
[33:03.000 --> 33:14.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.720 --> 33:33.360]  Well, Neil, if it isn't an accident, it's a monumental tragedy.
[33:33.360 --> 33:35.640]  But forgive me for being suspicious.
[33:35.640 --> 33:40.120]  Just last month, a 17th century church was set on fire in Paris.
[33:40.120 --> 33:44.600]  We've seen tabernacles knocked down, crosses have been torn down, statues have
[33:44.600 --> 33:45.600]  been torn down.
[33:45.600 --> 33:46.600]  We don't know that.
[33:46.600 --> 33:47.600]  We don't know.
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.520]  So if we can avoid what your suspicions might be, I do want to look at what happens now.
[33:51.520 --> 33:57.280]  There was a very pricey rebuilding and renovation effort going on that involved a good deal
[33:57.280 --> 34:01.440]  of Catholic fundraising campaigns I know in this country and abroad.
[34:01.440 --> 34:03.840]  This renovation was paid for up front.
[34:03.840 --> 34:06.040]  So in other words, all the monies were there.
[34:06.040 --> 34:11.960]  And now I'm wondering how much more the Catholic Church commits to this or do you think now
[34:11.960 --> 34:15.000]  they first want to get to the bottom of it?
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.400]  Well, first they have to get to the bottom of it and they will rebuild it.
[34:17.400 --> 34:18.600]  There's no question about that.
[34:18.600 --> 34:20.680]  And certainly the Catholic Church will come up with the money for it.
[34:20.680 --> 34:22.200]  That's not even a question.
[34:22.200 --> 34:23.200]  But I'm sorry.
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.960]  I mean, when I find out that the Eucharist is being destroyed and excrement is being
[34:27.960 --> 34:28.960]  smeared on crosses.
[34:28.960 --> 34:29.960]  Wait a minute.
[34:29.960 --> 34:30.960]  This is going on now.
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.080]  I love you, Dale, but we cannot make conjectures about this.
[34:34.080 --> 34:35.080]  So thank you very much.
[34:35.080 --> 34:36.080]  Oh, no.
[34:36.080 --> 34:37.080]  I'm sorry.
[34:37.080 --> 34:38.080]  Thank you very, very much.
[34:38.080 --> 34:39.080]  I do want to let people know.
[34:39.080 --> 34:41.400]  And again, we're not trying to be rude to our guests here.
[34:41.400 --> 34:44.400]  There is so much we do not know about what happened here.
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.120]  We do know that about four hours ago, something started here.
[34:48.120 --> 34:51.520]  Now there are incidents that have been raised against the Catholic Church.
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.480]  A lot of popular tourist sites, certainly in and around Paris, no stranger to attacks.
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.880]  But it is another leap to start taking the juice like that.
[34:59.880 --> 35:01.400]  Really good.
[35:01.400 --> 35:07.400]  By the way, in just a few minutes, we'll get to the video.
[35:07.400 --> 35:10.280]  It's up on infowars.com.
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.960]  ISIS supporters celebrate Notre Dame's Inferno, three years after terror groups failed bomb
[35:15.960 --> 35:20.040]  attack on the same cathedral.
[35:20.040 --> 35:25.120]  But that's okay because Neil Caputo and Shep Smith say, it doesn't matter if you're the
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.120]  head of the Catholic League.
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.200]  It doesn't matter if you're a federal official in the government that they invite on as a
[35:30.200 --> 35:32.920]  guest and you say, listen, they're blowing up churches everywhere.
[35:32.920 --> 35:36.000]  They said they would attack in and around Easter.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  They do this all over the world, no, it's not Islamic.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.920]  It's not Islamic.
[35:43.920 --> 35:45.800]  Do not look there.
[35:45.800 --> 35:46.800]  Okay?
[35:46.800 --> 35:47.800]  We have it investigated.
[35:47.800 --> 35:51.000]  We have it looked.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.240]  But we're going to tell you it's not Islamic and it's not terror.
[35:53.240 --> 35:56.520]  Even though there was nobody working in the building at the time, we're just going to tell
[35:56.520 --> 36:03.000]  you that we know it's not Islam because it is the religion of peace, period.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.760]  Meanwhile, we've had giant caravans, hundreds of thousands every few weeks slamming into
[36:08.760 --> 36:10.920]  the United States.
[36:10.920 --> 36:16.000]  We have Democratic Party paid for buses just picking up men, women and children who disappear
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.680]  to be given fake IDs and vote.
[36:19.680 --> 36:25.560]  A permanent underclass, a new giant group of caravans just smashed over the Mexican border
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.920]  with Guatemala overrunning police just like last year.
[36:28.920 --> 36:38.240]  This all happened and we've got new giant waves of Islamic invasion, millions now pouring
[36:38.240 --> 36:43.080]  into Europe, a third giant wave.
[36:43.080 --> 36:46.840]  It's all happening and you've got the former head of Homeland Security, the former head
[36:46.840 --> 36:53.160]  of ICE, both coming out and saying this is the worst crisis ever.
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.720]  It's three times any number we've ever seen and I see some leftist press blaming Trump.
[36:57.720 --> 37:00.840]  Oh, the reason there's record people coming here is because of you.
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.600]  No, the UN, George Soros, the State Department, set it up with the refugee centers to prepare
[37:06.600 --> 37:10.840]  this and to break our border.
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.760]  Steve Watson has the article at mfullwars.com, Obama Border Patrol head.
[37:15.760 --> 37:18.320]  Crisis is worse in the history of the country.
[37:18.320 --> 37:24.000]  So, while the Democrats got the refugee centers built and the millions ready to bomb Russia's,
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.680]  they said this isn't happening, there's no caravan, there's no crisis, there's no
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.440]  diseases, there's no crime.
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.880]  And now that the courts are overwhelmed, the military is overwhelmed, federal law enforcement,
[37:37.880 --> 37:40.360]  ICE, the border patrol, it's all overwhelmed.
[37:40.360 --> 37:45.760]  Now, oh, it is a big crisis and it's Trump's doing.
[37:45.760 --> 37:47.120]  It's Trump.
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.000]  Trump created the crisis.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.680]  Trump put the children in cages.
[37:50.680 --> 37:52.720]  Trump, Trump, Trump.
[37:52.720 --> 37:53.720]  Good Lord.
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.560]  Oh, and here's the headlines.
[37:57.560 --> 38:04.080]  Million Prime Minister warns EU about almost a million of potential migrants, that's Islamic
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.760]  military-age men invaders, echoing Qaddafi and says a million are on their way.
[38:09.760 --> 38:10.760]  They are aggressive.
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.160]  He says we are facing a war of aggression that will spread its cancer throughout the Mediterranean.
[38:16.160 --> 38:21.720]  This is the radical Islamists that took over Libya, have been partially repulsed, and now
[38:21.720 --> 38:25.840]  it's left the government saying, emergency, emergency, they're killing us, they're coming
[38:25.840 --> 38:36.040]  for you, Islamic radicals have entered the base, Islamic radicals have entered the base.
[38:36.040 --> 38:41.160]  I mean, we've got videos where you can look out a high-rise window and see like 400 fires
[38:41.160 --> 38:48.200]  burning, and people going, just running around, just mall off cocktailing.
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.240]  Each person has two or three mall off cocktails, in a backpack, each person burns three cars.
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.880]  You'll have 500 dudes running around, and they'll just go down street after street, and the
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.680]  domesticated Europeans literally piss themselves, and they're not putting Europeans down, they're
[39:02.680 --> 39:11.520]  so domesticated, and you hear the video of someone in English like, what do we do?
[39:11.520 --> 39:18.880]  They know to burn Europe, and they're burning the churches, and then you get French officials,
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.440]  and Catholic officials going, well, and a major cardinal in the U.S. saying it's Islamic
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.640]  invasion, guard yourself for true.
[39:29.640 --> 39:38.160]  We're told, stand down, stand down, everything's fine, everything's okay, go to sleep.
[39:38.160 --> 39:46.760]  Meanwhile, Caitlin Bennett will be joining us, she is a reporter with a long history
[39:46.760 --> 39:53.520]  of being very polite, she went to a Bernie Sanders event, they threw her out, it has
[39:53.520 --> 40:02.720]  12 million views on Twitter, they marked her, and threw her out, she will be joining us.
[40:02.720 --> 40:05.560]  And what did Bernie Sanders tell the local news?
[40:05.560 --> 40:14.440]  When it became a big story in Ohio, that her and Millie Weaver, both from that area by
[40:14.440 --> 40:23.120]  the way, were thrown out, he said, info wars is a white supremacist platform, and Caitlin
[40:23.120 --> 40:30.600]  Bennett is a white supremacist, that's the way it is, that's actually a quote to play
[40:30.600 --> 40:40.200]  you news 21 in BC, when we come back, young lady, you want to come, you want to videotape,
[40:40.200 --> 40:45.680]  we're going to have you thrown out, and then we're going to call you a Nazi.
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.240]  And then I'm going to go on Fox News, and call for free health care, and have them
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.640]  cheer me, you know, Fox rigged who they had in the focus group.
[40:55.640 --> 41:04.160]  So that is the way it is, do you understand, I will bankrupt America, like I did at college,
[41:04.160 --> 41:10.080]  I will steal the money, Alex Jones had a major typo yesterday, I said he drives a
[41:10.080 --> 41:17.440]  hundred and fifteen thousand dollar Audi, excuse me, the car cost one hundred and eighty
[41:17.440 --> 41:27.040]  thousand dollars, he owns three one million dollar homes, I don't know about you, but
[41:27.040 --> 41:31.560]  I've never owned a car that cost more than seventy thousand dollars, which is fine if
[41:31.560 --> 41:33.320]  you do.
[41:33.320 --> 41:40.560]  But the point is, you don't get to be a commie with big buck teeth and a cycle look, and
[41:40.560 --> 41:46.920]  tell us how America sucks all day, when you drive around in the classic old man, hundred
[41:46.920 --> 41:52.840]  and eighty thousand dollar Audi sports car that goes two hundred and twenty miles an
[41:52.840 --> 41:58.520]  hour, can we pull up Bernie Sanders and his fancy sports car, just type it in, it's everywhere,
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.080]  it confirms it's him, that's right, pull back.
[42:02.080 --> 42:08.200]  He's driving around in a bright red one hundred and seventy five thousand dollar car that with
[42:08.200 --> 42:14.400]  taxes we looked it up cost one hundred and eighty three thousand dollars on average,
[42:14.400 --> 42:23.000]  a one hundred and eighty three thousand dollar car, which swindled money out of the campaign,
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.280]  but because he is an anointed one, with the democratic party and a socialist just like
[42:28.280 --> 42:35.200]  Hillary and just like everybody else, he is allowed to do it.
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.360]  Infowars is funded by the Globals, we're funded by you, and right now we've got the once a
[42:40.360 --> 42:46.040]  year annual sale, all ball caps, all t-shirts, all everything, that is apparel, fifty percent

[43:03.360 --> 43:09.080]  need, you don't want, the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put
[43:09.080 --> 43:15.200]  it on par with a major city, there's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major
[43:15.200 --> 43:17.800]  cities, how can I solve that problem?
[43:17.800 --> 43:24.480]  So we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze which is right now fifty
[43:24.480 --> 43:31.640]  dollars off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology and we've

[44:00.240 --> 44:04.400]  I want to say brain force is great, I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is, but
[44:04.400 --> 44:10.160]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.800]  that and that's an example of what I'm talking about, fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body,
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.160]  heart, the cleanest, the best out there, you've got the children's, you've got the adults,
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.360]  you've got the krill oil, if you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.240]  children's are really strong, they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best
[44:27.240 --> 44:30.560]  and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm just sorry, you want something like this,
[44:30.560 --> 44:31.560]  you don't get stuff for free.
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.840]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not a medical statement here
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.080]  but let me tell you something, I eat five cabinets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing
[44:40.080 --> 44:51.320]  Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is, so we don't
[44:51.320 --> 44:54.520]  make a big profit off of it but you notice I'm just obsessed because whatever the best
[44:54.520 --> 45:00.520]  is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[45:00.520 --> 45:04.880]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.600]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.600 --> 45:15.320]  to detoxify the body, that's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[45:15.320 --> 45:21.200]  Support, it's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[45:21.200 --> 45:26.120]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer, it is a classical 360
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.400]  win, this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[45:30.400 --> 45:35.680]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.760]  get, you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.520]  this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[45:44.520 --> 45:50.040]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[45:50.040 --> 45:53.880]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be, thanks to your support and
[45:53.880 --> 45:58.440]  your prayers together we're changing the world, now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield
[45:58.440 --> 46:04.080]  and InfowarsLife.com, there are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different
[46:04.080 --> 46:10.040]  political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist, Infowars is truly the tip
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.600]  of the spear of the zeitgeist, that's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying
[46:13.600 --> 46:18.680]  to shut it down, I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana
[46:18.680 --> 46:23.160]  and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.880]  behold it's super popular like it's always been, that's why the globalists are trying
[46:27.880 --> 46:33.080]  to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that
[46:33.080 --> 46:38.160]  sends chills at my spine, so whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.120]  by buying the great products at InfowarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.680]  videos and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.240]  for peace and discernment, for myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank
[46:51.240 --> 46:57.480]  all of you for what you've done because without you Infowars is nothing, you are the Infowars
[46:57.480 --> 47:04.480]  and I salute you.
[47:27.480 --> 47:46.480]  Nope says that Bernie Sanders didn't drive around in a hundred and seventy something thousand
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.960]  dollar car but it turns out he did, Snopes also says Islam has never committed one terror
[47:52.960 --> 48:02.080]  attack because that's not real Islam, Obama said so and NPR and Snopes and CNN they decide
[48:02.080 --> 48:11.720]  what is reality and what is not, of course everyone decides to tune out of them and so
[48:11.720 --> 48:19.040]  the answer is to make you watch but let me get really serious here.
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.920]  You have ISIS saying they're going to blow up and firebomb the Notre Dame, you have them
[48:22.920 --> 48:27.400]  trying to do it repeatedly, you have this happening the week of Easter where other churches
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.160]  are being blown up all over the world and there's zero news coverage and if government
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.520]  officials try to say on CNN or Fox, hey this needs to be looked at, we haven't investigated
[48:37.520 --> 48:44.880]  yet, we're not going to speculate, there's no way it's Islam, no way it's arson.
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.960]  Move along, nothing to see here, these aren't the droids you're looking for, meanwhile our
[48:49.960 --> 49:00.360]  borders are literally being opened completely up right now, oh there are no caravans, there
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.720]  are no emergencies at the border, remember that the last few years and then now, oh
[49:04.720 --> 49:12.040]  it's a big emergency, it's Trump's fault, sanctuary cities deserve Trump migrant dumping
[49:12.040 --> 49:18.640]  plan, former ICE chief says he worked for Obama, yeah if we don't have the jails to
[49:18.640 --> 49:21.640]  hold him and we've got due process and the courts can't ship him, you know Mexico doesn't
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.120]  even have that, you're illegal, you're shipped back, oh but the average waits over four years
[49:26.120 --> 49:34.240]  now so they're just catching release now, that's the law, Trump's trying to change it
[49:34.240 --> 49:40.040]  and so we're not supposed to even ask questions about all that but now Bernie Sanders has
[49:40.040 --> 49:45.760]  come out, after the Caitlyn Bennett video on Twitter alone has gotten 12 plus million
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.560]  views, millions of views on YouTube, millions of views on a bunch of other platforms, there's
[49:51.560 --> 50:00.920]  like 20 million views right now, there's just one version, 12.7 million views.
[50:00.920 --> 50:07.160]  So now we have Bernie Sanders, how's he going to respond to these bullies kicking a female
[50:07.160 --> 50:10.920]  reporter out and saying you're not real news, you're info wars, well you advertised it was
[50:10.920 --> 50:17.880]  a public event at a school auditorium at a public school and so she shows up, she's
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.160]  peaceful, she's driven out of there and so because it makes you look bad, what do you
[50:22.160 --> 50:29.080]  do, well Bernie Sanders just calls her a white supremacist, that's right, Bernie Sanders
[50:29.080 --> 50:36.840]  info wars a white supremacist platform, campaign kicked out, Caitlyn Bennett from Ohio rally
[50:36.840 --> 50:43.440]  because we don't support free speech in Venezuela, I mean Russia, excuse me, I meant North
[50:43.440 --> 50:53.000]  Korea, this future, USA, so let's check out that local NBC News clip, here it is.
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.320]  You may remember her as the Kent State gun girl, she posed with an AR-10 rifle at her
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.320]  Kent State graduation last year.
[50:59.320 --> 51:03.040]  But yesterday, Caitlyn Bennett says she was kicked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign
[51:03.040 --> 51:05.000]  event without explanation.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.720]  She spoke with Matt Stone today about why she thinks it happened.
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.360]  Since Kent grad, Caitlyn Bennett took those gun picks on campus last year, she's been
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.920]  busy speaking out for conservative causes and recently being hired by the info wars.com
[51:19.920 --> 51:22.280]  website as a reporter.
[51:22.280 --> 51:27.080]  That's why she showed up at the Bernie Sanders campaign stop in Lordstown, a rally that was
[51:27.080 --> 51:28.360]  supposed to be public.
[51:28.360 --> 51:33.240]  I asked them did I violate any rules, did I do anything, am I a disturbance, no I was
[51:33.240 --> 51:37.640]  scrolling on Facebook, they simply didn't want me there because they know who I am and
[51:37.640 --> 51:44.040]  I believe that event was staged, they had plants in the audience that were supposed
[51:44.040 --> 51:47.960]  to ask the questions, Bernie was scripted, what the response is and they didn't want
[51:47.960 --> 51:51.080]  anybody else to try to ask him questions.
[51:51.080 --> 51:55.360]  Bennett says she would have asked Sanders if he supports free healthcare for illegal
[51:55.360 --> 51:56.360]  immigrants.
[51:56.360 --> 51:59.440]  So I'm being ejected from a public event.
[51:59.440 --> 52:04.320]  Instead she says she was told to leave the public event, which she did, with no explanation
[52:04.320 --> 52:05.640]  as to why.
[52:05.640 --> 52:09.720]  She says she's never been a disturbance at any event she's covered before.
[52:09.720 --> 52:14.600]  We called the Sanders campaign to ask specifically why they had removed her and they wouldn't
[52:14.600 --> 52:16.320]  answer the question directly.
[52:16.320 --> 52:19.560]  Instead, they gave us the following statement.
[52:19.560 --> 52:24.280]  We are disappointed the people of the Youngstown community are being shown on the local broadcast
[52:24.280 --> 52:30.080]  news, content from InfoWars, a white supremacist platform that has been banned from YouTube,
[52:30.080 --> 52:35.080]  Apple and Facebook for hate speech and targeting the parents of children who died in Sandy
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.080]  Hook.
[52:36.080 --> 52:42.280]  None of that is true, all made up, never targeted the parents of Sandy Hook, not a white supremacist,
[52:42.280 --> 52:43.440]  they know that.
[52:43.440 --> 52:51.720]  But Bernie Sanders is a dirty, filthy authoritarian who works with a dirty, filthy mainstream
[52:51.720 --> 52:56.200]  media and the dirty, filthy Democratic Party murdering the truth.
[52:56.200 --> 52:58.480]  They all know who Caitlyn Bennett is.
[52:58.480 --> 53:03.040]  They had some of their little body snatchers come over behaving like Nazis.
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.400]  Anybody's a Nazi and telling her get out of there and then she left and then Americans
[53:08.400 --> 53:14.600]  recognize it as tyrannical and so you pull out the Nazi card.
[53:14.600 --> 53:21.960]  Unlike you do on Laura Loomer and so many others who clearly aren't Nazis.
[53:21.960 --> 53:27.920]  Meanwhile, Sanders gets massive towards Sorrel's funding, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[53:27.920 --> 53:34.040]  Now coming up, Caitlyn Bennett will be joining us in about 15 minutes.
[53:34.040 --> 53:43.120]  Leo Zagami, Vatican expert, will be joining us on the situation with obviously the Inferno,
[53:43.120 --> 53:46.560]  the Notre Dame, that former sanctuary.
[53:46.560 --> 53:48.960]  Nick Baggage will be in the studio where there's Dr. Nick Baggage.
[53:48.960 --> 53:56.400]  I can't wait for that and then Paul Joseph Watson from London, England will be hosting
[53:56.400 --> 54:02.960]  our number four and then Owen Schreuer and the War Room, three to six p.m. central time.
[54:02.960 --> 54:07.920]  A lot of our stations are picking up, day-to-night show, day mornings, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. are picking
[54:07.920 --> 54:08.920]  up the War Room.
[54:08.920 --> 54:12.400]  We're very thankful to those stations and want to encourage listeners to become sponsors
[54:12.400 --> 54:18.320]  of the local stations or support the sponsors or like you tithe to the local churches, but
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.440]  most of them aren't fighting for pro-life.
[54:20.440 --> 54:24.680]  Most of them aren't fighting for family values or sovereignty.
[54:24.680 --> 54:27.320]  I don't plan to be some Pharisee up here on a high horse.
[54:27.320 --> 54:28.520]  It's perfect, but I love God.
[54:28.520 --> 54:29.520]  I love Christ.
[54:29.520 --> 54:32.680]  And we're not tax exempt, the government can't regulate us.
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.920]  But when you buy a book, you buy a video, you buy a t-shirt, you buy coffee every month,
[54:36.920 --> 54:42.360]  you buy toothpaste every month, you buy stuff like the protein bars every month.

[54:48.680 --> 54:54.760]  You can tithe a little bit of profit we make on each one to fund this operation, push us
[54:54.760 --> 54:57.560]  into the black, and help us stand in the face of the globalists.
[54:57.560 --> 55:00.920]  So please, a lot of the great listeners have done this and we salute them and we thank them.
[55:00.920 --> 55:10.520]  But if you haven't habituated to go to infowarstore.com and get a t-shirt, we have the annual 50%

[55:33.840 --> 55:36.200]  competitors are 500, 600 bucks.

[55:44.480 --> 55:45.480]  on food ever.
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.960]  It's in these high quality plastic, I mean, I mean, hell just the plastic container at
[55:49.960 --> 55:56.240]  Wal-Mart would cost us much, you know, nice snap top plastic, high quality rubber made
[55:56.240 --> 55:57.240]  type material.
[55:57.240 --> 56:07.920]  And then it's got a two week food supply in a big tote container, 101,500 calories a day,
[56:07.920 --> 56:09.920]  92 servings.
[56:09.920 --> 56:17.960]  You can see that's already got 97% positive reviews, 4.8 stars.
[56:17.960 --> 56:21.760]  That is the best deal on high quality storeable food out there and it's great to have one
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.240]  in your garage, one in your car, one at work in case something goes down or you can give
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.880]  it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road at last 25 years.
[56:29.880 --> 56:31.320]  This is the best deal ever.
[56:31.320 --> 56:38.440]  You have a two week supply, we can put that back on screen, a two week supply, ladies
[56:38.440 --> 56:47.240]  and gentlemen, that is more than 50% off it is at cost, $67.
[56:47.240 --> 56:51.680]  That is at cost as a promotional they're doing because they want you to see how great it
[56:51.680 --> 56:52.680]  is.
[56:52.680 --> 56:57.280]  It's a loss leader, infowars life select, by that it's private label, my Patriot supply
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.000]  will begin around contracts they have with other distributors who go the lowest by us
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.040]  being a private label but it's a private label at the very same factory, fresh, high
[57:05.040 --> 57:06.520]  quality food.
[57:06.520 --> 57:14.280]  So it's all there, $67, two week food supply and just the container itself, it costs close
[57:14.280 --> 57:15.600]  to that at Walmart.
[57:15.600 --> 57:23.920]  It's also highly reusable, each food meal is in its own sealed, vacuum sealed packet,
[57:23.920 --> 57:24.920]  amazing.
[57:24.920 --> 57:53.320]  If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.480]  doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey, I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures,
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.120]  I'm not sitting here selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[58:02.120 --> 58:05.080]  I just go out and say what is the top heart pill?
[58:05.080 --> 58:06.080]  What is the top tumor?
[58:06.080 --> 58:10.160]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country?
[58:10.160 --> 58:11.160]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[58:11.160 --> 58:12.880]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.920]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle but that's still incredible, sir.
[58:16.920 --> 58:22.160]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later, 90, 95% no one's ever done
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.520]  that, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10, no one's ever done that, sir.
[58:26.520 --> 58:32.360]  The average competitor is 3 to 5%, the top brand is 50%, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[58:32.360 --> 58:36.280]  I mean, you understand like that's like our information is explosive, our fish oil, I
[58:36.280 --> 58:39.880]  go out and I get the cleanest, the best, my children take it.
[58:39.880 --> 58:44.200]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[58:44.200 --> 58:47.320]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?
[58:47.320 --> 58:48.320]  Never.
[58:48.320 --> 58:55.040]  We all know the importance of fish oils, while we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[58:55.040 --> 58:59.560]  it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:15.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:20.080]  A little bit better than I used to be because I'm alive.
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:24.080]  I look inserious.
[1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:47.080]  The authoritarian lying swendler.
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:52.680]  The pig creature, the man that believes he's born to rule you and your family, has come
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:57.320]  out in Ohio and said that Caitlyn Bennett and Infowars are white supremacists after
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:04.360]  he had her as a reporter thrown out of his rally for absolutely no reason. What a dangerous
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:06.080]  dirtbag.
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:11.320]  And by calling her a white supremacist with these CBS TV shows where they say go out and
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:18.040]  assault Nazis, he's calling for Caitlyn Bennett to be shot or stabbed or murdered.
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.800]  The assaults on conservatives is already over the top. Bernie Sanders is a weathermen-loving
[1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:25.640]  terrorist.
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:32.160]  Bernie Sanders is a clear and present danger to this country and the world.
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:39.360]  And our putting up with this degenerate criminal's activities, swendling colleges, never having
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:46.520]  a paying job in his life until he was 40, it just shows how weak we are that this bug-eyed
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:53.400]  criminal, this charlatan, is taking over our society in Fox News with Shep Smith and Neil
[1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:59.320]  Caputo and all these cowards who want to control conservatives, won't even let French officials
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:03.160]  or the head of the Catholic League point out that ISIS said they'd blow up Notre Dame
[1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:07.600]  last week and they've attempted to blow it up before and that they've done no investigation
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.080]  but they're told Islam isn't violent.
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:14.080]  And Bernie Sanders says open our borders to Islam as well.
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:20.520]  So here is this anti-American filth, this enemy of everything that's good, Bernie Sanders,
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:26.400]  the tip of the global sphere, on Fox being worshiped with a hand-picked group of stoolies
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:30.520]  and minions praying for free stuff from this criminal.
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:31.520]  Here it is.
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:36.280]  I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here, a show of
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:41.800]  hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance right now, how
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:44.160]  many get it from private insurance?
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:49.520]  Okay, now of those, how many are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:50.520]  run system?
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:51.520]  Woo!
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:52.520]  Woo!
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:59.920]  And right before that, you're going to get free healthcare, you're going to get free
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:06.520]  school, you're going to get free housing, you're going to get free healthcare and there's
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:17.000]  going to be reparations, every white baby born is a criminal that needs to pay money.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:22.680]  One of my good friend's newborn babies from all the respiratory problems is on a respirator
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.280]  right now.
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:27.320]  That baby, according to me, Bernie Sanders, is guilty.
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:31.320]  No, seriously, one of my friends has a really sick baby from all the stuff in the air, all
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.200]  the mold, all the deadly fungus.
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:36.880]  Pray for him, pray for Pat's baby, but little buck.
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:41.760]  But it's just so sick, you know, I was thinking about how reparations is a new form of slavery.
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:46.840]  Something like 98% of people in this country have no ancestors even connected to slavery.
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:50.240]  But what if their daddy was a slave master, they had nothing to do with it?
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:54.760]  Since when are you guilty for what your grandpa did or your great, great, great, great, great,
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:00.600]  great, great, great, great, great grandpa back eight generations did?
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:05.280]  That's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, that's a lot of greats.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:06.280]  That's crazy.
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:11.320]  Hell, once you've already served your time, you're supposedly, I mean, if you had the
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:19.720]  slaves and served time for it, but it doesn't matter, Bernie Sanders knows, and he's going
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:25.040]  to do it, give me all your money, all your races.
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:35.200]  I'm going to swindle your country because I am better than you, understand?
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:40.600]  My whole life, I was going to get you in a corner and kick your teeth in, and I'm going
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:41.600]  to do it.
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:46.840]  We're going to gut this country and starve you Christians out, and you're going to work
[1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:50.360]  in slave camps just like in Russia for me.
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:58.440]  I am VI11 reborn, I am Bernie Sanders, and I will kill this country.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:02.200]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the falls,
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:06.960]  they'd have it during the winter, and that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:13.520]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top, most respected
[1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:19.600]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:22.200]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:26.480]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:27.480]  win-win.
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:33.360]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select, storeable foods,

[1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:42.600]  supply.

[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:47.160]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:50.960]  If you're buying war bonds, bring you great products, and together with God's help, we
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:51.960]  are unstoppable.
[1:05:51.960 --> 1:06:06.040]  M4sTour.com and M4s Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:12.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[1:06:12.360 --> 1:06:38.760]  front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:47.600]  Well, if you just joined us on this live Tuesday, April 16, 2019 global transmission, CNN, MSNBC,
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:54.240]  NPR, all the usual state-run media, globalist-run media, collaborator media, is saying, don't
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:00.280]  question fire, don't question arson, don't question Islam, even though ISIS and Al-Qaeda
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:03.720]  said they were going to blow up Notre Dame and tried a few times, and we're saying just
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:06.120]  last week they would and are now celebrating it.
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:11.920]  No, because Islamic care doesn't exist, and French officials are being thrown off the
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:12.920]  air.
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.360]  The head of the Catholic League is being thrown off the air, even on Fox News, because they're
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:24.960]  saying, look, no one's investigated, but it's official, you do not say it could be arson.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:27.720]  That's just the way it is.
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:30.120]  Get used to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:35.160]  Absolutely amazing that we have gotten to this point, and I have a map here that we're
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:37.920]  posting up to infowars.com.
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:44.040]  Notre Dame was the 875th church to have been vandalized in France this year alone.
[1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:45.560]  It was just vandalized last week.
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:49.560]  In the last four years, these are the attacks on French churches.
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:53.680]  Christians everywhere pray our faith is the number one persecuted religion in the world
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:54.680]  at this time.
[1:07:54.680 --> 1:08:02.160]  Well, let's not just believe Taya Jones, who did put up that official attack on church's
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:08.600]  map put up by the French government, I actually have CBN News and I have the UN saying attacks
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:15.520]  on Christians have doubled the last five years and account for almost 80% of the attacks
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:17.960]  on religious groups, period worldwide.
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:21.720]  So Christians are being annihilated.
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:22.720]  Christmas is under attack.
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:23.720]  The family's under attack.
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:29.040]  But don't worry, Fox News now makes jokes about there is no war on Christmas.
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:30.040]  Amazing.
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:36.520]  Church's desecrated and ongoing attacks across Europe, CBN, over 1,000 of them this year.
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:37.520]  Have a nice day.
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:43.400]  ISIS fanatics revel in Notre Dame's destruction, describing it as punishment.
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.120]  Just a few weeks ago, they said they would attack it.
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:48.240]  And of course, it happened around Easter.
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.720]  Alarm was raised 23 minutes before the Notre Dame blaze was detected.
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:56.080]  That's right.
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:00.080]  A cell of French women guided by ISIS behind failed Notre Dame attack.
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:01.080]  The Guardian.
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.280]  Oh, but that was a couple of years ago.
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.880]  A cell of women posing as Catholics attacking.
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:11.920]  Oh, but don't look at it.
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:14.360]  Was this same shell group involved now?
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:20.480]  We know the feminists come out with their bare breasts and go, they go get sexually
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.160]  mutilated and they just revel in men backs, backhanding and breaking their noses.
[1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:30.680]  They go, you hate the West break my nose, please.
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:31.680]  Because they're not feminists.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:32.920]  They're West haters.
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:35.440]  They hate their daddy that was so nice to them.
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:41.440]  A cell of radicalized French women guided by Islamic State commanders in Syria was behind
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:46.720]  a failed terror attack near Paris Notre Dame Cathedral last weekend and planned another
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:50.320]  violent attack this week before they were intercepted by police.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:54.920]  The Paris prosecutor said, but now some of those same prosecutors are saying they think
[1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:55.920]  this is Islamic attack.
[1:09:55.920 --> 1:10:00.920]  But don't worry, Shep Smith says, no, you don't.
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:01.920]  Islam is peace.
[1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:04.680]  Well, Shep, I'm not against you that you're gay.
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:05.680]  That's fine with me.
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:08.720]  But if you went to one of these Islamic countries, you're defending, they'd murder you, Shep.
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:09.720]  But you don't care.
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:10.720]  You love it.
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:11.720]  Because you hate America.
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:13.400]  That's your religion.
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:18.200]  The woman aged 1923 and 39 were arrested.
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:23.200]  A small town 19 miles south east of Paris on Thursday night after they were linked to
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:29.080]  a discovery of a car parked with gas cylinders parked near the cathedral last weekend.
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:35.880]  Officials said the women had been planning an imminent attack against the busy, grod
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.680]  the only on station in Paris and were stopped after a police and intelligence operation
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:45.880]  described it as a race against time.
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:49.040]  Christians are the most persecuted religion in the world reveals a new report by the UN.
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:52.240]  Just thought I'd show you that since I mentioned this out of the Express UK.
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.920]  An ISIS plot to blow up Notre Dame Cathedral and rule the world the daily beefed two years
[1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:57.920]  ago.
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:10:58.920]  Let's see now.
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:10:59.920]  It's not a big deal.
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:02.440]  You see, do not ask questions.
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:04.040]  Do not ask questions.
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.040]  Do not ask questions.
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:14.920]  Oh, meanwhile, YouTube came out and just like when Brennan, the former head of the CIA went
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:21.120]  in front of the CFR a few years ago, Eddie Bravo was playing this on his show last week
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:22.520]  when I was in LA.
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:26.760]  I'd seen the text of the transcript on CFR.org, but I didn't know he'd actually done a press
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:27.760]  conference.
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:30.600]  He's like, yeah, we're controlling the weather, but a lot of governments don't like it, so
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:31.600]  we keep most of it secret.
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:36.760]  We're spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salt in the sky, high altitude, aerosol injection.
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:45.680]  We're going to totally control the weather now with the chemtrails.
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.440]  And they put an encyclopedia Britannica thing under it saying it's only ice crystals.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:51.440]  This doesn't exist.
[1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:56.120]  So when they admit it, because they can't hide it, they still put a little factoid saying
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  it's not true.
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:05.720]  So some people were questioning this as a possible arson yesterday, so the little Southern
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:10.120]  Primary Law Center folks that actually admittedly hired 10,000 of at YouTube didn't know what
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:11.120]  to do.
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:17.400]  They said, so let's just put a message up that 9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:20.680]  They go, what fits best as a factoid?
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:21.880]  Don't investigate as arson.
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:24.080]  Don't say as long could do this, even though they said they're going to do it.
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:25.840]  Okay, well, people question 9-11.
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:30.920]  So let's just put under this, it doesn't even fit, it's like a round peg in a square
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:31.920]  hole.
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:42.120]  Let's just say, you know, it makes no sense that don't say 9-11's a conspiracy theory.
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:43.920]  And people are like, what does this have to do with this?
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:44.920]  Exactly.
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:49.720]  There's this stupid SJW's in there that people are all over the place questioning because
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:52.480]  of big buildings burning on TV for six hours.
[1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:53.480]  Is it arson?
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.280]  Is it an electrical fire?
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:56.480]  Was it construction?
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:58.120]  Is it an Islamic terror attack?
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:01.200]  We don't know, it's totally normal to speculate.
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:03.400]  The fires weren't even out.
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:07.360]  And then they're going, no, no, no, you don't question, we don't know what it is, but we
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:12.600]  know it's not arson and we know it's not Islam because Islam doesn't ever do anything
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:13.600]  violent.
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:20.920]  And as Bernie Sanders said, white people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:26.320]  We played the newscast earlier, Bernie Sanders, who had a reporter thrown out of a public
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:30.160]  event that they announced was public, says that she is a white supremacist.
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:37.040]  Yeah, I think it's time to have old Robert Barnes follow lawsuit on old Sanders.
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:45.280]  Old Sandy is right to rule.
[1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:49.120]  One reign to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:50.120]  Born to rule.
[1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:53.760]  Can we put that butt toothed demon chipmunk back on screen place?
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.440]  For TV viewers, remember we're a radio show that is simulcast.
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.040]  I am your boss.
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:03.240]  Hello, I'm here to babysit your children.
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:04.240]  My.
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.960]  Oh, let me take care of that for you.
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:12.480]  I am Bernie Sanders.
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:13.480]  We're going to go to break.
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:14.480]  Caitlin Bennett's coming on.
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:18.040]  Then we have a reporter from Europe, Leo Zagami and so much more and I tend to open
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:19.880]  the phones up and get your take on this.
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:23.640]  But don't you question or say it might be arson or might be Islamic, even though the
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:28.240]  local police say that because you're not allowed to buzzfeed says we're not allowed
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:33.080]  to why they're calling for us to be taken off the air right now and in PR this morning
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:34.280]  because we questioned it.
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:35.280]  You don't do that.
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:42.720]  Only NPR does the thinking and that nice soft voice of car go to sleep.
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:44.080]  Let me hypnotize you.
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:50.600]  Please don't forget we have a lot of amazing deals on the site.

[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:02.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:03.760]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:06.720]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:10.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.240]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.600]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:09.200]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.640]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:17.400]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:22.000]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.920]  popular like it's always been.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:28.920]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:32.520]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:37.320]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:41.760]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.320]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:50.240]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:54.200]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:58.240]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:02.280]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:07.520]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:10.440]  literally dumbs the population down.
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.560]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:17.320]  gone through two permutations.
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:21.480]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:23.400]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:28.560]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:29.560]  incredible.
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:34.600]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:36.880]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:41.520]  Chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:48.440]  other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:49.440]  bioavailable.
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:53.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:54.960]  discovery.
[1:19:54.960 --> 1:20:01.440]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:08.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:17.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:22.800]  What I can remember here is the Penn State gun girl.
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.480]  She posed with an AR-10 rifle at her Penn State graduation last year.
[1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:30.160]  But yesterday, Caitlin Bennett says she was kicked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:32.160]  event without explanation.
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:36.840]  She spoke with Matt Stone today about why she thinks it happened.
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:41.480]  Since Kent grad, Caitlin Bennett took those gun picks on campus last year, she's been
[1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:47.040]  busy speaking out for conservative causes and recently being hired by the Infowars.com
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:49.400]  website as a reporter.
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:54.200]  That's why she showed up at the Bernie Sanders campaign stop in Lordstown, a rally that was
[1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.440]  supposed to be public.
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:21:00.280]  I asked him, did I violate any rules, did I do anything, am I a disturbance?
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:01.680]  No, I was scrolling on Facebook.
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:04.720]  They simply didn't want me there because they know who I am.
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:07.480]  And I believe that event was staged.
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:12.200]  They had plants in the audience that were supposed to ask the questions.
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:16.800]  Bernie was scripted what the response is and they didn't want anybody else to try to ask
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:17.800]  him questions.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:22.520]  But it says she would have asked Sanders if he supports free healthcare for illegal
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:23.520]  immigrants.
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:26.720]  So I'm being ejected from a public event?
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:31.440]  Instead she says she was told to leave the public event, which she did, with no explanation
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:32.760]  as to why.
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:36.840]  She says she's never been a disturbance at any event she's covered before.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:41.720]  We called the Sanders campaign to ask specifically why they had removed her and they wouldn't
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:44.320]  answer the question directly.
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:46.640]  Instead they gave us the following statement.
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:51.360]  We are disappointed the people of the Youngstown community are being shown on the local broadcast
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:57.200]  news content from InfoWars, a white supremacist platform that has been banned from YouTube,
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:02.200]  Apple and Facebook for hate speech and targeting the parents of children who died in Sandy
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:03.200]  Hook.
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:06.640]  Okay, so none of that is true.
[1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:11.560]  And now they can just add on, now it's white supremacists, not just child endangerment
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.960]  or all these other things they've made up.
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:18.920]  And this is because they threw a woman who they know who she is.
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:23.560]  Her video has 12.7 million views on Twitter.
[1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:27.360]  It has millions of views on YouTube, that's way more than any of Sanders' videos do.
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:31.880]  She routinely has that many viewers and they're scared of her.
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:37.040]  And so she was there just to show what he said and to show what he did and the police
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:40.800]  even said, we're sorry, they were acting as private security, we think this is wrong,
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:44.240]  we apologize, you've done nothing wrong.
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:50.760]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, thrown out, and then their answer is to not just
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:56.880]  crap on Caitlyn and the First Amendment, but then rub it in and say that it's a white
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:01.280]  supremacist organization.
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:04.400]  It's lawsuit time, but we just don't have the funds, people need to support us.
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:07.480]  We've got to stand up against this monster.
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:12.080]  He is such an anti-American, he supports Venezuela, he supported Fidel Castro.
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:15.680]  He literally honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:21.280]  He was kicked off a commune in Israel because they said he wouldn't work and was fondling
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.280]  all the women.
[1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:24.560]  Look it up.
[1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:31.160]  I don't work, the women are mine, I sit here, I drink wine and you do what I say.
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:34.680]  So Caitlyn, we salute you and your great work, you and of course Millie, we were there,
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:41.360]  she was able to stay inside, but you are hitting the zeitgeist here every single time and of
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.360]  course you're interviewed in the local news.
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:47.160]  They did a pretty fair job, but white supremacist, I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable what
[1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:48.160]  the Democrats do.
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:52.440]  Well, what's really funny is that they say that it's a white supremacist platform.
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:57.200]  They're indirectly calling me specifically a white supremacist and then CBS comes out
[1:23:57.200 --> 1:24:01.600]  with the show, the good fight and they have on their punch Nazis.
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.760]  So what are they trying to say?
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:05.560]  They're calling me a white supremacist.
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:06.560]  That leads to violence.
[1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:10.160]  That leads to people getting punched and violently assaulted in public.
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:12.320]  So I don't know, do they want me to get hurt?
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:16.080]  Is this an indirect way of saying go out and hurt Caitlyn Bennett?
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.120]  There's so many levels to this, but I think the most amazing part of the statement is
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:25.600]  that they're disappointed that the people of Youngstown are being shown content from
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:27.100]  info wars.
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:30.680]  They don't want people to watch info wars and you have to wonder why.
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:33.280]  They don't want the truth getting out to these people.
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:37.880]  You just hit the nail on the head as you always do.
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:43.200]  They're saying we are disappointed they are looking at that content that was raw unedited
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:49.760]  footage of us throwing a woman out, a female reporter, a bunch of men for no reason.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:51.120]  I mean, exactly.
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:52.520]  It's just raw footage.
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:53.520]  You're a reporter.
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:57.080]  And just because they say we're white supremacist or did these things we didn't do doesn't matter.
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:01.360]  But even if we did, CNN helped lie about the WMDs and the babies and incubators that
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:02.360]  killed millions.
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:05.040]  They helped lie and try to start race wars.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:11.480]  So by that yardstick, no one should be able to even see CNN, but CNN has to pay hotels
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:14.480]  and train stations and airports to make people watch it.
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:17.560]  It's different with info wars and the great Caitlyn Bennett.
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:22.120]  It's just, it's really disappointing and I feel if there's any viewers from Youngstown
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:26.720]  out there that should really concern you, should concern everybody that the Bernie Sanders
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:31.400]  campaign is blatantly saying they don't want people to watch info wars and it's a good
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:32.400]  point.
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:33.400]  It was unedited.
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:34.400]  It was uncut.
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.680]  It was video filmed on a phone because we didn't go in there with camera equipment.
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:42.280]  We just went in there to listen and ask a question.
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:46.800]  But of course, they felt threatened just by my presence and I'm surprised that they didn't
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:49.440]  notice Millie because she was right in front of me.
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.120]  So if it was in by only, Millie would have been kicked out too right away.
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:54.720]  She ended up getting kicked out later.
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:58.840]  But you know, they fling those words around white supremacist Nazi.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:03.120]  That's one thing, but to blatantly say that they don't want the people of Youngstown
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:06.280]  to be watching info wars is completely different.
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:09.960]  There's so many levels to this statement.
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:14.360]  It's a short statement, but there's so many levels that you really just have to dissect
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:17.520]  it because there's a meaning in each sentence that they say.
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  That's right.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.040]  It's the standard Democrat party line.
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:23.080]  If you're not allowed to see info wars, we're for censorship.
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:24.600]  We kicked her out.
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:28.400]  We didn't let her cover the event and now we don't want you to show the public what happened.
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:32.240]  But it looks like the local news station of their credit did not buy into this bull and
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:33.240]  saw through it.
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.240]  Oh, yeah.
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:39.000]  They completely said, you know, here's the statement and I love that they added in there.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.560]  They didn't answer the question directly of why she was kicked out.
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:44.560]  I'm so glad they put that in there.
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:48.080]  They were very respectful when they came to interview me.
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:53.640]  Very non bias and they just Sanders dehumanize you.
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:57.520]  And we see with Gamergate and all this where they say, Oh, we want all the heroines, all
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:26:58.520]  the heroes to be women.
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.120]  We want women in command.
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  Great.
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:02.120]  We want daughters and one son.
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:04.640]  I want women to do anything my son can do or greater.
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:08.880]  The point is, is it the left just thinks they own black people and women and minorities
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:09.880]  is what it comes down to.
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:13.360]  And then when it really comes to women being empowered, they treat women like absolute
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  crap.
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:16.520]  I've noticed when Trump's put more women in power than any other president ever.
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:20.960]  Well, they do that to Candace Owens, but Candace Owens really, you know, stuck the
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:26.040]  middle finger up to Congress when they were trying to beat her down and lie about her.
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:27.040]  It's amazing.
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:29.120]  And it's a double way because she's a black woman.
[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:33.360]  So they really don't like it when she's out there proving them wrong, proving that they
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:36.600]  don't have to be Democrats and they don't like it.
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.160]  So they have to make sure they shut them down.
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:42.120]  What's funny is that Bernie and his campaign just let me sit in the audience.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:45.400]  I wouldn't have gained 12,000 new followers.
[1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:49.160]  This wouldn't have gotten the attention of millions of people and it wouldn't even be
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:50.500]  a story right now.
[1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:53.040]  So they're so stupid that they don't understand.
[1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:55.480]  Just let people listen, just let people watch.
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:00.800]  Don't be the cause of a disturbance because if anything, they disturbed their own event
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:04.720]  because instead of what Bernie is saying, being on the news, it's what his campaign
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:11.040]  staff did against me that's on the news and they shoot themselves on the foot every time.
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:12.480]  And you're, you're well spoken.
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:14.600]  You're a lady just like Millie Weaver.
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:17.360]  You guys always knock it out of the park because you were calm.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:18.360]  You were polite.
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.080]  They have nothing to claim you did that was wrong.
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:21.560]  No reason to censor you.
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:22.800]  And that's why they're paralyzed.
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:24.480]  So they go, okay, she's a white supremacist.
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:29.800]  When we come back, I want to give you a chance to speak directly to the Sanders campaign
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:33.760]  and to Sanders to retract this because I'm not bluffing.
[1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:34.760]  I've sued a few people.
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:38.360]  We're looking at a bunch of other lawsuits and I think this is one that needs to be done
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.200]  if Sanders doesn't retract saying we're white supremacist because it's dangerous.
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:44.480]  And as you said, they have CBS shows saying attack Nazis.
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.960]  Well, if they say we're Nazis, we're going to get attacked.
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:51.840]  So Sanders, you're inciting violence against us and literally want us to be hunted down
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  and killed.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:53.840]  Shame on you.
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.360]  You're a authoritarian monster.

[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:01.400]  Go ahead.
[1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:03.120]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:07.040]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:08.040]  It just gets old, man.
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:11.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.240]  You're taking calls about your nomination.
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:17.760]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:20.560]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:23.080]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:25.680]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:26.680]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:27.680]  You know what, Alex?
[1:32:27.680 --> 1:32:29.680]  Hey, I put him on pause again.
[1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:34.240]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:36.120]  under attack, we need your help?
[1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:40.480]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:43.480]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:44.480]  Do you understand?
[1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:45.720]  I need your help, Frank.
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:48.000]  I need your help, Frank.

[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:54.280]  Do you understand?
[1:32:54.280 --> 1:32:55.960]  I need your help, Frank.
[1:32:55.960 --> 1:33:01.440]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:15.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:20.240]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:27.360]  Is it alright to hit a Nazi on the vote?
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:33.080]  I was always taught to never throw the first punch, never instigate, defend, don't attack.
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:38.080]  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:44.360]  during an interview and I realized Spencer was in a pressed suit, wearing a tie, big
[1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:48.360]  interview like his opinion mattered, like he should be considered part of the conversation,
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:54.680]  like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view and then I realized there's no better
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:57.560]  way to show some speech is not equal.
[1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:02.440]  Some speech requires a more visceral response, it's like Overton's window, that's the term
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:05.160]  from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:10.640]  Well, Overton's window doesn't mean s*** unless it comes with some enforcement, so yeah, this
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:12.640]  is enforcement.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:17.160]  It's time to punch a few Nazis.
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:25.960]  Wow, that's CBS.
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:36.080]  So, CBS, your radio listener, has a new TV show coming out where it shows rioting, whites
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:40.880]  and blacks beating up supposedly racist white people, anybody in the news says it's a Nazi.
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.240]  Then it shows real footage of white nationalists being physically attacked.
[1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:50.120]  Mr. Spencer, I don't agree with his views, but I believe it's his first amendment, and
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:55.640]  you've got this arrogant, aggressive, basically black racist nationalist trying to invoke a
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:34:56.640]  race war.
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:00.440]  So, that's their answer to Trump being up in the polls, that's their answer to people
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:04.720]  rejecting open borders, that's their answer to globalism, and so Trump's like, here,
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:08.480]  you just take all the illegals in your city, oh no, it's a threat, it's dangerous.
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:15.720]  CBS drama, the good fight, tweet with assassinate Trump, oh yeah, they're also tweeting assassinate
[1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  Trump.
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:28.560]  CBS has mainline dinner time shows that you're supposed to turn on showing actors in simulated
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:32.880]  riots attacking white people, cut him with real footage of white people, unprovoked being
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:39.440]  attacked, but it's okay because they're Nazis, then meanwhile the whole leftist group is
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:42.880]  funded by George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:47.840]  Well, what they're trying to do is to get enough dumb people to go out and attack white
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:53.520]  folks so white folks start shooting back so they can cause a civil war.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:57.560]  So understand the pawns in this are the minorities they're trying to manipulate, and the good
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:04.040]  news is, you got any leftist event, it's 90% white, bunch of professors trying to get blacks
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:05.040]  and others to riot.
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:11.240]  Remember the documents we got in January of last year, now 16 months ago, secret, internal
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:17.200]  George Soros documents from Alexander Soros, how to have professors dressed up in black
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:23.920]  in Maryland and other cities attack, pre, pre, place, places, they had agreements with
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.280]  Starbucks, everybody, no wonder why they knock over a trash can, attack Starbucks and McDonald's,
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:32.520]  they have pre-agreements, they won't press charges, and they talk about the scripting
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:36.800]  points, they are actors, but it's real attacks, you'll burn this trash can, you'll attack
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:42.960]  that, and then they're in blue cities where the police commanders are in on it, but the
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:46.080]  local, low level police aren't.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:50.000]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore, Obama wanted to get
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.800]  into nationwide martial law and stay in office, but he failed, because black folks didn't
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:55.600]  riot the way they wanted to.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.240]  Remember all the Trayvon Martin stuff, using any case they could, all the hyped up stuff
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:06.720]  in Ferguson, all the weird buses pulling up with white professors going ding dong, kill
[1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:12.720]  the cops, deck the halls with dead cops, jingle bells, jingle bells, remember all that?
[1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:17.200]  And then cops will get killed in Dallas, they get killed in areas of Louisiana, and they'd
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:19.720]  say, well, cops are bad, they deserve to die.
[1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:23.960]  When they start behaving better, they'll stop dying.
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:27.480]  The left thought that if they funded a bunch of cops getting killed, the cops would go
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:30.760]  into the strong cities initiative in Obama to stop it, the cops didn't, the cops went
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:38.000]  for being somewhat lap dogs of the system to now being against it, so good job there.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.240]  But then there's Caitlyn Bennett, I haven't even counted up all the views she's got,
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:44.680]  500 million of billion views, I don't know by now, almost everything she does gets a
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:48.880]  million views, repeatedly every week, 15, 20 million views, like she just got on this,
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:53.400]  just politely there, grown men come over and say, get out of here, people laugh at her,
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.280]  you're kind, didn't want it here.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:01.240]  They throw her out, now it's at the 13.1 million, that was 12.7 million, it was about 30 minutes
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:07.160]  ago, but about 20 million views right now total on that video of the M4Wars.com reporter,
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:12.760]  Caitlyn Bennett can follow her at the Twitter site you see right there on screen, I'll give
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:15.640]  that up for radio listeners in a moment, but it doesn't matter folks, the point is she
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:21.840]  has a home here at M4Wars.com and NewsWars.com, no matter what they do, but instead of saying
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:28.920]  okay what happened is wrong, they say, she is a white supremacist who is mean to Sandy
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:36.960]  Hook children, we are ashamed, no that's true, we are ashamed that local news NBC would show
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:44.920]  the footage, let us bully women and cover it up, or I call you Nazi, that's right America
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:51.160]  defeated the Nazis, but I will say you are a Nazi if you don't do what I and my Nazi
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:56.320]  finances say, so Caitlyn Bennett, I'm sorry I will stop talking like Bernie Sanders, how
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:00.880]  would you like to respond to be targeted for death by Bernie Sanders, would you like to
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:02.560]  give him a message?
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:09.480]  I would, so this is directly for Bernie and his campaign, one I reject the label of a
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:14.800]  white supremacist, it's absolutely disgusting, I have never aligned myself any of that idea
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:19.880]  of ideology, and I think it's very dangerous to start calling private citizens a white
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:25.000]  supremacist, you are running for president, the last thing you should be doing is calling
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:31.240]  private citizens who are there to listen to your town hall meeting a white supremacist,
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:36.680]  we know what goes on, we know that violence is instigated towards people who are labeled
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:41.360]  white supremacists when they're not, and another thing you need to do is you need to
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:48.000]  answer the question directly, why was I kicked out, did I disturb anybody, did I cause any
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  type of uneasy feeling, did you just not want me there, these are questions that need to
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  be answered, if Trump can potentially be sued for blocking someone on Twitter because he
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.640]  is an elected official, he is the president, and you're barring somebody from hearing his
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:09.600]  message, then why is it I'm allowed to be ejected from someone's public event that's
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:14.480]  running for president, what are you so scared of that you don't want people to see info
[1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:19.640]  wars in their content, these are all questions that need to be answered from Bernie and his
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:25.320]  campaign and a retraction needs to be issued for him calling me and calling info wars a
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:30.920]  white supremacist and we are a white supremacist platform, so these are demands that literally
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:36.840]  need to be met and they need to be met soon because it's disgusting and like Alex said
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.000]  maybe there'll be a lawsuit that's filed up.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.760]  And let's remember they did this to Candace Owens last week, they said that she loved
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.080]  Hitler and it edited tape when she's anti-Hitler and won a major lawsuit when white supremacists
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:53.520]  actually threatened her and threatened physical harm against her and things we won't get into
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:57.960]  in Connecticut because they settled the case but I know her well, she's talked about the
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:02.000]  story she went through as a child and the fact that they would then try to say a black
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:06.880]  woman raised in the south where their grandfather grew up on a basically a plantation and then
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.000]  he raised her to say that she loves Hitler, this is the new thing by these monsters, they're
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  just monsters.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:20.960]  Well what's sad is that it was Congress doing it, it wasn't even just the media, it wasn't
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.240]  even just people on Twitter because that already happened with the media on Twitter against
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:29.880]  Candace, now some members of Congress doing it, these are elected officials, these are
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:35.160]  people running our country, making laws, influencing people, I don't understand how we've got to
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:38.680]  Oh that's the playbook, it's race war, look look look, the Christian ethos said open a
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:43.520]  society up, unify around values, the Democrats never liked it, they were the KKK, they said
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:47.320]  oh we can't beat this for now, change the demographics and then we think the minorities
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:51.720]  will be racist like us and they just flipped to that new race paradigm and whether it's
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:57.400]  Congressman Lew or Maxine Waters or Chuck E. Schumer or any of these people, Michael
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:01.920]  Moore, it's total race-based class war, it's in the WikiLeaks, three years ago they said
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:07.240]  we're losing, we've got to escalate culture and racial conflict and so that's why they've
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:12.600]  got CBS News showing black people beating up white people and saying let's have a race
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:17.080]  war because there's Nazis everywhere and then they're literally financed and run by a real
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:20.960]  live Nazi collaborator, Caitlin Bennett, people can obviously follow you on Twitter,
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:24.680]  your videos are posted at infowars.com but I knew we were talking about this a few weeks
[1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:28.920]  ago but you need to have your own big, clean website where everything Caitlin Bennett
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:33.600]  is, we need that for Millie Weaver, I'd encourage you guys to do that so let's come back though
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:37.360]  and I want to play a few more clips for you and ask where you think all this is going
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.480]  but where are some of the other places people can find Caitlin Bennett information?
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:47.480]  So we have libertyhangout.org, it is a different website than Infowars, all my stuff does go
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:52.720]  there as well, Liberty Hangouts YouTube channel where we post all of our videos since Infowars
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:59.720]  is banned and then obviously Infowars.com you can find it.

[1:45:55.040 --> 1:45:59.320]  news today started right here.
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:03.440]  I want to say brain force is great, I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is, but
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.280]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:14.880]  it and that's an example of what I'm talking about, fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body,
[1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:19.240]  heart, the cleanest, the best out there, you've got the children's, you've got the adults,
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:22.440]  you've got the krill oil, if you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:26.320]  children's are really strong, they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:29.800]  and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:34.440]  get stuff for free, the krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not a medical
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:38.080]  statement here but let me tell you something, I eat five capillates of krill oil before
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:45.680]  I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:52.240]  of what fish oil is, so we don't make a big profit off of it but you know what I just
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:56.120]  obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:03.120]  do it, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:41.680]  When you get some old weird con artists that's never had a private secretary job in their
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:49.120]  life, didn't get a paycheck until they were 40, was kicked out of a kibbutz out of a Jewish
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:53.320]  collective when he was over there in the 60s for being lazy, who had vacation in the Soviet
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:58.200]  Union getting free trips over there as a Russian spy basically, I mean you didn't get paid
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:04.240]  for trips over there to spend months unless you were on the payroll, he likes Venezuela,
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:11.920]  he likes Hugo Chavez, he likes Fidel Castro, he likes your money, he bankrupts colleges
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:18.600]  with his wife and steals the money, oh sorry, I'm going to stop doing his voice, it's just
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:26.560]  that this is a raving criminal loon calling Caitlyn Bennett a white supremacist after
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:36.080]  he had her thrown out of his rally and then meanwhile, free health cap, free education,
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:44.080]  free housing and I agree with AOC, if you do not want to work, you do not work, those
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:50.200]  of you that are not part of the inner party, work camps for you to teach you the joy of
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:57.400]  under my whip, no, there's a story up on info wars.com, you've got Pelosi out saying AOC
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:03.600]  doesn't speak for us, there's only like five socialists in the leadership, okay, Michael
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:11.640]  Moore destroys Pelosi, her old tired privileged ways are over, oh you got more money than
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:15.880]  her and you're like, look, I hear Miss Amy Mills, why don't you go to Venezuela and
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:21.360]  help them out, but it's just all whipping up a big Maoist operation, well this is funded
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:27.240]  by big mega banks that are tax exempt, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to step aside and
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:32.040]  let the far left take over the Democratic Party, said far left filmmaker Michael Moore,
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:36.560]  it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Moore tore into Pelosi after a 60 minutes
[1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:41.760]  interview on Sunday where he bashed socialism, where she bashed socialism and far left wing
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:49.400]  of her party and he went on to say that socialism is the system, that's a story up on info wars.com.
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:54.480]  So going back to Millie Weaver, because it's such a big deal, they've really jumped the
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:59.560]  shark with you and you know, you were the Kinstake young girl a year and a half ago,
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:06.280]  we got you on, you're a woman, you're a citizen, it's legal to have the open carry, they tried
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:11.400]  to demonize you, only so-called feminist, you're calling your own shots in your own
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:14.280]  life, that's what they don't like and modern feminist does what the establishment says
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:21.480]  they're slaves, they're controlled by the system, but why is your work all going so viral and
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:24.800]  they don't know how to handle you and where do you think this all goes now that you've
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:27.680]  graduated to white supremacist according to Bernie Sanders?
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:34.680]  I feel like my work is always going so viral because they don't know how to handle a college
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:36.280]  educated woman.
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:40.400]  This is Caitlin Bennett, I was mumbling words and Millie Weaver, go ahead.
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:45.800]  Yes, I feel like they just, they don't know how to handle a young woman who just got out
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:51.840]  of college that isn't conforming to modern feminism, like you said, who's conforming
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:53.480]  to the democratic party.
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:51:00.240]  I cause so much ruckus just from my speech and just from my activism being simple.
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:03.560]  It's flat out and simple, it's truth, they don't like it.
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:07.880]  So when they come out and they have someone who doesn't represent feminism because I don't
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:12.600]  have armpit hair flowing out of my tank top and my hair isn't half shaved and I don't
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:14.760]  have piercings all over my face.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:19.560]  So I don't look like them, I always feel like they're mad because I don't look like them
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:23.240]  because I don't, you know, tattoo my face and shave off my hair.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:27.760]  So one, they're mad because I'm not ugly like them and two, they're mad because they don't
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:31.240]  conform and represent what they want me to represent.
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:33.520]  And of course, people love to hate on that.
[1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:38.800]  So they have to kind of push you down when they can't rise to your level and they can't
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:39.800]  be better than you.
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:43.080]  So they have to make sure I'm brought down, but I never am.
[1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:47.600]  What they don't understand is the more they attack me, the more people go to my page,
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:52.480]  the more people follow me, the more people I'm reaching, the more people I'm influencing.
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:55.480]  So they're doing me the biggest favor.
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:52:00.520]  And, you know, I think I've been called a white supremacist for probably two years
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.480]  now, even before I became the Kent State gun girl.
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:08.840]  And you know, at first it really bothered me, but this is kind of a message to the listeners.
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:14.200]  You have to understand that you know that you aren't any of these labels that the left
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:15.640]  is going to throw out you.
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:21.240]  So reject them a couple of times, but don't spend too much time worrying about it because
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:24.560]  they want to distract you from the truth of what's really happening.
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:27.600]  You want to talk about open borders and what's going on there.
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:32.400]  You want to talk about Islam and the dangers that are going on there with that religion,
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:34.560]  but they're going to call you white supremacists.
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:35.720]  Don't even touch on the subject.
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:37.000]  Say, no, I'm not.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:38.200]  Let's talk about the truth.
[1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:39.800]  Let's talk about what's actually going on.
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:44.880]  It's a way to distract people in the population from talking about the truth and the dangers
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:48.480]  of certain ideologies and certain policies.
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:51.400]  Don't fall into that trap.
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:56.760]  Caitlyn, I totally agree with you and our listeners should realize we're at the tip
[1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:57.760]  of the spear.
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:52:58.760]  We're fighting hard.
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.640]  And I really appreciate you and Millie Weaver.
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:06.840]  And just the dynamic work you're doing that's made so many other conservatives and libertarians
[1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:07.840]  and nationalists jealous.
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:13.400]  And I'm just glad that you guys in the last year with your great success have not let
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:18.040]  that get to you and that you didn't wait in line, as you said.
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:22.680]  And now you're getting more views than Ben Shapiro for the establishment's pushing.
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:25.640]  You're not being pushed by the establishment, but the people like you.
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.760]  They like what they see, just a common sense, you know, Midwestern young lady taking action
[1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:32.320]  and we just salute the work you're doing.
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:35.520]  And I want to be able to put a couple more camera people with you and your team.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:38.880]  I want to be able to fly you guys more places with a bigger budget.

[1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:57.040]  Keep it up.
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:01.560]  But for those that haven't, that have been on the fence, just take this show for granted.
[1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:02.560]  Don't do it.
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:04.160]  DNA force is selling out.
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:05.320]  Find out why it's so amazing.
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:06.320]  It's discounted.
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:12.560]  We've got the lowest price ever on a two week emergency food supply in an amazing, totable,
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:18.440]  the hard plastic rubber container, each meal, vacuum sealed, super high quality.
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:24.200]  It's all there, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:25.200]  nine.
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:29.640]  Now I've got some really big scientific news I'm going to get to next hour Dr. Nick Baggots
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:33.560]  that I've been saving up for when he was going to be in studio with us today.
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:35.800]  But just briefly, I wanted to hit this with you.
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:39.320]  Not that I'm that smart, but I've just figured out the ins and outs of this.
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:44.120]  The Mueller report is the culmination of an attempt to have a coup against the president
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  that failed.
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:46.120]  So it was a fraud.
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:49.120]  They bought them so they had to pull it back and they could never make anything up because
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:51.000]  there was nothing there.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.960]  So obviously the report is going to then be an attempt to cover up of the illegal investigation,
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:59.000]  the illegal FISA warrants and all the perjury to Congress.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:03.520]  So I said two weeks ago and a week ago, I said, you Democrats better watch it.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:09.360]  You want the full 400 page report put out with all the thousands of pages of index files
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:11.160]  that go with it.
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:16.280]  It's going to be a blueprint of your illegal spying in line to Congress.
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:21.240]  Well, now they're basically going to release it except for a few redactions of agents and
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:23.640]  people.
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:26.400]  Here's NBC News dot com.
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:31.680]  So next week's news today in four wars dot com, I told you this, White House officials
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:35.280]  concerned about being exposed by report.
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:39.680]  And it's not just Trump officials that blew the whistle and spied on Trump and tried to
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:41.120]  put him in the coups.
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:44.400]  It's people going all the way back to Obama.
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:48.160]  This is all a serious situation.
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.240]  It's supposedly coming out in about 38 hours from now.
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:54.240]  What do you expect to be in here, Caitlin?
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:58.360]  Well, I expect that the Democrats are going to be really upset.
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  I think it's going to show that, you know, there wasn't any collusion with Russia.
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:08.080]  We know that there hasn't been even though all these claims of evidence and, you know,
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:09.080]  it's crazy.
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:15.160]  I think more, so that's going to be more important than Trump and Russia, are the Democrats
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:21.280]  and their spying on Trump in the campaign and perhaps their collusion with other foreign
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:25.480]  nations as well to try to unseat Trump, to try to rig the election.
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:27.240]  So I think they're going to be disappointed.
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:28.240]  I think they're scared.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:33.320]  And when Attorney General Barr used the word spying, it got them all kind of wrestling
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:36.920]  in their seats because they, they're scared it's finally going to come out.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:40.520]  But the truth is.
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:41.520]  You're absolutely right.
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.520]  Well, Caitlin, I know you don't want to tell people what you're doing next, but you and
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:49.040]  of course, mainly we were in others are on fire.
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:51.680]  That term gets overused, but you are in Fuego.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:57.160]  So we'll all just be watching what you do on a routine basis at news wars.com and info
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:56:58.160]  wars.com.
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:01.600]  And then on your own site, tell people about that, the Liberty Hangout again.
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:07.520]  It's libertyhangout.org, it's just a website and we kind of post articles and every, every
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:11.160]  video will be in an article there.
[1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:12.160]  Not just the website.
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:16.840]  It's a badass place for a young lady and her fiance and others are taking action, swinging
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:20.880]  for the fences and knocking home runs and grand slams.
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:25.120]  So as they try to censor the web folks back to websites, news wars.com, info wars.com,

[1:59:51.880 --> 1:59:57.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:00.880]  We're not going to make America great again.
[2:00:00.880 --> 2:00:05.720]  It was never that great.
[2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:09.280]  We have not reached greatness.
[2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:12.760]  What's wrong with this picture right here?
[2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:18.900]  Radio listener stories posted up on info wars dot com from the LA Times putting American
[2:00:18.900 --> 2:00:23.400]  flags on police cars sparks backlash in Laguna Beach.
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:26.360]  Yes, people don't like seeing American flags.
[2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:30.240]  And the reason they've got to be brought out is they're demonizing the American flag.
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:34.200]  The Democratic Party has officially come out and said many of their leaders get rid of
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:35.200]  it.
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:40.120]  It's a racist evil symbol of each city council will decide this week if a flag graphic on
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:43.240]  the side of its patrol cars will stay or go.
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:47.160]  In February, the council agreed to paint the cars, but the design ended up being brighter
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:49.280]  and bolder than the proposed one.
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:53.560]  Some residents feel the flag is a little too aggressive while others are surprised anyone
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:56.120]  would object to the American flag.
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  This week, the council will vote to keep the design or choose an alternative.
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:04.000]  This was all over YouTube and all over the place on Facebook yesterday.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.800]  It's been taken down.
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:11.280]  We have a low res copy of it, but this is already about to air.
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:13.760]  This is airing on CBS television.
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.800]  Anti Trump show faces backlash for inciting violence against conservatives says any Trump
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:22.720]  supporter is a Nazi and should be physically attacked.
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:24.520]  That's how the Democrats operate.
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:27.240]  Jamie White wrote a story about it for info wars dot com.
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:31.080]  Is it all right to hit a Nazi on the vote?
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:35.640]  I was always taught to never throw the first one never instigate the fan don't attack.
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:40.600]  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:47.280]  during an interview and I realized Spencer was in a press suit wearing a tie big interviewed
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:52.040]  like his opinion mattered like he should be considered part of the conversation like neo-nazism
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:54.120]  was just one political point of view.
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:02:00.000]  And then I realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.480]  Some speech requires a more visceral response.
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:07.760]  It's like over things window that's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:11.600]  Well over this window doesn't mean unless it comes with some enforcement.
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:15.120]  So yeah, this is enforcement.
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:18.840]  It's time to punch a few Nazis.
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:24.480]  Remember when Tucker Carlson last year was defending Rand Paul, who Senator John McCain
[2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:29.320]  had called a Russian agent on the floor because he voted against bombing Russian troops in
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:34.480]  Syria who were pushing ISIS and al-Qaeda and al-Nusra out.
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:41.200]  Swallowswell told Tucker Carlson, well you work for Putin too.
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:43.360]  Quote you work for Putin too.
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:48.800]  What an outrageous statement, what an incredible statement.
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:52.600]  When Swallowswell is connected to the Democrats that hate America, say they want to get rid
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:56.320]  of the country, they hate American flags, they hate the Bill of Rights, they hate the military,
[2:02:56.320 --> 2:02:59.560]  they hate police, they say the country sucks.
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.360]  My God, all the Democrats are electing is a bunch of crazy Muslim women.
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:08.680]  They want to cut their daughters genitals off and say that 9-11 people, you know, did something.
[2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:10.680]  It's insane.
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:18.480]  Care was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something.
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:21.680]  So you have no idea right now?
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:25.160]  Oh there's another one, another plane just hit.
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:32.960]  That's right, if you are unfortunate enough to be on Twitter and saw the President's tweet
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:42.600]  about the member of Congress, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota, happens to be a Muslim member
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:49.320]  of Congress and that is important because the President tweeted a video that shows
[2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:56.200]  Representative Omar speaking, telling that speech is interspaced with planes hitting
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:04:03.560]  the Twin Towers on 9-11 and the end of the video says, we will never forget.
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:14.520]  This is an incitement to violence against Congresswoman Omar.
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:17.600]  Here's what Omar recently told Vogue Arabia in an interview.
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:22.520]  She described living in the United States as, quote, an everyday assault.
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:27.120]  America is so racist and hateful, she says, that she feels, quote, threatened, demonized
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.680]  and vilified every day.
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:32.040]  It's difficult for her even to go to work.
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:37.080]  In many ways, things were easier growing up in a refugee camp in Kenya, she says, quote,
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:40.880]  when you're a kid and you're raised in an all-black, all-Muslim environment, nobody
[2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:43.920]  really talks to you about your identity, you just are.
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:46.120]  There is freedom in knowing that you were accepted.
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:50.080]  Yeah, so why'd you come here to conquer us?
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:51.080]  That's it.
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  She doesn't want to assimilate.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:56.240]  She's been brought here by Soros to piss all over her thing.
[2:04:56.240 --> 2:05:00.240]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:01.400]  need, you don't want.
[2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:08.280]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:09.280]  city.
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:12.960]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:14.720]  How can I solve that problem?
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:19.640]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now

[2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:34.720]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:39.120]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:41.080]  I've got two in my home.
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:46.240]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:47.240]  house.
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:51.880]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:52.880]  Have clean air.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:06:20.920]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[2:06:22.880 --> 2:06:26.080]  All right, Dr. Nick Baggitz joins us, and he's a smart cookie.
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:30.360]  As you know, he co-hosts quite often, but he's here at studio with us.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  His dad was a famous congressman and actually got the land signed over to the people in
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:38.880]  Alaska, actual good land use system compared to all the others.
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:42.880]  His brother, of course, was a U.S. senator, but he's a guy I've been around for over
[2:06:42.880 --> 2:06:51.080]  26, 27 years as a scientist and as a professor, exposing with books and films with his website
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:56.680]  earthpulse.com, the shadow government, the whole rise of the technocracy, and we'll
[2:06:56.680 --> 2:07:02.720]  get to that next segment and all this science news where he's really preeminent in getting
[2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:03.720]  into all this.
[2:07:03.720 --> 2:07:08.120]  And by the way, I forgot before we got here, where you guys pull up the CFR, Brennan admits
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:13.400]  geoengineering, about a three-minute clip, it's on YouTube, and they even put a encyclopedia
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:17.400]  Britannica up saying, there is no weather modification because the official story is
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:22.280]  there isn't, but when they have the CIA, it's telling the CFR there is, they fact check
[2:07:22.280 --> 2:07:24.680]  and say he's wrong.
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:27.240]  That's right, that's next level mind control.
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:30.720]  So we're going to play that clip coming up as well, but you were talking during the
[2:07:30.720 --> 2:07:40.000]  break about Sanders and Ilhan Omar and AOC and we've got, it's up on infowars.com, we've
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:44.880]  got the usual suspect coming out saying, shut up Pelosi, Michael Moore says, we are socialists,
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:48.440]  we're going to be socialists, but that isn't the socialism the average person thinks.
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:52.920]  So you're a smart political hand, you grew up Neha to a grasshopper in this, you've got
[2:07:52.920 --> 2:07:54.800]  that she's kind of over the horizon.
[2:07:54.800 --> 2:08:00.000]  What would you call this period, what the globalists are doing at this current point?
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:06.960]  You know, from my perspective, it's really consolidation of power and splitting those
[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:08.080]  that are really threatening.
[2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:12.760]  And when you think about what's going on on the right, you know, we're dealing with facts
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:15.840]  and information on the left, they're dealing with emotions.
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:17.240]  And that's what they're manipulating.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:21.440]  And when you think about within the Democratic Party, the split that's emerging, which is
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:28.920]  a split between socialists, communists, and those that were basically the old labor working
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:30.960]  people kind of folks.
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:37.440]  And then you've got sort of scattered throughout the Democratic Party is all of the flaky kind
[2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:41.200]  of weird subgroups, you know, they've really missed it.
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:45.320]  And this is where the parties of both parties actually have left the base.
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:48.960]  And that's why the Republicans with all the establishment candidates couldn't get any
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:49.960]  of them elected.
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:50.960]  Trump came out.
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:54.800]  And he completely changed the platform really for the Republican Party.
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:56.920]  You see the same things happening with the Democrats.
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:02.400]  What people were looking for two years ago was real change, whether you're on the left
[2:09:02.400 --> 2:09:05.080]  or the right, people were sick of the status quo.
[2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:13.200]  So what I see more of is sort of this consolidation of consolidating power in the hands of really
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:17.600]  corporate interests that are using both parties to further their political aims.
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:21.640]  And we'll talk about that at the bottom of the hour because whether Trump knows this
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.840]  or not, remember Obama tried to sign the Internet over to the UN, the EU, it happened
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:26.840]  partially.
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:27.840]  Well, they're just going ahead with that plan.
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:32.080]  It's like Trump got elected, but Hillary and the stay behind networks with Obama continued
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:33.160]  their plan.
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:37.280]  And so I don't know if Trump's ignorant or not, but they're coming in and, oh, Zuckerberg's
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:41.480]  embracing censorship with the EU and, oh, we're getting rid of Section 230.
[2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:46.240]  Yes, they're ending the free web as we know for corporate consolidation and the Wall Street
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:47.400]  Journal hails it.
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:48.400]  Right.
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:54.480]  And the idea of the Internet being originally a place to really the town square of the modern
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.160]  21st century, that's what was becoming the town square.
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:03.480]  And now it's shifted again back to really it has never been that from the globalist
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:04.480]  perspective.
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:09.560]  It was the biggest propaganda machine and data collection network in history.
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:13.520]  So what happens now is people freely give up their information.
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:18.040]  They allow for the profiling that is used both commercially and politically.
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:21.440]  The same things that were developed in China, and we've talked about this before for social
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:24.240]  scoring, is the same things that Google did and others have done.
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:26.040]  So it's a paradox.
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:29.280]  They always believed, oh, let them have websites, they won't defeat us.
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:30.280]  We start defeating them.
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.080]  It makes them accelerate phase two of the web, not as a freeing system, but something
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:36.080]  of total control.
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  That's exactly it.
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:41.040]  And when you think about how people gather knowledge now, you know, we used to get sort
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:44.920]  of both sides of the story, or at least that was the attempt in the news media.
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:45.920]  Now we don't.
[2:10:45.920 --> 2:10:48.800]  We get the editorial news, which is the way it is.
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:53.360]  And I think on that basis, we need to function a little bit more like contrarians because
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:57.120]  we need to know what the adversary is saying and thinking so we can better prepare our
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.120]  arguments.
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:02.960]  So I think we have to make a more active approach to gain the knowledge of who you're opposing
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:05.720]  so you can better frame your arguments to get into the fight.
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:07.480]  Otherwise, we're just singing to the choir.
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:08.480]  We don't need to sing to the choir.
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:13.760]  We need to convert people into reexamining themselves and the way that we shape the world
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  together.
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:15.760]  No, I agree.
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:20.640]  You know, it's quite a train wreck that people question Notre Dame because no one knew if
[2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:25.240]  it was arson or Islamic or a electrical fire or construction fire, and they said we haven't
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:26.240]  been inside.
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:28.520]  We don't know it did it, but it's not terror.
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  And it's not arson.
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.120]  Well, everybody knows about a fire investigation.
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:32.120]  You can't say that.
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:34.280]  So it makes people suspicious.
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:40.720]  And so CNN Fox, they start banning guests, federal officers in France, heads of the Catholic,
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:41.720]  you know, organizations.
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:45.000]  No, you don't question Muslims weren't involved.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.200]  Well, you don't know who was involved and Al Qaeda and ISIS said they were going to target
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:52.040]  this, this theater and they've done it before.
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:53.320]  So it's that mere fact.
[2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:59.360]  And then YouTube and Google started putting messages under articles or videos superimposed
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:02.600]  saying people think 9-11 was staged, but it wasn't.
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:04.400]  And this wasn't staged either.
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:10.240]  So before the fires are even out, they were superimposing stuff under it saying, no, this
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:12.720]  was a fire from construction.
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:13.720]  Move along.
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:14.720]  Wow.
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:19.080]  You know, and the fact that these things have been talked about, I mean.
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.560]  And of course it backfired.
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:21.560]  People are pissed now.
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:23.680]  They're like, what are you covering up?
[2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:24.680]  Right.
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:28.840]  Because the smoke hasn't even cleared the room yet.
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:33.000]  You know, and the fact is on every major fire, especially something of this magnitude is
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:37.200]  going to require, you know, in the U.S., it would have been the fire marshals coming in,
[2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:38.680]  doing all of the forensics.
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:39.680]  Yeah.
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:42.440]  And it would have taken months to get an answer.
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:48.040]  The flames are shooting up 450 air and they're saying, we don't know what did it, but it's
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:49.920]  not Islamic or it's not arson.
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:50.920]  Right.
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:54.240]  And, you know, here's my take on it.
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:59.320]  Christianity has been under attack in every quarter of the world in various ways.
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:05.640]  The idea of burning, bombing, affecting churches, attacking Christianity, attacking the core
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:10.600]  value system of the West, because whether you're a Christian or not, the value system
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:11.840]  is the West.
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:16.800]  I mean, it's classic real Christianity, not the fake one, but right is what built this.
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:17.800]  That's exactly right.
[2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:20.040]  And, you know, and you can go back to the Founding Fathers.
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:21.040]  Many of them were deists.
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:22.040]  They weren't Christians.
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:23.040]  They were something else.
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:27.680]  But, you know, some don't even remember this, but, you know, there's a Bible called the
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:32.360]  Jefferson Bible and people forget about this, you know, and he never had never talked about
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  his religion.
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:36.600]  Now, that was one of the things he didn't do, but he kept this and what it was, was
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:41.480]  all the highlighted parts that Christ said, you know, that's what he kept as his Bible.
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:42.480]  He didn't want interpretation.
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:44.400]  He wanted information.
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:48.080]  But when you think about how that got applied into the basic form of government that we
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:54.640]  have, those value systems, this is the core of the West, and this is what's being gutted
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:59.440]  right now that we're really not seeing, because that was based not on a big collective, the
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:02.380]  Bernie Sanders vision of the future.
[2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:10.280]  This was based on strong individuals, the sovereignty of the individual soul, the created
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:15.560]  human being that each of us are, and the idea, the respect, whether they were Christians
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:22.600]  or deists of our founding fathers, was the recognition of human beings as made the image
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:24.880]  of God, made in the image and likeness of God.
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:25.880]  What about the paradox?
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:33.960]  Because, I mean, absolutely, that we are individuals, but then individuals, when they're left to
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:38.480]  be individuals, generally then go with whatever the best system is, and it creates a collective,
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:41.560]  and it's not a top-down collective, it's an individually created collective.
[2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:46.720]  Yeah, I would say it's the analogy of cells in the human body functioning independently,
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:49.120]  but interdependent on everyone.
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:50.120]  It's that.
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:53.480]  In fact, the model was even used as, you know, you're a part of the body, right?
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:54.480]  And so that's it.
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:57.040]  So it's synchronized, but it's coming from the individual level?
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:14:58.040]  Yeah, I think so.
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:02.400]  And I think because, you know, what do I think about that statement, creating the image and
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:03.400]  likeness?
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.280]  And that's whether you're Christian, Jewish, or Muslim, right?
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:08.840]  Those are the basic premise.
[2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:11.760]  And so how do we project that, if we're going to project that honestly?
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:15.080]  By the way, that was written thousands of years ago, we've already built pyramids, and
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:16.080]  you name it, look what we've done now.
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:17.600]  I mean, we are pretty powerful.
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:18.600]  Oh, yeah.
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:21.680]  And this is why it's even more important to be responsible.
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:27.360]  And I think the responsibility is to take the ideas, debate those ideas, develop those
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:31.800]  ideas, and engage the public in an awakening, and that's what I see happening.
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:34.480]  We are awakening to the power of the individual.
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:38.440]  And as you keep saying, that's what the globalists are trying to suppress, with the chemicals,
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:44.040]  the biologicals, the radiologicals, the electromagnetic, they fear what humanity already is, it isn't
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:45.040]  about to realize.
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:46.920]  We're not about to become that in my view.
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:47.920]  We already it.
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:48.920]  We just don't know it.
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:49.920]  We just got to remember again.
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:50.920]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  We've got Nick Beckett.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.920]  Stay with us.
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:59.120]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:04.600]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:05.680]  of control.
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:11.040]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:12.880]  using prescription drugs.
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:17.200]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:18.200]  me.
[2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:21.160]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:24.720]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[2:17:24.720 --> 2:17:27.440]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:29.320]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:36.560]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[2:19:59.480 --> 2:20:04.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:18.000]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album, Silver Stallion.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:34.800]  We're back live, Alex Jones here, Infowars.com, NewsWars.com, but our Nick Begats is our guest.
[2:20:34.800 --> 2:20:40.080]  You can find out his great site at EarthPulse.com, find his books and films at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:43.760]  But we've got so much news to cover here, so many clips, so much to get to in the time
[2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:47.160]  we have while you're in studio with us, but you were getting into how the whole system
[2:20:47.160 --> 2:20:52.200]  is about, you suck, you're going nowhere, humanity's a joke, humanity doesn't have
[2:20:52.200 --> 2:20:56.560]  free will, humans are bad, let's get rid of the population.
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:03.360]  I mean, this is really the message and it looks to me like the establishment really,
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:08.240]  really, really wants to just get us to give up and roll over and die.
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:09.680]  A, is that true?
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:10.680]  B, why?
[2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:12.480]  From the globalist, what's their end game?
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:16.480]  I think it is true because, you know, every major thing that's ever happened on this planet
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:20.880]  has started with one or two individuals, not some big, huge group waiting for the majority
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:23.160]  to form up to go do something.
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:27.920]  Everything meaningful in the arts, politics, business, science, it doesn't matter.
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:30.200]  A few engage and, and...
[2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:34.040]  It's like evolution, the official story of evolution isn't real, but there is this spontaneous
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:35.040]  evolution.
[2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:36.040]  Right.
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:39.840]  And I think a lot of what's going on right now is, is the real fear is the recognition
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:44.240]  of the power of an individual, you know, and when someone fully recognizes that they
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:45.240]  can do something.
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:49.200]  This is where, if we recognize our own divinity and we start treating ourselves like we treat
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:53.840]  someone we care about, it's kind of a good idea, you know, it's one of Jordan Peterson's
[2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:54.840]  statements.
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:21:56.280]  You have respect for ourselves.
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:00.760]  Have respect for yourself, treat yourself well, and then from that, start being a little
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:04.720]  bit self-critical, you know, analyzing yourself, but not in such a horrible way.
[2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:06.880]  You know, if you're creating the image and likeness of God, what are...
[2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:07.880]  I was like, I've gotten...
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:11.480]  I'm already doing okay, but I've got such great potential, what can I really do?
[2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:12.480]  That's exactly it.
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:17.880]  And when we start asking that question, you know, what, what is possible instead of what
[2:22:17.880 --> 2:22:22.200]  is impossible and then start taking those steps of the possibilities for our lives,
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:23.920]  we take control of them again.
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:30.680]  We, we get out of the hive and we begin to stand up and stick out and begin to express
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:32.400]  our individuality.
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:33.920]  That's what we were created to do.
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:36.920]  You know, people talk about purpose, having a purpose in life.
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:41.120]  I think it's more important to have meaning in life and there's a difference.
[2:22:41.120 --> 2:22:45.680]  Meaning is your general state of being and you project that in everything you do and how
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:50.840]  you treat the person waiting you at the restaurant in terms of how you deal with the mailman.
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:56.760]  But when you think about meaning and you express your value systems in how you live, purpose
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:02.240]  requires a plan and a set of actions, judgments, and so that comes under meaning.
[2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:07.160]  To define meaning about our individual lives is to apply a set of values in the way we
[2:23:07.160 --> 2:23:08.960]  live and that's individual.
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:13.840]  This is about self-reflection, analyzing the divinity within you and not being so self-condemning
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:19.040]  of that divinity within you, that you're creating a blast for me against the creation
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:20.360]  if you think about it.
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:22.000]  Being self-critical to improve who you are.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  Well, that's the devil's trick.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:26.160]  Like the devil's called the accuser because the devil knows that we have a conscience
[2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:27.960]  that love God and know we are sinners.
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:31.800]  So the devil's always, you suck, you're bad, keeping us in that paradigm instead of recognizing
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:33.960]  what's good in us to trigger the chain reaction.
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:34.960]  Right.
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:36.880]  And this is how I think the creator, how God looks at us.
[2:23:36.880 --> 2:23:39.160]  He looks at us like we look at two-year-olds.
[2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:43.720]  There's nothing that that two-year-old's going to do that you're not going to forgive.
[2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:48.960]  And that's how God, I think, sees us in the scope of the universe as these small, little
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:51.800]  microcosms of the creation itself.
[2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:59.680]  And so this is the training ground for becoming the soul within the carrier that we are of
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:07.280]  reverse in the roles of ego-driven or the devil's voice, if you will, the ego-driven
[2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:13.240]  life versus the life that recognizes our base creation and then uses our ego, uses that
[2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:17.680]  personality as a drive, as a tool for your awareness.
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:18.680]  Not the other way around.
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:23.360]  And see, when you flip it the other way around, then you get the train wreck because then
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:28.760]  it's ego, it's the material, it's the earthy, it's that that drives you.
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:32.680]  Instead of that being literally like a tool in this dimension you have to use.
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:33.680]  Right.
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:34.680]  And that's what it is.
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:37.280]  We're a spiritual creation within a physical form.
[2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:38.840]  If you read Genesis, you'll find that.
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:39.840]  Oh, it's totally true.
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:42.120]  And I see these people that join the dark side.
[2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:45.520]  They are totally obsessed with the tools they have and think that's God.
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:46.520]  Right.
[2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:48.200]  When all that is, it's just one little aspect.
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:49.200]  Right.
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:51.880]  And this is where you see these things happening globally.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:56.200]  Like I've done a lot of work, as you know, on the mind effects, mind control issues.
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:58.400]  And that's kind of the synthetic.
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:01.440]  You know, when they start talking about synthetic telepathy and they start talking about all
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:06.200]  of these attributes of perhaps what we're capable of, but they're doing it in a synthetic
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:07.200]  way.
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:08.200]  These are our natural.
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:09.200]  Well, I mean, it's true.
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:12.600]  I've learned when I literally just turn loose and do what I think is right, then I do all
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:13.600]  this amazing stuff.
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:15.200]  But if I overthink it, then it doesn't happen.
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:16.200]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:21.560]  And I had this long discussion yesterday with a 20-something gentleman.
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:24.640]  And the value of intuition versus a value of intellect.
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.600]  And I default to intuition as the guide and intellect is, again, the tool.
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:31.120]  You know, you think of left brain, right?
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.720]  Isn't intellect a scientific attempt to scan the already great consciousness you have?
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:36.720]  Right.
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:37.720]  And it's just getting a snapshot.
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:41.120]  It's like a photograph, you know, out of your lifetime, and that's how much resolution
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:42.560]  they get out of that, right?
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:48.320]  Because what has changed too in the sciences, we've gone from sciences of the 60s and 1950s
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:52.760]  where everything was a closed system, nothing interrelated to now they uniform theory.
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:53.760]  Right.
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:55.640]  You know, everything is connected.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:56.640]  Unified.
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:25:59.440]  So, we understand this, and this is the good news.
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:00.440]  What is destiny then?
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:07.000]  I mean, I think that is the shared will of the population, your individual vision, interfacing
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.200]  with that and understanding of where you want to go and the goals of the species.
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:13.360]  I mean, what was you called destiny?
[2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:18.760]  You know, I would say it is the collective creation that we all do.
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:20.640]  Again, creating the image in the light of the sky, what does that mean?
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:22.840]  It means we're co-creators in a certain sense.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:27.720]  We have certain potency, in fact, you know, what was the messaging was, greater things
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:31.480]  you'll do also, you know, you can move mountains if you have the faith of a mustard seed.
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:34.480]  These are real concepts, in fact, in science.
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:38.200]  If you take two people and you put them together, you get a thing called resonance, which is
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:42.920]  a scientific principle, and it's X plus X in brackets, and you square it.
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:43.920]  Square it.
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:44.920]  It multiplies against itself.
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:45.920]  Exponential.
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:46.920]  Yes.
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:48.680]  This is what two or more gather together means.
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:53.120]  When you combine the energy of two or more people, things happen.
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:54.120]  Especially a man and woman.
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:55.120]  Yes.
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:26:56.120]  And that's why that's under such attack.
[2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:57.120]  Yeah.
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  And look at this.
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:00.840]  A man and woman, the relationship of that is the typeset on earth of the Godhead in
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:01.840]  heaven, right?
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:06.320]  And because when two emerge together, you get a third principle, okay?
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:07.320]  A different union.
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:08.320]  So it's a microcosm of the Trinity.
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  Yes, it is a microcosm.
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:10.320]  Which God creates.
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:11.320]  Right.
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:12.320]  And now there's creation.
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:13.320]  Right.
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:14.520]  And then what does that union bring?
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:19.760]  It brings creative work, both in the biological sense and in the metaphysical sense.
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:23.680]  Because when that energy of, this is a polarity world.
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:26.080]  This is a negative, positive, a female, a male.
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  And the enemy.
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:28.080]  So who is the enemy?
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:30.000]  They're trying to sabotage that natural order.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  That's exactly right.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:37.480]  And you see it almost everything around us from the sexualizing of children or the unsexualizing
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:38.480]  of children.
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:39.480]  I guess it's better to say it.
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:40.480]  It ruins them.
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:41.480]  It ruins them.
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:44.720]  They're killing the potential they're supposed to have at germination.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:45.720]  Exactly.
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:52.200]  And you know, the thing that I see so much of the world is the fake approach to what
[2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.200]  we are.
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:56.600]  And if we begin to start to reconcile what we are, this is what the government found
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:27:58.520]  in the big research on mind control.
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:27:59.520]  What they discovered.
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  General Sablebine, all of it.
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.000]  All of them, they figured out, wow, if people really knew what they were and could actualize
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:12.760]  what they were, would we be in trouble because all the walls would come down.
[2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:14.320]  Transparency would be a real thing.
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:18.480]  And then, you think about it, then it's a matter of can we deal with it?
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:22.840]  So let's come back and talk about that because this is really important and how people understand
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:26.480]  is the biggest thing I see is the system makes people feel small because they're not financially
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:28.040]  successful or whatever.
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:31.080]  When you're already successful by being conscious, it doesn't mean you don't want to do new things
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:32.380]  or not be lazy.
[2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:36.680]  But when you stop feeling inadequate or powerless is when the power comes.
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:37.680]  That's it.
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.680]  And there's a time when you let it go and you recognize that you're not alone in this.
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:44.000]  The traumas create the change.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  That's the refinement.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.160]  The best thing for me in the last five years is to learn how to totally turn lose and it's
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:55.200]  so powerful we'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:28:57.720]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:29:00.280]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:04.440]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:05.560]  of control.
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:10.880]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:12.720]  using prescription drugs.
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:17.000]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  me.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:24.560]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:27.240]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:28.720]  Get sober now.
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:32.040]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:33.040]  It's simple.
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:35.880]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:37.360]  Please, don't wait.
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:39.160]  Your life matters to us.
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:49.600]  800-213-9264 800-213-9264 800-213-9264.
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:51.960]  Call right now before it's too late.
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:57.040]  800-213-9264.
[2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:03.600]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist pro-free market,
[2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:05.960]  pro-western speech all across the world.
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:11.520]  I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last
[2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:14.640]  year to be D-platformed, then they set the precedent.
[2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:19.480]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:20.960]  take you off the internet.
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:26.400]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of
[2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:31.800]  most types on their platform, because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[2:30:31.800 --> 2:30:37.760]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist,
[2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:42.640]  anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:47.680]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco and many of these
[2:30:47.680 --> 2:30:51.680]  big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[2:30:51.680 --> 2:30:56.520]  We must awaken and say no to these control freaks.
[2:30:56.520 --> 2:31:00.520]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can food during the fall, so they
[2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:01.520]  have it during the winter.
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:11.640]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply, one of the top most respected
[2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:12.640]  companies out there.
[2:31:12.640 --> 2:31:18.240]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:20.280]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[2:31:20.280 --> 2:31:24.560]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food, so it's a total
[2:31:24.560 --> 2:31:25.560]  win-win.
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:31.440]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select storeable foods,
[2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:35.640]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak
[2:31:35.640 --> 2:31:39.720]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three year
[2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:40.720]  supply.
[2:31:40.720 --> 2:31:42.680]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[2:31:42.680 --> 2:31:45.240]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[2:31:45.240 --> 2:31:50.200]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[2:31:50.200 --> 2:31:56.400]  M4Store.com and M4 Select, high quality storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:01.320]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[2:32:01.320 --> 2:32:04.400]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:06.920]  M4 Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[2:32:06.920 --> 2:32:10.400]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:15.160]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really
[2:32:15.160 --> 2:32:18.360]  works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:22.720]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:26.720]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:30.560]  light in the dark of the night, that sends chills at my spine.
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:35.120]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and M4 Wars, by buying the great products
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:39.520]  at M4Store.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[2:32:39.520 --> 2:32:44.120]  this operation, and for praying for this nation, and the world, for peace and discernment.
[2:32:44.120 --> 2:32:49.000]  For myself and the whole M4 Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  because without you, M4 Wars is nothing.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:33:17.280]  You are the M4, and I salute you.
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:33.320]  Okay, I've got a lot of technology news, a lot of world news with Dr. Nick Maggich,
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:38.200]  but stripping everything away, you're not just saying this, when you read what the
[2:33:38.200 --> 2:33:44.160]  Pentagon is into, what you read what the EU's been studying, what the Russians are studying,
[2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:49.640]  they're obsessed with human potential, and all of these powers of intuition and things
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:55.680]  that have been proven to be real, but they can't be harnessed by any centralized system,
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:04.440]  and any pro-freedom government or group promotes these things, any anti-human group attacks
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:09.160]  them, and there's definitely an anti-human agenda going on, as you said, because the
[2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:14.200]  establishment's worried about individuals, but what would you call the current time we're
[2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:19.000]  in, and how things are going for the establishment, and how split up the establishment is?
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:20.760]  Because everybody wants to know who they are.
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:25.040]  To me, the globalists are just mad scientists that work with some of the richest families
[2:34:25.040 --> 2:34:28.560]  who've decided to be ruthless and cut corners so they can be in control.
[2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:31.240]  So there's a lot of rich people, as you know, that aren't bad, they're actually wanting
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:32.520]  to understand what's happening.
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:35.480]  So being rich isn't the issue, it's a conglomerate.
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:39.360]  How would you quantify who this group is and what their goal is?
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:41.640]  I keep saying, what's the end game?
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:46.160]  I think it's within, when you think of the wealth of the world, I think it's 80 families
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:49.800]  own half of it, and they want to keep that half and want to actually expand that.
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:53.880]  I think that really is part of it, and there are good, I mean, wealth is not a sin in and
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:54.880]  of itself.
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:34:58.760]  It's what you do with your wealth, it determines whether it's good or bad, just like driving
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:02.640]  an airplane, you know, you can either crash it into a building, that's bad, or you can
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:04.960]  deliver the freight, right, I mean, and it's the same.
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:05.960]  You can't see grandma.
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:10.480]  Yeah, and I mean, there's, it's about really, once again, about the choices that we choose
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:16.080]  to make, and when I think about the bigger plan, it's to shut down those individual choices,
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.520]  to take them away from you, to shut down the possibility of you reaching your higher states
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:22.280]  of awareness, and the simplest way to do it.
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:25.200]  Oh, that's it, they're just taking avenues of consciousness away.
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:29.080]  That's exactly it, because if you're going to fight all this, we can attack each of the
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:34.560]  symptoms, and we do it all the time, and we hit the massive stage, and the behavior.
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:39.400]  It's a, it's bad behavior based on a lack of self-examination, the recognition of our
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:42.880]  foundational divinity, and this is what they're stripping from us.
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:49.600]  If we can recognize the divinity of, of God, and what God did by creating us in, in his
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:53.920]  image and likeness, that demands respect for one another.
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:54.920]  Let's be clear.
[2:35:54.920 --> 2:35:59.880]  Each of us, like Gandhi said, is true, and like Genesis says, is a literal, new universe
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:02.560]  of free thought and free expression that God created.
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:05.840]  It doesn't mean that we've done what God's done, but it is the potentiality of a new
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  universe.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:12.400]  Right, and the idea is that, you know, we're, we're here to explore, to encounter, and,
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:14.880]  and to, and to remember, I think.
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:19.880]  Because I think if you go back to the root of what we are, if we remember that, it is
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:20.880]  all consciousness.
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:25.480]  And so then you come from consciousness into reality, because, I mean, again, read Genesis,
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:26.880]  you get the picture.
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:30.560]  And I think the science bears it out over the long term in terms of what we are.
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:36.800]  You know, we're the, a crystal, for instance, is the outward expression of internal arrangement
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:42.080]  of atoms, which is an, an expression of a, of a, of a wave front interacting with another
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:43.080]  wave front.
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:44.080]  Energy.
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:45.080]  We're the same thing.
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:46.080]  You know, we're at our core.
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:47.080]  We're energy.
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  We're this soul.
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:52.160]  Isn't it, it's almost like God discovering God, or God, God going down to the smallest
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:53.160]  level.
[2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:58.200]  And it's a way, I mean, think about, if you had all knowledge, all everything, you know,
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:01.280]  think about this from this perspective, and then you create something in your image and
[2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:02.280]  likeness.
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:03.920]  Boy, there's a feedback loop there.
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:08.240]  You know, I mean, I think God experiences our living experience also through us and
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:10.280]  in us, as we experience it.
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:15.120]  And because we have free will, yeah, you could, I mean, time and space exist in this reality,
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:16.120]  but no other.
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:21.960]  And so we see it, but actually everything got created, it has happened like this, but
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:22.960]  we don't perceive it that way.
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:25.720]  We've got a slow rollout, you know.
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:29.480]  And so we're in the slow rollout, and when you get back far enough, you can see the
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:30.480]  order and the chaos.
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  It's called a fractal.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.840]  And that's what the universe is all about.
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:37.960]  And even this planet of a bunch of individual souls running around doing things, all these
[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:40.880]  things do work together for good, whether we can see it or not.
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:43.880]  And that's why all these scientists that were atheists now go, okay, there is something
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:48.920]  outside creating an artificial reality, but it's still all a simulation.
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:52.600]  They're now offering, we'll build our new simulation better than whatever built this.
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:53.600]  Right.
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:54.760]  And you know, and here's the thing.
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:59.760]  You can give it that frame of words to describe it, and all you're doing is overlaying another
[2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:04.040]  set of words to describe the creation that's described biblically.
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:08.080]  Because God's consciousness breathing out life of the universe, everything we do is just
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  another expression of it.
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:11.480]  So as much as they run from God, it's just another.
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:12.480]  Yeah.
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:14.120]  You can't run from what you're in the middle of.
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:17.560]  And this is what they discovered, you know, is actually we're in the middle of it.
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:21.440]  You know, whatever created this, we're in it, and it's not disconnected.
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:23.160]  You're part of it like that cell in the body.
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:25.800]  And again, it's not some one-dimensional or two-dimensional simulation.
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:26.800]  It's real.
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:27.800]  Yeah.
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:32.680]  And when you think about sort of the multi-dimensional aspects of it, this is what science has also
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:34.240]  discovered, you know.
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:37.800]  So am I right to say, as I read a lot of the journals, that all the people that were atheists
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:38.800]  aren't anymore.
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:39.800]  They're like pretty freaked out.
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:40.800]  No.
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:41.800]  It's really shifted people.
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:44.720]  And in fact, I was at a conference a number of years ago, and it was called Religion,
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:46.280]  Science, and the Environment.
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:52.520]  And it was sponsored by the Orthodox, and there were, the Catholics had people, the
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:54.480]  Buddhists, Muslims, everybody had people.
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:56.800]  The Yaga Khan was even on board for the Muslims, right?
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:38:58.240]  And it was a closed conference.
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:02.960]  And what they decided in this, or one of the consensus points was that science and religion
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:04.680]  should have never separated.
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:11.920]  On the basis that the religious system of values gave science something.
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:15.600]  When you separated them, now you got science without a value base.
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:18.840]  This is dangerous in a technocracy like what we have now.
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:23.280]  The human's instinctive understanding of what they came from, expressed in the universe,
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:24.800]  turns out to be the right map of what it is.
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:25.800]  Yeah, it is.
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:29.560]  And that's so, we're all the way rolling back, and now we have new words to describe what
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:31.520]  was described biblically.
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:32.800]  But the words say the same.
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:35.640]  So why is there evil that wants to destroy life in the world?
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:39.240]  That's because there's free will, and some people are going to resonate towards evil,
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:41.080]  and so it's going to be expressed.
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:43.520]  Yeah, I think it is expressed in the world.
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:46.960]  I mean, if you want to take it a level deep...
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:49.280]  People say, God's just saying this, why did God allow this?
[2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  That's free will.
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:51.880]  Yeah, it is free will.
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:53.720]  And see, it's like this.
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:57.240]  I had, as you know, and we've talked about it before, I had a pretty devastating thing
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:00.560]  happen to me when I was young, and it would have been very easy to hate God for it when
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:02.680]  my dad disappeared.
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:05.000]  But what I do know is it didn't do that.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:10.600]  What I realize is that even those really tough lessons, again, using the analogy...
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:12.560]  It accelerated you to be the man.
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:15.480]  Yeah, and we do this with our two-year-olds, right?
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:16.880]  God does it with us.
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:19.880]  And we're not the two-year-old in our minds, God's mind.
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:21.080]  But God threw you in the deep end.
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:25.120]  Yeah, He'll throw you in the deep end, and He's not going to let you drown, but you
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:30.000]  might get off of close, and that's when you cry out, and when you recognize the absolute
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.720]  power and grace of God.
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:36.120]  And I think it's in our torment, in our suffering, and our challenges, which I prefer to use
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.480]  the word challenges, that we remember who we are, and we remember the base of our strength,
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:41.760]  and we come into it again.
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:45.560]  And you just said it, the whole nanny state is about your week, your fallen, never have
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:49.400]  rites of passages, never do the cultural rituals that activate.
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:50.400]  That's right.
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:54.280]  And these are, you know, in every tradition in the world, there are these rituals, and
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:00.680]  they go back millennium about growth and understanding, and when you come into your personhood, if
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:07.680]  you will, when you evolve to a point where you see yourself as a being that does have
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.600]  some power, that can do things, that can create as we gain understanding.
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:14.800]  And you get the vision of the past and present, and the future.
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:16.880]  Yeah, and here's the thing.
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:19.640]  You can worry about the future, and a lot of people do.
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:22.000]  99% of what we worry about never happens.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:25.320]  We can live in the past, which a lot of people do, and you're not going to get a chance to
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:29.240]  go back and do that again, or you can live in the present and get some things done.
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:30.880]  And that's where we live.
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:35.000]  And that's why intuition, when it kicks in, that's a really present moment.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:39.480]  That's when you are actively engaged, the awareness kicks in, the ego subordinates.
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  Yeah, I use it, there's a metaphor I like to use.
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:48.200]  If you remember the story of John the Baptist is there, and Christ is baptized, and the
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:53.080]  dove descends on him, which is the vision of the Holy Spirit activating in him, right?
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:56.560]  And then he goes for 40 days in the desert, and the devil's tempting him, and he keeps
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:58.560]  saying, get behind me.
[2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:03.320]  The analogy here for me is the ego part of you.
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:10.000]  Is that devil, he's thrown behind him, to make, to coordinate the ego, so that the
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.840]  awareness says, you serve me, ego, I don't serve you.
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:16.240]  And this is the opposite message of the world.
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:18.160]  The world says, you're there.
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:21.880]  Worship the ego, worship the baseness, instead of get behind me Satan.
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:22.880]  That's right.
[2:42:22.880 --> 2:42:24.840]  And so, the struggle individually.
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:29.760]  Put the animal behind, which again gives us control in the world and teaches us and trains
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.560]  the young ones as a tester, but the comet rushing through space-time is going forward.
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:38.560]  That's right, and that's where we need to be, moving forward with creation.
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:41.520]  But then what is beyond that?
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:44.880]  Because I have a gut level that once we go to the next level, we're going to wake up
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:47.720]  until they're even bigger, and that there's some new challenge.
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:48.720]  Oh, I think that's true.
[2:42:48.720 --> 2:42:52.560]  I think the challenges are going to be huge, and the forgiveness factor is going to be
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  great.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:57.560]  But I beg you, if you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:42:59.280]  There is no set stasis.
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:00.520]  There is no managed system.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:02.080]  There is no uncontenual.
[2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:05.360]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:08.720]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:09.720]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:10.720]  We'll be here forever.
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:11.960]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[2:43:11.960 --> 2:43:16.680]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:18.840]  and say, you know, we struggled here.
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:19.840]  We made it.
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:21.160]  And that's really where this goes.
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:23.440]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready.
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:27.120]  And so, if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:30.480]  Seitang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:35.080]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:36.080]  to fight.
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:38.480]  And you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:40.480]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:44.120]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:45.320]  I want to go to the next level.
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:49.920]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:52.560]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:53.680]  I want life.
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:55.320]  I want Jesus.
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:43:59.120]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:01.920]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania States.
[2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:06.480]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about
[2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:09.080]  ash and acid rain.
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:12.200]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:16.000]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:22.520]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:26.520]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:27.840]  in the rainwater.
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:33.200]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:39.280]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[2:44:39.280 --> 2:44:44.200]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:49.040]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:50.040]  supply.
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:45:05.560]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:12.280]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy
[2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:21.480]  drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:24.640]  few hours and have terrible side effects.
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:31.240]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:34.080]  and beyond system in the world.
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:36.480]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:41.040]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:43.480]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:47.360]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:51.400]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:52.400]  into overdrive.
[2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:53.400]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:58.560]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:00.560]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:01.560]  It is.
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:06.000]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:09.240]  The fish oil is better than that and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:14.800]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:18.280]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:21.640]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong,
[2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:25.040]  they don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:28.400]  burps and I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:31.480]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[2:46:31.480 --> 2:46:34.400]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, I eat five
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:39.960]  camperels of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:47.480]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:50.920]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:59.400]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:06.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:41.400]  Alex Jones here, back live, Paul Joseph Watson is set to take over in the fourth hour, then
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.320]  Owen Shroyer will host the war room that our Nick Beggars is in studio until Friday with
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:47.320]  us.
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:50.480]  He'll be on with me, he'll be on with Owen, he'll be on with David Knight, very excited.
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:55.720]  Everybody should read Earth, Change is the Ripple Effect, Alaska sounds the alarm, it's
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:01.760]  available at info or store.com or just go right to the earthpulse website, earthpulse.com.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:02.760]  I don't care where you get it.
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:08.160]  You want to get real research on mind control, mind control, a brave new world, or enhancing
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:09.160]  human performance.
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:12.920]  So they're wanting mind control to suppress our performance.
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:18.960]  Harp the update, angels don't play this harp, a technology in the 21st century, controlling
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:23.840]  the human mind, the book, the technologies of political control and tools for peak performance.
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:28.520]  Angels don't play this harp, the original book from 20 years ago, earth rising the revolution
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:33.840]  towards a thousand years of peace, earth rising to the trail of science, society and the
[2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:34.840]  soul.
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:37.320]  And while you're here, I want you back on to Mara though to get into nuts and bolts
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:44.720]  about 5G, electronic control, all the admissions that, you know, the other stuff is killing
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:47.120]  young people that attention spans are shrinking.
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:50.240]  You know, we've gotten into positive things here, our potential, we have to look at the
[2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:54.960]  negative and this larger agenda, but just continue with other points you want to make
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.600]  Dr. Beggis because you're really making I think some profound points here.
[2:48:59.600 --> 2:49:02.560]  How can the globalists know we have all this potential and you've worked with some of the
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:09.000]  top billionaires out there off record and then still try to suppress it when any common
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:14.080]  sense or analysis or even gut level analysis, which is Trump says shallowness is the deepest
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:18.760]  thing because it's an instant, you know, spiritual is installed, tells you that if you suppress
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:20.480]  others, you suppress yourself.
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:22.840]  Why doesn't the establishment get that?
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:24.920]  You know, I think it's fear driven also.
[2:49:24.920 --> 2:49:30.520]  You know, this is what drives so much of the bad decisions everyone makes a fear greed.
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:37.360]  I mean, those negative aspects of what we are as human beings tend to take the forefront.
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:40.320]  When people have done a lot of things that are wrong and they know it, you know, because
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:43.200]  we all know, I mean, we all know, right.
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.320]  And when you think about transparency and what this change brings about is we're going
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:50.960]  to know the truth about everyone.
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:52.880]  You know, this is the opening of the book of life.
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:55.240]  We're talking about a little bit during the break.
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:00.920]  They're afraid of what will happen if we see into our governments, see into these corporations
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:06.080]  and is it funny, you're talking about total telekinesis human link, which the global starting
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:09.840]  knows coming and that's not some new age thing that's mathematically been proven.
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:10.840]  It's increasing.
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:14.360]  They're trying to block it, but they're trying to create AI that already knows omnipresence.
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:19.200]  So they fear humans having omnipresence or partial omnipresence, the beginnings of it,
[2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:22.280]  the singularity of consciousness, but then they're creating artificiality.
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:23.280]  Right.
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:24.800]  And here's the thing about the artificial side.
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:25.800]  It won't be 100%.
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:29.840]  It'll be like 99, but it looks so good as predictability.
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:33.320]  Plus how can somebody that even look at that if they don't have that consciousness and
[2:50:33.320 --> 2:50:34.320]  even read it?
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:35.320]  Right.
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:39.920]  And so, you know, when you think about, again, these attributes of human beings, what the
[2:50:39.920 --> 2:50:45.960]  military now calls anomalous human potentials, which used to be referred to as extrasensory
[2:50:45.960 --> 2:50:46.960]  perceptions.
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:50.960]  When you go back to the beginning of a lot of these programs, what they discovered was
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:53.160]  these weren't extra at all.
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:55.240]  These weren't anomalous at all.
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.080]  These are things that we actually have within us.
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:04.880]  Now those are our innate capacities of communication are really telepathically driven.
[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:06.400]  We just don't perceive it all.
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:08.640]  The science proves that there's some really good research.
[2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:12.080]  And by the way, again, the military particularly knows this because it's been tested under pressure.
[2:51:12.080 --> 2:51:13.080]  That's right.
[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  And it gets even stronger under pressure.
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:15.080]  Absolutely.
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:18.920]  In fact, trauma brings about some of these, you know, I've talked and had opportunities
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:23.840]  to meet with people that have had sort of the spontaneous activation of some of these
[2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:28.000]  attributes and they happen in the midst of trauma, almost like a defense mechanism where
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:33.080]  your inner self says, Hey, man, if you want to survive, you better wake up to what you
[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:34.080]  are.
[2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:37.240]  Now, think about that in the context of the global situation right now.
[2:51:37.240 --> 2:51:39.480]  It says the enemy's coming over the hill right there.
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:40.480]  Not here, not there.
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:45.520]  It happens to me like I'm in Congress, there's five doors that the Sundar Pichai or whoever's
[2:51:45.520 --> 2:51:46.680]  going to come out of.
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:50.680]  And I know the one I literally tell the military guys, that's the door they nod and they know
[2:51:50.680 --> 2:51:52.480]  to, and we know they're coming out that door.
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:53.480]  Yeah.
[2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:54.480]  And it's like always right.
[2:51:54.480 --> 2:51:55.480]  Yeah.
[2:51:55.480 --> 2:51:56.480]  And intuition usually is.
[2:51:56.480 --> 2:51:58.160]  In fact, I would say it always is if you're paying attention to it.
[2:51:58.160 --> 2:51:59.320]  We usually don't.
[2:51:59.320 --> 2:52:02.400]  And this is, and as we don't, this is the voice, right?
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:03.760]  I mean, this is your consciousness.
[2:52:03.760 --> 2:52:06.720]  Because our brain has been proven really broadcasting and receiving.
[2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:07.720]  It's scanning.
[2:52:07.720 --> 2:52:08.720]  It's a sensor.
[2:52:08.720 --> 2:52:09.720]  Right.
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:12.920]  Now, here's what, you know, when you think about extra sensor perceptions, you think
[2:52:12.920 --> 2:52:14.080]  of energy mostly.
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  You think about it.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  These are energy things.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:19.920]  But if you think about our regular perceptions, sight, for instance, that's an energy thing,
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:21.720]  although we put physical attributes on it.
[2:52:21.720 --> 2:52:23.440]  It's picking up electromagnetic energy.
[2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:24.440]  Right.
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:30.080]  And the bandwidth for visual on the electromagnetic spectrum is this little narrow bandwidth.
[2:52:30.080 --> 2:52:33.600]  And then on the sides of it are ultraviolet and infrared that we don't see.
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:37.280]  But other species do see because they have bigger bandwidth.
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:38.280]  All right.
[2:52:38.280 --> 2:52:39.280]  Now, hearing is the same way.
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:40.280]  It's bandwidth.
[2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:41.280]  Right.
[2:52:41.280 --> 2:52:43.840]  It's a vibration that the ear picks up and translates through our physical system and
[2:52:43.840 --> 2:52:44.840]  the sound.
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:45.840]  And smell.
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:46.840]  And smell is the same way.
[2:52:46.840 --> 2:52:47.840]  And they say it's particles.
[2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:48.840]  It's not.
[2:52:48.840 --> 2:52:49.840]  It's vibration.
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:50.840]  All right.
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:51.840]  This is what the science is showing us.
[2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:52.840]  And so the particles put off a vibration.
[2:52:52.840 --> 2:52:53.840]  Right.
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:56.360]  And those are picked up and then those are understood for what they are.
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:03.560]  And so when you think about all of our perceptive windows are all electromagnetic spectrum related
[2:53:03.560 --> 2:53:08.160]  and the part that we don't see that doesn't have a physical connection, like the eye or
[2:53:08.160 --> 2:53:10.800]  the ear, we sort of discount it.
[2:53:10.800 --> 2:53:13.040]  But it's just as real.
[2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:15.040]  It's a vibration that we can either zero out or...
[2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:17.320]  So what is it that's claiming women have better intuition than men?
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:18.800]  Or is that they're more in tune with their intuition?
[2:53:18.800 --> 2:53:19.800]  Well, this is...
[2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:24.240]  We have the left brain, which is the rigid structured side, which men tend to gravitate
[2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:25.240]  to.
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:27.040]  We tend to be more interested in things versus people.
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:28.480]  You know, that's kind of our nation.
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:33.680]  Sometimes we become engineers, you know, mechanics, truck drivers, where women, the emphasis is
[2:53:33.680 --> 2:53:37.160]  on the right side, which is a creative, intuitive side of the brain.
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:41.720]  Now if you look at some of Jordan Peterson's work on this, which is really interesting
[2:53:41.720 --> 2:53:48.840]  work because the idea is to find the balance between chaos, the right side of the brain,
[2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:52.800]  and order the left side of the brain, and find the middle way that brings chaos and
[2:53:52.800 --> 2:53:54.040]  order together.
[2:53:54.040 --> 2:53:57.560]  That's male and female again, gets back to that same analogy.
[2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:00.680]  When you have union, then you have possibilities.
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:05.360]  In fact, they say the highest IQs are when both hemispheres of the brain balance, and
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:10.920]  then you create a resonance between bit both, and then you get this super brain, right?
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:14.520]  That's what human beings were raised, born into.
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:20.640]  Our brain balance as children is really obvious, and then if you look at the scans, as we get
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:21.640]  older at gravitation...
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:25.480]  They try to use the TV, that was an article to have it to bring it up, that attention
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:30.960]  spans are the lowest ever, and they're plunging even faster, and the system admits they're
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:32.120]  targeting that.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:34.680]  Why would you target the heart of civilization?
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:36.000]  Why would you target attention span?
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:41.080]  Because then, it's almost like the activation to consciousness, the door to consciousness,
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:45.800]  is the attention span that you remember things, instead of you're always in the new moment,
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:47.400]  you're basically a slave.
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:55.760]  If you follow any relaxation or meditation practices, even prayer is to stay focused
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:58.960]  on one thing, and your mind drifts immediately, right?
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:00.560]  It just always does.
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:05.120]  Now the brains are being trained to drift deliberately, so you never can be focused.
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:09.640]  You can never reach higher states of awareness, where you can actually let the awareness
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:11.140]  rule.
[2:55:11.140 --> 2:55:16.640]  This is what's happening, is the fracture way of thinking, the breaking of focus, continually
[2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:19.080]  throws the ego in front of every decision.
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:22.600]  I notice the trends, which is the human vision, are getting shorter and shorter, where we're
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:23.600]  all broken up.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:27.960]  Right, and this is, look at how the brain is being trained.
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:32.440]  I mean, you're interrupted 50 million times, kids are looking at their cell phones three
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:39.440]  and four hundred times a day for messaging, for feedback, because all of these things,
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:45.240]  it's about keeping your attention in the digital economy, which is an attention economy, is
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:52.440]  to keep you in the internet, in the data feed, in the propaganda program, as opposed to into
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:55:53.440]  your own thinking.
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:55.520]  You need to internalize a bit more.
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:57.000]  We need to go inside a bit more.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:02.280]  When you think about AI and what's coming, the computers are already so complexed in
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:05.880]  writing their own programs, we can't even figure them out, and we're at the very beginning.
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:08.440]  Let's be clear.
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:12.680]  Every metric, the computers are advancing, and getting more sophisticated, we're going
[2:56:12.680 --> 2:56:16.640]  down, we're losing attention span, we're losing consciousness, we're losing IQ, we're losing
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:17.640]  physical health.
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:18.640]  Right.
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:20.760]  So, as this thing builds, we're dying.
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:25.600]  Yeah, and I think it's not an accident, you know, from my perspective.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:30.040]  When you think about the worldwide web, PBS and number of years ago did a great job.
[2:56:30.040 --> 2:56:31.040]  Stay there.
[2:56:31.040 --> 2:56:33.760]  Paul Watson's coming over in six minutes to take over, but let's go to break up with
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:34.760]  five minutes.
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:39.960]  Post it, it's books and films at m4warstore.com, store-wide free shipping is still there.
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:43.240]  We had to stop supplement sales, except for DNA for it, and it's about to sell out.
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:46.520]  Take advantage of that, and we have 50% off all apparel.
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:51.400]  I want you to wear an m4war shirt, or an attorney-response team shirt, or an adult-tread-on-me shirt,
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:53.320]  or a Molan lobby shirt.
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:59.040]  Over 100 shirts, 50% off, that's designer shirts, regular shirts, they're all there,
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:09.080]  m4warstore.com, or triple-aid, 2533139, triple-aid 2533139, and again, we have swarable food,
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:15.440]  two-week supply at cost, we have the Alexa Pure Breeze, $50 off, incredibly low price,
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:21.680]  and so much more at m4warstore.com, or triple-aid 2533139, it's your funding of this operation
[2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:27.960]  that makes it all possible, but our Nick Begich is kicking butt, we'll talk more about this
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:33.000]  whole situation on the other side, and then Paul Watson from her Britannic Majesties England
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:37.720]  on Notre Dame and the Globalist, and all the rest of it is straight ahead.
[2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:42.040]  There's a reason I want this broadcast shut down, we're pro-human, we believe in you,
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:58:12.000]  we believe in humanity, stay with us.
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:41.560]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:59:11.560]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:41.520]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:59:41.560 --> 3:00:11.520]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:00:11.560 --> 3:00:41.520]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:01:11.480]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:41.440]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[3:01:41.480 --> 3:02:11.440]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:54.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:58.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:58.520 --> 3:16:00.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:03.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:06.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:08.520]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:08.520 --> 3:16:09.840]  I can help you too.
[3:16:09.840 --> 3:16:12.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:12.840 --> 3:16:15.080]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:15.080 --> 3:16:22.960]  Call 800-34-no-tax, or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:28.320]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:29.320]  the world.
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:32.320]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:38.280]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:42.080]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:43.080]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:44.640]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:44.640 --> 3:16:51.200]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:53.120]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:56.840]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[3:16:56.840 --> 3:16:59.880]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:03.560]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay heating
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:04.560]  pads?
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:10.000]  Sunny Bay heating pads, made by Biomed DB Design right here in the USA, come in all sizes.

[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:22.040]  But I need to know their good quality.

[3:17:51.760 --> 3:17:59.880]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:07.880]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:14.560]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:20.200]  authoritarians, like the young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[3:18:20.200 --> 3:18:22.120]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[3:18:22.120 --> 3:18:27.680]  They don't want us to remember what political action did, and that's why the globalist,
[3:18:27.680 --> 3:18:30.560]  Hillary and others, are trying to shut in for us now.
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:35.640]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:37.080]  sovereignty away.
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:39.360]  This country is in a war.
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:43.160]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[3:18:43.160 --> 3:18:46.280]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:49.840]  have and fund us, in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[3:18:49.840 --> 3:18:53.400]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com.
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:54.400]  Thank you.
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:56.200]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:18:57.200]  Go ahead.
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:18:59.080]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:02.880]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  It just gets old, man.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:06.840]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:09.080]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:13.320]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:15.760]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:18.960]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:21.520]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:22.520]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:23.520]  Yeah, you know what?
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:24.520]  I'll take it.
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:25.520]  I put it on pause again.
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:30.080]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:31.960]  under attack, we need your help.
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:36.360]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[3:19:36.360 --> 3:19:39.360]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:40.360]  Do you understand?
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:41.560]  I need your help, Frank.
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:43.840]  I need your help, Frank.
[3:19:43.840 --> 3:19:49.160]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info World.
[3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:50.160]  Do you understand?
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:19:51.800]  I need your help, Frank.
[3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:58.000]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:10.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:18.080]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:24.440]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:31.600]  So basically what happened, I'm trying to summarize this in a tweet right now as we
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:32.600]  speak.
[3:20:32.600 --> 3:20:37.160]  I came out and said, point to the evidence, there were people reacting with smiley faces
[3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:38.400]  to the Notre Dame fire.
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:39.400]  This is horrible.
[3:20:39.400 --> 3:20:40.400]  This is vile.
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:41.400]  These people should be condemned.
[3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:47.160]  BuzzFeed came back with a giant article claiming that that was a hoax.
[3:20:47.160 --> 3:20:50.440]  Even though it wasn't a hoax, I provided the source video, you can see it for yourself
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:56.720]  right now, people reacting with smiley faces to the Notre Dame fire, BuzzFeed the next
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:21:03.120]  day after I called him out on Twitter said, oh, smiley faces don't matter.
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:08.120]  Okay, but you just said there was no evidence of smiley faces.
[3:21:08.120 --> 3:21:12.000]  Now you're admitting there are, there is evidence, but now you're saying smiley faces don't
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  matter.
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  All right.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:19.240]  How about dozens and dozens of comments of people on these Facebook pages celebrating
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:21.200]  it in real time?
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:22.200]  What are you going to say about that?
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:26.240]  Are you going to say that they're fake comments, that those comments don't matter?
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:29.160]  This is where we're at with the mainstream media.
[3:21:29.160 --> 3:21:34.800]  And again, it's not just that they smear you, defame you, and lie about you, it's that they
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:41.120]  use this fake claim that I created a hoax to then call for me to be de-platformed so
[3:21:41.120 --> 3:21:46.720]  then I don't even have the opportunity to defend myself when they next smear me on
[3:21:46.720 --> 3:21:50.040]  whatever the next issue is.
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:56.280]  It's also about the sheer blind panic and terror that these news organizations have, especially
[3:21:56.280 --> 3:22:01.880]  BuzzFeed, which of course has laid off dozens and dozens of staff over the past six months
[3:22:01.880 --> 3:22:04.440]  about not controlling the news narrative.
[3:22:04.440 --> 3:22:12.680]  And you even saw that on Fox News yesterday with Kovuto and with Shep Smith, where in the
[3:22:12.680 --> 3:22:18.320]  case of Shep Smith, it was literally a French official who was there on the scene speculating
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:23.000]  whether it was arson or whether it was accidental, which at the time, even though they've quickly
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:28.480]  ruled it out now, was a perfectly reasonable thing to speculate, given that we've literally
[3:22:28.480 --> 3:22:39.080]  had 875 attacks on churches in France in the last year alone, not just fires but desecrations,
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:42.560]  the headings of statues of Jesus Christ of the Virgin Mary.
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:48.360]  So yes, it's completely within the realm of respectable common to speculate whether this
[3:22:48.360 --> 3:22:53.720]  was arson, especially when it was happening and nobody really knew, nobody knew.
[3:22:53.720 --> 3:22:57.560]  So for him to shut him down, oh, we don't want conspiracy theories, and then for the
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:03.120]  likes of BuzzFeed to put out the biggest conspiracy theory, which was that there were no people
[3:23:03.120 --> 3:23:08.960]  celebrating this when there clearly were hundreds and hundreds.
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:14.920]  I was on that French 24 Arabic Facebook page, and in fact, in the video, I go on Al Jazeera's
[3:23:14.920 --> 3:23:20.360]  Facebook page, and it's exactly the same in terms of smiley faces.
[3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:26.680]  Literally every other comment was people celebrating this fire, and they say that's a fake news
[3:23:26.680 --> 3:23:31.200]  conspiracy theory, they say that that is the reason I should be de-platformed.
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:33.680]  And they're doing it today.
[3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:37.440]  With people like Glenn Beck, obviously I'm not a big fan of Glenn Beck, this is a headline
[3:23:37.440 --> 3:23:42.280]  out of Newsweek, Glenn Beck compares Notre Dame Fire to 9-11, this is their World Trade
[3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:43.280]  Center moment.
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:48.480]  Obviously, it's nowhere near the horror of the World Trade Center because no one died.
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:55.000]  But in terms of a historical devastation, a historical desecration, yes, it was somewhat
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  on a par, at least architecturally.
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:00.080]  Thankfully nobody died.
[3:24:00.080 --> 3:24:06.400]  It's not on the same level of 9-11, but what Beck was trending for on Twitter earlier was
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:12.840]  his comment, according to this article, that the fire may have been intentional.
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:16.560]  And Beck said this, quote, if this was arson, this is going to be bad.
[3:24:16.560 --> 3:24:20.360]  It might have just been started by a cigarette, we don't know.
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:24.520]  And bear in mind they did this to Cernovich yesterday as well, on Buzzfeed.
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:25.520]  Same thing.
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:30.200]  Cernovich literally did two videos where he straight off the bat said, yeah, it looks
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:34.080]  like an accident, it's probably an accident, or by the way, this is also a good time to
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:40.840]  talk about these 875 French churches that have been attacked, but this is an accident.
[3:24:40.840 --> 3:24:45.880]  And immediately that turned into, oh, Cernovich says it's not an accident, and now Russian
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:51.360]  media is picking up what Cernovich said, everybody panic, more Russian conspiracy theory, they're
[3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:55.040]  still running with that hoax.
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:59.800]  So Beck comes out and says it might have just been started by a cigarette, but if this was
[3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:03.600]  started by Islamists, I don't think you'll find out about it, because I think it would
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:05.280]  set the entire country on fire.
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:08.640]  They've had killings, they've had mass shootings, they've had people running down people in
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:11.200]  the streets, the tension is very high.
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:15.240]  And that, again, is a completely fair comment to make.
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:22.280]  We've done stories on info wars about military heads, security officials in France, ex-ministers
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:27.320]  of the interior saying, look, if this gets much worse in terms of the lack of integration
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:31.200]  of some of these communities, and in terms of these terror attacks, these attacks on
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:37.480]  police, you had the priest back in what was it, 2017 being beheaded, dozens and dozens
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:41.640]  of Islamic terror attacks in France, they've said this could spill over into some kind
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:43.080]  of civil war.
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:48.320]  This is not Glenn Beck saying it, this is officials within the French security apparatus
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:50.860]  within the French military saying this.
[3:25:50.860 --> 3:25:57.600]  So would there be an agenda for them to hide an Islamist connection to something as devastating
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:01.920]  and horrific as the Notre Dame cathedrals burning down?
[3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:06.600]  I don't know, it probably was an accident, but even to ask the question, it's a perfectly
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:12.240]  reasonable question to ask, it's not within the realms of wild conspiracy theory.
[3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:17.040]  But again, he's been completely torn apart just for asking the question.
[3:26:17.040 --> 3:26:21.280]  Once again, they don't want anybody asking any questions which challenge any of their
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:25.680]  narratives, even if it's far from the realms of wild conspiracy theory.
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:31.400]  I mean, YouTube is so freaked out at this point about tamping down on conspiracy theories
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:37.760]  that they literally put up a Wikipedia fact checkbox on videos of the Notre Dame fire
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:41.360]  yesterday because that stupid algorithm didn't even know what was going on.
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:45.760]  It was like, oh, panic, somebody might say something against the official narrative.
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:49.720]  You better clamp down on this immediately.
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.040]  The other aspect to this, and that's in the CNN article, the Internet is already washing
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:55.960]  Notre Dame conspiracies.
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:00.880]  There were a lot of dumb conspiracies which were obviously not true.
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:07.120]  Like oh, there's some guy milling around with Muslim garb as the fires burning in the building.
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:08.120]  No, it wasn't true.
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:09.520]  It was a fireman.
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.480]  There were fake Fox News accounts, fake CNN accounts that were set up on Twitter that
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:20.000]  put out deliberate fake news that this was an ISIS or an Islamic terror attack.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:23.880]  Yes, pure conspiracy theory, pure BS.
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:27.320]  Then you had BuzzFeed patting themselves on the back because they got those accounts
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:28.320]  shut down.
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:30.200]  And yes, that was complete BS.
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:31.820]  That was pure conspiracy theory.
[3:27:31.820 --> 3:27:38.680]  But then they link it in, they tie it all together with stuff which is actually true
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:43.880]  like the fact that there were people celebrating this fire in real time as it happened and
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:48.160]  basically say, oh, well, all these other conspiracies are BS, they've been debunked, they've been
[3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:49.160]  shut down.
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:50.160]  Why not this one?
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:52.560]  Well, because it's true.
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:57.040]  And you were the ones who put out the fake news story that it wasn't.
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:01.560]  So Glenn Beck is being completely pillared for that again.
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:08.600]  Anyone who dares bring up the fact that there have been 875 attacks on French churches over
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:14.720]  the past year alone, they're being called conspiracy theorists now, anti-Christian attacks
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:15.720]  in France.
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:21.840]  We did a story on this yesterday before the fire coincidentally enough on summit.news.
[3:28:21.840 --> 3:28:27.560]  Anti-Christian attacks in France are running 10 to 1 against anti-Muslim attacks.
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:33.520]  So there are around 1000 anti-Christian attacks in 2018 in France, attacks on churches, etc.
[3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:35.760]  And only 100 anti-Muslim attacks.
[3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:38.600]  And all attacks are horrible, all should be condemned.
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:40.520]  But again, this is a big problem.
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:43.360]  Jews are fleeing France in record numbers.
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:48.200]  These hate crimes are actually a big problem in France and we can't deny that by claiming
[3:28:48.200 --> 3:28:50.400]  it's all one big conspiracy theory.
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:53.720]  We'll be back at Infowars.com.
[3:28:53.720 --> 3:28:58.240]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol

[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:55.640]  Now the last little tidbit of this BuzzFeed hit piece was they claimed that InfoWars put
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:35:59.160]  out a baseless claim that the fire was set deliberately.
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:05.040]  No, that wasn't put out by me, that was put out by somebody who worked for the mainstream
[3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:07.240]  media.
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:13.600]  So this was a guy called Christopher Hale, who was a Time Magazine journalist who tweeted
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.800]  that he knew an employee who worked at the Notre Dame Cathedral who said that it was deliberately
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:20.800]  set.
[3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:25.880]  He's not Alex Jones that said that, he's not PJW that said that, it was one of your own
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:28.280]  mainstream media journalists.
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:35.240]  Now as soon as this started getting attention, he deleted the tweet, pretty cowardly.
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:39.920]  I managed to screenshot it before he deleted it, wrote up an article saying, this guy who
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:43.760]  works at Time Magazine has a friend who works there, he says it was set deliberately, didn't
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:49.000]  say it was set deliberately, said this guy claims it was set deliberately.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:53.720]  Was that true that this individual who worked at the Notre Dame, according to this Time
[3:36:53.720 --> 3:36:59.200]  Magazine journalist said it was set deliberately, well according to your own Time Magazine journalist,
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:01.200]  yes it was true.
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:06.520]  So then they claim that we're spreading that baseless theory because he got freaked out
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:09.040]  by the attention and deleted his tweet.
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:13.160]  And then they went back and interviewed him and said, he basically said, oh for the record
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:17.640]  I completely believe it was an accident, why did you tweet that then?
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:22.040]  I was writing an article based on his tweet, that's your guy, he works for the mainstream
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:23.040]  media.
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:27.640]  It's not us circulating fake news, if he knew it was fake news that was him circulating
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:28.640]  it.
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:33.720]  He deleted the tweet, again extremely, extremely weak.
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:41.320]  Meanwhile, Sputnik reports, Pakistani migrant facing jail time over damage to ancient French
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:42.320]  Basilica.
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:47.320]  Oh we can't talk about this though, I guess this is a conspiracy theory now too.
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:53.000]  The 875 churches have been desecrated in France over the past year according to official
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:54.840]  government numbers.
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:59.880]  France has suffered a stark uptick in vandalism against places of Christian worship in recent
[3:37:59.880 --> 3:38:05.320]  years and close to 900 acts of defacement and well over 100 thefts of church artifacts
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:07.360]  reported over the last year alone.
[3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:12.920]  A 41 year old Pakistani national charge with causing extensive damage to the Basilica of
[3:38:12.920 --> 3:38:20.800]  Sandini, which is where 400,000 illegal migrants live, 40% of the Muslim, one of France's most
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:24.880]  important religious, cultural, historical and architectural landmarks will go on trial
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:25.880]  next month.
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:26.880]  Or will he?
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:27.880]  Is it just a conspiracy theory?
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:29.840]  Maybe BuzzFeed can debunk it.
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:34.920]  The man who arrived in France just two months ago, again very well integrated individual
[3:38:34.920 --> 3:38:39.360]  by the sands of it, is accused of damaging two doors and several stained glass windows
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:44.800]  and causing extensive damage to the Basilica's main organ back in March.
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:50.200]  Remember there was the fire at the other Saint-Sulpice church, I think it was a couple
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.240]  of months ago as well in Paris, that got barely any media attention, as did this.
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:38:58.960]  He was arrested last week after his DNA was reportedly discovered at the scene of the
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:00.480]  crime.
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:06.920]  So this guy is going to be on trial here shortly, I guess that may not be happening because
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:12.320]  it's a conspiracy theory that we've all invented in our minds according to BuzzFeed.
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:16.440]  The Sun reports churches across France have been set on fire and poof smeared on walls
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:21.040]  as the country's Christian heritage is said to be under attack from militant secularism.
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:24.560]  And again, that's the point.
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:28.160]  You'll notice in the original tweet, I didn't even say that Muslims were celebrating it,
[3:39:28.160 --> 3:39:30.160]  I said people.
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:34.160]  Some of these attacks are from Satanists, some of them are from extreme atheists and
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:36.520]  some of them are from Muslims, it's a mix.
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:41.920]  It doesn't matter who's doing it, it's a real big problem.
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:47.440]  Daily Mail reports have a nice day, ISIS fanatics revel in Notre Dame's destruction
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:53.840]  days before Easter, as they describe the inferno as retribution and punishment.
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:39:57.760]  So I guess according to BuzzFeed, that doesn't matter.
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:00.840]  Maybe ISIS doesn't exist, I don't know.
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:05.920]  So again, you have this narrative of ISIS reacting to it, ISIS celebrating it, unless
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:12.200]  ISIS is running every other comment through the France 24 Arabic Facebook page, I mean
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:17.880]  God hope they're not, otherwise ISIS is far larger than we expected because the comments
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:19.840]  were quite similar.
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:23.880]  ISIS fanatics are heartlessly reveling in the inferno at Notre Dame Cathedral just
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:27.360]  days after Easter calling it retribution and punishment according to terror intelligence.
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:31.680]  Researchers, I guess BuzzFeed is going to have to debunk them as well and say that they're
[3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:35.840]  lying and putting out fake news even though they're not, the poster of the Blazing Cathedral
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:38.960]  appeared online accompanied by the words have a good day.
[3:40:38.960 --> 3:40:40.120]  But did it really?
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:45.200]  Does that poster from this article really show the Notre Dame Cathedral?
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:49.520]  Maybe we need BuzzFeed to take a look at this because apparently they can't recognize what
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:55.280]  the cathedral looks like but still put out fake news stories claiming that I don't know
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:40:59.160]  what it looks like when it's right there in the background.
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:05.640]  Meanwhile, Baptist pastor says Bank of America shut down all of his church's bank accounts.
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:10.120]  We've seen that in the past with people like Joe Biggs, I think who temporarily got his
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:11.480]  account shut down.
[3:41:11.480 --> 3:41:17.880]  We've seen it with Enrique Tarrio, the proud boys member who got his Chase bank account
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:18.880]  shut down.
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:25.320]  And now we have pastor Stephen Anderson of the faithful Will Baptist Church in Tempe,
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:26.320]  Arizona.
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:31.800]  And again, this guy says a lot of stuff which is absolutely insane and I'm not going to
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:36.440]  defend what he says about specific issues, but if you're going to defend free speech,
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:39.720]  you're going to have to defend unpopular free speech.
[3:41:39.720 --> 3:41:45.440]  You can't withdraw people's ability to engage in basic e-commerce just because you don't
[3:41:45.440 --> 3:41:52.120]  like what they said because that is a slippery slope to absolute oblivion.
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:57.080]  So they've had their, I said Chase, it was actually Bank of America account shut down.
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:41:58.560]  Why not just start your own bank?
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:01.320]  I mean, that's what people on the right say.
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:03.520]  Some of them, it worshiped my free market.
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:06.480]  Oh, we can't have any regulation of social media.
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:11.120]  We can't have any regulation of commerce, just start your own bank.
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:12.800]  Just start your own Twitter.
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:16.360]  That's what their reaction will be to that.
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:22.680]  Again, people are continuing to react to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:27.280]  We had this story as well, ISIS pride leftists want back in the UK stitched explosives into
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:28.720]  suicide vests.
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:34.480]  So this is a Begum, this Shemima Begum, this ISIS pride literally saw decapitated heads
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:37.040]  in bins and said she wasn't fazed by it.
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:41.640]  Stitched explosives into suicide vests was a brutal ISIS controller.
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:44.720]  Now she wants back into the country and the left supports it.
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:42:47.440]  Now she's got legal aid and it looks like it could happen.
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:49.080]  Absolutely absurd.
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:51.320]  This is the Alex Jones show live and for wars.com.
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:52.320]  We'll be back.
[3:42:52.320 --> 3:42:56.640]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:42:59.760]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:00.760]  for a year and a half fight.
[3:43:00.760 --> 3:43:05.800]  But we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic item in the
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:07.600]  world, X2 is back.
[3:43:07.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  We got it.
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:10.080]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:11.680]  We rushed it into production.
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:12.680]  It's been bottled.
[3:43:12.680 --> 3:43:16.920]  The symbols are being put on today and that it's going to be on an 18 wheeler right here
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:21.480]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:27.440]  Be sure and sign up for auto ship and an additional 10% off the 25% off celebration of the fact
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:29.800]  that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:31.560]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:33.320]  Find out why it's so important.
[3:43:33.320 --> 3:43:36.120]  Find out why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens.
[3:43:36.120 --> 3:43:39.920]  You have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:43.880]  It's the Umbrella site, infowarstore.com, makes you write the supplements.
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:47.040]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:54.000]  It is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:55.440]  I want to say brain force is great.
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:43:57.440]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[3:43:57.440 --> 3:43:58.440]  It is.
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:02.920]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[3:44:02.920 --> 3:44:04.240]  The fish oil is better than that.
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:06.160]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:11.680]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:12.680]  You've got the children's.
[3:44:12.680 --> 3:44:13.680]  You've got the adults.
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:14.680]  You've got the krill oil.
[3:44:14.680 --> 3:44:18.520]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:21.880]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:22.880]  burps.
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:23.880]  And I'm sorry.
[3:44:23.880 --> 3:44:25.280]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[3:44:25.280 --> 3:44:26.280]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:27.280]  It's so good.
[3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:28.280]  It might be.
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:30.480]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[3:44:30.480 --> 3:44:33.360]  I eat five camperels of krill oil before I go to bed.
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:35.080]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:43.040]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:47.440]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I'm just obsessed because
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:54.480]  whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:58.840]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[3:44:58.840 --> 3:45:03.080]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:07.240]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[3:45:07.240 --> 3:45:14.360]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:18.560]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:22.720]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[3:45:22.720 --> 3:45:27.720]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[3:45:27.720 --> 3:45:34.920]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:38.920]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[3:45:38.920 --> 3:45:42.600]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:47.920]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:59.560]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[3:45:59.560 --> 3:46:02.600]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:05.200]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:08.680]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:13.440]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really
[3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:16.640]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:20.960]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:24.960]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[3:46:24.960 --> 3:46:28.800]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:33.320]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[3:46:33.320 --> 3:46:37.760]  at InfowarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[3:46:37.760 --> 3:46:42.360]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[3:46:42.360 --> 3:46:47.000]  To myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:50.240]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:57.480]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[3:46:57.480 --> 3:47:13.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:13.600 --> 3:47:21.880]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[3:47:21.880 --> 3:47:25.280]  host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:32.920]  I'm going to throw here to the video that I just put out a couple of hours ago, completely
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:39.800]  rebutting and debunking BuzzFeed's fake news about this Notre Dame fire.
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:44.280]  Another article we had on Summit News yesterday, friends attacks against Jews and Christians
[3:47:44.280 --> 3:47:45.280]  continue to rise.
[3:47:45.280 --> 3:47:49.760]  That was a big article, pretty coincidental, that it came out literally an hour before
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:51.920]  this in terms of attacks on churches.
[3:47:51.920 --> 3:47:56.800]  Oh, but we can't talk about that because it's a conspiracy theory that 900 churches were
[3:47:56.800 --> 3:48:03.640]  attacked in France last year and again, anti-Semitic hate crimes way up in France.
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:09.480]  The anti-Christian hate crimes also climbed anti-Muslim hate crimes at their lowest since
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:14.120]  2010 at their lowest for nine years.
[3:48:14.120 --> 3:48:15.680]  So again, what is the real problem?
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:21.600]  What is the real conversation that we should be having here in the aftermath of this Notre
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:22.600]  Dame fire?
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:23.600]  Which was an accident.
[3:48:23.600 --> 3:48:24.600]  Don't get me wrong.
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:25.720]  We're going to go to this clip.
[3:48:25.720 --> 3:48:29.680]  This is the full video, the Notre Dame fire, which is available on my YouTube channel,
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:31.960]  which you can go, please get this, share it out.
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:38.160]  And here is that full video.
[3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:44.440]  So BuzzFeed just got caught sharing hoax misinformation about the Notre Dame fire and then blamed me
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:47.320]  for sharing hoax misinformation about the Notre Dame fire.
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:52.520]  While the blaze was still raging, I posted this tweet in which I stated a brief summary
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:58.520]  of who is responding to the tragic Notre Dame fire with smiley faces on Facebook.
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:03.240]  The video attached to this tweet was a live Facebook feed of the Notre Dame fire.
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:08.960]  In this video, you can see a list of who was reacting in real time to the fire with smiley
[3:49:08.960 --> 3:49:10.560]  emoticons.
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.080]  Take a good long look.
[3:49:13.080 --> 3:49:17.760]  The video clearly shows the Notre Dame Cathedral burning in the background.
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:22.160]  And here's the original Facebook video from where my tweet was grabbed.
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:23.160]  It's a page called Brute.
[3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:28.360]  It has over 7 million views and there you see Brute was live at Notre Dame Paris.
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:29.960]  You can check all this for yourself.
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:33.680]  Again, you see the Notre Dame burning in the video.
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:36.320]  It's the same video that I tweeted.
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:42.240]  And this screenshot from the original live at Notre Dame video shows people reacting
[3:49:42.240 --> 3:49:45.680]  with smiley faces as Notre Dame burns.
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:48.880]  Now, how do you think Buzzfeed reported on this?
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:54.200]  In a giant article about hoax as a misinformation surrounding the Notre Dame fire, Buzzfeed's
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:56.520]  Jane Litvinenko wrote the following.
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:50:01.280]  There's zero evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces.
[3:50:01.280 --> 3:50:05.840]  Paul Joseph Watson tweeted a link to a video that claimed to show Muslim people celebrating
[3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:06.840]  the fire.
[3:50:06.840 --> 3:50:10.680]  Critically, the video in question does not show what people on Facebook were reacting
[3:50:10.680 --> 3:50:11.680]  to.
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:15.520]  It's possible to know the religious views of each person reacting to a video en masse,
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:17.840]  so we really have no idea what was going on here.
[3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:20.360]  And there is no proof to back up this claim.
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  Really?
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:26.680]  Well, first, I never said it showed, quote, Muslim people celebrating the fire.
[3:50:26.680 --> 3:50:28.000]  That's line number one.
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:29.800]  It wasn't even in my tweet.
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:34.280]  And secondly, yes, the video does show what people were reacting to.
[3:50:34.280 --> 3:50:36.800]  They're reacting to the Notre Dame fire.
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:41.440]  It's right there in the background at the start of the frigging clip.
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:46.400]  And here's the original where they're quite clearly reacting to the Notre Dame fire with
[3:50:46.400 --> 3:50:47.720]  smiley faces.
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:50.960]  The video was authentic and it's in the video.
[3:50:50.960 --> 3:50:55.840]  So Buzzfeed published fake news claiming I was engaged in a hoax when they were the
[3:50:55.840 --> 3:50:57.440]  ones engaged in the hoax.
[3:50:57.440 --> 3:50:58.440]  Oh, yeah.
[3:50:58.440 --> 3:51:05.040]  And Jane putting a stupid nope yellow sticker on my tweet doesn't invalidate its accuracy.
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:06.760]  Even this tweet is wrong.
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  She claims this screenshot also doesn't show the video itself.
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:12.200]  Yes, it does.
[3:51:12.200 --> 3:51:13.280]  Here's the video.
[3:51:13.280 --> 3:51:14.280]  You lied.
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:15.280]  You were called out for it.
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:20.040]  I asked you for a retraction on numerous occasions and you did nothing.
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:22.880]  You're deliberately putting out fake news.
[3:51:22.880 --> 3:51:24.520]  This is why you suck.
[3:51:24.520 --> 3:51:26.280]  This is why no one trusts you.
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:31.040]  This is why Buzzfeed is going bust and laying off staff left, right and center.
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:35.560]  As to the wider question of were Muslims celebrating the fire, which I never even said in the
[3:51:35.560 --> 3:51:37.160]  tweet, but they say I said it.
[3:51:37.160 --> 3:51:38.880]  So I guess let's just go with it.
[3:51:38.880 --> 3:51:40.720]  Let's take a closer look.
[3:51:40.720 --> 3:51:43.560]  This is called research Buzzfeed.
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:44.840]  You should try it sometime.
[3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:50.360]  Here's a selection of comments I grabbed from just two threads about the Notre Dame fire
[3:51:50.360 --> 3:51:54.200]  from France 24, Arabic's Facebook page.
[3:51:54.200 --> 3:51:57.600]  These comments are all translated from Arabic.
[3:51:57.600 --> 3:51:59.960]  What were these people saying about the fire?
[3:51:59.960 --> 3:52:04.600]  I am disappointed for the lack of charred bodies in this festive party.
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:05.880]  What a wonderful moment.
[3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:06.880]  God thank you.
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:10.080]  I dedicate this wonderful and beautiful fire to my family.
[3:52:10.080 --> 3:52:11.080]  Congratulations.
[3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:13.920]  Hopefully the mass destruction of France.
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:15.240]  It's a beautiful fire.
[3:52:15.240 --> 3:52:17.600]  OMG, the most beautiful fire in the world.
[3:52:17.600 --> 3:52:21.280]  We announced the sympathy of our full solidarity with the fire.
[3:52:21.280 --> 3:52:24.520]  Unfortunately, the entire structure did not collapse.
[3:52:24.520 --> 3:52:26.520]  I am sympathetic to the fire.
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:31.480]  I dedicate this fire to all the Algerian people and we wish another fire.
[3:52:31.480 --> 3:52:33.960]  God willing, the next on the Eiffel Tower.
[3:52:33.960 --> 3:52:39.960]  I am very happy, smiley face, smiley face, to see part of France burning.
[3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:44.920]  People were even posting gifs which said, yea I'm so happy and celebrate.
[3:52:44.920 --> 3:52:50.200]  Again, these comments were grabbed from just two small sections of two threads.
[3:52:50.200 --> 3:52:54.360]  From what I saw, nearly every other comment was celebrating the fire.
[3:52:54.360 --> 3:52:57.840]  Let's look at how Al Jazeera viewers were reacting to the fire.
[3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:02.840]  Here's how they reacted to stories about the fire on Al Jazeera's Facebook page.
[3:53:02.840 --> 3:53:06.760]  Again, note the names and note the smiley faces.
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:09.680]  Remember, Buzzfeed claimed, quote.
[3:53:09.680 --> 3:53:15.200]  There's no evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces, really.
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:20.840]  Let's let it run a little further so you can get a good sample of that reaction.
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:22.720]  Remember, Buzzfeed, quote.
[3:53:22.720 --> 3:53:27.280]  There's zero evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces.
[3:53:27.280 --> 3:53:30.400]  Guess I must just be imagining all these smiley faces then.
[3:53:30.400 --> 3:53:34.400]  Here's a screenshot from the original Facebook video, the one which Buzzfeed lied about and
[3:53:34.400 --> 3:53:38.680]  said was a hoax, with someone commenting, Allah is grand.
[3:53:38.680 --> 3:53:43.760]  Is that a hoax too, am I making that up, Buzzfeed, Jane Litvinenko, or were you the
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:45.440]  ones who put out a hoax?
[3:53:45.440 --> 3:53:50.080]  Unlike Buzzfeed, which apparently doesn't know how to do basic research, you could go
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:52.000]  and check all this out for yourself.
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:53:57.440]  The comments are all still on France 24 Arabic's Facebook page and Al Jazeera's Facebook page.
[3:53:57.440 --> 3:54:00.240]  Were Muslims celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[3:54:00.240 --> 3:54:06.400]  Yes, it's a fact and there's evidence in abundance and that's a big problem, that's a reality
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:09.280]  we need to face up to and have a conversation about.
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.200]  It's not a conversation that you can just cover up and sweep under the rug by claiming
[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:15.720]  it never happened, it happened.
[3:54:15.720 --> 3:54:20.720]  In their Morning Tech newsletter, Politico also claimed, Paul Jeffs if Watson shared
[3:54:20.720 --> 3:54:24.240]  a hoax claiming Muslims were reacting positively to the fire.
[3:54:24.240 --> 3:54:28.800]  No, you're the one sharing the hoax, Politico, because it did happen.
[3:54:28.800 --> 3:54:34.120]  Buzzfeed's Ryan Broderick thinks people should be removed from Twitter for spreading, quote,
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:35.120]  misinformation.
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:39.720]  Better remove Buzzfeed then because they're openly spreading misinformation about the
[3:54:39.720 --> 3:54:41.920]  reaction to the Notre Dame fire.
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:43.160]  See how this works?
[3:54:43.160 --> 3:54:49.360]  They lobby social media companies to de-platform me for spreading conspiracy theories when
[3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:52.400]  they're the ones spreading conspiracy theories.
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:55.720]  Does that mean that every Muslim was celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[3:54:55.720 --> 3:54:56.720]  No.
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:01.680]  Does it mean that Buzzfeed and Politico lied in reporting that the claim Muslims were celebrating
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:03.800]  the Notre Dame fire was a hoax?
[3:55:03.800 --> 3:55:04.800]  Yes.
[3:55:04.800 --> 3:55:10.000]  Instead of denouncing the vile rhetoric of those celebrating the destruction of a cherished
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:16.680]  piece of history, Buzzfeed denounced me and ran defense for the very people spewing that
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:17.920]  vile rhetoric.
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:21.200]  Do these individuals seem to be horrified by the fire?
[3:55:21.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  How about these individuals?
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:27.560]  So don't get me wrong, it wasn't just Muslims who were celebrating the fire, many leftists
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:29.960]  could barely contain their glee either.
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:34.960]  Notre Dame burning is cosmic karma for all the historical sites and artifacts France destroyed
[3:55:34.960 --> 3:55:37.960]  and stole when being colonialist scum.
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:42.280]  Genuinely awful, but if you mourn for this one building and not say the entirety of Syria,
[3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:45.360]  your white supremacy is showing.
[3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:50.080]  Notre Dame on fire is the most aesthetically pleasing visually I've ever seen, Notre Dame
[3:55:50.080 --> 3:55:51.080]  burns.
[3:55:51.080 --> 3:55:55.600]  Former French colonies, alongside a video of a guy laughing his head off with nearly
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:55:58.000]  22 million views.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:03.720]  Oh, but no one celebrated it according to Buzzfeed, it's just one giant conspiracy theory.
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:06.840]  This one's for colonizing African countries, b****.
[3:56:06.840 --> 3:56:07.840]  Yeah.
[3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:15.200]  Notre Dame was completed in 1345, that's 70 years before the first wave of European colonization.
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:17.360]  Do some f***ing maths, moron.
[3:56:17.360 --> 3:56:23.360]  So yes, people celebrated, Muslims celebrated, leftists celebrated, and what does that tell
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:26.120]  us about the state of western civilization?
[3:56:26.120 --> 3:56:28.880]  They laugh, they party, they say it's karma.
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:33.480]  Then our own media runs defense for them and says all of that never happened and it's
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:34.480]  all a hoax.
[3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:39.640]  Now, I know the Notre Dame fire was accidental, but in France, churches are being burned and
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:42.400]  desecrated on a regular basis.
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:46.640]  Public statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary are being decapitated and destroyed and the
[3:56:46.640 --> 3:56:49.080]  media barely reports on it.
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:53.320]  In France, there are 10 times the number of anti-Christian attacks compared to anti-Muslim
[3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:54.320]  attacks.
[3:56:54.320 --> 3:57:00.880]  175 Christian churches in France were vandalized last year alone, Jews are fleeing France in
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:05.240]  record numbers and it's time more people started talking about it.
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:10.760]  When Islamic sites are burned, attacked, or desecrated, we respect their grief and mourning
[3:57:10.760 --> 3:57:11.760]  and rightly so.
[3:57:11.760 --> 3:57:17.080]  When Christian sites are burned, attacked, or desecrated, apparently to a lot of people
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:23.200]  it's just one big joke and if you try to denounce those people for their hatred, the media will
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:26.080]  run defense for them and tear you down.
[3:57:26.080 --> 3:57:32.520]  They'll run a giant hoax claiming no one celebrated and then accuse you of running a hoax for telling
[3:57:32.520 --> 3:57:33.520]  the truth.
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:35.640]  Buzzfeed is fake news.
[3:57:35.640 --> 3:57:44.280]  They lied about me, they lied to their audience and they ran defense for vile people.
