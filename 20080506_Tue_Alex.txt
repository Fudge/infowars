[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.000 --> 00:37.000]  Oh, my. This Tuesday, May 6, 2008, transmission is going to be quite a revelation for you.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  Very special broadcast today. Jim Tucker, who just covered and got inside info from the
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  Trilateral Commission meeting a few days ago, will be joining us here first to break the
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  news and information more than is just in his article on AmericanFreePress.net and infowars.com
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  right now. We have a surprise top globalist. We say that because we don't want to foil them
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.000]  coming on blind scheduled for later. I'm just going to leave that be about 95% of the time.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  We'll see if this one does. Mike Rivera over his monthly visits pops in. Perfect timing to cover
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  the latest info on the murder of Deborah Jean Palfrey and the overdrive cover-up by the police,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  AP and others. And then we also have the apartment manager. They haven't even really released his
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  name yet, but we have it. And we've talked to him. He's talked to the TV cameras, but without
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  giving his name, he'll be joining us coming up. We're not going to give his name out either.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  The point is, is that he's going to be on the radio show with us coming up later today.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  She told him that she was being followed, thought there was a contract out on him.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  Then we have James Whale, who's made the front page of all the major papers in England. He was fired
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  for giving his political views. That's right. You're not allowed to do that in England.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  Arguably one of the most popular. He's in the top three. Arguably the most popular.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  Radio talk show host in England fired for supporting the individual who just won to be the new
[02:16.000 --> 02:26.000]  mayor of London. The last guy was an open communist. So this is just amazing, a conservative mayor.
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  And his friend is James Whale and James was fired over this. He will be joining us in the fourth hour
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  today from London. And he is going to do his own internet radio show and he may be arrested.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  Because in England, you do not allowed to have free speech. Jolly Old England is a hyper police
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  state today, ladies and gentlemen. And you're not allowed to have free speech if they don't say so.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  Nice men with badges and guns drop by. By the way, I'm not bashing police. I'm against what you're
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  being trained to do and what you're following orders to do.
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  There was a cop calling himself anonymous Austin cop on my message board in the comment section
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  of info wars commenting on a story today and he said typical blow hard frothing Alex Jones
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  making the police look bad and the people pointed out officer. This is a Seattle Times article about
[03:28.000 --> 03:37.000]  how they give the police information on citizens that the telecommunications companies do without warrants.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  And the article by the way is pro destroyed the fourth amendment. I mean, I even post articles to point out
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  what the establishments doing that are saying get rid of the fourth amendment. And this guy is in there
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  saying he's an Austin cop saying that I'm basically what do you call me trash. Well, let me tell you
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  something. I'm not the one destroying your dollar in your future. I'm not the one that put sodium
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  fluoride in your water cop. Let me tell you something. There is no doubt that it is eating
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  holes in your brain attacking every organ in your body. There is no doubt it's reduced your IQ
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  massively and mine. There's no doubt we're in the same boat. You just think you're in the boat that
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  didn't go into the bottom when you're in the boat with us going to the bottom. By the way, in a three mile
[04:24.000 --> 04:38.000]  stretch, I saw nine police running speed traps today on 360. And I literally started crying. It's over.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  It's just beginning. They're going to triple the number and they are going to literally micromanage
[04:44.000 --> 04:54.000]  everything you do.
[04:54.000 --> 05:03.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  new world order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. Order in-game on DVD at

[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  diet, and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health,
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000]  water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic. The fact is that disease
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  your body now. Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com. Again, that's

[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract is
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  product as a preventive to keep their cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two month supply

[08:28.000 --> 08:35.000]  Well, in the next few weeks, he's found out the past 35 years every time he should discover
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  the location either in North America or Europe of the Bilderberg Group annual meeting of
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  125 owners of the chattel slaves. It's global economic steering arm. It's openly called
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  for world government. The end of the dollar just met global elite gather in DC trilateral
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  commission. He's got major leaks from the inside. And by the way, Jim's leaks always turn out
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  to be very accurate. Kissinger a few years ago talked about $200 a barrel oil. It's gone
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  past $120 a barrel. When Kissinger said that it was at $40 a barrel. And he said within
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  the next few years they would raise it artificially. And now Jim Tucker's got us another window
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  via spies into the trilateral commission meeting in Washington DC. He joins us from the offices
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  of American Free Press in Washington DC, the super sleuth, straw hat and all. It is Jim
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  Tucker. Jim, thanks for coming on with us. It's always a pleasure. All right, we only got you
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  for one segment. Run down what you've got from the trilateral boys, the sub directorate with
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  David Rockefeller and then where you think Bilderberg may be? Well, the trilateral commission
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  meeting in Washington was a lot of fun this weekend. We still don't know where Bilderberg's
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  going to meet. There's boys in Europe have some ideas, but they're not checking out very well.
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  And the possibility of Japan is only suggested because the G8 has a state from North America
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  and Europe are going to meet in Japan this year for the first time ever. So there could be a
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  connection there. But the trilateral commission this past weekend was a lot of fun because
[10:27.000 --> 10:34.000]  they close their meeting absolutely convinced that there would be no reporting. Nobody would
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  know who is there or maybe a few people identifying outside of Rockefeller or a famous face. But
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  we have their complete list of participants. We have their complete agenda. We know everything
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  that transpired and they're going to be shocked when they see the American Free Press this
[10:51.000 --> 11:03.000]  week, a four-page pullout insert that tells all about their mischief. As usual, well,
[11:03.000 --> 11:11.000]  one interesting thing is they are very upset about Ron Paul. Now, they said they're... Tell
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  me what, stay there because I know you're in a newsroom and it's noisy, but I want you to
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  back up a little bit because somebody's voice was overpowering things. Jim, explain to people
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  you guys... I had a mole in there. I mean, I don't want you to give us any details, but
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  I mean, or give us as much as you can of how you're getting this info out.
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  Somehow I can't go further, but they came into my hands, their complete packet which
[11:37.000 --> 11:48.000]  listed their participants, all 320 of them that listed their agenda, what they're dealing
[11:48.000 --> 11:56.000]  with, and then these dropping in bars is a very helpful thing, also developing helpful
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.000]  bartenders who will also be your eyes and ears. Of course, as we said, they're drinking
[12:02.000 --> 12:10.000]  lemonade or something, and their concern over Ron Paul fascinated me. They say that they're
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  quite sure that they own any of the three potential presidents, meaning Senator John
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  McCain and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They noted that Hillary and Obama have
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  pretended they've got reservations about NAFTA and they say that's pure politics, citing
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  the Obama boy in Canada who reassured Canadian diplomats according to stories published
[12:37.000 --> 12:45.000]  in Canadian newspapers. Obama was all far and NAFTA's just campaign retic with his reassurances
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  to the Canadians.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  Okay, but you specifically, this is coming from Bilderberg, I mean, from Trilateral Commission,
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  same thing. Why are they still worried about Ron Paul?
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.000]  Because they're concerned about Ron Paul's turning out thousands and thousands of young
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  voters who are getting what they call their political education. Well, the political education
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  Dr. Paul is giving these throngs of young people is exactly the opposite of what Bilderberg
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  and Trilateral won't.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  So they're worried about the movement and what it's built rather than the candidacy?
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  Yes, they're sure that Ron Paul, well, Ron Paul himself says that he recognized no chance
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  to be elected president.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  Well, Ron Paul would give us some marching orders for the tens of millions that will do
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  whatever he says, like let's try to repeal NAFTA now that it's up or let's repeal gun
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  laws or let's shut down the border or end the war. They would go out and continue the
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  grassroots operations. Right now they're still spending 99% of their time on the delegate
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  process and running around shouting Ron Paul and buying his book. And that's all fine and
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  dandy. We sell the book too. It's just that I think Ron Paul needs to understand he is
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  the leader right now and he needs to, I think, go ahead and give some orders because an army
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  that doesn't fight kind of falls apart.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  Well, he thinks he's got about 50 delegates with all the campaign election cheating and
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  so forth still about 50 delegates and he's hoping to be able to deliver a prime time
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  speech at the convention on that basis. And it used to be if you got even one delegate
[14:24.000 --> 14:32.000]  you could be placed in nomination during fashion. But they're concerned that these thousands
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  of young people who follow Ron Paul are being educated on the Constitution which they despise,
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  the First and 10th Amendment which they despise. And the fact that Ron Paul would bring the
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  United States back to non-interventionist policy about he'd bring the troops home immediately,
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  not only from Iraq and Afghanistan, but from 130 peacekeeping missions around the world.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  He'd bring them home and they would protect our border, not other people's borders, and
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  our borders are so badly unprotected as it is.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  Okay, so bottom line, they're worried about the anti-globalist movement exploding in size
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  with Ron Paul as a focal point.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  Yes, and with all these young people embracing and traditionally young people were always
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  considered left wingers in the 1960s. They all voted from the government and then they
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  who was opposed to, correctly opposed to the war, but also favored a whole lot of socialism.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  That's right. So now they're not buying into fake conservatives and neocons. They're not
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  buying into a foundation, establishment, gatekeeper liberals. They're actually waking up to the
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  New World Order and your sources were saying that that was one of the main topics.
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  It was not actually on the agenda, but a lot of people expressed concern about Ron Paul.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  Did they talk about ways to counter it?
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  No, they just raised the issue. We've got to do something about it. They won't follow
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Republicans to pressure Paul to drop out now and stop his education rallies.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  His other assignment was given to Thomas Foley, former US Speaker of the House, but he was
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  a Democrat, but of course all that.
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  How was Foley going to go after Paul? Do we know from the enemy operation?
[16:17.000 --> 16:24.000]  He will call up old Clint Easton, Congress, Republicans and Democrats, who will pressure
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  Paul to announce he's dropped his campaign through making speeches of exercise and futility.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  So the Trilateral Commission is putting a political photo out on Paul. You will see
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  demonization campaigns. All of this suddenly heat up.
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  Yes, but Paul is a strong man. He will resist that and he'll stay in at least until the
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  Republican convention and I hope he'll run as a third party.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  Oh, absolutely. That's the way to go, but he's not going to do that for some reason.
[16:58.000 --> 17:06.000]  Well, maybe he will allow himself to be persuaded until the convention would be not
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  politically safe. I'm not nominated. If you don't vote for me, the convention, I'm going
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  to run as a third party.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  He should have announced that at his peak as I look at all the graphs in late January.
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.000]  I mean, my God, we had total destiny in our hands, but Ron Paul's advisors, I have to say,
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  are very old school and I don't think I'm a 21st century, but Say La Vie, he's a great
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  man and we appreciate the work he's done. It shows they're afraid.
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  Jim Tucker, they also, according to your sources, are very upset that our taxes aren't 75, 80%
[17:37.000 --> 17:43.000]  and that's back on, I guess, the agenda to make sure we pay all of our money into, I guess,
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  taxes of one form or another to pay off the debt on what the bankers have run up.
[17:48.000 --> 18:03.000]  Oh, yes, they've, let's see, scanning even as we speak. Well, they're saying as far as
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  the title title, U.S. Smart and Domestic Policy, brought out outlines for a new administration
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  that was presided over by a journalist named David Gerkin who will write nothing about
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  this in his magazine, U.S. News and World Report.
[18:19.000 --> 18:29.000]  And the conclusion was Americans simply don't pay enough of their fair share.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  We should pay our rears and the UN dues to allow as many immigrants in the United States
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  as want to come and provide amnesty for illegal aliens already here.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  But nothing was said about the American taxpayers paying one fourth of the UN's operating costs,
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.000]  one third of the peacekeeping missions overseas, but we should stop doing that right now.
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  And also we have a duty, it says here in your article at AmericanFreePress.net, we have a duty
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.000]  to intervene and pay off all the banks and give them unlimited money and pay taxes for that.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  Oh, yes, we should bail out the banks, but they didn't express much concern, if any,
[19:07.000 --> 19:13.000]  about the Americans who have hundreds of thousands of Americans whose homes are being foreclosed.
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  Now, it can be said it was stupid, in fact, to have a Bilderberg meeting some years ago,
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  we had an advanced story on the financial crisis.
[19:22.000 --> 19:30.000]  And surely it could be said it was very stupid of a young couple to buy a house with not a nickel down.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  They told that you can only have to pay this much each month, that's just your interest,
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  not a bit of equity.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  And then six months or a year later, the interest rates multiplied by hundreds of dollars.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  That's right, the Bilderberg group said in 2006 they were going to pop the mortgage bubble.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  Jim Tucker, thank you so much for the time.
[19:49.000 --> 20:16.000]  You'll be reporting for us of course from Bilderberg.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[20:24.000 --> 20:32.000]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  Together we're coming straight on, straight on.
[24:47.000 --> 24:53.000]  Straight on for the New World Order, and they're scared.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  They know that we know they're the enemy.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  They first tried to deny they were setting up a world government.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  Now they admit it and try to claim it's benevolent and loving and good,
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  but we can see the fruits of everything they do.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  They're war criminals.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  They're combined.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  We'll be brought to justice.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Because humanity doesn't have a choice.
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  We're coming straight on.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  We're not listening to their propaganda.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  They're misdirection anymore.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  We've broken our conditioning.
[25:38.000 --> 25:49.000]  We see clearly.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  The New World Order knows their time is short.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  All right, later in the show, again, we have the condo manager friends with
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  Deborah Jean Palfrey, the murder DC madam joining us.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  That's going to be a radio first.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  He's going to be coming on with us.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  We've got Mike Rivera who's been working the case since the start,
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  popping into the next hour.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  James Whale making all the big British papers, getting fired over supporting
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  a candidate for mayor of London, his candidate won.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  He's been fired.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  That's your so-called free speech.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  Country where if you do one of a couple hundred things, you get arrested speech-wise.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  It didn't used to be like that, but it's no longer Jolly Old England.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's police state England.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  I'm going to explain this again because I get emails and message board comments
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  from people claiming to be cops calling me trash.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  You know, something I've been there at the hospital watching innocent families
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  have their babies kidnapped from them for no reason.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  I have seen the sheriff where I grew up, go to jail for shipping in the drugs.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  I already knew that and told people I had the cops threaten to kill me.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  I have witnessed thousands of videos of police beating people up and then charging them with assaulting them.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  I have had police demand to search my car without a warrant repeatedly
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  and then threaten me when I said no.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  I, on a three-mile stretch of road, three miles, saw nine cops this morning
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  radaring people.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  That's too many.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  There's too many of you.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  You're in our business too much.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  There's too many cameras.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  And I was thinking, it was running through my head, raising through my head
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  the thousands of things that make me mad at police.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  Like pulling up last year at my office and my IT guy pulled in to the office
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  and they said that that looks suspicious the way he pulled in to his workplace.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  They were behind him, thought he was running from him pulling in.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  No, he works here.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  And so his license was expired.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  They were putting him in the police car when I pull up
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  cops kind of bull up at first and they recognized me and started laughing
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  and saying how they've been watching me for all these years
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  and how one of them is retired in six months and he can't wait.
[28:04.000 --> 28:09.000]  And two senior cops, the woman cop is taking him to jail.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  And I said, if he was an illegal alien, you wouldn't arrest him.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  He said, you know, Alex, really you're right because we're encouraged not to
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  because the judge just lets him go or gives him a $50 fine.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  And that's really true and I don't like that.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  But I said, that's not a law, is it? He goes, no, but you know, it's
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  what else did he say? He was like, well, and quotas aren't a law, but we got to do it.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  He started laughing. He goes, that's why I'm glad I'm out of here in six months.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  The other guy's there, black guy, white guy, they're both laughing.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  I lean over to the car while she's driving off and I said, yeah, if he was an illegal alien,
[28:42.000 --> 28:48.000]  wouldn't he go into jail? And she got mad and pulled off.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  And don't deny you do that.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  Don't deny that's, you know, the cop who called me trash on my comment section
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.000]  on info wars today said, you know what, we've got too many things.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  You know, I'm too busy.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  Wasn't even part of the conversation.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  He just said, I'm too busy to put up with this type of baloney.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  And we're too busy.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  Like, what does that even mean?
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  You're too busy writing tickets.
[29:18.000 --> 29:25.000]  You should be arresting reckless drivers and red light runners.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  Not, look, here's the deal.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  Police didn't use to give you a ticket when you're five miles over.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  They do now.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  That's what I mean, the squeezing, the tightening.
[29:33.000 --> 29:40.000]  I mean, folks, I saw 12 cops on the way to work, nine on one road, nine.
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  It's infested with them.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  Hi, my name's Don Wiskinen.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  For over seven years, I've been telling people about Cardivite.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  Here's Dr. John Matz and a naturopathic doctor in his views on Cardivite.
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  I would like to thank you, Don, for making my job so much easier
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  because your products just make it so simple, right?
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  We can just put them on Cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them.
[30:17.000 --> 30:22.000]  And what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  That yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver heart.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  It also has metal chelating effect.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  And most of the other herbs in there are fine.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  The strength in the arteries, they help to neutralize free radicals.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program as you can get
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  as far as one supplement goes.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  It's working on the gut, it's working on the liver, it's working on the arteries.

[33:34.000 --> 33:42.000]  You weren't your mama's only boy but her favorite wanted scene.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  It's Willie Nelson.
[33:50.000 --> 34:01.000]  He's declared his eternal enmity against the New World Order on this radio show along with thousands of other prominent people.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  But we got somebody who likes the New World Order, an apologist for it.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  He is the former head of the Kissinger Group.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  He is one of the top people at the Carnegie operation that has shaped this wondrous world we all live in.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  And he wrote the last book, Running the World.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  He has his new book out bound to be a bestseller.
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  Super Class, the Global Power Elite and the world they're making all about the Boulderburg Group Trilateral Commission, CFR.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  And he is, of course, David Rothkoff.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  And we appreciate him coming on.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  He's kind of the new generation of Henry Kissinger prototypes.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  And we appreciate him spending time with us and I was talking to him in the break and I said,
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  I started talking.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  I said, hello, sir, thanks for coming on.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  He started laughing.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  And I said, oh, you know my views.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  He said, yeah, I know him.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  So we appreciate him coming on.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  My pleasure.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  So tell us all about the New World Order and about the Super Class and the people that run it all for us.
[35:06.000 --> 35:14.000]  Well, Super Class is looking at how power has changed in the modern world and how, you know, there have always been elites.
[35:14.000 --> 35:22.000]  But what's emerged in the past 20 or 30 years is an elite that operates on a global stage as opposed to a national stage.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  And obviously, when an elite's on a national stage, you've got this kind of umbrella of sovereignty laws and other things that can help
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  brain them in and give people a larger voice.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  But on the global stage, of course, you don't have that.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  You've got big companies that can play countries against each other.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  You've got small clusters of people who can influence how financial markets that might be regulated in a country operate beyond regulation on the global stage
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  and so on.
[35:48.000 --> 35:57.000]  So what the book's really looking at is how this shift is impacting our lives, whether it's diminishing the influence of nation states,
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  who's rising, who's falling, and tries to, you know, ask the question, what do you do about it?
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  So this is the model I saw in Think Tank Papers 25 years ago where we're going to give the slaves a choice of,
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  are we going to have a world government system that you have a stake in?
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  Or is it going to be a world government system that you don't have a stake in, but we end up with world government either way.
[36:21.000 --> 36:30.000]  And as you write in your book, we basically have these non-governmental organizations that are trained seals for the 6,000 Super Elite.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  So, I mean, I love how you guys engineer each crisis and then offer each new solution to the crises that were created by the global super vampires.
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  Well, I don't use the term super vampires and I don't refer to trained seals in the book.
[36:47.000 --> 36:59.000]  What I do try to do is look at what the trends are and ask the question, you know, what an average person like you or me ought to be doing about this.
[36:59.000 --> 37:08.000]  And, you know, from my point of view, I come from a real old school, not, you know, the kind of papers that you might have seen at a Think Tank at any point,
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  but from that old-fashioned school that says that the legitimacy of a government comes from the consent of the governed.
[37:14.000 --> 37:22.000]  And we've got lots of things going on on the global stage where decisions are being made that don't reflect in any way on the consent of the governed.
[37:22.000 --> 37:33.000]  But Mr. Rothkopf, I mean, you tell me, working at the, working at the, heading up Kissinger and Associates, what type of work you did?
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  It was a, Kissinger and Associates is a small consulting firm that advises companies on how they can build their business around the world.
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.000]  But we know that Kissinger is a big supergopher for David Rockefeller and other big interests.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  So, I mean, that's a very powerful position.
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.000]  I mean, you certainly count yourself amongst the 6,000 superclass, aren't you?
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  No.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  Anybody who's worried about how do you pay for your daughter's college education as me is not a member of the superclass.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  But it isn't about money, though.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Isn't it about the levers of power?
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  It is.
[38:07.000 --> 38:18.000]  But I mean, you know, I mean, the definition that I use for, you know, who's a member of the superclass is, the ability to influence millions of lives across borders on a regular basis.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  And I don't do that.
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  But I mean, you know, CEOs of big companies do, big financial executives do, people who run government do.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  Well, here's an example.
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  Here's an example.
[38:27.000 --> 38:43.000]  Dr. Kissinger wrote, as you know, in 73, State Department memorandum 200 saying that IMF and World Bank money to third world nations would be tied to population reductions, sterilizations, food wars, things like that.
[38:43.000 --> 38:53.000]  I mean, are you familiar with Dr. Kissinger's State Department memorandum 200 that was then taken on as U.S. foreign policy?
[38:53.000 --> 39:05.000]  I'm not familiar with that particular document, but, you know, I have in my last book and in other things taken a position that, you know, Kissinger did some things when he was Secretary of State National Security Advisor that were positive.
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  He also did some things that I didn't agree with.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  And, you know, I'm not out here either advocating what he's done or passing judgment on him.
[39:14.000 --> 39:30.000]  But the bottom line, we know that through globalism, which is just a, I would call it a modern manifestation of the British imperial system, not saying they even particularly run it today, but that same power behind the throne system of good old boys of regional roundtable groups,
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  as Dr. Carol Quigley at Georgetown said, I'm sure you're familiar with him.
[39:35.000 --> 39:44.000]  Now we're looking at this and you're right in your book. We're now under a global government. It's just a group of piratical corporations bigger than any one government having their way with us.
[39:44.000 --> 39:53.000]  But then the argument is being put forward by that very same consortium to have a even more powerful global government in the name of reigning themselves in.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  That's like somebody saying, please don't throw me in the briar patch. Your comments to that.
[39:57.000 --> 40:10.000]  Well, first of all, I don't advocate a global government at all. I do think that we could use some global governance. I don't think that the argument that financial elites make that somehow they should be allowed to operate on global stage without regulation makes sense.
[40:10.000 --> 40:26.000]  And we've seen in the past couple of weeks a situation where that system, that approach has run amok and that they then had the power to go to leaders in Washington and say, hey, bail us out at our investment bank while you're ignoring bailing people out
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.000]  who have mortgages at home. So I think that somehow you've got to get your regulatory arms around that.
[40:33.000 --> 40:52.000]  And I think you need to deal with a whole host of other transnational issues ranging from immigration to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to global trade in some way that reflects the will of people at large as opposed to leaving it to informal clusters
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  of super empowered people and institutions who are going to act in their self interest.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Okay. Well, here's an example of everybody else.
[40:59.000 --> 41:07.000]  Our mole got the entire list of attendees at the trilateral commission meeting a few days ago.
[41:07.000 --> 41:25.000]  NDC was able to get the whole list, what they talked about, what they did. There might even be a tape, but we'll see if that gets released. We just had Jim Tucker on a few minutes ago. And there they were saying the government must fully pay in to the banks and quote, bail them all out.
[41:25.000 --> 41:39.000]  Well, look, I mean, I mean, first of all, I don't know what happened at the trilateral commission meeting. I do know the trilateral commission has sort of been on hard times in the past few years. A lot of the people who were originally involved in that aged and it didn't replenish itself.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  Yeah, you say that on page 162 of Running the World.
[41:42.000 --> 41:55.000]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's kind of, you know, as a group that's kind of passed itself by date. But, you know, having said that, I also know that this recent meeting is an effort to try to bring some new blood into it and restore the process.
[41:55.000 --> 42:09.000]  You know, having said that, you know, look at the list you've got there and, you know, 60, 70% of the people in the room fall into the category of wonks rather than people who've got real power. So, you know, that's really a talking shop.
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  What would you call yourself? What would you call yourself?
[42:13.000 --> 42:30.000]  In what respect? I mean, you wouldn't call yourself a wonk? Yeah, probably. I mean, I'm writing books, I'm writing articles, I'm out there offering my opinion, but I don't have any ability to sort of, you know, move people in the direction of my opinion beyond, you know, whether I express it clearly or not.
[42:30.000 --> 42:48.000]  We know that the big think tanks and the big military industrial complex foundations are studying human activity, studying how we behave, engineering our society. I mean, that came out in the church hearings about the Carnegie Endowment for Peace that you're in.
[42:48.000 --> 43:05.000]  So, I mean, again, you guys all come across as real reasonable and friendly and everything's okay, but when I fair it into what, I mean, Richard in Haas, writing Club of Rome documents admitting global warming is fake, but saying that we need to use it to make humanity the enemy so the state can organize against humans.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  I mean, have you read that quote? No. Are your friends with Haas?
[43:10.000 --> 43:26.000]  No, I'm pretty friendly with Richard Haas, but I gotta tell you, that sounds ridiculous. I mean, you know, first of all, global warming isn't a fake, but secondly, you know, in whose interest would it be to engineer that? You know, who would benefit from that?
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  Why did Hitler want to kill everybody else but him and his people?
[43:30.000 --> 43:44.000]  Well, I mean, you know, the motives of that man. He got that from the West. He got that from the Carnegie's. He got that from the Rockefellers. You know, who funded eugenics, that is the main driving force of everything in our society?
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  Well, I mean, you can, I mean, again, I don't certainly.
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  Well, are you compartmentalized? Let's say maybe you don't know. I mean, what division are you, I mean, I've got your title here, but what do you do at Carnegie?
[43:54.000 --> 44:06.000]  I'm just a visiting scholar. I work on things like international economic issues. I work on things like America's role in the world. But, you know, what I do is I write books and I write articles. That's what I do.
[44:06.000 --> 44:19.000]  I wish I had the kind of influence that is normally ascribed to these groups, but most of the guys who work in think tanks are, you know, former this or former that or they're academics and they're trying to influence policy.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.000]  And, you know, all you have to do is listen to the political debate in the United States today and see what that debate's about to realize.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  They're, you know, pop, you know, policy types aren't having much influence on the debate at all.
[44:30.000 --> 44:40.000]  Okay, let me read this to you. This is Richard in Haas first published in the first global revolution, 1991, republished Club of Rome 93 just republished last year.
[44:40.000 --> 44:49.000]  In a report titled the first global revolution, Club of Rome, globalist think tank, we find the statement by Haas in searching for a new enemy to unanimous.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  We came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention. The real enemy then is humanity itself.
[45:01.000 --> 45:10.000]  What's going on to call for state sovereignty must be altered in a global error that a system of world government must be created and sovereignty eliminated in order to fight global warming.
[45:10.000 --> 45:18.000]  And it goes on and on. And you're saying I'm not for global government. I'm for global governance. That is a semantical trick.
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  I mean, I mean, well, I mean, you could, you could say that, but I mean, you know, take, take, take an issue, take an international issue.
[45:24.000 --> 45:31.000]  Um, you know, I mean, you got one has to acknowledge we live in an era where there are whole sorts of issues that are beyond the ability of individual nations to deal with.
[45:31.000 --> 45:43.000]  And so the question is, how do you deal with them? And if you don't want to have global governance, you don't want to have, you know, some kind of mechanisms that are actually connected somehow to the people who resolve these issues.
[45:43.000 --> 45:54.000]  And what I'm saying is, if there's a void, then the way it gets resolved is the competing self-interest of the most powerful people and companies and institutions.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  And that means there's very few people at the table and it's always going to be resolved in the direction of one self-interest or the other.
[46:00.000 --> 46:11.000]  And the vast majority of people who don't even figure in these conversations, the three billion people in the world who live in less than $2 a day, they're not anywhere in the conversation.
[46:11.000 --> 46:22.000]  And, you know, I mean, I just come from a school of thought that says, you know, everybody has a right to influence their own lives and we need mechanisms to do that.
[46:22.000 --> 46:31.000]  Just as we want them in our, on a national basis, we now live in an era where we need them on an international basis or we're going to leave it to the super empowered.
[46:31.000 --> 46:39.000]  Super class, the global power elite in the world they're making is a manifest over how the elite plan to shape the course of our planet
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  and impose a new world order while combating the inevitable global network of anti-globalists.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  This is Paul Watson writing for infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[46:49.000 --> 46:55.000]  The author of the book, David J. Rothkoff, is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
[46:55.000 --> 47:05.000]  This previously served as the deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade during the administration of Bill Clinton before he became managing director of Kissinger Associates in 1996.
[47:05.000 --> 47:15.000]  And he did an interview for Salon. You know, I have seen that you guys and gals are coming out of the woodwork now and are engaging the public and aren't denying everything now.
[47:15.000 --> 47:26.000]  Is that being done because your great work is now about to come to fruition or is that being done because you see massive resistance forming in every quarter across the planet?
[47:26.000 --> 47:35.000]  Well, look, I can't speak for why anybody else is doing anything. The reason I wrote this book was that I felt that there are a bunch of issues that need to be addressed that aren't being addressed.
[47:35.000 --> 47:46.000]  And that I feel that, you know, when I look out at the discussions about globalization, they tend to be taking place within elite forums in ways that end up serving elites.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  And that we would be better off if we had a broader discussion that brought more people to the table.
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  Now, you've repeated that seven times and that's basically you're like a pulsar. You just, you know, repeat, repeat, repeat.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  Well, it's possible that it's, you know, I mean, it is also possible. That's just my view, right?
[48:01.000 --> 48:08.000]  No, no, I understand that that's your view. But, you know, this Delphi technique of repeating the same thing over and over again.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  The globalist, the globalist.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  I'm trying to answer the question. You want to ask me a question about something else? I'm very happy to answer the question about something else.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  No, no, listen, we appreciate your time. I'm not trying to be mean here. I'm trying to understand something.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  I'm explaining the globalist, the crowd that has worked together.
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  And we've got Rockefeller speeches thanking you guys in basically one, you know, major direction.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  You fight about some things to set up global power by the corporations to amass all the power you can.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  And then now you say, oh, we've taken your regional and local control away.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  Come now, energize and support a world government so you get your power back.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  And then I look at how the UN operates. I look at everything else operates.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  You're talking about getting rid of the last levers I've got.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  Nationally, you're the crowd. The corporations always want to get rid of my sovereignty.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  And then now you're saying, oh, no, to stop them, you need to get rid of sovereignty.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  Well, I don't think I'm saying any of that.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  I do believe that we need to preserve national sovereignty.
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  I believe that nation states are going to be the fundamental building blocks of the global system for a long time to come.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  What I'm saying is that there are gaps in the system forming because there is so much global activity.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  And, you know, I mean, we've got two kinds of international organizations in the world, weak and dysfunctional.
[49:22.000 --> 49:31.000]  The UN, the IMF, the World Bank, all of these were cooked up 60, 70 years ago to respond to a post-World War II reality.
[49:31.000 --> 49:38.000]  And the countries that are most influential and the issues that are needed to be addressed are different from the ones that those organizations...
[49:38.000 --> 49:47.000]  And now John McCain and you and everybody else are calling for a new global system of, quote, these League of Democracies,
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  which I guess you can form and get rid of the bureaucracies in your image.
[49:51.000 --> 50:01.000]  But, I mean, that's always basically been the plan is to use the UN and NATO and other groups as building blocks in the new World Order system.
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.000]  Look, I think that there was a plan at the end of the Second World War to create international institutions
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  so that we didn't end up fighting the kind of wars that have been fought for the proceeding several hundred years
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  because the cost of modern warfare had grown too high.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  I think the issue now is what kind of institutions work best?
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  Should those institutions somehow disenfranchise nation states?
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  Of course not, because you need institutions that are as close as possible to people to reflect the interest of those people.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  But if you don't create the right kind of global institutions, what are you going to end up with?
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  You're going to end up with leaving it to the big guys.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  And that's not a good outcome either.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  I can't imagine it's one that you would support.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  Final segment with our guest straight ahead.
[50:46.000 --> 50:54.000]  We appreciate that David Rothkopf for joining us. We'll be right back.
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.000]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame,
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.

[51:48.000 --> 51:54.000]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  If you're shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea,
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[52:58.000 --> 53:03.000]  In the near future, earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  And America is making great progress toward a world government.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  That's their affidavit.

[53:53.000 --> 54:06.000]  Yeah, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, the head of the Human Genome Project, Dr. Watson.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  We have thousands of their quotes.
[54:09.000 --> 54:16.000]  Now they got to build a world government so they can carry out the big black op.
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  Then you talk to globalist and technocrats
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  and they'll tell you, point blank, I've had them walk up to me on the hiking bike trail.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  It'll be a retired U.S. Senator and Mr. Jones, you're wrong about what we're doing.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  You know, it's not run by one group. It's not one power structure.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  We don't all want the things you say.
[54:34.000 --> 54:40.000]  All I know is that what the Rand Corporation says happens.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  All I know is what these big commissions call for happens.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  All I know is I hear about the League of Democracies.
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  We're losing our freedoms. Pentagon-designed MIT control grids are going in
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  and the government calls it a control grid.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  Police are tasering and killing people every day.
[54:56.000 --> 55:05.000]  All I know is, Mr. Roth, would you say that this is all just happening because the state is growing out of control
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  or because there isn't order?
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  I mean, you're saying there are some power structures.
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  A, who are the different power blocks? How would you break it down?
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  And then B, what would your answer be to counter that?
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  Well, first of all, the way I broke it down was, you know, there was a book 50 years ago
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  written by a guy named C. Wright Mills called The Power Elite.
[55:24.000 --> 55:33.000]  It looked at how in the United States, political, military, academic, cultural, other kinds of power,
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  leadership tended to be kind of interlocking.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  Directorships, a lot of people knew each other and worked together and what the consequences of that were.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  And I said to myself, well, if I were going to go look at that kind of group today,
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  it's going to be on a global stage, not just on a national stage.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  And I thought I'd look at how it broke up.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  But, you know, I mean, look, I mean, you could look at political power structure in the United States
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  and you see fragmentation, you look at it on a global stage, there's more of it.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  You look at businesses and they have competing interests.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  Oil companies want something completely different from what alternative energy companies want.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  You look at it in media and again, they're competing interests.
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.000]  So, you know, to say that, you know, somehow there's a grand plan out there that that's, you know, being achieved.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  That's not the main problem.
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.000]  And frankly, if I were worried about people with too much power, what I'd be worried about is the reality more than the myth.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  And the reality is that very often people with a lot of power act in a self-interested way.
[56:27.000 --> 56:31.000]  And when those interests align, because they are so super empowered,
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  they tend to get their way more than average folks who don't have the ability to offset that.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  Well, we have thousands of quotes by top globalists saying,
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  the House of World Order will cost money and blood.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  We're going to kill anybody that gets in our way.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  I can read those if you'd like from, I mean, just incredible British lords, you name it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  And then we see everything they called for 80 years ago being built.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  And then now they're saying, oh, global government will stop us.
[56:55.000 --> 57:00.000]  You know, that will defeat us as they start hundreds of foundations, you know,
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.000]  and push them and run them and, you know, constantly drive for all of this.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  Well, who is the most powerful then?
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  You say we need this global system to stop these evil globalists.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  I mean, who is in power?
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  Who are the major power brokers right now?
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  What depends on what you're talking about.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  If you're talking about international finance, there are 50 institutions that have 48.5 trillion dollars.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  And those institutions, thus, you know, control about a third of all assets.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  If you're looking at companies, there are 250 companies that have annual sales
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  that are roughly a third of global GDP.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  So clearly when you've got more assets, you've got the ability to determine how those assets are allocated.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  But it's all interlocking. It's all interlocking. I mean, the Rockefellers...
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  It is interlocking. You're right about that.
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.000]  The Rockefellers are about to fire Rex Tillerson because he won't go along with the global tax scheme. Go ahead.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  Well, first of all, they're not going to fire him because they don't have enough power to do it.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  But the point is, it is interlocking. It's just not all interlocking.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  There are a lot of self-interested groups acting in competition with each other out there.
[58:02.000 --> 58:07.000]  Now, you've got me wrong if you think I've written a book or I'm arguing for global government.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  What I'm arguing for is a bigger say for the people in an area where right now,
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  most of the decisions are being made by a handful of people.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  Well, look, I agree with you that it's already being made outside of our power.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.000]  But do I want to give those same bankers and industrialists now a global governmental mechanism
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  with nice men in black uniforms who enforce globally?
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with our guests and let them answer that question.
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  Most people have no idea they're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[59:27.000 --> 59:53.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  David J. Rothkopf is our guest.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  The new book is out in stores.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Get it, read it, analyze it.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Superclass, the global power elite and the world they are making.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  We've got him for about four more minutes. We appreciate him spending time with us.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I've just got one more question in the seren.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Then you can make whatever key points you want that you haven't been able to make.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  And that's this.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  And I know they're all interlocking, and I understand they're not totally monolithic,
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  but power wants more power. Bureaucracy wants more power.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  I know there's competing interests, but they're all going in the same direction.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  They're like a pack of wolves.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  I mean, they all want to eat deer.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  They may fight with each other occasionally.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  They may have different color pelts, whatever.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  But they're all going in the same direction here.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  And that is, what's more powerful?
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Grove.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I know Council on Fine Relations is just a British roundtable regional group.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  But, I mean, overall with those structures, what would you call more preeminent, more powerful?
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Is Davos now more powerful?
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  I mean, what would you, I mean, today, what's the most powerful?
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Well, I think the most influential is going to end up being the biggest,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  because it's got more people there, and so if a consensus is formed,
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  or sort of a common view evolves, it's going to reach more people.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  And so my sense is, you know, probably Davos, the world economic form,
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  is more influential than these other ones that you're talking about.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Having said that, Davos is mostly a bunch of people going around,
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  giving speeches and not much really interesting happening.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  And I think what it does do is it helps set the agenda.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  It helps influence the discussion.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  And I think the greatest power that a group like this has is this kind of agenda-setting ability.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And, you know, I got back to Davos.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Yeah, they said consensus is there and get the flavor and the tone and the direction.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Yeah, they do.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  I got back from Davos one year or two ago, and somebody said, what happened there?
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And I said, I came to conclusion, you know, Davos is the factory
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  where global conventional wisdom is manufactured.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  They're not making decisions.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  What are you going to do with the web?
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  In your book, you talk about a new internet phasing out the old one.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Well, look, I mean, the web is great in the sense that it empowers people.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  It, you know, it's led to all sorts of grassroots movements
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  that enables people to go and create information and share it
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  in a way that only the rich and powerful could have done before.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Like I said that, if you take Microsoft, Google, AOL, Yahoo, you know, in MySpace,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  they can, you know, those big corporations are responsible for 96% of the internet
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  access in the United States.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  So it has made some people very rich and powerful.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  It has also empowered a lot of people.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Oh, so what needs to happen?
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  An internet too with other corporations and institutions,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  and then you'll sign on to it and have a subdomain internet too?
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  No, no, I don't even know what an internet too is.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  I think that the empowering qualities of the internet are wonderful.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  So what are you calling for with the net?
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  I'm not calling for anything.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  I don't have any agenda as far as the net goes.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Well, I got some quotes here.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  I don't have time to dig them out, but I mean, you do,
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  your book doesn't have anything about the internet or, or...
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  No, it talks about how the internet has created some, you know,
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  members of the superclass and it has talked about the power of the internet
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  to, you know, to help democratize...
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  But you say something about domain names and the UN.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Well, I do talk a little bit about ICANN, which is a,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  one of these sort of very, very, very narrow global governance mechanism
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  that helps assign domain names that has worked better than some other,
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  you know, groups like the UN.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  So, you know, the point is, I believe that globalization is not a reversible trend.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  I believe that, you know, there's never going to be a referendum
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  in which we sort of vote against it.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  It's a historical trend that's a continuation of the Industrial Revolution.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  And so, the consequence from, from my perspective is, what do you do about that?
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  Well, you know what?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  You know what?
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I want to just keep you for one more minute past the break
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  for our internet audience, John.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  So, keep him on with me.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Four folks listening on the web.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  We're just going to skip one minute of this break,
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  because I wanted to ask you about what are these steps that are anti-anti-globalist?
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  I mean, you talk in the book about, you know,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  trying to control and deal with the anti-globalist.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  What's that mean?
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Sir?
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Yeah.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I mean, you, in your book, you talk about dealing with anti-globalist.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  How are you going to do that?
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  With the anti-globalist?
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Well, I mean, you know, I'm talking about Hugo Chavez
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  They get closer and closer,
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[1:07:48.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  Protect your family.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I am here and I am back live.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  I was just, you like that?
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  I opened up the studio door and started screaming so that I'll be on air.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  I forgot that that was a short segment,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  a short break coming back as I was talking to the globalist guest that we had,
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  David Rothkopf, on.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  And then I ran out for a one minute break and came back a bit late there.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Let me just finish my comments on him and then we will go to Mike Rivera, our next esteemed guest.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  I talked to him during the break and just made the point that,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  okay, well, in your book you talk about these anti-globalist groups and how they have to be dealt with.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And he said, yeah, they're Ahmed Denizide and they're people like the Venezuelan president.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  They have to be dealt with.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  These super nationalists.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Everything they do has meant to sound so reasonable, so, so nice, so, so friendly, so good.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  You know, it's just reasonable.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Don't you want to say, and I've seen UN white papers and others that have been published where they said a decade ago,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  15 years ago, 20 years ago, different organizations have the same thing.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  We have to give people a false choice.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They know there's a global government now.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  They know the global corporations are controlling and we have to give them a choice.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  A false choice of a democratized world government that's us getting energized behind it
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  and supporting it and having kangaroo meetings and votes that don't matter.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Or you can just let the global corporations do whatever they want and act however they want
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  because they've already achieved global governance.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  They're just rogue pirates doing what they want.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  No, we use nation states to prosecute them, to go after them,
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  and pretty soon they would quit doing what they were doing and the people took their nations over.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  It's kind of like in your state, you know, one jurisdiction's got bad cops and other jurisdiction has good cops.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Do you want to get rid of all the jurisdictions?
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  I mean, like, I stay out of Williamson County because I've just seen too many horror stories,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  too many bad things happen, too many...
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  I'm not saying all their police are bad, but I mean, it's legendary.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  They arrest you like two days after your videotapes are late to blockbuster.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  I mean, it's any way to get you.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I mean, it's... I've been to court there, I've covered it, I've watched it.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  I mean, it's boss hog on steroids.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Do I want them to be able to come down here?
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  I hardly go fishing on Lake Travis because LCRA are just complete total psychopathic maniacs.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  And they're a private organization, they surveil all of Austin.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  They have cameras up all over Austin.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  I know some of their former security people.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  They're involved in all sorts of corruption that's in the news all the time.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  They do whatever they want, when they want how they want.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  It's literally a private mafia organization.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  And I'm strongly considering never going on Lake Travis again.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  The problem is there's less and less places I can go.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Not that I'm doing anything wrong.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  I don't go to dangerous parts of East Austin where there are well-known MS-13 and Crips and Bloods.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They have their own local Austin names, but it's the same deal.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  You know, just like I don't go around dangerous street gangs.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  I want to be able to go to another country if the U.S. completely falls.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  The problem is it's global.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Standardized police brainwashing, standardized brainwash public, standardized control.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  I mean, that's what the globalist pushed for.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Standardized taxation, standardized regulation.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  They take your blood for 30-plus years in every major western country.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  That was an international agreement, international DNA database.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  They use it for bio weapons.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  They use it to frame people.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  They use it in claiming whatever they isolate the compounds or DNA or proteins.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  The government and the private corporations they give it to claim ownership.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  People start suing as they learn, mainly through this show.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  The last decade that's going on, Bush gets a bill passed and signs it this week.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Last week saying, we take your DNA and blood for criminal databases.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  All babies are criminals.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I mean, that isn't freedom.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Sucking blood out of babies.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Keeping it in government databases.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  The government's rogue.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  The government's corrupt.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  The government's out of control.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  You're illegitimate.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  We certainly don't want a global government set up to, quote, keep us safe from the globalist.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  We have this outdated global order system set up by the bankers.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And so now we need a total world government that will be run by the people with the same bankers pushing for all of it.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Just like the Federal Reserve engineers, the latest collapse and consolidation writes off all of its debt that it bought real assets with and then positioned into safe controlled areas.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Then their answer is give us total government power, abolish three federal agencies that regulate us and make us complete rulers of the United States.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Have you read the proposal?
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  They engineer it and then, oh, they get even more power.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  I had a cop.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  Like I said, I've got it here in the stack.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I'm going to read it later.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Comment, you know, Alex, you're trash and we're just trying to do our job and you make everything up and you're just a piece of garbage.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Well, last time I checked, there have been hundreds of thousands of convictions just in the last 20 years of police for dealing drugs, running whores, raping children, everything else.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Does that mean all cops do it?
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  No.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  But it's not a few bad apples.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  The government reaches in and throws out the good apples and then kisses and loves the worm-eaten apples and dumps worms in the bucket.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I mean, have you seen the kind of stuff that goes on?
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Have you seen how you've been brainwashed?
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  You understand that I shouldn't see nine cops in three miles writing tickets?
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  You understand that they plan to double and triple again the number of cops and they now snatch your kid if you're three-year-olds in a fenced backyard playing and you're watching them out the window.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  The scumbag neighbors call the police on you because we are a Nazi-stazzy degenerate society trained as tattle and the cops come and take your kid.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Did you know I know well-to-do middle-class people whose kid falls off of monkey bars and breaks their finger?
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  That matter if they have witnesses, the CPS comes and takes their kid.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  The government's unreasonable.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It's out of control.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  It violates the law all the time.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  I have been to court and seen police lie.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  I saw them beat up Oza Motley, the jazz slash alternative band, for no reason, on video and then lie in court and say they attack police.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  I mean, the cops lie now when there's video of it.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  Take the guy in Houston, the CIA guy they gunned down.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  The family's now suing for civil rights violation.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  They pull him over.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  He gets spooked for some reason, drives off, not on a high-speed chase, waits for other cops to get there, gets out with his hands at his side.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  The cop shoots him one time in the back.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  He falls down.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  The cop's manhandling, putting him in handcuffs as blood runs out and they stand around acting all pumped up.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  You can see one of them doing a pumped up deal, making his fist.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  I mean, getting off on killing somebody.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I'm not here, meatball, so you can go out and hunt man.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Last night, I couldn't sleep and I was exhausted.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  I'm about to go to you, Mike.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I want to make this point where I'm going to hold you over if you can.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Last night, I laid in bed.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  I got in bed about 10.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  I was exhausted, but I couldn't go to sleep till about one.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  And I thought about my son, my daughters.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  I thought about how they got to grow up and be pulled over by people like you.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  I thought about how their future's gone.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  I thought about how there's going to be 10 million cops and bureaucrats and tattletales and spies.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  And I was just sick.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  I was sick.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  I was sick.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  And then I got up and watched the latest info on Cedric Benson, the UT football player.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Turns out the police report according to all the witnesses and his lawyer and everybody else, as usual, is a lie.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  There were more than 50 boats in Devil's Cove.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  They pull up to his.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  He's blown the lake twice since he bought this boat a year ago and he's been pulled over both times.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  So that's the freedom.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Quote randomly.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  It's like the airport on the lake.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Just we're going to search you.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  And they got on board and the cops said that he smart mouthed him a little.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  And the lawyer said, yeah, he just said, why are you pulling me over every time I'm out here?
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  They were at anchor in the Cove drinking beer.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  And they said, come over to the boat with us.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  And then in front of witnesses and the police admit this, they kicked his legs out from under him when he argued.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  By the way, you know what he said? He said, hey, we're at anchor. I can have somebody else drive.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  If you think I'm drunk, they kicked his legs out from under him and then pepper spread him in the face.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  And he was smart enough.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  But, you know, he cried and didn't cry because he was a wimp.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  I know it's real funny.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  He's not doing good on the bears.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  So he deserves to, you know, he cried because he knew he's a slave and he knew that his life is always going to be like this.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  And he's always got to let lesser men.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And by the way, the cop as usual said, I was intimidated by his size.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  I had to take control of the situation.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  It's like when that other retired football player got out of his car, not one of the gangbanger types, no criminal record.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  He was in Georgia.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And the cop said in the report that he was intimidated.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  You can see it, the guy gets out and he's like, yes, sir, officer.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  He's being real nice because he knows people are intimidated by him.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Big black and these are big white guys.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  They're nothing compared to this guy.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  I mean, these are big white guys, probably six foot one.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  This guy's like six foot six, 350 pounds and they're only 250. They're intimidated.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  And so he gets out and they step back and they put their hands in and he puts his hands together.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  He says, please, come on.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  And the guy says, don't you make a fist at me?
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  And he goes, I'm not.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  He has his hands together begging me.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  So the cop shoves him and the black guy steps back and tries to run because he's got the taser out and they taser him in the back.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  And then the news says he's bad.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  Mike Rivera, I appreciate you holding for five minutes while I was ranting about that.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  It's just that then this morning I was driving to work and on three miles, I started when I saw the first one, I count them is what I do nine.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  I saw three police cars and six motorcycle cops.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Then I saw three more on the, on the rest of the way to work another four miles or so.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  But I mean, I literally started getting nauseated, freaked out.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  They were pulling up beside me.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  They were everywhere.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  I just, I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Do you have any comments?
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Well, yeah, we have pretty much the same thing happening here in Hawaii recently.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  The state legislature put our speeding fines, you know, way, way up there.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  It used to be, you know, like 20, 30, 40 bucks.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  Now it's $150, $200 for speeding.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  And inevitably, of course, you know, the cops are lined up on the roads with their radar guns and everything.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  And it's basically it's a form of pillaging the people because, you know, the traffic is the traffic, you know, here in Hawaii.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  And they're pulling people over for being just a mile or two above the limit.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  There's no more little five mile an hour gracing.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  It's just a money making opportunity because tax revenues are in decline because the economy is in decline.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Property taxes are in decline.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  And they're hiring more cops.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  Stay there, Mike Rivera.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  He'll be with us into the next hour.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Mike, we really appreciate you.

[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  They're not after money.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  They're after power.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  That's their affidavit.

[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:53.400]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:58.100]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[1:22:58.100 --> 1:23:03.400]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.400]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:09.400]  protect a complete fuel system treatment,
[1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:14.700]  cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:19.400]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:23.200]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:28.700]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:31.200]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:33.500]  Call triple-8, use SFR-1.
[1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:40.700]  That number again is triple-8, use SFR-1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[1:23:40.700 --> 1:23:42.800]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:53.800]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:59.100]  Yeah, I just finished up the point I was thinking about Cedric Benson.
[1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:00.600]  You know, they started decades ago.
[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:04.600]  We do a safety check to make sure you've got your life vest.
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:05.800]  That sounds reasonable.
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:08.600]  Not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:14.000]  Because in a free society, you're not supposed to have people in your business, in your life, always stopping you.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.300]  You're the citizen, you're the boss, not you, the government.
[1:24:17.300 --> 1:24:19.200]  But see, that's how it starts. They just go boat to boat.
[1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:20.900]  Oh, it's Cedric Benson.
[1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:23.600]  We're going to have our way with you now.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.100]  Oh, you refuse to put a breathalyzer in your mouth. We're going to torture you.
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:30.900]  I know I'm off on the police. It's really starting to get to me.
[1:24:30.900 --> 1:24:33.400]  And then how they don't see that this isn't freedom.
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.600]  They're just hiring more and more and more.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:41.900]  And we're going to get into Deborah Jean Palfrey, her friend who said that she said that they had a contract out.
[1:24:41.900 --> 1:24:46.400]  Owner's going to be joining us and Mike's going to be co-interviewing her with me.
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:50.700]  But getting back to this about the police, you know, our oil costs are going up.
[1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.600]  All our prices are food prices.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:55.700]  And what do they have? They've now doubled the cops the last 10 years.
[1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:56.600]  They're just everywhere.
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.100]  So they're going to really squeeze.
[1:24:58.100 --> 1:25:01.400]  I mean, I guess this is a full court precedent, Mike.
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:09.100]  Yeah, it absolutely is. And it's all about repression. And one of the alarming tendencies we're seeing is the police forces are hiring up.
[1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:12.900]  They specifically are recruiting from among the veterans returning from Iraq.
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:20.200]  So we're getting these guys who have been trained to basically just crush the population down and, you know, keep them in their place.
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:21.500]  They're joining the police force.
[1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:28.200]  And nobody's really spending any time or money trying to convince them that maybe they're supposed to behave a little bit differently here in the United States.
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:38.100]  So, you know, I think one of the most alarming things that happened this last week is the manufacturer of the tasers that have been sort of at the forefront of this police pain compliance thinking
[1:25:38.100 --> 1:25:47.500]  has gone to court and succeeded in getting a judge to order medical examiners to no longer blame tasers for the death of people being arrested.
[1:25:47.500 --> 1:25:51.100]  That's right. In one county, three people died in one year.
[1:25:51.100 --> 1:26:00.500]  And so they picked that case with a judge for some reason that then he would be playing and go along. And then now the judges, I guess when a cop shoots you,
[1:26:00.500 --> 1:26:06.700]  they'll have the, now they'll order the doctors, not to say you died by a gunshot wound, huh, Mike?
[1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:19.500]  Well, it does seem extremely absurd. They came up with some kind of phrase, hysterical over exuberance or something to basically make it look like it's your own fault when you die after running a bunch of electricity through your heart.
[1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:27.900]  And of course, it led a lot of police who had been facing manslaughter charges there now off the hook. And of course, nobody can sue the taser manufacturers anymore.
[1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:35.500]  Yeah, that's why people die, folks, when you get electrocuted is the heart is electrochemical and it messes up its beats.
[1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:43.500]  Yeah, it doesn't take very much electricity at all going through the heart to make it stop beating. And that's how death from electrocution happens.
[1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:52.500]  And these tasers, they're pouring all this current into your body. It goes through your chest. You know, it's designed to basically hit the nervous system and knock you down.
[1:26:52.500 --> 1:27:03.500]  People are dying from it. And rather than raise the question about whether this is something that should be used on the American people, the courts are now saying, you know, we will make sure that tasers are never blamed.
[1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:06.500]  You will have no recourse. You cannot sue the taser manufacturer.
[1:27:06.500 --> 1:27:11.500]  And by the way, taser announced last year they're going to radically increase the power. Go ahead.
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:19.500]  Yeah, absolutely. And not only are they increasing the power, they're increasing the range. And you know, again, the police just say I was intimidated by the person's actions.
[1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:31.500]  And I got to tell you, I saw that video of that gentleman who got gunned down by the Houston police department. There was no question that officer just walked up and shot the guy and put him down on the ground.
[1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:32.500]  There was no question that.
[1:27:32.500 --> 1:27:43.500]  Then they roughly jump on him with a bullet hole in blood. They were wanting to die. It was a hit, folks. The evidence is overwhelming. And then put handcuffs on him. They wanted, I mean, did you see that?
[1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:47.500]  And they said, well, we couldn't give him mouth to mouth. We didn't have our plastic gloves.
[1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:56.500]  Yeah, it really was extreme nonsense, but there's no question in my mind from the way, just looking at the way the officer just runs up, shoots him and then immediately leaves.
[1:27:56.500 --> 1:28:02.500]  There was no, absolutely no indication of saying, you know, put your hands up where we can take. The guy was just getting out of the car.
[1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:06.500]  Well, it looks like a hit. It looks like a hit to me.
[1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:16.500]  Oh, absolutely. I agree with you. I mean, we're seeing a lot of this wet work. We had that gentleman with the Palestinian Charity was sliced up, duct taped, tied and thrown in a lake.
[1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:20.500]  And they declared it suicide. I mean, come on, you know.
[1:28:20.500 --> 1:28:27.500]  Well, they've always, they've always had hit teams on departments, but the way the news lied and said he went for something clearly on video.
[1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  He goes, he wanted police around him. Somebody pulled him over. He was scared. He left the scene and then they don't make it about how they gun him down the back.
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:43.500]  It didn't give him aid. It became an issue of, was he really CIA? And then I went and did a Google search. It was all over the news. It was confirmed he was CIA.
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:51.500]  Absolutely. He was confirmed he was CIA. He was contacting. He was trying to call the FBI. So he knew somebody was, was had a hit out on him.
[1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:57.500]  And he was trying to basically get to a place of safety. And he thought if he had a bunch of police officers around him, nobody could do anything.
[1:28:57.500 --> 1:29:06.500]  But you know, Lee Oswald thought exactly the same thing at the Texas Theater. And, you know, and then down in the basement of the Dallas Police Department, he was assassinated anyway to silence him.
[1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:10.500]  And they let, they let Jack Ruby in the back door. That's admitted.
[1:29:10.500 --> 1:29:19.500]  Yeah, absolutely. They did. And, you know, there's a little wrinkle about that. Most people don't know that the officer who was in charge of Kennedy's security in Dallas became Chief of Police of Dallas.
[1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:27.500]  The cop who was accused of letting Ruby into the basement became Chief of Police of Midlobium. So how's that for performance enhancements or performance?
[1:29:27.500 --> 1:29:35.500]  Well, they've always used, they've always used cops as your hit men. I mean, most of the time in the U.S., it's a local hit team they hire because they need to be able to cover it up.
[1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:40.500]  That's how you pay the police. That's a tax to them is that they get to do the hits.
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:30:09.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:24.500]  Other countries are already buying all our food they can get at any price. Farm organizations are trying to stop greedy commodity investors from buying up all our food.
[1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:49.500]  Grocery stores are rationing flour, rice, cooking oil and so on to be corn. Storeable apples are almost impossible to find.

[1:32:49.500 --> 1:33:00.500]  Art Lake Towers says he spent a lot of time talking with Paul Free on Monday as she packed up to heads who are her mothers. Now he claims that she did not at all seem suicidal.
[1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:19.500]  Deborah Jean Paul Free has many ties to Central Florida. For the past 12 years she's owned a condo at Park Lake Towers. The building manager who asked us not to show his face talked with Paul Free Monday before she left for her mothers in Tarpon Springs. He strongly believes Paul Free's death was not a suicide.
[1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:33.500]  Jean Paul Free was a class act. She wore very good clothes. She was very well educated. Her way out of this earth certainly wouldn't have been in an aluminum shed attached to a mobile home in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
[1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:47.500]  Paul Free was convicted of running a high profile escort service for Washington's elite and faced many years in prison. But she was found hanged yesterday at her mother's home and investigators say they have no doubt it was a suicide.
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:53.500]  A couple handwritten notes, at least more than one handwritten note was discovered inside the residence indicating her intent of taking her life.
[1:33:53.500 --> 1:34:04.500]  But her building manager says Paul Free often told him she believed she was being followed. And he thinks there may have been some former clients of her escort service who wanted her dead.
[1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:10.500]  She insinuated there was a contract out for her. So I fully believe they succeeded.
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:23.500]  Paul Free's Lexis is still parked in the Parklake garage and the staff says on Monday she asked them about making sure her condo fees continued to be paid during what Paul Free anticipated would be six years in prison.
[1:34:23.500 --> 1:34:27.500]  They say she left that day with some suitcases and a box.
[1:34:27.500 --> 1:34:43.500]  She had one file box, white paper file box that she told me had her some important papers with her. And she just kind of raised her eyebrow like, oh yeah, you're supposed to think that's all her information on her business that she had in Washington.
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:35:00.500]  Now it is estimated that Paul Free's phone records contained the phone numbers of 10,000 to 15,000 clients who used her services during the 13 years that she was in business. She's never denied running an escort service, but she did deny having knowledge that any illegal sexual activity was.
[1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:16.500]  So that's part of the NBC newscast on this there in Florida and I really appreciate Joseph Streisak joining us. Mike Rivera talk show host weeknights here on Genesis is co hosting with us for this hour and some into the next hour.
[1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:24.500]  Mr Streisak, I appreciate your courage in going public and putting out your name and everything. Why are you now doing that?
[1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:38.500]  Well, it's mainly because we're having contacted from so many different locations, so many different people locally. I've had calls from overseas, San Francisco.
[1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:52.500]  Basically, when you talk to a woman on a Monday and she's dead on Thursday, it's a little bit, you know, unnerving. And I think people, I feel sorry for her mother and her family.
[1:35:52.500 --> 1:36:11.500]  Well, we appreciate your courage. Can you specifically and expand on it if you can any details when on Monday she told you she thought that there was a contract on her thought she was being followed specifically when and where and what did she say please go back in your memory think as hard as you can.
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:40.500]  Well, she was I watched her in the morning after 9am, go several times to a vehicle out in the parking lot, which was not her vehicle. It was a rental. And on her last bop down the stairs, I ran into her and I we started talking and then we proceeded to walk outside and we sat down on a bench and she started telling me about why she was there and
[1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:57.500]  that she was going to her mother's and things that had happened. She had gotten a lot of rest. She said at the Park Lake Terrace because simply we have a very high surveillance system in the building where we can watch what's going on and she felt very safe.
[1:36:57.500 --> 1:37:13.500]  And then she proceeded to tell me about different times she'd be on the outer belts in Washington driving around and cars would be following her and she would then have to get off and lose them and get back on and continue on her ways.
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:35.500]  So she felt very safe here. We're a very, very safe building and she was very happy for having a rest. But she also she told me about her probably going into jail and how she felt that they were down to about six years and negotiations on it and that she worried for her mother.
[1:37:35.500 --> 1:37:49.500]  And she was going to try and talk her mother into moving into Park Lake Towers while she was in jail and how she would take care of the association dues while she was in jail.
[1:37:49.500 --> 1:38:01.500]  And although they had been being paid from a bank through automatic depositing, I'm sure she wanted to make sure that the place was being kept up while her mother was living here.
[1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:10.500]  I don't know if she ever proceeded to tell her mother her wishes, but I know that's one one thing she was very adamant about was getting her mother to move here from Tarpon Springs.
[1:38:10.500 --> 1:38:19.500]  So now I'm doing a go ahead. No, no, sorry. Go ahead. I was just going to ask about the specifics of thinking a contract was out on her.
[1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:31.500]  Well, she taught me she feared for her life. And that's how we proceeded to talk about her being followed about the safety of the building here.
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:38.500]  So she didn't have to worry about that. And she didn't say contract out for a life. She just told me she feared for her life.
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:41.500]  And that she thought that she was being followed.
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:52.500]  Oh, yes, she said definitely she anything else that she said or any other details. It's so important.
[1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:59.500]  She did talk about, you know, who her true friends were and how she thought some people were friends and they were not.
[1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:04.500]  And I think she had a little bit of paranoia.
[1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:14.500]  I think she was very hesitant making friends with anyone right now. I don't think she trusted anyone except her mother.
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:23.500]  I'm sure she she really well, I'm thinking about her being a very ladylike, very nice person, very, very meticulous about being clean and well dressed.
[1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:28.500]  I don't think any woman would go murder herself, go kill herself at her mother's house.
[1:39:28.500 --> 1:39:34.500]  And as you said, do it in a dirty shed. I mean, I mean, this stinks to my heaven and she told others.
[1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:39.500]  She told me off air. I said, I said, listen, you need to go on air and say you're never going to kill yourself.
[1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:45.500]  And she said, that's silly. I'll never do that. If I die, I was murdered. But then on air, she said, I'll never kill myself.
[1:39:45.500 --> 1:39:50.500]  But I mean, she told me she'd never kill herself. She told her family that the news that said she was an only child.
[1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:53.500]  She did have a sister. Her sister said she never talked like that.
[1:39:53.500 --> 1:40:03.500]  Her mother said she was in a good mood despite everything and was talking about an appeal, was talking about writing a book, was talking about how she was going to deal with prison.
[1:40:03.500 --> 1:40:14.500]  And then this guy pops up out of nowhere who helps cover stuff up on the on the Bobby Kennedy killing who pops up as an apologist just says, oh, I don't have a tape of it.
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:18.500]  But she said she was going to kill herself. I want to bring Mike Rivera in here.
[1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:24.500]  Mike, do you have any questions for the building manager who was friends with Miss Palfrey?
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:31.500]  Well, I don't have so many questions. I'm certainly glad that you have the courage to speak out and fill in some of the missing pieces here,
[1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:39.500]  because my first comment in listening to your description about her going around and making all these preparations and making sure things were going to be paid and the rest of it.
[1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:50.500]  These are inconsistent with the profile of somebody who is seriously considering ending her own life, because there are behavior patterns that are associated with being a suicidal person.
[1:40:50.500 --> 1:41:00.500]  And this is inconsistent with it. And just the idea of taking a lot of her belongings to her mother for a visit is also inconsistent.
[1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:05.500]  Why is she going to pack a suitcase if she knows she's not going to be needing all of that stuff?
[1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:11.500]  Of course, my question is, where did that box of papers go? But obviously, that's down at the mothers right now, and you wouldn't know anything about it.
[1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:18.500]  I also saw a report early on that the mother thought somebody had broken into her house, but now we never heard anything about that, and we can't get a hold of her.
[1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:25.500]  Yeah. You know, that's the inconsistencies here that I question, too.
[1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:38.500]  I would talk about every couple months to her. She would call and find out how things were doing here, whether she would be getting prepared to make a trip to Orlando, and she would tell me, you know, I'm coming in on Friday.
[1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:44.500]  Is there going to be someone around? Because my car may need jumps, because her battery was going low quite a few times.
[1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:56.500]  So other than, you know, just to talk to Jean all the time, you definitely would know she was not the type of person to take her life. Period.
[1:41:56.500 --> 1:41:59.500]  She just is not that type.
[1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:04.500]  What was the last thing she said to you? When was the last time you saw her? What did she say?
[1:42:04.500 --> 1:42:16.500]  That was a week ago, Monday, and she told me at that time she feared for her life and that she was happy to spend the night at Park Big Towers because she wasn't being watched.
[1:42:16.500 --> 1:42:24.500]  You know, Mike, this is amazing. You can say, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm fearing for my life. I feel safe here because of the surveillance security system.
[1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:35.500]  And then you magically kill yourself in a shed and then a suicide note pops up and somebody pops up to corroborate it who's been involved in all sorts of bizarre behavior.
[1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:41.500]  Well, frankly, the incident Dan Moldea showed up to start talking about how he knew that she was going to kill herself.
[1:42:41.500 --> 1:42:48.500]  That to me was the absolute clincher that we're dealing with a cover up here because Dan and I went head to head back on the Vince Foster case.
[1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:56.500]  And he still has a web page at his website specifically targeting me for the issues I raised in the Vince Foster assassination.
[1:42:56.500 --> 1:43:02.500]  So any doubts I may have had that this was a murder vanished as soon as Dan showed up?
[1:43:02.500 --> 1:43:15.500]  You know, whoever would have had anything to do with it was a very, very, very smart person because my only question was, how did the police,
[1:43:15.500 --> 1:43:22.500]  even though I know they were there, they have these two letters. In fact, I've got copies of them right now in front of me.
[1:43:22.500 --> 1:43:29.500]  How did they know it was a suicide? What made them say it was a suicide just because it looked like a suicide?
[1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:34.500]  They announced within minutes that it was a suicide. Well, let me tell you how this works.
[1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:41.500]  She gets out of the car. It was like in a weird park by an industrial area by itself.
[1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:46.500]  You take her in and hang her. That's their favorite way of doing it. Mike Rivera?
[1:43:46.500 --> 1:43:54.500]  Yeah, absolutely. There are so many inconsistencies with this. I mean, first of all, the notes themselves talk about her being penniless and alone.
[1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:59.500]  And that is obviously inconsistent with the idea that she had a book deal, potentially a movie deal.
[1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:06.500]  You know, the track record of Hollywood is they always make a big deal about these madams to the elite stories.
[1:44:06.500 --> 1:44:11.500]  Like the Happy Hooker and the Mayflower Madame. They always get book deals and TV shows and movies.
[1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:16.500]  So the reality is, and Palfrey was smart enough to know this, because she went to law school.
[1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:20.500]  You know, she would go to prison for maybe six years. She'd come out of prison.
[1:44:20.500 --> 1:44:25.500]  Probably a lot richer than us regular working stiffs who are out here in the free world working nine to five.
[1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:31.500]  So this idea that she was going to be penniless was absolutely nonsensical.
[1:44:31.500 --> 1:44:37.500]  We also saw the over the top zealousness to say she would have spent 50 years.
[1:44:37.500 --> 1:44:41.500]  She was depressed. Her life was over. It's clearly suicide.
[1:44:41.500 --> 1:44:46.500]  And within 30 minutes of it being announced, this guy's already contacted us and the article's already written.
[1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:51.500]  She told him she was going to do it. Ignore all these tapes and ignore her saying she was scared.
[1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:54.500]  She killed herself. Shut up. That's how it happened.
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:45:01.500]  Jean Palfrey was person with a sense of humor. And I wish I could find, I had a little post-it note.
[1:45:01.500 --> 1:45:04.500]  She set me one time and it was a...
[1:45:04.500 --> 1:45:09.500]  It was somebody by Spencer's or one of the gift stores.
[1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:14.500]  A hundred things to do with a dead cat. And one of the things in the upper left-hand corner, I remember looking at it,
[1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:19.500]  a cat that was hanging like it was strangled itself.
[1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:25.500]  And it says, I'm just hanging around waiting for you. And she had just wrote me some little note on it.
[1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:34.500]  And I just took that as being very ironic that she would have used that so many years ago and that's the way she died.
[1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:39.500]  And that it was already a pre-made package of cat jokes. That happened to be the one that she...
[1:45:39.500 --> 1:45:43.500]  Well, that's an omen and there's something real to those poor tens and omens in life.
[1:45:43.500 --> 1:45:48.500]  I've certainly learned that. Call it what you want and something goes on weird in the universe like that.
[1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:50.500]  This is just...
[1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:52.500]  Do you still have that post-it note?
[1:45:52.500 --> 1:45:53.500]  I was about to say.
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.500]  If I find it, I'm going to sell it on eBay.
[1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:59.500]  Will you send a scan to Alex and I?
[1:45:59.500 --> 1:46:01.500]  Sure will.
[1:46:01.500 --> 1:46:03.500]  Well, this is what I was going to say.
[1:46:03.500 --> 1:46:10.500]  I think I threw it out though, but you know, it was something that wasn't, you know, something...
[1:46:10.500 --> 1:46:15.500]  Well, the point we're trying to get to here is that if you have any examples of Palfrey's handwriting,
[1:46:15.500 --> 1:46:19.500]  I'm sure Alex Jones and myself would appreciate getting a scan of those...
[1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:20.500]  Oh, sure, certainly.
[1:46:20.500 --> 1:46:22.500] ...proposal comparison against the notes.
[1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:25.500]  Yes, I have many notes that she had sent me over the years.
[1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:28.500]  And I would certainly make those available to you.
[1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:30.500]  Okay, that would be wonderful.
[1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:33.500]  Well, I want to be clear here. Absolutely. This is a murder investigation.
[1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:35.500]  We're doing the real deal.
[1:46:35.500 --> 1:46:41.500]  And if during a break I can give you a fax number, you could blot out any personal info or anything like that, sir.
[1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:46.500]  But Mike actually works in Hollywood on big TV shows like Lost.
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:48.500]  He's an expert in special effects.
[1:46:48.500 --> 1:46:52.500]  He knows a lot of criminologists and forensics people that can look at it.
[1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:54.500]  If you'll get me a copy, I'll get it to Mike.
[1:46:54.500 --> 1:47:02.500]  In fact, Mike, if you can dig out your fax number, I'd be happy to have him just send it directly to you.
[1:47:02.500 --> 1:47:04.500]  Or would you rather me go with this?
[1:47:04.500 --> 1:47:09.500]  I would rather he fax it to you because we both need to get this out so it's defense in depth.
[1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:13.500]  But if you could then email a scan back to me, I would really appreciate that.
[1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:19.500]  Okay, because just the way the note is written is very, very suspicious, isn't it, Mike?
[1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:21.500]  Yeah, it is. It doesn't fit the profile of a suicide.
[1:47:21.500 --> 1:47:25.500]  It doesn't fit the palfrey that you and I both spoke to.
[1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:31.500]  And you know, I want to put one more wrinkle in here, and this even goes back to the Vince Foster investigation.
[1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:39.500]  The law in the United States is that all unattended deaths are treated as murder until suicide is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
[1:47:39.500 --> 1:47:43.500]  And when they come right out and say, oh, there is no question that this is a suicide,
[1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:50.500]  especially only two weeks after this duct tape and flashed up and bashed in guys throwing a lake and they declared that a suicide,
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:54.500]  I mean, the credibility of the police right now is a big fat zero on this.
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:56.500]  Yeah.
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:48:01.500]  I definitely thought they were way too fast in calling it a suicide.
[1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:07.500]  Again, we're talking to Joseph Streisak, and I appreciate you coming on, Mr. Streisak.
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  Any other points we haven't raised, any other points you'd like to make?
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:22.500]  Well, you're right in saying I know she was going to try to have an appeal done.
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:26.500]  Where's her attorneys with all this information?
[1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:30.500]  I mean, certainly they have looked at all her records.
[1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:32.500]  They know everything about her.
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:40.500]  I know she was a little bit upset with them because their cost to protect her legally was very expensive.
[1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:45.500]  I know that she talked about that several times, but where's her attorney in all this?
[1:48:45.500 --> 1:48:50.500]  Well, this is also very, very suspicious that we haven't heard from them on the news shows.
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.500]  What's your take on that?
[1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:57.500]  Yeah, I'm absolutely in agreement because if Palfrey had made copies of the information that is now in the,
[1:48:57.500 --> 1:49:01.500]  the now vanished box, I would presume her lawyers would have it.
[1:49:01.500 --> 1:49:07.500]  But again, yeah, not a word at all, and I find that very alarming.
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:14.500]  Now, if anybody out there other than family is in a position to talk to Miss Palfrey's mother, Mrs. Palfrey,
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:23.500]  that would be Joseph Streisak, have you had occasion to dig out her mother's number out of your files
[1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:27.500]  or to call her or to see if, or have you heard from the family about her belongings
[1:49:27.500 --> 1:49:29.500]  or has anybody wanted to get into her stuff?
[1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:31.500]  What's been happening on that front?
[1:49:31.500 --> 1:49:34.500]  Well, we're a very secure building here.
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  No one will get in there until I know her mother.
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:38.500]  And I know her mother from this letter.
[1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:41.500]  She's going to be the exact year of the estate.
[1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:47.500]  No, but no one's contacted. I did talk to someone in the family the other day.
[1:49:47.500 --> 1:49:51.500]  They knew her calling hours were on Saturday and Sunday for her services,
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:56.500]  but other than that, no, we've never been contacted as to when there's going to be anyone showing up
[1:49:56.500 --> 1:49:58.500]  or who is going to show up.
[1:49:58.500 --> 1:50:03.500]  I'm sure that something will come about in their future,
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  but no, I'm not being contacted by anyone in the family.
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:11.500]  You know, I'm tempted to jump on an airplane and go to that service. I bet I could find out a lot of key info.
[1:50:11.500 --> 1:50:13.500]  It was this past Saturday and Sunday.
[1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:15.500]  Boy, they sure did that quick, Mike.
[1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:22.500]  Yeah, I thought that was very, very, well, of course, you know, I think today everybody wants to get it.
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:25.500]  Death is a very fast thing today.
[1:50:25.500 --> 1:50:30.500]  Not if it's a murder, though. We appreciate your amazing courage, Joseph Streisak.
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:34.500]  Stay there. Mike Rivera riding shotgun with us about 15 minutes in the next hour.
[1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:37.500]  We'll talk to Mr. Streisak on the other side and ferret out some more details,
[1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:42.500]  but some big tidbits there. She specifically feared for her life, not just a hit,
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:47.500]  but was like where she was living because it had higher security.
[1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:50.500]  She could relax. She was, quote, paranoid.
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:58.500]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut,
[1:50:58.500 --> 1:51:04.500]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:08.500]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:11.500]  in which family members receive answers to their questions,
[1:51:11.500 --> 1:51:15.500]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[1:51:15.500 --> 1:51:18.500]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:51:18.500 --> 1:51:22.500]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:26.500]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:32.500]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.

[1:51:46.500 --> 1:51:51.500]  and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[1:51:51.500 --> 1:51:55.500]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[1:51:55.500 --> 1:51:59.500]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:03.500]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually,
[1:52:03.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:09.500]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:13.500]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy,
[1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:18.500]  is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[1:52:18.500 --> 1:52:23.500]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:26.500]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:30.500]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system
[1:52:30.500 --> 1:52:33.500]  to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:39.500]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.

[1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:55.500]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:53:00.500]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:05.500]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here. Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[1:54:37.500 --> 1:54:42.500]  We're back for a ride with Joseph Streisak, building manager there at the condominium high rise.
[1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:46.500]  Whatever Jean Palford that he seen, Madame lived.
[1:54:46.500 --> 1:54:53.500]  You talk about that she thought powerful men might be after her, that she was being followed.
[1:54:53.500 --> 1:55:00.500]  Did she ever mention to you or hint at who these powerful men could have been, Mr. Streisak?
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:06.500]  In a conversation we had quite a few months ago, probably in January.
[1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:14.500]  We were talking about some clients, and she told me that it started at the White House, and it went from there.
[1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:19.500]  She said they weren't all Republicans, but there's also Democrats involved in this.
[1:55:19.500 --> 1:55:24.500]  Okay, that's a big new development, Mike Rivera. He just said from the White House on down,
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:29.500]  she would never say that previously when I brought up other researchers claiming it was Cheney,
[1:55:29.500 --> 1:55:34.500]  and of course McCain, she would say, well, I have heard that, and she would imply that it was true.
[1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:36.500]  That's a big deal, isn't it?
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:40.500]  Yeah, it is. She had been implying some very high level people.
[1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:46.500]  There had been some comments off the record which implied it, but it always seemed like these were the chips
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:52.500]  that she was really hanging onto to try and negotiate her way out of the prison sentence.
[1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:57.500]  Obviously, somewhere along the line, somebody miscalculated or this wet work would not have been necessary.
[1:55:57.500 --> 1:56:01.500]  I was about to say, sir, I'm not trying to scare you, Mr. Streisak, but I would imagine
[1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:05.500]  you've already had the willies if you've got good instincts, and I would imagine you do.
[1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:11.500]  Think of anything else she told you. I would just dump it all now. That's your best protection.
[1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:16.500]  Did she say anything else? She said the White House on down, both parties, anything else?
[1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:25.500]  Well, she also was very impetitive. She didn't know most of the people, only that she would watch the Caller ID.
[1:56:25.500 --> 1:56:32.500]  She knew people by their wrong names. They would use alias' names.
[1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:38.500]  She really didn't know her clients directly by their real names.
[1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:51.500]  Anessa came over to call her ID. I do know that when I called her, she'd say hello, Joe, so she knew it was me calling.
[1:56:51.500 --> 1:56:55.500]  But you're saying she said, quote, from the White House on down, both parties?
[1:56:55.500 --> 1:56:56.500]  Yes.
[1:56:56.500 --> 1:56:59.500]  Anything else she said to you in the times you talked to her?
[1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:09.500]  No, just a lot of very influential people, and that many of the customers were clients.
[1:57:09.500 --> 1:57:13.500]  She always made sure and said clients. She was very professional.
[1:57:13.500 --> 1:57:16.500]  We're from the DC area.
[1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:22.500]  Mike Rivera, in the minute or so we've got left, any other key points you want to ask our guests?
[1:57:22.500 --> 1:57:28.500]  Well, this is consistent with what Debra Jean had said on both of our shows.
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:31.500]  When we come back, though, because I know we're close to the end of the break,
[1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:37.500]  I want to bring up the subject of an intelligence operation that had penetrated her database that she'd expressed to me on my show.
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:43.500]  No, she said that here, too. She said they were using her group of 15,000 clients as a hunting ground.
[1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:48.500]  Absolutely. And it raises the possibility there's a third party with the motive to have killed her.
[1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:53.500]  Okay. Mr. Streisak, any other key points you want to add that you haven't added?
[1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:56.500]  No, that's about it.
[1:57:56.500 --> 1:58:01.500]  Well, you know, I just feel that Debra Jean was a very nice person.
[1:58:01.500 --> 1:58:05.500]  She did not deserve to die in vain. The truth needs to come out.
[1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:07.500]  And you don't believe she committed suicide?
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:12.500]  No. To no Jean, you know she wouldn't commit suicide. She was not that type of person.
[1:58:12.500 --> 1:58:14.500]  Do you believe this was murder?
[1:58:14.500 --> 1:58:16.500]  Yes.
[1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:20.500]  We appreciate your courage, Mr. Streisak. We're all praying for you and everybody else.
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:22.500]  Please get us that handwriting as fast as you can, okay?
[1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:23.500]  Well...
[1:58:23.500 --> 1:58:25.500]  Thank you. You're the best. We'll stay in contact. Take care.
[1:58:25.500 --> 1:58:28.500]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivera.
[1:58:33.500 --> 1:58:35.500]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:38.500]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:38.500 --> 1:58:45.500]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[1:58:45.500 --> 1:58:50.500]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:53.500]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:56.500]  But their objective being world domination?
[1:58:56.500 --> 1:58:59.500]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:02.500]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:09.500]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.500 --> 1:59:15.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:15.500 --> 1:59:19.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:22.500]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:25.500]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:27.500]  They're after power. That's their aptitude.
[1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:32.500]  If you're in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[1:59:32.500 --> 1:59:36.500]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv
[1:59:36.500 --> 1:59:58.500]  Blue Prep for Global Enslavement. You have been warned.
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:21.500]  We are now into hour number three.
[2:00:21.500 --> 2:00:25.500]  Mike Rivera with us for another 15 minutes and Steve Shank popping in for a second or two
[2:00:25.500 --> 2:00:27.500]  to talk about what's happening in the world food economy.
[2:00:27.500 --> 2:00:30.500]  We'll look at free speech in England and how you get fired
[2:00:30.500 --> 2:00:33.500]  if you state your political opinions in the supposed free nation.
[2:00:33.500 --> 2:00:36.500]  With one of their former top national hosts fired.
[2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:41.500]  James Well joining us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[2:00:41.500 --> 2:00:46.500]  Mike Rivera, quite an incredible interview with this gentleman
[2:00:46.500 --> 2:00:48.500]  whose info meshes with everything we got.
[2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:52.500]  I just wish I could have gotten her on air to say it was going to be murder if she died.
[2:00:52.500 --> 2:00:57.500]  She did tell him that, but you know, she just said that it sounded ridiculous to say that on air.
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:01:01.500]  I think as smart as she was, she didn't realize that they were, you know,
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:04.500]  people think they don't get killed that people, you know, he said she was paranoid.
[2:01:04.500 --> 2:01:08.500]  No, that was her feeling the wings of the angel of death flapping around her head.
[2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:14.500]  You know, she said she could quote sleep good, you know, felt secure in that high security condo,
[2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:19.500]  but she's dead now and I see this M.O. one of their favorite tactics.
[2:01:19.500 --> 2:01:25.500]  I believe it was probably police that killed her because it fits the favorite tactic of police hitman.
[2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:26.500]  What do you say?
[2:01:26.500 --> 2:01:33.500]  Well, the exact mechanism almost is kind of irrelevant. The issue is that we're definitely dealing with suspicious circumstances here.
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:39.500]  These supposed suicide notes were written apparently a few days in advance and dated,
[2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:42.500]  which is kind of odd for a suicide note.
[2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:45.500]  And there are a lot of questions and it does need to be looked at,
[2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:51.500]  but the bottom line is that there were people who did have a motive to see Palfrey dead.
[2:01:51.500 --> 2:01:55.500]  Now that her case was over and she was going to jail and she had a book deal,
[2:01:55.500 --> 2:02:01.500]  she had no reason to hold back any of the little bits of information she'd been using as a final chip.
[2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:03.500]  And so a lot of that stuff was going to come out.
[2:02:03.500 --> 2:02:10.500]  And the case, she tried to have her lawyers declare a national security clause for secret admittance of evidence
[2:02:10.500 --> 2:02:13.500]  showing that she was probably part of an intelligence operation.
[2:02:13.500 --> 2:02:18.500]  That's what Wayne Madsen's saying and you were talking about a third party having her killed.
[2:02:18.500 --> 2:02:19.500]  Give us your take.
[2:02:19.500 --> 2:02:26.500]  Well, the idea was that what Palfrey had said on my show was not that she herself was running an intelligence operation,
[2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:30.500]  but that somebody's intelligence operation had penetrated her company
[2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:37.500]  and was glomming onto information about various political leaders who were kind of a little kinky out there.
[2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:38.500]  Now we all know-
[2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:46.500]  Probably Brandy Britton where it all started and she shot her mouth off, then she hung herself when she was only facing six months in jail.
[2:02:46.500 --> 2:02:55.500]  Yeah, absolutely. Now it's one thing you have politicians who will get embarrassing information about a candidate or an opponent to get rid of them,
[2:02:55.500 --> 2:03:02.500]  but if you have an intelligence operation that is using this kind of information to blackmail politicians to get them to go a certain direction,
[2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:08.500]  you don't want that information to become public because then these politicians are no longer of any use to you.
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:09.500]  You can't blackmail them.
[2:03:09.500 --> 2:03:13.500]  And of course the masters of that are the British, the Russians and the Israelis.
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:21.500]  And the Israelis. And if they've got this information and they're blackmailing politicians with this embarrassing information,
[2:03:21.500 --> 2:03:28.500]  they don't want it to become public because then all the money they've invested in getting these people into these compromised positions is gone.
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:30.500]  The honey trap is completely blown.
[2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:33.500]  It also makes them look bad.
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:39.500]  There's a lot of evidence that the Israelis were running.
[2:03:39.500 --> 2:03:41.500]  Monica Lewinsky, do you think that's accurate?
[2:03:41.500 --> 2:03:45.500]  Yeah, I think that was accurate. They had her phones tapped at the Watergate.
[2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:56.500]  We know that the guy who was behind this Emperor's Club VIP that resulted in Elliot Spitzer's downfall had two Israeli passports in his home along with $600,000 in cash.
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:03:59.500]  That one was quite probably an intelligence operation.
[2:03:59.500 --> 2:04:03.500]  And honey trap is a common spy operation tactic.
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:07.500]  It's used all the time. The Israelis are masters at that as well.
[2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:11.500]  And you know, once you've got somebody on that hook, you don't want them to get off.
[2:04:11.500 --> 2:04:20.500]  So whoever was using Palfrey's information to control politicians would want to silence her because if she went and exposed everything with a tell-all book,
[2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:24.500]  then they lose that ability to control these politicians.
[2:04:24.500 --> 2:04:30.500]  Now, we know that Karnaby was a medallist in an origin that's been reported as parents living by a root.
[2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:37.500]  The MO, the information we're getting right now is that Karnaby was somehow tied into all this.
[2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.500]  We'll get your take on that on the other side.
[2:04:39.500 --> 2:04:44.500]  Final segment with Mike Rivera. WhatReallyHappened.com. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.500]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:57.500]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[2:04:57.500 --> 2:05:03.500]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[2:05:03.500 --> 2:05:09.500]  In the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[2:05:09.500 --> 2:05:17.500]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:24.500]  Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[2:05:24.500 --> 2:05:31.500]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[2:05:31.500 --> 2:05:47.500]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com, 1-800-453-2202.
[2:05:47.500 --> 2:05:55.500]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:05:55.500 --> 2:05:58.500]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:05:58.500 --> 2:06:04.500]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:06:04.500 --> 2:06:08.500]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:06:08.500 --> 2:06:13.500]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:20.500]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[2:07:20.500 --> 2:07:24.500]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:33.500]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[2:07:33.500 --> 2:07:37.500]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[2:07:37.500 --> 2:07:41.500]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:47.500]  This is unveilingthem.com, the message of His Kingdom.
[2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:37.500]  Well, you know, we've pretty much covered all the information we have on Palfrey until that handwriting sample comes in.
[2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:41.500]  And I don't want to get caught up in a lot of minutiae.
[2:08:41.500 --> 2:08:49.500]  The bottom line is a lot of people, you know, are breathing a sigh of relief that she and her memoirs are now basically silenced forever.
[2:08:49.500 --> 2:08:57.500]  And it's just one of those, you know, the sadly, the gravestones that are marking the path through history that we have right now.
[2:08:57.500 --> 2:09:10.500]  As far as Iran is concerned, I'm sensing that there is a deep faction opening up within our own government between those people who just want to go on and invade Iran and those who realize it would be a huge, huge mistake to do.
[2:09:10.500 --> 2:09:20.500]  So I find it very interesting that in their latest screed against Iran, Israel has once again admitted that they are already a nuclear power armed with nuclear weapons.
[2:09:20.500 --> 2:09:31.500]  And this kind of like pulls the legs out of Hillary Clinton's latest attempt to prove how butchery is by saying she's going to obliterate Iran if it attacks Israel.
[2:09:31.500 --> 2:09:40.500]  Because obviously Israel does not need our help and it does not need our defense dollars and systems because it is a nuclear power in and of its own right.
[2:09:40.500 --> 2:09:43.500]  Well, Israel just doesn't want to get the blame for attacking Iran.
[2:09:43.500 --> 2:09:46.500]  And for the general public, they won't even know Israel is involved.
[2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:57.500]  The general public thinks that Australia is Israel. I mean, I've seen the presentations on the streets where grown adults don't even, you know, they think that Iran is Australia.
[2:09:57.500 --> 2:10:03.500]  They don't know where the U.S. is. I mean, how do they ever dumb us down so bad, Mike?
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:06.500]  Well, I don't think we're quite as dumb down as they'd like to think.
[2:10:06.500 --> 2:10:15.500]  I've seen that news clip that you're talking about and that crew had to really kind of work to find, you know, the people who looked that dumb and they edited out a lot of other people.
[2:10:15.500 --> 2:10:19.500]  I don't know. I mean, I agree. It's a little overdone, but I run into stuff like that all the time.
[2:10:19.500 --> 2:10:24.500]  I mean, the general public thinks carbon dioxide is a devil weapon.
[2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:31.500]  That's definitely true. But again, they're starting to rise up to that one as well, especially after this last winter was so cold.
[2:10:31.500 --> 2:10:34.500]  But no, I agree. The public needs to be educated.
[2:10:34.500 --> 2:10:38.500]  And that's why it's so important for people to keep on speaking out on that.
[2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:44.500]  But getting back to the economy, because I know we're almost out of time for me right now, the economy is looking worse.
[2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:55.500]  And I think the most alarming thing right now is, being an election year, both of our traditional political parties are really ignoring the warning signs of disaster to come,
[2:10:55.500 --> 2:11:01.500]  because they don't want to get into discussion about the economy, because when the fingers start pointing, it's going to point everywhere.
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:05.500]  And this is why I think they're so obsessive about Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
[2:11:05.500 --> 2:11:09.500]  He is safe for them to hurl back and forth accusations.
[2:11:09.500 --> 2:11:18.500]  They don't want to talk about the war. They can't talk about the economy, so they're going to make a big thing about Reverend Jeremiah Wright and who said what and who's wearing an American pin.
[2:11:18.500 --> 2:11:24.500]  Meanwhile, we have Clinton top staffers running around calling white people white inwards, but that's okay.
[2:11:24.500 --> 2:11:30.500]  Yeah, and they're trying to make all these non-issues important because they can't talk about the real thing.
[2:11:30.500 --> 2:11:38.500]  But I saw an interesting statistic just this morning, where half of all homes purchased since 2006,
[2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:41.500]  more money is owed on the mortgages than the homes are now worth.
[2:11:41.500 --> 2:11:44.500]  And that means more people are going to start walking away.
[2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:46.500]  It's going to be a disaster.
[2:11:46.500 --> 2:11:53.500]  And with everybody going bankrupt, you're going to have double cops running around giving everybody tickets and running checkpoints.
[2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:56.500]  I mean, it is just a squeeze, man.
[2:11:56.500 --> 2:12:00.500]  They're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.
[2:12:00.500 --> 2:12:12.500]  And we're down to pillaging the population, which is why they're out there writing speeding tickets while murders and rapes and robberies are basically going uninvestigated because it's all about getting money from the population.
[2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:18.500]  And this cop that posted a comment on Info Wars, he talks about how they're out busy doing important work.
[2:12:18.500 --> 2:12:21.500]  And I know they go to scum filled crack houses and the rest of it.
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:29.500]  But the point here is that the cops told me, and it's been in the news, that they don't arrest illegal aliens.
[2:12:29.500 --> 2:12:31.500]  And I'm not even after the illegal aliens.
[2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:32.500]  The point is they can drunk drive.
[2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:33.500]  They don't have to have IDs.
[2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:37.500]  They're left alone because the establishment wants to leave the door open.
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:41.500]  But then me, the citizen, I am just absolute trash, Mike.
[2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:43.500]  Well, you're not trash.
[2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:44.500]  You're the food.
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:46.500]  You are the food of the system.
[2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:49.500]  Your tax dollars and your earnings are the food of the system.
[2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:50.500]  Exactly.
[2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:51.500]  I don't like it.
[2:12:51.500 --> 2:12:52.500]  Well, I don't like it either.
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:56.500]  I don't like being, you know, we've become a cannibalistic society if you think about it.
[2:12:56.500 --> 2:13:00.500]  I agree, it's like, government and the elites live off of our work and off, literally off our blood.
[2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:03.500]  It's like being on the African savannah.
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:10.500]  And instead of seeing 10 lions every five miles like you're supposed to, you see 500.
[2:13:10.500 --> 2:13:15.500]  I mean, and they're just making more and more bureaucracies, more and more tattletail squads.
[2:13:15.500 --> 2:13:18.500]  They're CPSing people's kids for no reason now.
[2:13:18.500 --> 2:13:20.500]  I mean, folks, you understand, they're going to do something.
[2:13:20.500 --> 2:13:21.500]  They're going to arrest you.
[2:13:21.500 --> 2:13:22.500]  They're going to get you.
[2:13:22.500 --> 2:13:24.500]  Do you know what it means when there's this many cops?
[2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:26.500]  I'm sorry, Mike.
[2:13:26.500 --> 2:13:27.500]  I just, I start ranting.
[2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:28.500]  Go ahead.
[2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:31.500]  Well, I understand that, but you're on a very, very valid point because I, and I made this
[2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:33.500]  observation on what really happened this morning.
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:35.500]  We have 5% of the world's population.
[2:13:35.500 --> 2:13:37.500]  We have 25% of the world's prisoners.
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:38.500]  Why?
[2:13:38.500 --> 2:13:42.500]  Because we've got prison industries and these people are being put to work in these prison
[2:13:42.500 --> 2:13:43.500]  factories.
[2:13:43.500 --> 2:13:44.500]  This is what the Nazis had.
[2:13:44.500 --> 2:13:48.500]  All those camps that we see in the history books, they were slave labor camps.
[2:13:48.500 --> 2:13:52.500]  The prisoners in them were making products for the German people or for the German government
[2:13:52.500 --> 2:13:53.500]  rather to support the war.
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:54.500]  They were making boots.
[2:13:54.500 --> 2:13:55.500]  They were making uniforms.
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:13:59.500]  It was prison labor, and we've got the same exact system here in the U.S.
[2:13:59.500 --> 2:14:03.500]  When Janet Reno was attorney general in her office at the Department of Justice, she had
[2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:08.500]  a sign on the wall saying all the furniture in this office is made by federal prison inmates.
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:09.500]  They're proud of it.
[2:14:09.500 --> 2:14:13.500]  They're proud that they're setting up the same kind of system that they had in the German
[2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.500]  labor camps.
[2:14:14.500 --> 2:14:19.500]  The same system that the Bush family made money off of when Prescott Bush was business partners
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:24.500]  and by the way, the idiot public thinks, good, make them prisoners work, you're competing
[2:14:24.500 --> 2:14:29.500]  against people getting 20 cents an hour and there's no regulators.
[2:14:29.500 --> 2:14:34.500]  You better know the prison's dump whenever they want in the river.
[2:14:34.500 --> 2:14:39.500]  It's absolutely true, and we pay for the prisons and we pay for the infrastructure, but we
[2:14:39.500 --> 2:14:41.500]  don't even get the profits back from the prison labor.
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:43.500]  It goes to private corporations.
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:47.500]  Well, I mean, they're building more and more prisons, more and more cops everywhere in everybody's
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.500]  business. New tax authorities show up in my office all the time.
[2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:53.500]  I mean, I'm getting sick of it.
[2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:54.500]  I am really getting tired.
[2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:58.500]  I mean, this country is pathetic and these cops think this is freedom.
[2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:03.500]  Mike Rivera, I really appreciate you and we'll talk to you soon, whatreallyhappened.com.
[2:15:03.500 --> 2:15:05.500]  Thanks for your great contribution.
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:06.500]  Thank you for having me on.
[2:15:06.500 --> 2:15:07.500]  You bet.
[2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:09.500]  And again, I love the average cop.
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:11.500]  You know, I know you're drinking Florida water.
[2:15:11.500 --> 2:15:13.500]  Your kids are getting shot up with deadly vaccines.
[2:15:13.500 --> 2:15:15.500]  I don't want you to be part of this.
[2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:18.500]  I just keep harping on the cops because I got to see you everywhere.
[2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:20.500]  I mean, every, I can't go five feet.
[2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:22.500]  A cop car just drove by.
[2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:24.500]  I mean, I'm infested.
[2:15:24.500 --> 2:15:26.500]  I'm an adult.
[2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  I don't, I'm tired of it.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:29.500]  There's a crack house two doors down from me.
[2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:32.500]  You've never busted it.
[2:15:32.500 --> 2:15:34.500]  You're always sucking off me.
[2:15:34.500 --> 2:15:41.500]  And man, I'm going to shut up now because all I'm going to say is in New Orleans, the police didn't
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:46.500]  bring food, they brought gun confiscation with all the economic crises and all the talk
[2:15:46.500 --> 2:15:48.500]  of food shortage and everything that's happening.
[2:15:48.500 --> 2:15:49.500]  You're crazy.
[2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.500]  If you don't get.
[2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:53.500]  Storeable foods and we've got the sponsor for you.
[2:15:53.500 --> 2:15:55.500]  Longest continually operating company.
[2:15:55.500 --> 2:15:57.500]  It's, it's, it's dried food.
[2:15:57.500 --> 2:16:00.500]  So it's very heavy, but stores in small containers.
[2:16:00.500 --> 2:16:01.500]  So fills up small areas.
[2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:02.500]  Very easy to transport.
[2:16:02.500 --> 2:16:04.500]  Last more than 10 years.
[2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:07.500]  J. Michael Stevens group, eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:10.500]  And it's a Steve Shank, but I wanted to get him up on the air because.
[2:16:10.500 --> 2:16:15.500]  He is involved in massive food purchasing and preparation and sale.
[2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:19.500]  And he told us a year ago about coming food shortages and massive food increases.
[2:16:19.500 --> 2:16:22.500]  Thanks for coming on with us, Steve.
[2:16:22.500 --> 2:16:24.500]  Hey, glad to be aboard Alex.
[2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:30.500]  I really appreciate that last guest that you had on.
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:33.500]  We are in a situation right now.
[2:16:33.500 --> 2:16:43.500]  Remember when you and I talked a long time ago about the fact that food is the control mechanism of the system.
[2:16:43.500 --> 2:16:44.500]  Absolutely.
[2:16:44.500 --> 2:16:50.500]  We have a worldwide famine and it's deadly serious.
[2:16:50.500 --> 2:17:02.500]  But, you know, I think a lot of people don't realize that it's not going to be very long before they are not going to be acquiring groceries in the grocery store.
[2:17:02.500 --> 2:17:04.500]  It's already there.
[2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:08.500]  We have rationing of rice.
[2:17:08.500 --> 2:17:12.500]  We have rationing of wheat in the form of flour.
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:21.500]  The last notice that we put out, we've started putting out situation reports, Alex, to anybody that has an email with us.
[2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:31.500]  And the information that we put out, you've got to realize that, you know, on my radio program last night, they had a little news flash.
[2:17:31.500 --> 2:17:39.500]  How Mrs. Bush was berating the Burmese government for not notifying their people of a storm that came.
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:42.500]  Well, we have a worse situation with the food.
[2:17:42.500 --> 2:17:49.500]  Our government is not notifying your listeners that there's no food.
[2:17:49.500 --> 2:18:05.500]  And the president just appropriated another $770 million to go along with the $200 million that he's sending off to the UN to buy food for these third world countries.
[2:18:05.500 --> 2:18:16.500]  And he's refusing to limit exports of our own food despite the fact that we've already seen a 35% increase in the overall average price of food in the last six months.
[2:18:16.500 --> 2:18:30.500]  Now, it even gets worse than that. The farm organizations, Alex, just petitioned like crazy to have the government control mechanism over the commodity futures markets.
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:38.500]  Now, you know that every place that you can invest, the government has control mechanisms.
[2:18:38.500 --> 2:18:43.500]  Well, what they're doing is we have investors right now.
[2:18:43.500 --> 2:18:57.500]  You talk about hoarding. No, I know that's the main thing adding to all this is not just the bad last three seasons, but we have big global speculators who are dumping their dollars and they're dumping it in raw commodities like food and then hoarding.
[2:18:57.500 --> 2:19:08.500]  Why do you think that the gold prices went down? They're not buying gold anymore. They're buying food. They're buying futures. They're buying the future crop and they're buying every crop they can get a hold of.
[2:19:08.500 --> 2:19:17.500]  So here's what we got. We've got the United Nations that is just about to receive almost a billion dollars of American money.
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:25.500]  Now, they asked the developed nations to send that money, but we're sending all but 30 million of it.
[2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:39.500]  Steve, stay there. We've got a break. We're going to come back and maybe go to the next segment after that with Steve Shank and then I've got a bunch of other global news. Anyway, a slice of we're going into very rough waters, batten down the hatches and get scoreable foods, eatfooddirect.com.
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:47.500]  But Steve is here because he's on the inside of all this. He can tell us what's really going on as if the news itself isn't bad enough. We'll be right back.
[2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:57.500]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.500 --> 2:20:02.500]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:20:02.500 --> 2:20:13.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:13.500 --> 2:20:25.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:28.500]  The Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.500 --> 2:20:33.500]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their happenings.

[2:23:53.500 --> 2:24:00.500]  Folks, five, six, seven years ago, before all these crises were happening, I had horrible food.
[2:24:00.500 --> 2:24:08.500]  And then what you do is when it gets old, I haven't really gotten to that point yet, you just start eating it, or you give it away to family, friends, give it away to the local food banks.
[2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:18.500]  It's good stuff. But the stuff that Steve Shank's got last more than 10 years in climate controlled, 10 years if it's not climate controlled, saying you're a garage erratic.
[2:24:18.500 --> 2:24:23.500]  But he's, every time I bring up his products, he says, no, I want to tell him what's happening.
[2:24:23.500 --> 2:24:34.500]  He's got a free email alert that goes out every day. You can go sign up for it, eFoodsDirect.com. And, you know, he was telling me a year ago, they were already seeing prices go up and having trouble getting it.
[2:24:34.500 --> 2:24:40.500]  And yeah, they admit that all these big companies are buying it up and hoarding it, even though there was already a shortage, they're hoarding it.
[2:24:40.500 --> 2:24:44.500]  Are they trying to drive the market up and then dump it, or what are they doing, Steve?
[2:24:44.500 --> 2:25:00.500]  Well, the worst thing is not the companies that are hoarding it, most of those are trying to get it shipped back out. What's happening is your commodities, futures investors, people from all over the world, and particularly in the United States,
[2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:06.500]  are buying up the crops. And at the same time, we've got the United Nations.
[2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:18.500]  Now, when the money gets back, now, Mr. Bush is trying to send almost a billion dollars. That was the amount that was asked by the United Nations Food Program.
[2:25:18.500 --> 2:25:28.500]  And it was asked from all of the developed nations. We're sending it all. And we're the only nation that is not restricting exports of our food.
[2:25:28.500 --> 2:25:39.500]  And that means that when that big chunk of money comes back around, there's only one country that's going to be bought from, these investors within our country, our own Americans,
[2:25:39.500 --> 2:25:46.500]  are buying up the food and they will sell it when the UN comes in with our own money to buy it away from us.
[2:25:46.500 --> 2:25:50.500]  Okay, let me break this down for people. We've got a double whammy here.
[2:25:50.500 --> 2:26:01.500]  Not only are there hundreds of trillions of US dollars out there that all want to come back in now, and globally, people are dumping them and they're trying to buy up what skyrocketing,
[2:26:01.500 --> 2:26:10.500]  i.e. food commodities, you know, gold, silver, oil, food, you know, the whole gamut has been going up over all the last year.
[2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:18.500]  But then, because the dollar's been devalued, they can come here and use their investments to buy things even cheaper. Go ahead.
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:27.500]  That's absolutely right. And the fact is, is that right now, just to give an example, wheat is what you grind to get flour.
[2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:38.500]  Now, Costco and the companies are limiting the amount of flour you can have, limiting the amount of rice you can have, limiting the amount of cooking oil that you can have.
[2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:51.500]  And what happens is that these other countries, you figure, China has 1.3 trillion of our dollars, and they are short of wheat? Guess where they're going to go?
[2:26:51.500 --> 2:27:04.500]  China shut down their exports, even though we're importing from them. They shut all these other countries that we're importing, 30 to 40% of our food from, have shut down their exports to keep the food for their own people.
[2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:13.500]  Not only are we not keeping the food for our own people, but we're giving the United Nations almost a billion dollars to come back and buy that food away from our people.
[2:27:13.500 --> 2:27:25.500]  At the same time, our government regulation organizations are not stopping the investors in commodities from buying up the feed.
[2:27:25.500 --> 2:27:38.500]  Now, corn is just about to be rationed also, and that means that if they have 86% less corn this next year, that means that all of the feed for cattle.
[2:27:38.500 --> 2:27:49.500]  I talked last night, Alex, to a fellow that has 1,000 head of cattle out in one of the Midwestern states. He specializes, he raised the cattle.
[2:27:49.500 --> 2:28:01.500]  He has to buy the feed for those cattle from guys that specialize in raising the feed. They are taking the cattle feed, turning it into ethanol, and subsidizing the ethanol.
[2:28:01.500 --> 2:28:18.500]  And what's going to happen here within the next couple of months is that the dairy herds that can't afford to feed, that can't afford to be fed to provide your milk and your butter and things, and your meat, your beef herds are all fed corn, all your poultry is fed corn.
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:30.500]  Well, a large percentage of it in some states like Texas, it's range-fed, but you're right, a lot of it. That will certainly cause an increase in price, and then everything else is going up in price because the dollar is plunging in value.
[2:28:30.500 --> 2:28:40.500]  No, it's not about a price. It just isn't going to be there, Alex. I'm telling you, the outside investors, these other countries are coming in.
[2:28:40.500 --> 2:28:51.500]  The Kansas City wheat market, for example, is upset as all get out. The broker's on the wheat market because foreign countries are coming in, and they aren't even asking the price.
[2:28:51.500 --> 2:28:56.500]  They're buying all that they can get at whatever price it takes.
[2:28:56.500 --> 2:29:03.500]  Now, is this a real food shortage, or is it all caused by dollar devaluation and wild speculation?
[2:29:03.500 --> 2:29:13.500]  It is absolutely a food shortage. This is the third year of a worldwide famine. The stinking planet didn't produce enough food to feed its population.
[2:29:13.500 --> 2:29:28.500]  The last two years running, and we've got less food, less water, and on top of it, now that we've got the shortages of food, investment organizations are going in, and other countries are going in, and bidding away that food from our people.
[2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:33.500]  It's not going to be a matter of whether you can afford it or not. I don't care how much money you've got.
[2:29:33.500 --> 2:29:59.500]  Stay there, Steve. I want to come back and finish up.

[2:31:08.500 --> 2:31:24.500]  This is a story of the rite that rids demons. There are a lot of stories told on TV and the like about demons these days, but untold about demons is the rite introduced about 2000 years ago that gets rid of demons.
[2:31:24.500 --> 2:31:41.500]  An old ancient in origin rite that works every time when performed and done right. It's a simple rite and know it doesn't require a priest and Hollywood like exorcism type fight and struggle. It's really quite simple and it works quite well.
[2:31:41.500 --> 2:32:01.500]  This rite was once used or performed regularly in society, but then someone or shall we say someone started getting it removed. Who would want to remove a simple rite, a practice if you will, when properly performed, removes demons and or demonic influence in people's lives?
[2:32:01.500 --> 2:32:13.500]  Well, how about this for starter answers? A perverse demonic race. Could this be? Could there really be such a race? And what is this simple rite?

[2:32:52.500 --> 2:32:58.940]  oh man this is a good song it's hard not to play it sometimes I'd like to just be
[2:32:58.940 --> 2:33:10.700]  a DJ let's say the age of DJ is gone and now we've got iPods video killed the
[2:33:10.700 --> 2:33:14.740]  radio star and then I guess it brought the radio star back when he became a
[2:33:14.740 --> 2:33:32.980]  video star whatever comes we're gonna be here God willing covering it tracking
[2:33:32.980 --> 2:33:55.220]  it documenting it I'm finishing up two films right now it's been a situation
[2:33:55.220 --> 2:34:04.580]  where I've been so focused on finishing 9-11 Chronicles truth rising for the
[2:34:04.580 --> 2:34:08.460]  last six eight months that I haven't even thought to make a trailer or promote
[2:34:08.460 --> 2:34:14.580]  it we're finishing the film this week which is why Burmese is gonna be in
[2:34:14.580 --> 2:34:20.980]  here tomorrow that I haven't even promoted it yet it's gotta be the best
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:24.180]  song I've ever made I know each film I say that and you can admit yourself that
[2:34:24.180 --> 2:34:29.020]  each film has gotten better but this is cinema verite there's no voiceover from
[2:34:29.020 --> 2:34:35.020]  Alex Jones Alex Jones only pops up two times in a two-hour film I try to keep
[2:34:35.020 --> 2:34:39.260]  myself completely out of it but it is the story of the 9-11 truth movement yes
[2:34:39.260 --> 2:34:42.780]  believe it or not folks I'm sick of looking at myself I'm sick of talking
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:47.980]  about myself I'm sick of being dirt leader in the fight but I do get arrested
[2:34:47.980 --> 2:34:51.100]  in it and herald those flipping everybody off and it's pretty dynamic but
[2:34:51.100 --> 2:34:54.900]  it shows the power of the people taking action the point is I'm only showing
[2:34:54.900 --> 2:35:00.660]  this twice locally in Austin it won't be out for a couple months on DVD and it
[2:35:00.660 --> 2:35:04.820]  is the 17th and 18th the Saturday and Sunday evening Alamo draft house

[2:35:23.540 --> 2:35:28.820]  cheeseburgers but prices are exploding there are shortages I didn't roll my
[2:35:28.820 --> 2:35:33.100]  eyes because Steve's a very credible guy but I mean eight months ago on the
[2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:37.180]  show he's like they'll be wheat shortages they'll be grain shortages and I'm
[2:35:37.180 --> 2:35:40.660]  like going well Steve what do you mean and then suddenly three months ago I'm
[2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:44.900]  in a pizza place and it says sorry the price of the pizza has gone up 20% but
[2:35:44.900 --> 2:35:49.620]  the milk to feed the cows to make the milk the you know the grain to make the
[2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:53.540]  flour and then suddenly I saw those things at the grocery stores and
[2:35:53.540 --> 2:35:58.300]  everywhere and and just inflation alone I knew a jack of prices but not cause
[2:35:58.300 --> 2:36:05.820]  shortages so Steve's right been right so far I hope you're wrong Steve but
[2:36:05.820 --> 2:36:11.780]  Steve I don't get the feeling you're gonna be wrong I know unfortunately I'm
[2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:16.740]  not there just too many too many scenarios but I've got to tell your
[2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:23.620]  listeners I have to laugh folks one time when we were doing our little our
[2:36:23.620 --> 2:36:29.780]  little I guess I don't know what you call it my rant I guess Alex came on in
[2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:35.140]  one of the breaks he says Steve Steve now you don't want to get too extreme
[2:36:35.140 --> 2:36:39.780]  here if if if we tell these people people folks I'm worried about my
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:43.380]  credibility I don't I need to make sure that what you're telling people on my
[2:36:43.380 --> 2:36:49.260]  show is is is not going to be so so way far out there and then when it doesn't
[2:36:49.260 --> 2:36:54.700]  happen you're gonna look a little bit goofy and and I will go right along
[2:36:54.700 --> 2:36:59.900]  with you because I had you on there and I said Alex please don't worry didn't I
[2:36:59.900 --> 2:37:03.940]  Alex I said don't worry I know what I'm talking about because what I what I
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:08.100]  usually tell people is what's already happening but you ask well no I mean I
[2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:11.940]  mean you were talking about no food and I still hope that's not the case and I
[2:37:11.940 --> 2:37:15.380]  think now as bad as it's gotten people should get storeable food but I think
[2:37:15.380 --> 2:37:19.660]  because of terrorism we know they're behind it because of the police state
[2:37:19.660 --> 2:37:24.380]  because of the talk of depression now mainstream news that's my reason to have
[2:37:24.380 --> 2:37:27.780]  storeable food because if there's a 10% chance something bad's gonna happen I
[2:37:27.780 --> 2:37:32.940]  want it now it's gone up to like 50 60 you're just saying a hundred and I and
[2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:36.980]  I'm just saying okay I hope you're wrong I'm just telling listeners regardless
[2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:40.620]  they need storeable food and and now we come to the part where I have to make
[2:37:40.620 --> 2:37:44.060]  you plug that you are one of our big sponsors and I've gotten food from you
[2:37:44.060 --> 2:37:47.580]  long before you're a sponsor and you've got really high quality at very good
[2:37:47.580 --> 2:37:51.420]  prices and you've got food unlike some what some other folks have other people
[2:37:51.420 --> 2:37:56.700]  are selling 1950s and 60s military ration junk you have high quality stuff
[2:37:56.700 --> 2:38:02.180]  that was just packaged in the last month correct that's correct and the thing is
[2:38:02.180 --> 2:38:06.220]  is that we've already announced the fact that on May 12th there is going to be a
[2:38:06.220 --> 2:38:12.100]  significant price increase this is not a marketing issue very simply Alex what
[2:38:12.100 --> 2:38:17.620]  we're dealing with every single when we go to suppliers to buy the substitutes
[2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:22.500]  for wheat things like spelt and some of those those ancient grains just because
[2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:27.020]  wheat has become so short they are completely out of all of the substitutes
[2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:32.940]  in fact right now 70% of the suppliers that the J. Michael Stevens group
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:38.100]  eFoods Direct is ordering from when we when we try and put in advanced orders
[2:38:38.100 --> 2:38:45.060]  for the time after May 12th when when the prices are going to increase they
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:38:48.740]  cannot even tell us what the price is going to be well here's the good news
[2:38:48.740 --> 2:38:52.780]  I mean here's the good news is that at least in three or four months it'll be
[2:38:52.780 --> 2:38:56.060]  the end of the big season and I would imagine farmers are putting in even
[2:38:56.060 --> 2:39:00.700]  more fields I would imagine fields are planning to go fallow they're not I mean
[2:39:00.700 --> 2:39:06.260]  is there some type of big girl up no that is not going to happen 80 they will
[2:39:06.260 --> 2:39:13.220]  only raise 86% of the corn that they raised last year a higher percentage is
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:19.420]  going to go into ethanol okay now the other thing that we're dealing with is
[2:39:19.420 --> 2:39:23.940]  with the fuel prices a lot of the farmers that were able to plant last year
[2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:31.420]  will not be able to okay this whole thing is a complex what I've got to tell
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:38.860]  all of our listeners is very simply Alex folks as you know Alex and I stay

[2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:42.940]  you hey thank you for coming on with us I appreciate it Steven we get up Steve
[2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:47.100]  on for 10 hours there's so much information again a year ago on this show he
[2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:50.460]  said there was going to be all these food price increases and shortages and the
[2:41:50.460 --> 2:41:54.860]  rest of it I believe that he believed it because I was seeing government reports
[2:41:54.860 --> 2:41:58.180]  but the government hypes things up so often but now it's actually happening
[2:41:58.180 --> 2:42:01.780]  and a lot of it is the dollars been devalued and the rushing in to buy it
[2:42:01.780 --> 2:42:04.620]  all up now because they're they're foreign currencies are worth more than
[2:42:04.620 --> 2:42:10.900]  ours and there are global food shortages because of different climate things
[2:42:10.900 --> 2:42:14.860]  that have happened and regardless I do believe in the J. Michael Stevens
[2:42:14.860 --> 2:42:18.180]  crypto great folks eFoodsDirect.com and the phone number is also on that
[2:42:18.180 --> 2:42:27.620]  website okay I've got James Whale coming up and he's over in England he has been
[2:42:27.620 --> 2:42:35.660]  on Talks Sport which is Sky News it's it's it's Fox owned it's a news core
[2:42:35.660 --> 2:42:40.580]  company that's the umbrella company and he would have me on I remember eight
[2:42:40.580 --> 2:42:44.940]  nine years ago and call me a conspiracy nut but let me talk and agree with me on
[2:42:44.940 --> 2:42:48.620]  some things and then six years ago he would agree with me on a lot of things
[2:42:48.620 --> 2:42:53.140]  and in the last year or two he agreed with me on almost everything and he had
[2:42:53.140 --> 2:42:59.740]  really changed and I guess evolved like everyone does politically realizing
[2:42:59.740 --> 2:43:09.340]  what's happening and so he had the what 10 to 1 in the morning radio show one of
[2:43:09.340 --> 2:43:13.860]  the most highly rated in the country and it was on from Scotland to Ireland to
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:20.700]  Cornwall I mean just just all over the country from the south to the north and
[2:43:20.700 --> 2:43:25.620]  over across the channel in the areas of Europe as well and I'd always get a huge
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:30.260]  response going on a show he got fired last week and he wouldn't say why he got
[2:43:30.260 --> 2:43:35.300]  fired and then I saw a big report in the newspaper today about why he was
[2:43:35.300 --> 2:43:39.980]  reportedly fired so I thought we'd call him and get him on and and he refused to
[2:43:39.980 --> 2:43:44.780]  talk to the newspapers I guess he knew they would lie and spin and we already
[2:43:44.780 --> 2:43:48.100]  had him scheduled last week and suddenly he said something politicals come up I
[2:43:48.100 --> 2:43:53.620]  can't come on I'll talk to you next week well now it's next week and we find out
[2:43:53.620 --> 2:43:57.820]  that he wanted to break the news here of why he'd been fired so this will be
[2:43:57.820 --> 2:44:02.180]  exclusive the British papers you know report that he won't won't talk to them
[2:44:02.180 --> 2:44:05.940]  and that's because he knows that they will try to spend thanks so James
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:11.860]  Whale a leading light and exposing the whole new world order system he brought
[2:44:11.860 --> 2:44:16.260]  a lot of interesting people on his show every day and really exposed people in
[2:44:16.260 --> 2:44:22.900]  the UK to the new world order he has now been fired because they said he
[2:44:22.900 --> 2:44:26.180]  expressed his political opinions just like we had the fairness doctrine here
[2:44:26.180 --> 2:44:30.060]  until the late 80s you couldn't go on talk radio and have free speech and
[2:44:30.060 --> 2:44:36.220]  people challenged it in court it was overthrown now in England they will come
[2:44:36.220 --> 2:44:41.100]  arrest you for hundreds of things in your speech now speaking of police
[2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:46.860]  brutality now again I probably see 20 30 articles like this a day and I don't
[2:44:46.860 --> 2:44:50.940]  even cover them most days if I wanted to make police look bad if I wanted to sit
[2:44:50.940 --> 2:44:55.500]  up here and and drag you guys to the mud believe me I could do it in fact I
[2:44:55.500 --> 2:44:59.020]  think in the next few weeks I'm gonna gather a bunch of data I think I'm gonna
[2:44:59.020 --> 2:45:03.700]  do two or three shows where I play police killing people video over the web and
[2:45:03.700 --> 2:45:07.260]  audio on air and read their own admissions and convictions for drug
[2:45:07.260 --> 2:45:12.860]  dealing and framing people and you know what I've decided to just really go
[2:45:12.860 --> 2:45:16.380]  ahead and do a series of specials you think I've been trying to make you look
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:19.900]  bad you think I've been trying to act like you're bad guys and misconstruing
[2:45:19.900 --> 2:45:24.140]  things well we'll go ahead and give it to you with both barrels to really show
[2:45:24.140 --> 2:45:28.940]  you what you become now does that mean you individually have become this no
[2:45:28.940 --> 2:45:34.700]  but when you start defending it and saying I'm exaggerating you are
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:38.460]  gravely mistaken I mean I see this every day and most of time can't bring
[2:45:38.460 --> 2:45:44.020]  myself to watch it like there's some Polish guy who for 27 hours has been
[2:45:44.020 --> 2:45:48.500]  stuck in the airport and he throws a fit and kicks a chair over so the police
[2:45:48.500 --> 2:45:54.980]  come over and it jump on his head till his neck breaks while they tasering and
[2:45:54.980 --> 2:45:58.220]  then they tell the judges you don't say it was his broken neck and don't say it
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:04.860]  was the tasers he just got upset and had a heart attack at 35 years old I mean
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:12.460]  I've seen hundreds of videos hundreds where police beat someone to death
[2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:16.540]  Kelly rushing one of my listeners it was in the newspaper but I it was so
[2:46:16.540 --> 2:46:21.620]  amazing four years ago and this happened I didn't believe it then the paper said
[2:46:21.620 --> 2:46:25.660]  that he gave a Ron Paul speech in one of my videos on a videotape to a state
[2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:29.740]  police officer walked up to him and said sir I wanted to give you this very
[2:46:29.740 --> 2:46:33.100]  important information for you and your family and the cop knew where Kelly
[2:46:33.100 --> 2:46:35.380]  lived he's very well known in the community his family is one of the
[2:46:35.380 --> 2:46:41.180]  founders of that area and they came and arrested him and and the guy said put
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:44.500]  him in the car and said it's illegal to give me videos that was that's
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:47.740]  anti-government that's illegal then he called his wife on the cell phone and
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:51.940]  said I got the VHS bandit right here took him to jail and I called the judge at
[2:46:51.940 --> 2:46:55.580]  home and I said are you really charging him for for giving somebody a Ron
[2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:58.260]  Paul speech and the judge said I'm not gonna talk about the case you can read
[2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:01.540]  it in the paper and then we had guests on who were there in the court and they
[2:47:01.540 --> 2:47:05.540]  put on a prosecution and wanted him to spend six years in jail for two counts
[2:47:05.540 --> 2:47:09.380]  of giving the cop videos saying that they were anti-government and that hurt
[2:47:09.380 --> 2:47:12.540]  the officer's feelings thus it was assault thus it was a
[2:47:12.540 --> 2:47:18.500]  terroristic threat so you know in the cases of the cop who they come arrest
[2:47:18.500 --> 2:47:21.260]  the guy because he's got a sign in his yard saying our traditional systems a
[2:47:21.260 --> 2:47:27.100]  joke and the judge orders him arrested I mean this is boss hog on steroids and
[2:47:27.100 --> 2:47:32.100]  PCP and in every third world country we know the cops are corrupt and bad well
[2:47:32.100 --> 2:47:37.940]  we're just like that now and I for one have had enough of it I mean you can go
[2:47:37.940 --> 2:47:45.060]  look at the video and the photos of it this is out of the Daily Mail this is
[2:47:45.060 --> 2:47:49.380]  England pictured the moment a London tourist dies after screaming I can't
[2:47:49.380 --> 2:47:54.220]  breathe the police who restrained him and they put his head over the side of
[2:47:54.220 --> 2:47:58.800]  the curb and they pressed on him with full power with his head and broke his
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:02.820]  neck well of course they killed him what do you mean big cops are jumping on
[2:48:02.820 --> 2:48:07.780]  your head I mean what you know I mean you beat somebody they die a lot of the
[2:48:07.780 --> 2:48:11.620]  time it isn't like WWF wrestling when you jump on people's heads and they don't
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:20.220]  die believe me folks I know that's why I'm scared to get in a fight Frank Oburu
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:25.900]  43 was sprayed with CS gas and pinned down after a minor argument CCTV footage
[2:48:25.900 --> 2:48:29.540]  captured him losing consciousness after screaming I can't breathe I can't breathe
[2:48:29.540 --> 2:48:33.940]  the Nigerian businessman who was in London on holiday stopped breathing see
[2:48:33.940 --> 2:48:37.460]  I mean I don't want to be in the US or London anymore I can go to Africa and be
[2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:41.100]  left alone more by the cops and I'm serious so the one day they come to your
[2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:46.500]  village and kill you I mean you know you never see him till then witnesses said
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:53.100]  officers had their knees and feet on him as he wailed like a dog and it shows
[2:48:53.100 --> 2:49:00.060]  them each limb they got and put full weight on it and they love it and it
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:06.300]  just goes on and on and on and on and it says here two more officers arrived to
[2:49:06.300 --> 2:49:10.380]  help restrain footage appears to show one officer's knee over his neck as his head
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:15.700]  dangles over the curb and the police are defending and saying it was wonderful
[2:49:15.700 --> 2:49:19.460]  of course but Frank had no criminal record was not a criminal did not
[2:49:19.460 --> 2:49:25.460]  deserve to die at the streets like an animal I am crushed I put my faith in
[2:49:25.460 --> 2:49:28.460]  the British system to give me justice but it has failed me I you're not gonna
[2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:31.140]  get justice
[2:49:31.140 --> 2:49:40.780]  wow a pathologist gave the ruling of a asphyxia during restraint as a cause of
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:48.860]  death but the government says the CPS said a jury would find that the restraint
[2:49:48.860 --> 2:49:53.980]  was not unlawful yeah you just you just crush you know you just kill people it's
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:59.220]  no big deal well hell just have the cops sue the pathologist and and to have a
[2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:03.940]  have a federal ruling or a state ruling that you're not allowed to say that cops
[2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:07.500]  are able to choke people how's that sound that's what tasers just got a
[2:50:07.500 --> 2:50:11.660]  judge to rule three deaths in one county in one year three citizens died
[2:50:11.660 --> 2:50:19.660]  being tasered by the new God men they're dead their lives over by the way you can
[2:50:19.660 --> 2:50:25.660]  look up cops dying during taser test doesn't matter they just I know you're
[2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:29.980]  good just trying to do your job I understand see the government wants
[2:50:29.980 --> 2:50:36.260]  this every day in the US and every day now in Europe people die from tasers and
[2:50:36.260 --> 2:50:51.580]  being restrained as the cops jump on top of your head it is a big idea a new

[3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:27.980]  from the UK joining us coming up with big developments dealing with free
[3:00:27.980 --> 3:00:36.340]  speech in the next segment so we post a link up on info wars dot com and post a
[3:00:36.340 --> 3:00:41.060]  few paragraphs it says telecoms give police info without a warrant now this
[3:00:41.060 --> 3:00:46.940]  article is actually written as a acclimate or it is written to condition
[3:00:46.940 --> 3:00:54.940]  you to accept it it is it is done in a palatable way how this is being done for
[3:00:54.940 --> 3:00:59.940]  your own good and how this is a wonderful thing but the cop the Austin cop
[3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:03.460]  who posted identified himself as an Austin cop the sounds just like one I've
[3:01:03.460 --> 3:01:11.900]  no doubt it isn't says oh this is our bull this is our we're making this up
[3:01:11.900 --> 3:01:19.820]  well I have to have a whole article you can link through to the Seattle post
[3:01:19.820 --> 3:01:24.820]  intelligence or article headline using cell phones define missing persons
[3:01:24.820 --> 3:01:28.900]  pushes law wireless carriers give a location to police without a warrant
[3:01:28.900 --> 3:01:33.140]  now it goes on to say how reasonable it is you know somebody said they're going
[3:01:33.140 --> 3:01:36.060]  to commit suicide nobody knows where they are they use the cell phone to track
[3:01:36.060 --> 3:01:41.660]  them in fact it looks like just in Austin a couple days ago some guys that
[3:01:41.660 --> 3:01:44.900]  he was gonna go mass shoot at Walmart and they use it to stop him but that's
[3:01:44.900 --> 3:01:49.340]  probable cause so in a way I can actually agree with that you know they
[3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:51.500]  call them said yeah we know he's doing it give it to us right now but the
[3:01:51.500 --> 3:01:56.580]  problem is the problem is see this is how this is all introduced to us this is
[3:01:56.580 --> 3:02:02.660]  how this is all done that's why we need police is because that's the the the
[3:02:02.660 --> 3:02:07.580]  general public couldn't do that couldn't have the woman find the suicide note that
[3:02:07.580 --> 3:02:10.380]  he's gonna go kill people at Walmart reportedly or go do something big at
[3:02:10.380 --> 3:02:16.820]  Walmart you know this this AISD worker slash Walmart worker and he's on his
[3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:20.060]  way and the cops made it within seconds as he's going into the Walmart with the
[3:02:20.060 --> 3:02:27.220]  gun loaded for bear now that's one thing but see I happen to know what the feds
[3:02:27.220 --> 3:02:30.740]  announced and what they're really doing and if you'd like to just not say I'm
[3:02:30.740 --> 3:02:34.820]  lying and actually go look into what I'm saying it's in my film matrix of evil
[3:02:34.820 --> 3:02:44.380]  the news article made in 2003 Ron Paul's in it by the way but but but side
[3:02:44.380 --> 3:02:48.140]  issue it's free on Google video you don't have to pay me to see it okay I
[3:02:48.140 --> 3:02:53.900]  don't care I have to buy the DVD and my point is that the articles in there you
[3:02:53.900 --> 3:02:57.620]  don't even have to know how to Google or for investigator find things but you
[3:02:57.620 --> 3:03:01.380]  claim your investigators are trained so maybe you can just go find it on your
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:09.420]  own but federal documents and the news articles where they buy law and
[3:03:09.420 --> 3:03:14.060]  telecommunications act of 96 had the NSA take over the phone companies and
[3:03:14.060 --> 3:03:18.580]  their final hub where everything comes in and goes out is in essay offices not
[3:03:18.580 --> 3:03:22.980]  just an NSA hookup it's in essay now I told you that since 96 I read it in
[3:03:22.980 --> 3:03:26.500]  telecommunications act and then now it was announced last year with IBM the
[3:03:26.500 --> 3:03:32.900]  whole floor in San Francisco was in essay it begins and ends with the NSA at
[3:03:32.900 --> 3:03:36.020]  all everything's listened to everything's tracked but they've got to
[3:03:36.020 --> 3:03:39.540]  introduce this to the public so they don't tell you the cops overnight you've
[3:03:39.540 --> 3:03:42.980]  got this power come like last month they announced yeah local cops and their
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:47.220]  squad cars will be able to dial in to our most high-powered satellites
[3:03:47.220 --> 3:03:52.060]  including radio satellites that see through clouds I mean they'll focus right
[3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:56.980]  in on a pimple on your butt I told you years ago they do that why I read
[3:03:56.980 --> 3:04:00.540]  federal documents and it started seven years ago in Australia using the
[3:04:00.540 --> 3:04:05.460]  British Commonwealth ones to spy and harass the citizens and land grab and
[3:04:05.460 --> 3:04:10.300]  the rest of it now the first place they announced it was 2003 in Green Bay the
[3:04:10.300 --> 3:04:14.500]  governor of Wisconsin said oh yeah under this new telecommunications act that
[3:04:14.500 --> 3:04:20.900]  became law October 1st 2001 passed in 96 but it had to be integrated by then we
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:25.620]  can track all cell phones in real time so the cops now just enter a code in
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:29.780]  Green Bay and it's spreading and then your cell phone pops up in real time
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:34.380]  they can also dial in and listen to you so when you read this in the Seattle
[3:04:34.380 --> 3:04:38.740]  Post intelligence sir it's telling you about cops calling and getting permission
[3:04:38.740 --> 3:04:41.980]  no no in most cities they've already gotten to the point of not even doing
[3:04:41.980 --> 3:04:49.860]  that no fourth amendment no nothing okay it is a big idea a new world order in
[3:04:49.860 --> 3:04:58.380]  the near future earth is dominated by the builder bird put their objective
[3:04:58.380 --> 3:05:04.020]  the world domination for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they

[3:08:45.620 --> 3:08:49.620]  nations that you would have free speech but oh no he's not allowed to have his
[3:08:49.620 --> 3:08:54.340]  own political views he's not allowed to say who he likes who he wants they can
[3:08:54.340 --> 3:08:59.220]  only have the controlled government owned BBC and others put out their spin
[3:08:59.220 --> 3:09:02.660]  which is clearly for a candidate but where they don't actually voice it and
[3:09:02.660 --> 3:09:05.820]  by the way Hillary Clinton says she wants the quote fairness doctrine here
[3:09:05.820 --> 3:09:11.300]  to until 88 we couldn't have free speech on talk radio in the US so they're
[3:09:11.300 --> 3:09:14.780]  trying to bring us back into the dark ages as well whereas with England they
[3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:17.980]  previously had free speech now they've taken it away this is the country where
[3:09:17.980 --> 3:09:22.180]  Robin Page BBC presenter in a private speech he gave separate from his TV
[3:09:22.180 --> 3:09:26.300]  job said I believe that rural communities deserve the same rights as
[3:09:26.300 --> 3:09:29.820]  Muslims and homosexuals he wasn't bashing either group but they said the
[3:09:29.820 --> 3:09:35.340]  word homosexual is insulting scientific terms upset people and that is seen as a
[3:09:35.340 --> 3:09:39.220]  thought crime and they have groups of people in restaurants spying on citizens
[3:09:39.220 --> 3:09:45.180]  now to see what they're saying headline hundreds raided in hate speech raid so
[3:09:45.180 --> 3:09:50.140]  so so this is a new dark ages of control all done by the velvet fist of the fake
[3:09:50.140 --> 3:09:56.020]  liberals so we can come in any party any shape or size but the good news is as
[3:09:56.020 --> 3:10:01.020]  he's fighting back he is instantly organized a online radio show and a
[3:10:01.020 --> 3:10:05.100]  website and has instantly since he got fired last week started a daily radio
[3:10:05.100 --> 3:10:09.620]  show that he'll do right when this one ends coming up in about 50 minutes and
[3:10:09.620 --> 3:10:13.740]  this is a mission to get everybody to listen to James Whale to fight back
[3:10:13.740 --> 3:10:18.860]  against the UK government who is attempting to stifle the will and free
[3:10:18.860 --> 3:10:24.540]  speech of its subjects who want to be free human beings and so now we go to
[3:10:24.540 --> 3:10:30.580]  James Whale joining us from England James really sorry to hear that your
[3:10:30.580 --> 3:10:33.540]  voice has been taken off the national airwaves in the UK
[3:10:33.540 --> 3:10:37.460]  Alex thank you very much indeed nice to talk to you the tables have been turned
[3:10:37.460 --> 3:10:43.540]  normally I I'm interviewing you this is an interesting departure for me thank
[3:10:43.540 --> 3:10:47.260]  you for that my friend listen here in the home of the Magna Carta the home of
[3:10:47.260 --> 3:10:52.740]  democracy we are told let me tell you the free free speech in this country
[3:10:52.740 --> 3:10:59.420]  doesn't exist there are so many rules and regulations surrounding what I am and
[3:10:59.420 --> 3:11:04.620]  I'm not allowed to say and but for 13 years on this last radio station for
[3:11:04.620 --> 3:11:11.780]  35 years over my radio career I've done this Alex and now because I am
[3:11:11.780 --> 3:11:18.420]  beginning to actually make sense to the majority of people in the UK they have
[3:11:18.420 --> 3:11:21.940]  tried to pull the plug but they won't silence me because that's why your show
[3:11:21.940 --> 3:11:26.780]  has gotten your show has gotten more and more popular really you know gaining
[3:11:26.780 --> 3:11:31.460]  exponentially you're saying they will not silence you certainly not I hope they
[3:11:31.460 --> 3:11:36.900]  don't come clap you in irons for having your having your own internet radio show
[3:11:36.900 --> 3:11:40.820]  tell us about the website tell us what you're launching okay well listen I a
[3:11:40.820 --> 3:11:45.540]  few months ago I realized that the future of broadcasting not just on the
[3:11:45.540 --> 3:11:50.860]  radio but on television as well is the internet okay because you and I and
[3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:54.820]  anybody else could start up their radio station we don't have to be controlled
[3:11:54.820 --> 3:12:00.900]  by other people and so I launched James Whale radio dot com and at the moment I
[3:12:00.900 --> 3:12:04.940]  didn't expect to be going and doing it quite as quickly but at the moment I'm
[3:12:04.940 --> 3:12:08.220]  doing I'm keeping people up to date when we finish talking I shall go and talk
[3:12:08.220 --> 3:12:11.740]  on on that some people can listen to James Whale radio dot com later and hear
[3:12:11.740 --> 3:12:16.900]  what I have to say but hopefully in the very near future like you do I should be
[3:12:16.900 --> 3:12:20.100]  going live on the air as well I'll be doing the podcast I'll be doing
[3:12:20.100 --> 3:12:25.660]  interviews and stuff like that there are so many restrictions regarding what
[3:12:25.660 --> 3:12:30.340]  somebody on the air can and cannot say and the thing that worried me is I've
[3:12:30.340 --> 3:12:33.660]  got away with it I mean people know people have generally said oh that's
[3:12:33.660 --> 3:12:38.380]  James Whale we know you know you don't don't um that's because you were already
[3:12:38.380 --> 3:12:43.740]  institutionalized for 40 something years now they've come at you but exactly
[3:12:43.740 --> 3:12:47.380]  once you already had some power you were still able to have some free speech but
[3:12:47.380 --> 3:12:50.020]  the fact that you were a canary in the coal mine the fact that they've gone
[3:12:50.020 --> 3:12:55.100]  after you listen let me tell you what what the catalyst for this was I don't
[3:12:55.100 --> 3:12:59.220]  blame the radio station because the radio station were lent on from above the
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:04.100]  radio stations be my home has facilitated me to be able to warn people
[3:13:04.100 --> 3:13:08.940]  about what is really happening out there we're living in the United Kingdom
[3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:15.260]  this is the most filmed and photographed country in Europe you cannot move in this
[3:13:15.260 --> 3:13:21.940]  country without being followed by a CCTV camera okay yesterday a report came out
[3:13:21.940 --> 3:13:26.980]  saying that that is only solved 3% of crime what are the cameras for they're
[3:13:26.980 --> 3:13:33.580]  not fighting crime as we were told and I said to the listeners to the public get
[3:13:33.580 --> 3:13:38.100]  out there and vote in the next election local national European whatever it is
[3:13:38.100 --> 3:13:43.540]  and you know a couple of days ago they went out and voted in their millions and
[3:13:43.540 --> 3:13:48.140]  it has never happened before we have had the highest turnout ever of local
[3:13:48.140 --> 3:13:54.260]  elections the mayor of London like the mayor of New York had his ass kicked he
[3:13:54.260 --> 3:13:58.420]  was kicked out of power and another guy with a blonde mop of hair and a bit of a
[3:13:58.420 --> 3:14:04.580]  Joker got into power now I don't like to think that I was the only cause of this
[3:14:04.580 --> 3:14:10.100]  but I I happen to say when the Prime Minister said he thought that the guy
[3:14:10.100 --> 3:14:13.860]  who is the mayor of London or was Ken Livingston was the best person for the
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:17.780]  job I happen to say something along the lines of hey if the Prime Minister is
[3:14:17.780 --> 3:14:21.740]  going for Ken I better go for the other guy surely the weight of the whale
[3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:27.740]  should that be better make things fair but I immediately contravened an act
[3:14:27.740 --> 3:14:31.180]  saying that you have to with a run-up to an election we can have free speech
[3:14:31.180 --> 3:14:37.060]  until a few weeks before an election and then when the election is in the process
[3:14:37.060 --> 3:14:42.260]  we have to just say nothing now James let me be clear this wasn't enforced yet
[3:14:42.260 --> 3:14:47.460]  and now it's suddenly been enforced here under campaign finance reform really
[3:14:47.460 --> 3:14:53.940]  that that Bush signed in 2002 they claimed that six weeks before an
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:14:57.900]  election I can't have political speech and you know what I went on air I said
[3:14:57.900 --> 3:15:01.740]  go ahead government come after me but I have a network that'll stand behind me
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:05.820]  but now they're talking about coming after me coming after others so it's
[3:15:05.820 --> 3:15:11.020]  the exact same crap what are we gonna do Alex I mean I you know I don't want to
[3:15:11.020 --> 3:15:15.100]  be too too molded about this but you know this is my job I don't I don't make
[3:15:15.100 --> 3:15:18.660]  huge amounts of money I mean I make a lot enough money to live but the that
[3:15:18.660 --> 3:15:23.340]  suddenly I find myself without any income and I find myself being sort of
[3:15:23.340 --> 3:15:29.980]  spurned at every door I'm not gonna lie down and take this I'm telling you well
[3:15:29.980 --> 3:15:34.260]  I hear you people should go to Jameswell radio.com we got a big fat link to it up
[3:15:34.260 --> 3:15:40.100]  on info wars.com I'm gonna put the document cam up for the viewers right
[3:15:40.100 --> 3:15:44.060]  now so they can see your website there on the screen we're also doing a live
[3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:49.380]  TV show in this fourth hour every day and then if they look on their screen
[3:15:49.380 --> 3:15:55.060]  you'll see radio presenter Whale sacked after urging listeners to vote for Boris
[3:15:55.060 --> 3:15:59.540]  Johnson and again they selectively enforced because I've heard other
[3:15:59.540 --> 3:16:04.460]  London radio shows yours is national yeah fawning after the Communist fawning I
[3:16:04.460 --> 3:16:11.020]  mean this last mayor you had he was a quite a establishment whore well let me
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:15.220]  tell you that the Ken who I have known had dinner with a few times before he
[3:16:15.220 --> 3:16:19.140]  came became mayor affable but as soon as he became mayor he didn't like to speak
[3:16:19.140 --> 3:16:25.820]  to me um this this this guy introduced the congestion charge now this means
[3:16:25.820 --> 3:16:31.420]  that you me anyone who drives into the capital city of the United Kingdom has
[3:16:31.420 --> 3:16:36.220]  to pay for the privilege and if you if you don't pay if you forget to pay then
[3:16:36.220 --> 3:16:40.660]  you get fined over a hundred bucks they impound your car some of the time I've
[3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:45.600]  seen that on the news and they will crush it they also want to put
[3:16:45.600 --> 3:16:51.900]  transponders in all your cars to track their following us every way we go yet
[3:16:51.900 --> 3:16:58.220]  at the moment that the vandalism and the you know the the yobos on the street
[3:16:58.220 --> 3:17:03.740]  corners hey listen let me tell you this big big story in the news today the
[3:17:03.740 --> 3:17:08.380]  police are now not going I don't know if you have the term vandalism in America
[3:17:08.380 --> 3:17:12.780]  oh yes they run around breaking lights spray-painting well this apparently now
[3:17:12.780 --> 3:17:17.980]  according to the police in in Britain is not going to be recorded as a crime
[3:17:17.980 --> 3:17:23.020]  figure oh let me stop you I'm gonna stop you right there I've had my car stolen
[3:17:23.020 --> 3:17:27.100]  twice cops won't come out I've had the house broken into they don't come out
[3:17:27.100 --> 3:17:31.540]  but they're all over the street riding his tickets raising money off of us for
[3:17:31.540 --> 3:17:34.580]  going a couple miles over the speed limit oh listen it's a it's the same in
[3:17:34.580 --> 3:17:37.500]  the United Kingdom I mean if you call the police and you say I've got an
[3:17:37.500 --> 3:17:41.540]  intruder they don't come I I like to shoot bows and arrows we talked about
[3:17:41.540 --> 3:17:44.180]  this before yeah but then you're not even allowed to have guns that's right
[3:17:44.180 --> 3:17:47.620]  they won't they won't come for violent stuff there but then you're not but it
[3:17:47.620 --> 3:17:51.500]  but a hell of a will work nicely won't it exactly and and you know that they'll
[3:17:51.500 --> 3:17:55.900]  come after me if I was to do that but I am not allowing my family to be in any
[3:17:55.900 --> 3:18:01.260]  kind of danger at all I'm listen I I occasionally break the speed limit do
[3:18:01.260 --> 3:18:08.260]  you yes okay the week after next I'm going on what they very kindly allowed
[3:18:08.260 --> 3:18:12.580]  me to go on a speed awareness course you know when you get a ticket they put
[3:18:12.580 --> 3:18:18.420]  points on your license that they find you yes now if you're lucky they say
[3:18:18.420 --> 3:18:22.420]  listen we're not gonna we're not gonna put points on your your license but if

[3:18:40.940 --> 3:18:44.820]  against the old mayor the new mayor did get elected you had tens of millions of
[3:18:44.820 --> 3:18:48.180]  listeners I have no doubt that you helped swing the pendulum and the reason I
[3:18:48.180 --> 3:18:53.940]  know that is I've been on probably 50 60 or more other radio shows and and and
[3:18:53.940 --> 3:18:59.020]  yours was the strongest out there I would call most the others just the
[3:18:59.020 --> 3:19:07.100]  simpering ninning literally they sounded like castrated nymphs won't stand up to
[3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:13.340]  authority the British do not like to make a fuss the British like to bow their
[3:19:13.340 --> 3:19:21.740]  heads and apologize if somebody says to them you can't do that what you need is
[3:19:21.740 --> 3:19:26.660]  a bunch of crazy rednecks over there I don't know we're pretty cowardly over

[3:26:21.020 --> 3:26:28.460]  gonna have a go at Al Gore the big fat boy and the global warming issue and he
[3:26:28.460 --> 3:26:34.580]  has brought a lot of proof to bear that this whole fallacy about green issues
[3:26:34.580 --> 3:26:40.620]  global warming and everything else is nothing more than scared tactics by
[3:26:40.620 --> 3:26:44.340]  certain interested parties and these interested well yeah he admitted that
[3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:48.660]  their own government report was staged and and documents have come out that
[3:26:48.660 --> 3:26:51.900]  they admitted to global tax it's a total yeah absolutely do you know what
[3:26:51.900 --> 3:26:59.180]  happened is a fact for you the planet has not warmed up for over 10 years yeah
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:04.380]  we've been cooling 1998 we started to cool and we haven't done anything other
[3:27:04.380 --> 3:27:09.900]  than that well I know that the earth is the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever
[3:27:09.900 --> 3:27:13.380]  recorded going back hundreds of thousands of years and yeah ice core we
[3:27:13.380 --> 3:27:17.700]  need carbon dioxide but you know the general public so dumb over here you
[3:27:17.700 --> 3:27:20.860]  can walk up to them and give them a scientific name for table salt or water
[3:27:20.860 --> 3:27:25.060]  and they'll say they'll say ban it they think carbon dioxide is like is like
[3:27:25.060 --> 3:27:29.700]  uranium or something yeah I mean we have this wonderful thing the carbon tax
[3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:34.540]  now and people are encouraged to have the lowest carbon footprint they can
[3:27:34.540 --> 3:27:37.860]  have what does that mean it's anti-human it's a way to regulate and

[3:38:27.260 --> 3:38:33.500]  sovereignty can we no it's a it's a huge problem if you cannot do a talk
[3:38:33.500 --> 3:38:38.940]  radio show unless you have a point of view I don't care what your point of
[3:38:38.940 --> 3:38:44.980]  view is but you have to have a point of view and it's not acceptable to suddenly
[3:38:44.980 --> 3:38:49.220]  say to somebody you know you can't you can't think this you can't think that
[3:38:49.220 --> 3:38:54.100]  you can't say this you can't say that otherwise we have no freedom of speech
[3:38:54.100 --> 3:38:58.540]  and then the entire population young people growing up model their speech
[3:38:58.540 --> 3:39:03.540]  off of news off of talk radio and that's why we have a generation of people in
[3:39:03.540 --> 3:39:06.260]  this country and in your country and because we used to have this here too
[3:39:06.260 --> 3:39:10.140]  where they always say that they don't have an opinion or couch everything like
[3:39:10.140 --> 3:39:14.460]  lawyers successful talk radio the number one rule I know you know this is that
[3:39:14.460 --> 3:39:18.620]  you have an opinion and you stick with it and that you don't back off do you
[3:39:18.620 --> 3:39:24.300]  know how many talk radio stations we have in the UK not many well we have one
[3:39:24.300 --> 3:39:29.100]  national one which was the one I was on these are commercial stations not the
[3:39:29.100 --> 3:39:35.420]  BBC obviously they don't have any either we have three local talk radio
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:42.140]  stations one in London one in Edinburgh and one in Liverpool and that is it I
[3:39:42.140 --> 3:39:47.700]  must have been on a bunch of their shows then because I've been on a few in
[3:39:47.700 --> 3:39:53.660]  London a few in Scotland quite a few in Ireland and and then I you know the more
[3:39:53.660 --> 3:39:58.100]  I think about it usually it was just a handful of station hosts yeah and they
[3:39:58.100 --> 3:40:02.620]  would usually snivel at me and laugh at me and or they'd call up saying they
[3:40:02.620 --> 3:40:05.780]  were friendly which they could have said they hated me and I would have come on
[3:40:05.780 --> 3:40:09.020]  yeah and then I'd get on air and I later learned that it was a tape show and
[3:40:09.020 --> 3:40:14.660]  they'd cut it up and then make fun of me so but so I guess it's okay to then have
[3:40:14.660 --> 3:40:18.700]  a view the government's good surveillance is good so you actually James you
[3:40:18.700 --> 3:40:22.420]  can't have a view just so long as it's groveling and worshiping the government
[3:40:22.420 --> 3:40:27.140]  most people are frightened who are on the air in this country they want to suck
[3:40:27.140 --> 3:40:31.740]  up to the people who employ them I have been very very lucky that my employers
[3:40:31.740 --> 3:40:36.940]  have encouraged me over the years to be controversial because nobody else in this
[3:40:36.940 --> 3:40:43.020]  country has done it now I overstepped the mark up and to be quite honest with
[3:40:43.020 --> 3:40:46.820]  you I actually didn't mean to do it some of it slipped out of my mouth
[3:40:46.820 --> 3:40:50.860]  criminal exactly Winston may have may have been speaking in his sleep when
[3:40:50.860 --> 3:40:57.260]  the telescreen picked it up you know but I'm and I I don't know I I have to
[3:40:57.260 --> 3:41:01.620]  say I I have no animosity to them if you know if at some point they'd like to
[3:41:01.620 --> 3:41:06.100]  offer me a job back I may well be prepared to say yes say or sorry to
[3:41:06.100 --> 3:41:10.980]  BB say apologize to big brother before they send you to the chestnut cafe
[3:41:10.980 --> 3:41:15.980]  hey but you know I have discovered that the place for broadcasters is the
[3:41:15.980 --> 3:41:19.820]  internet and that is the place where there is freedom of speech and there is
[3:41:19.820 --> 3:41:25.740]  freedom of expression and in this country we have no hardly any internet
[3:41:25.740 --> 3:41:31.100]  radio to talk off we got a few stations that play music I can put a CD in my car
[3:41:31.100 --> 3:41:35.580]  or in my my mp3 hang on I'm gonna just turn that off for one moment because
[3:41:35.580 --> 3:41:41.220]  that's my that's my my other phone I have to hang on do you like my July a
[3:41:41.220 --> 3:41:48.820]  ringtone yes it's very nice I what was it it was some gangster rap that I
[3:41:48.820 --> 3:41:54.380]  recorded from some radio station in America but I had to stop it before the
[3:41:54.380 --> 3:41:59.540]  rude words in view well James you know in the time we've got here I agree that
[3:41:59.540 --> 3:42:05.740]  it's the future but we need the old media to energize the new media and and
[3:42:05.740 --> 3:42:10.220]  that's what I've done I've used old media platforms yeah starting out access
[3:42:10.220 --> 3:42:14.940]  TV then local radio the syndicated radio to then energize the new media and
[3:42:14.940 --> 3:42:18.620]  then and then together the two have a synergy and so that's why I think it's
[3:42:18.620 --> 3:42:23.540]  important that you get booked on as many UK shows as you can to launch your new
[3:42:23.540 --> 3:42:27.300]  website that's why I hope people will visit it will spread the word about it
[3:42:27.300 --> 3:42:32.020]  because we need we need to see you rise out of the ashes like a phoenix I was on
[3:42:32.020 --> 3:42:37.980]  the sky TV this morning talking about the news I I'm on once a week at the
[3:42:37.980 --> 3:42:42.700]  moment on sky television which is a satellite TV station like CNN over here
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:46.660]  broadcast all over the world and I'm doing I'm doing a few things so I'm
[3:42:46.660 --> 3:42:51.620]  I'm sitting here and reorganizing myself now I understand tell us about the radio
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:55.540]  show how you just started it you've got it coming up live in about 15 minutes
[3:42:55.540 --> 3:42:58.780]  tell us a little bit about what you're gonna do on that show that you didn't
[3:42:58.780 --> 3:43:03.620]  do on the Big Brother program well at the moment I'm just gonna be talking we
[3:43:03.620 --> 3:43:06.980]  don't have the facility to take calls and think live on air and I'm gonna I'm
[3:43:06.980 --> 3:43:11.620]  gonna talk to your people about how we can we could we can learn from you but
[3:43:11.620 --> 3:43:14.100]  I'm gonna be sitting here I'm just gonna be going through the newspapers and
[3:43:14.100 --> 3:43:17.020]  gonna be referring to some of the emails that people have sent me and stuff like
[3:43:17.020 --> 3:43:21.300]  that and also what we're probably gonna do tonight is what we're gonna replay
[3:43:21.300 --> 3:43:25.500]  for the people who happen to be able to hear your radio show you and me on the
[3:43:25.500 --> 3:43:30.380]  last hour we're gonna replay this on James Whale radio.com as well good
[3:43:30.380 --> 3:43:33.420]  absolutely I asked you to do that and that's a that's a good idea thanks for
[3:43:33.420 --> 3:43:39.580]  doing that but I mean you can't tell me that it's not wrong that they fired you
[3:43:39.580 --> 3:43:43.140]  I mean I understand you're trying to be friendly you're still doing a spot on
[3:43:43.140 --> 3:43:47.940]  international TV through the same company so I understand why you're trying to
[3:43:47.940 --> 3:43:53.700]  make nice but they have fired you from your main job if three complaints from
[3:43:53.700 --> 3:43:58.900]  haters of free speech and lovers of that monster big brother mayor you had that
[3:43:58.900 --> 3:44:03.420]  could do this what about listeners contacting talk sport and politely
[3:44:03.420 --> 3:44:08.620]  telling them and and what about them contacting the little control freaks at
[3:44:08.620 --> 3:44:13.780]  the government body and telling them that that this is seen as a real attack
[3:44:13.780 --> 3:44:18.700]  on free speech whether or not that will have any any effect at all I don't know
[3:44:18.700 --> 3:44:21.980]  but if people want to do that there are people who are organizing all sorts of
[3:44:21.980 --> 3:44:27.940]  campaigns I would be I'd be very humble for them to do that but I think I have to
[3:44:27.940 --> 3:44:33.980]  now you know they got rid of me I have to look towards the future and I have to
[3:44:33.980 --> 3:44:38.700]  look after my own interest and and and try and and make something out of this
[3:44:38.700 --> 3:44:45.540]  Alex like you have absolutely anything else I mean many other times you were
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:49.620]  biting your lip where you wanted to say something but you self-censored you know
[3:44:49.620 --> 3:44:52.540]  just the thought of having to think about what you're going to say is
[3:44:52.540 --> 3:44:57.380]  censorship itself many have found looking at the basic psychology or are you
[3:44:57.380 --> 3:45:02.740]  afraid that they may nail you to the cross things you say now I'm not afraid
[3:45:02.740 --> 3:45:07.620]  what so ever then engage in thought crime right now tell us what James well
[3:45:07.620 --> 3:45:11.060]  really thinks about Tony Blair what he really thinks go ahead all right well
[3:45:11.060 --> 3:45:13.740]  I've said this before and this may have something to do with my present situation
[3:45:13.740 --> 3:45:17.860]  I mean Tony Blair was the biggest liability that this country has ever
[3:45:17.860 --> 3:45:22.420]  suffered and I said this before on radio I've said it in newspapers I've said it
[3:45:22.420 --> 3:45:26.020]  on television let me tell you when Tony Blair came to power because people were
[3:45:26.020 --> 3:45:30.340]  bored with the old Tories and people do get bored unless unless the politicians
[3:45:30.340 --> 3:45:34.260]  connect with them and when they forget to connect then people get bored and they
[3:45:34.260 --> 3:45:39.220]  go somewhere else Tony Blair came in with his grinning smile and his lying
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:46.660]  ways and he ruined the country he came in with 50 billion pounds in the chest in
[3:45:46.660 --> 3:45:50.980]  the black and he left office with something like a hundred billion pounds
[3:45:50.980 --> 3:45:55.700]  in debt most of this because of his ridiculous relationship with your
[3:45:55.700 --> 3:46:01.740]  George Bush and and the fact that they took us into this illegal war in Iraq
[3:46:01.740 --> 3:46:06.940]  and Afghanistan where we are allowing our men and women to be killed we are
[3:46:06.940 --> 3:46:12.300]  allowing people to spend billions of of dollars and billions of pounds which we
[3:46:12.300 --> 3:46:18.140]  can't afford my friend we cannot afford it and this is where it has to stop you
[3:46:18.140 --> 3:46:21.620]  know the people of Britain and I dare say a lot of the people in America when
[3:46:21.620 --> 3:46:27.460]  they learn the truth did not want us to go to war they didn't see any reason why
[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:32.300]  we should flatten Iraq why we should kill so many innocent people and allow
[3:46:32.300 --> 3:46:37.900]  so many of our people to be killed somebody has got to speak out it's got
[3:46:37.900 --> 3:46:45.380]  to stop and we actually have the power if we did but know it but if the people
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:49.540]  on the airwaves aren't allowed to ever say their views how are the people ever
[3:46:49.540 --> 3:46:54.300]  going to get together this is designed to neutralize the people having their
[3:46:54.300 --> 3:46:59.180]  will heard in government I mean it's it's that simple yeah I mean you know it's
[3:46:59.180 --> 3:47:02.940]  the same in America I presume is here but if you are writing in a newspaper you
[3:47:02.940 --> 3:47:09.820]  can say whatever you like you can have a view on anything so therefore why why is
[3:47:09.820 --> 3:47:15.980]  the the radio and the TV to a certain extent different James how did this go
[3:47:15.980 --> 3:47:20.820]  down when they called you in and fired you for your thought crime well they
[3:47:20.820 --> 3:47:26.220]  didn't they they phoned me up and told me they didn't call me in and what did
[3:47:26.220 --> 3:47:30.900]  they say how did it go but well I just said listen James very sorry but we
[3:47:30.900 --> 3:47:35.220]  can't we you know you're gonna have to go we can't we can't accept this sort of
[3:47:35.220 --> 3:47:39.060]  behavior and that was it really I mean I said oh right okay I was a bit shocked I
[3:47:39.060 --> 3:47:44.060]  have to be honest with you James we could not accept this type of behavior free
[3:47:44.060 --> 3:47:51.540]  speech in England what do you think this is a free country you have to you
[3:47:51.540 --> 3:47:54.660]  have to understand that at this particular moment in time I can't say
[3:47:54.660 --> 3:48:00.540]  much about that obviously because my lawyers are looking over it I understand
[3:48:00.540 --> 3:48:06.180]  but is there any chance I mean to get you back on air I mean I would imagine I
[3:48:06.180 --> 3:48:13.940]  mean being on the same station for I mean close to 15 years that has got to
[3:48:13.940 --> 3:48:19.380]  really a huge audience has to really upset all of your fans I bet they are
[3:48:19.380 --> 3:48:23.460]  just hammer who do they replace you with I don't know I mean I think that they
[3:48:23.460 --> 3:48:27.020]  they haven't even thought that far and they'll replace me with somebody who is
[3:48:27.020 --> 3:48:31.340]  a very safe bet well what do they have on the air right now I say again what do
[3:48:31.340 --> 3:48:36.180]  they have on right now I didn't you know when I I never have bothered to listen
[3:48:36.180 --> 3:48:39.860]  when I'm not on if I'm not on if I'm on holiday I'm not one of these paranoid
[3:48:39.860 --> 3:48:43.820]  people who listens to see whether the guy on instead of me is any better or
[3:48:43.820 --> 3:48:47.500]  any worse no but I mean I would want to know at least I mean they probably got
[3:48:47.500 --> 3:48:51.660]  somebody in there doing sewing lessons or how to play patty cake or how to lick
[3:48:51.660 --> 3:48:56.340]  black boots or how to how to how to worship a surveillance camera I mean
[3:48:56.340 --> 3:48:59.660]  I have surveillance cameras that shout orders at you it sounds like sounds like
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:05.220]  freedom to me James I don't know and I don't care if they if they decide
[3:49:05.220 --> 3:49:10.180]  that the public would like to have me back on air then maybe they will say
[3:49:10.180 --> 3:49:13.580]  listen James you know perhaps we can we can come to some arrangement we can
[3:49:13.580 --> 3:49:18.860]  bury the hatchet I don't know but I do know that I will continue to improve the
[3:49:18.860 --> 3:49:23.900]  presence and improve the sort of free radio if you like but we can get on the
[3:49:23.900 --> 3:49:27.660]  internet without any fear well I agree but this sounds like Vladimir Putin where
[3:49:27.660 --> 3:49:31.700]  he fires people from private stations because he doesn't like him I mean is
[3:49:31.700 --> 3:49:37.300]  the UK like Russia no I UK the radio stations have no choice they are told
[3:49:37.300 --> 3:49:42.740]  by this this organization so offcom so it's Russia it is Russia let's admit
[3:49:42.740 --> 3:49:47.140]  what it is out the licenses to broadcast if you don't do what we tell you we will
[3:49:47.140 --> 3:49:54.660]  take your license away well that is obscene that is that needs to be abolished
[3:49:54.660 --> 3:50:00.900]  England needs to be free and the creatures that are running it I mean
[3:50:00.900 --> 3:50:04.020]  your establishment is totally trying to enslave you I mean there's no doubt
[3:50:04.020 --> 3:50:09.340]  they're squeezing the peasantry and I'm gonna be living in the woods hunting
[3:50:09.340 --> 3:50:13.180]  with my bow and arrow just to keep myself alive for the next few months
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:16.620]  well how are you doing money wise I hope you get some big sponsors looks like
[3:50:16.620 --> 3:50:20.540]  you've already got some for James well radio well I mean I at the moment is a
[3:50:20.540 --> 3:50:23.980]  bit touch and go but I hope in the next few weeks that we will be able to sign
[3:50:23.980 --> 3:50:28.340]  some people up and help hopefully we'll get some people to support a new free
[3:50:28.340 --> 3:50:33.060]  form of broadcasting here in the UK maybe we can maybe we can open a branch
[3:50:33.060 --> 3:50:39.100]  of prison planet UK or something yes maybe we can get the mayor of London to
[3:50:39.100 --> 3:50:46.020]  give you a job as a city broadcaster we'll be right back with James well it
[3:50:46.020 --> 3:50:56.020]  is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by the

[3:51:56.460 --> 3:52:00.380]  agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation our
[3:52:00.380 --> 3:52:03.780]  forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom
[3:52:03.780 --> 3:52:07.100]  liberty of conscience history and the Bible proved to them that these two
[3:52:07.100 --> 3:52:11.420]  systems church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of God and
[3:52:11.420 --> 3:52:15.500]  of country that prompts or constraints us this will change the character not
[3:52:15.500 --> 3:52:19.100]  civil enforcement from history we saw that when church and state united known
[3:52:19.100 --> 3:52:23.020]  as papal Rome religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly
[3:52:23.020 --> 3:52:26.820]  contrary to the great principles of our nation America and papal Rome are

[3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:34.460]  and I'm an artist and I know how to look at the letters and it's not the same
[3:55:34.460 --> 3:55:41.620]  different different person big time man this is really really bad but it had to

[3:56:16.860 --> 3:56:21.940]  taking me serious in the UK I I wondered just a few weeks ago when I was on how
[3:56:21.940 --> 3:56:26.460]  you were still on the air I guess you got sacked a few days after that well
[3:56:26.460 --> 3:56:30.500]  yeah a couple of weeks now a couple of weeks now but thank you Alex very much
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:33.460]  indeed it's a pleasure to be on your program I love to talk to you I love to
[3:56:33.460 --> 3:56:38.140]  listen to your show and I'm a huge fan as you know well we're a fan of what
[3:56:38.140 --> 3:56:40.980]  you're doing we were a fan of you fighting the European Union taking over
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:45.260]  England in closing they said with the European Constitution they promised
[3:56:45.260 --> 3:56:49.060]  you'd be able to vote on it then they lied and didn't allow that yeah plus
[3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:51.660]  percent in the polls I mean you live there you know better than I but most
[3:56:51.660 --> 3:56:54.900]  polls I see are 80 plus percent are against the European Union why are you
[3:56:54.900 --> 3:57:00.380]  still being sucked into it we have no no choice we have not been allowed allowed
[3:57:00.380 --> 3:57:05.060]  to have our say I suppose you know it's like everything else if you went to the
[3:57:05.060 --> 3:57:08.660]  polls and you said do you want to bring back capital punishment which we don't
[3:57:08.660 --> 3:57:13.140]  have in this country the majority of people would say yes if you were to
[3:57:13.140 --> 3:57:15.860]  say do you want to be a member of the European Union the majority of people
[3:57:15.860 --> 3:57:22.180]  would say no if you would say do you want to cut the tax on fuel the majority
[3:57:22.180 --> 3:57:28.220]  of people would say yes so I'm I'm at a loss to know Alex where democracy
[3:57:28.220 --> 3:57:33.860]  actually is anymore well I mean that's it they tax you to social engineer and
[3:57:33.860 --> 3:57:37.860]  destroy the middle class so they have full control and then they order the
[3:57:37.860 --> 3:57:42.060]  police to not stop real criminals but to go out and write you tickets so you
[3:57:42.060 --> 3:57:46.020]  beg for more police so that they can write you more tickets James Whale
