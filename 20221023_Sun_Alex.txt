[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.000 --> 00:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have an absolutely loaded Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show here on this October 23, 2022.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  Now I have no time to waste, so let me get right into the news.
[00:44.000 --> 00:56.000]  Now in China, Xi Jinping has now been given more power than any Chinese dictator, even more than Mao Zedong.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  But you could say that was the last dictator in China that had as much authoritarian power as Xi Jinping.
[01:03.000 --> 01:14.000]  But Xi Jinping is now surpassing even Mao Zedong, the Communist leader with hundreds of millions of dead Chinese people under his watch.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  That's what the left-wing ideology always concludes with.
[01:17.000 --> 01:31.000]  And so in a display of his power for the world and a display of his coldness and his callousness towards anybody else that might think they are on the same page as him,
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  former Chinese leader is escorted out of Communist Party Congress in front of world media.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  And you can see it in the clip here.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  He is confused.
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  Hu Zhintao, former Chinese president, Hu Zhintao is confused as security comes to grab him away.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  And Xi Jinping won't even look at him.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And Zhintao grabs him and tries to say, hey, what is this?
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  This is some misunderstanding.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Why am I being escorted out by security?
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  What the heck is going on here?
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  Kind of refuses it at first.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  And then he says, what's going on?
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  And Xi just shakes his head and says, yep, you got to go.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  Yep, that's it for you.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  I am the unilateral dictator now.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  And just like in 1984, we are going to erase the history.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  We are going to erase the past because nobody can be thought of as president ever in Chinese history except me, Xi Jinping.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  And so when you consider that aggression towards his own fellow party members and leaders,
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  imagine what they'll do to Taiwan or Hong Kong in the near future.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  As they know, Joe Biden is a weak leader of America.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  So that's what's going on there.
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  Then, and it's been very few people outside of Info Wars, folks, very few people have been willing to tell you this.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  But of course, we right here at Info Wars have been telling you this.
[02:55.000 --> 03:04.000]  The United States Army already has soldiers on the front lines fighting Russians in Ukraine.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  This has been going on for months.
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.000]  Now, the way the Biden administration has legally justified this, which is a completely illegitimate illegal war against Russia and Ukraine,
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  is they say, oh, these are just volunteers.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  But now they've taken the mask off and they've admitted, yep, the U.S. military is in Ukraine fighting Russians on the front lines.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  No votes in Congress, no declaration of war. They're just doing it.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  Here, let's show you this clip from CBS News this weekend, clip two, as they're now admitting all of it.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  There, America's go-to combat troops.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Go, go, go, go!
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  The soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division now the closest U.S. forces to the fight in Ukraine.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  We join Colonel Edwin Methodus and Brigadier General John Lubas on board a Black Hawk helicopter where we flew along the coast of the Black Sea
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  across those same waters from Russian-held territory in Ukraine, including Crimea.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  Consider Russia now.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  What are you preparing for?
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  We have two major tasks, right, to assure our allies and deter our adversaries from doing anything.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  Fully aware, those adversaries have eyes on everything this close.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Is that part of it?
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  That's the fire department.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  All right, so that's fine, guys. You're going to pull it down.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  Now, I've got multiple news clips. It's the same thing.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  So the order has been given for whatever reason.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  The order has been given this weekend to let the American people know that their army is fighting Russians in Ukraine.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  Go ahead and let the American people know that we are illegally, illegitimately, but now we're showing you.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  We are at war with Russia.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  They've been doing this for months. Now they're actually telling you.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  So that's about six months old that the U.S. military is killing Russians and fighting Russians in Ukraine.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  So what's next? What are they doing now is the question.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[05:07.000 --> 05:15.000]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Info Wars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people,
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  not as of America, but the world, the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  That's why it's so essential today, down more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[06:28.000 --> 06:45.000]  So you just saw the American media this weekend has been given the green light to let you know that you are unofficially at war with Russia in Ukraine.
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  So I don't know why they've decided to roll those reports this weekend.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  I don't know why they've decided to let you know that that's been going on and show you the front lines.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  We've seen other clips, similar clips, but those have been in international news stories, Ukrainian news stories.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  So the green light's been given to the American media.
[07:03.000 --> 07:11.000]  All right, go ahead and let the American people know that we are at war with Russia in Ukraine and that we have troops on the ground right now fighting Russians.
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  Now that's been going on for about six months, but the fact that they're now giving it the green light to let the American public know about it
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  tells me that they're setting up their next phase of this operation right now.
[07:25.000 --> 07:35.000]  So the question then becomes what is the Biden administration going to do to escalate their agenda of war against Russia,
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  which of course any expert and anybody with any sanity knows could lead to a nuclear conflict or even World War Three,
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  which would be devastating to the planet and just a horrific thing.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  But the Biden administration is green lighting that as well.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  Now I don't want to spend too much time on that.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.000]  We covered that in the last segment.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  I'm mentioning it now and I want to move on, but I will just say this in closing.
[07:57.000 --> 08:05.000]  Let's not forget as the mainstream media and the American left comes after Elon Musk because he's an independent thinker.
[08:05.000 --> 08:15.000]  Let's not forget that they were hemming and hawing at Elon Musk earlier this year when he wanted to buy Twitter and it looks like that purchase may go through.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  The liberals at Twitter are trying to put it off till after the midterms because they want to use it to help rig the midterms with the censorship
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  and the Democrat Party propaganda being promoted onto your news feeds and everyone else's news feeds.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  It doesn't know any better.
[08:31.000 --> 08:44.000]  But remember they told Elon Musk, you're greedy, you're selfish, you're a bad person because you could solve world hunger with six billion dollars
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  and you won't do that.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  Why won't you give six billion dollars to the UN to solve world hunger, Elon Musk?
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.000]  You're a bad guy.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  You're a horrible person, Elon Musk.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  You won't give six billion dollars to the UN to solve world hunger.
[08:56.000 --> 09:08.000]  But as of today, the Biden administration has given upwards of nearly one hundred billion dollars to the war in Ukraine.
[09:08.000 --> 09:20.000]  So according to the UN and the American Left, the Biden administration could have solved world hunger twenty times over with the amount of money they've given to Ukraine.
[09:20.000 --> 09:28.000]  But I guess what are we supposed to take from that other than war is more important than solving world hunger to the Biden administration?
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  I don't know how you can take anything other than that away from those two developments.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  But of course, the truth is they were never serious about solving world hunger.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  They were never serious about that six billion dollar to solve world hunger.
[09:41.000 --> 09:48.000]  That was just an attack against Elon Musk because they didn't like what he was doing and they were trying to bully, intimidate and harass him.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  So that's what really gets proven here.
[09:50.000 --> 10:00.000]  But if you believe the propaganda of the left, then you would believe that the Biden administration chooses war over solving world hunger.
[10:00.000 --> 10:08.000]  Now, let's put that issue to rest for the rest of this Alex Jones show transmission.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  By the way, Owen Schreuer, just an honor and a privilege to be with you here this evening.
[10:11.000 --> 10:18.000]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this Sunday evening.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  More news develops over the weekend on the Alex Jones cases and the Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  And I'm not going to do too much commentary on this today. I'm going to show you some other individuals commentary.
[10:30.000 --> 10:42.000]  And we're going to show some commentary from some other shows and podcasts coming up like from Tim Pool over the weekend in the bottom half of this hour.
[10:42.000 --> 10:52.000]  And I will just say this, the lack of coverage of the Alex Jones, Sandy Hook case is actually pretty stunning.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  It's actually pretty amazing.
[10:55.000 --> 11:07.000]  You'd think that journalists or broadcasters or anybody in the media that's concerned about the First Amendment would be up in arms and furious about what's happening to Alex Jones.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  Love them or hate them.
[11:09.000 --> 11:19.000]  Or at least understanding how serious the precedent is being set right now with Alex Jones, just like they did with Internet censorship.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Now they're doing it with the lawfare.
[11:24.000 --> 11:49.000]  And so over the weekend, in case you didn't hear, the lawyers in the Sandy Hook case want $2.75 trillion for Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[11:49.000 --> 11:59.000]  I don't think people realize now when you walk around here, we thought we were going crazy, but the theme music for the Twilight Zone is just like playing in the background somewhere.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  And we're just kind of like, is that you? Is that your phone? Is somebody playing music?
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  Like you open a door.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  And then you go out into the outside of the office and then the music cuts off.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  And then you walk back in.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  What is that noise?
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  Oh, I'm in the Twilight Zone. You thought it was a joke.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  Yeah. Oh, Sandy Hook family, Sue Alex Jones for $55 million.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  What?
[12:33.000 --> 12:46.000]  Sandy Hook family, Sue Alex Jones for $1 billion.
[12:46.000 --> 13:04.000]  Sandy Hook family, Sue Alex Jones for $2.75 trillion.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  Two points. Did I, does that say trillion?
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Trillion?
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  So what's next?
[13:14.000 --> 13:22.000]  Am I going to walk in here tomorrow and it's going to be Alex Jones sued for $4 quadrillion?
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  I had to look it up. What's after a trillion? It's a quadrillion.
[13:27.000 --> 13:36.000]  Do you realize that $2.75 trillion is almost 10% of the entire planet's wealth?
[13:36.000 --> 13:47.000]  Do you realize how absurd this is? Almost 10% of the entire planet's wealth is to be extracted from Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  $2.75 trillion.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  So it just gets more ludicrous. It just gets more ridiculous as the days go on.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  But of course, it's not logic if it can't be applied universally.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Oh, so if you get something wrong, then you have to pay a trillion dollars.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  Well, then how much do the people that lied to us about the vaccines owe us?
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  How much do the people that lied us into wars owe us?
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  $80 quadrillion, $100 quadrillion? A zillion?
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  I mean, where does it stop? Where does it end?
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  But we all know what this is really about.
[14:27.000 --> 14:44.000]  This is about getting Alex Jones off the air. This is about destroying Alex Jones, making an example of him, scalping him politically, culturally, holding his head up like a victory, like a prize, and dancing on the corpse of free speech.
[14:44.000 --> 14:53.000]  And then scaring and intimidating anybody else that might resist the mainstream media, anybody else that might resist the government from a First Amendment perspective,
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  that you better not do that or you're going to have your life destroyed.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  And so we're going to play some other clips.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  Now, I've got some other news coming up, but here's some of the headlines because we are going to be, we have already filed for a retrial.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  We filed for a retrial. They demanded $2.75 trillion. Who do you think are the legitimate people in this case?
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Alex Jones demands new Sandy Hook trial claims half truths, inflamed Connecticut juries passion and prejudice.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  Well, yeah, he couldn't even present a defense. That's at lawncrime.com.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  Andrew Napolitano has written a story at Newsmax. Alex Jones and the freedom of speech.
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  And artist Ariel Pink offered this opinion over the weekend.
[15:33.000 --> 15:44.000]  How could Alex Jones family members not have a rock solid case against Sandy Hook parents for incitement? Are they not innocent? How much more harassment must his family endure?
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  Yeah, I've kind of looked at this and I've said, who's really been defamed here?
[15:50.000 --> 15:59.000]  Who has really been defamed for $2.75 trillion? Whose name are they really saying over and over and defaming for years now?
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[16:05.000 --> 16:14.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed. It's came over.

[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[19:51.000 --> 20:18.000]  You need to experience it, don't wait, you'll be impressed, infowars.com, X3.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  It's the time of the season.
[20:25.000 --> 20:32.000]  So you're 16 days away from the midterm elections and that means the politics are heating up right now
[20:32.000 --> 20:42.000]  and there was a lot of political activity over the weekend including infowars getting a shout out from Robert Francis O'Rourke at a rally this weekend.
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.000]  That's right, Beta O'Rourke gave us a shout out at his rally this weekend.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  Now we've put up the live stream from that event.
[20:51.000 --> 21:00.000]  We took the truck out this weekend downtown Austin and to a beta event and you can find that live stream linked at infowars.com.
[21:00.000 --> 21:08.000]  But we have the HD video never before seen that we're going to be premiering in the last segment today.
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  So folks, you're not going to want to miss it, it's just as entertaining as ever with these complete psychotic nut jobs.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  And we had a little bit of a different twist.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  I had a little bit of a different twist on the truck PA system this weekend.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  I think you're going to enjoy that.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  So stay tuned, that's going to be debuting in the final segment today.
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  But I mentioned that because I want to cover some of the other political activity including another psychotic here.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  This is in Nashville, Matt Walsh had an event in Nashville over the weekend.
[21:38.000 --> 21:45.000]  And so naturally, whenever Matt Walsh has an event, a bunch of psychotic leftist liberals show up and they hate white people.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  They're all white, but that doesn't seem to matter to them.
[21:49.000 --> 21:58.000]  And so here is a classic leftist psycho freaking out that Matt Walsh was in Nashville over the weekend.
[21:58.000 --> 22:19.000]  And clip five.
[22:19.000 --> 22:27.000]  So that's a white man pretending to be a woman putting a bullhorn in a woman's face.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  That's actually illegal. You can't do that, folks.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  You can't put an amplified device in somebody's face.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  And so you are well within your rights.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  I mean, I've been told and I believe it's true.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  If you need to slap away somebody's amplified sound device from giving you tonight as you're well within your rights to do that, that can be considered assault.
[22:45.000 --> 22:54.000]  But she puts her big, gigantic megaphone right in this woman's face and screams, F you cracker, F you whitey, you're going to die alone, you're going to burn in hell.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  You're a fascist.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  This is what the loving left is all about, isn't it?
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  Now, I play that clip because there's a theme here.
[23:04.000 --> 23:12.000]  And the theme has been this way for a while and that's the anti-white bigotry becoming mainstream.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  It's cool to be bigoted against white people.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  It's not considered racist. It's considered trendy.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  It's considered liberal.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  It's considered a good thing.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  And in fact, even today, one of the number one trends on Twitter before I got on air was hashtag white supremacy.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  And it was the American left complaining about white people.
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.000]  And actually their new thing is that white people are stalking black people to kill them.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  I'm not even kidding you.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  And you can find dozens of these videos and these breakdowns.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  And I don't know what these individuals' politics are.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  Most of them are black and they say white folks are hunting down black people.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  Specifically, if they see a black person driving a truck, they try to hunt them down and kill them.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  I'm not even kidding you.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  I could show you the videos of them saying it, but it's so in the margins.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  It's such a tiny minority.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  It's not even worth covering it.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  But I'm going to tell you why I'm mentioning it now.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  So it's totally okay to be an anti-white bigot.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  It's totally okay to say white supremacists run the world.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  That's mainstream.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  That's mainstream leftism, mainstream liberalism.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  You can tweet about white supremacy all day long and that's all good.
[24:27.000 --> 24:36.000]  Heck, you can even be Jamil Hill because what they've noticed is specifically with the Latino population,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  but it's true with the black population as well.
[24:38.000 --> 24:44.000]  But specifically with the Latino population, they're voting more Republican, they're voting more conservative,
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  they're running for office as Republican.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  And so there's a huge right-wing movement inside the Latino community.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  And so Jamil Hill is angry about that because she's a liberal that likes to control you,
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  especially if you have brown skin.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  She wants to control you because she's a bigot.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  And so she now says, just by associating with white people, then you're bad.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  Just by associating with white people, they consider you a white supremacist.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  That proximity to whiteness is a real thing.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  She responds to a story.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  Rhonda Santis is so popular among Florida Latinos.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  He may win Blue County, Miami-Dade, something Republican governor has not done in 20 years.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  So now if you align with white people in any way, you're a white supremacist.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Oh, that's proximity to whiteness, as Jamil Hill calls it.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  Oh, she's not the bigot. Oh, she's not the radical.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  No, you guys have bad policy politically, and you're just trash people.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  You're just scum people.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  And so nobody likes to associate with you.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  It has nothing to do with what color your skin is or their skin is.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  You just suck.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  That's a you thing, Jamil Hill.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  That's not a race or a color skin.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  That's a you thing.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  That's a liberal Democrat thing.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  You haven't figured it out yet.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Okay, fine.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  I don't even care as a white man that there's white anti-white bigotry everywhere.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  Do I like seeing it? No.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  When I see it, I'll most of the time try to tune out or get away from it.
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  It's called freedom of speech where I don't have to listen to what you have to say.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  But hey, you have every right to hate white people.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  You have every right to be an anti-white bigot.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Totally fine by me.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  There's no legislation that says you can't be anti-white.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Now, there is legislation that says you can't be anti-Semitic.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  Did you know that?
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  Only speech that is rejected, I guess you could say,
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  in actual legislation is anti-Semitic speech.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  They've passed laws.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  So I find it so funny.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's just, it confuses me.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  How are Jewish people not considered part of the white race?
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  And why can you bash white people all day long and that be mainstream?
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  And you can say white supremacy all day long and that's perfectly acceptable.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  But if you say Jewish influence, you get shut down like Kanye West.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  But see, this is Twilight Zone stuff here.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  Kanye West's white lives matter shirts given out to homeless people in Skid Row.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  So they're mad because Kanye West says white lives matter.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  White men are just as stigmatized as black men.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  But by the way, there's a serious Jewish influence in the world.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  Whoa!
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  First of all, standing up for white people was bad enough.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  But you don't dare say anything about the Jewish people.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  Kanye, you're supposed to be anti-white.
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  He says, well, then, okay, I'm anti-white.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  Well, what about Jewish influence?
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  Not those white people.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  And so Kanye West has all, and it's funny because he says,
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  he insinuates that Jewish people invented cancel culture.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  And then Kanye West starts to speak his mind and then there's thousands of Jewish people
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  calling for him to be canceled, calling for him to be debanked,
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  calling for him to have his deals with Adidas and everyone else cut off.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  So is that just Kanye West being proven right or what?
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  Then Ice Cube says, he hates that his name was dragged into the yay interview.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  And so he's trying to get the people that label you anti-Semite off his back,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  but it's too late for Ice Cube.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  Here's the story in The Daily Beast.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Ice Cube's long disturbing history of anti-Semitism.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  Of course, Ice Cube is not anti-Semitic at all.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  Ice Cube is anti the American regime destroying the people of this country.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  And so he's anti-establishment, but oh, they say he's anti-Semitic.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  I see.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  So that's what's going on now.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  ADL head blasts Adidas for not dropping Kanye West,
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  a company that outfitted the Hitler youth.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  Yeah, you want to get into everything else the Hitler influenced,
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  the Olympics, cars and everything.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  And now you have groups of individuals doing the Heil Hitler salute
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  with signs that say they support yay.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  This is so fake.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  Anybody that believes this is an idiot.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  This stuff has to be fake.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  It's our best seller.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion

[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  in the Western world against independent media.

[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them,

[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.000]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  What's the good halogen?
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[33:00.000 --> 33:21.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  Alex Jones for a while was just a personality.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  He was a guy who talked and he had fans.
[33:27.000 --> 33:34.000]  If they left him alone, he would have ended up in the historical record as a guy who said stuff online.
[33:34.000 --> 33:40.000]  Now they've turned him into an extremely consequential political and legal figure with everything they've gone after.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  Now throughout history, there's going to be precedent historical records talking about the conflict,
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  the crisis, the politics, all of that stuff.
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.000]  Sandy Hook families seek $2.75 trillion from Alex Jones.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  Jury already awarded families $965 million in damages.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  Judge to decide damages under state deceptive trade law.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  Oh, this is fascinating.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  So basically they're seeking what?
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  Just about 3,000 times what they were awarded from the jury.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  $2.75 trillion.
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  Let's put that into context.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  Here is a list of countries by GDP.
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.000]  You can see here US dollars in the trillions, France $2.77, Canada $2.2.
[34:23.000 --> 34:30.000]  So, Alex Jones' lawsuit falls somewhere in between Canada and France in terms of gross domestic product.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  That's how stupid we have become as a people.
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  I'm ashamed because, look, I'm worried the aliens are watching us and boy is this embarrassing if they are.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  You know, there was a story we talked about the other day that claimed Putin had already tried to fire a nuke,
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  but that sabotage or technical issues caused it not to fire.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  And I'm like, well, the only solution to that, the only answer is why it's happening is aliens.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  As soon as you press the button, the aliens deactivate it.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  Well, that's the conspiracy theory, right, that aliens stopped us from firing nukes.
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.000]  I'm just saying, the whole world, everything that humanity is, we are becoming a clown show.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  That's how stupid this is.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  I think we can take this back.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  We can end this easily.
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  Going back to late 1700s, Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  Now, back in those days, that only applied to Congress, right?
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  But after the Civil War, we passed this thing called the 14th Amendment,
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  says the states now shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.000]  So all of the privileges and immunities of free speech that were guaranteed in the Constitution applied to people like Alex Jones.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  There's modern jurisprudence as well that backs this up.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.000]  The Supreme Court case that you're going to want to look to reference this is Brandenburg versus Ohio.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  This was back in the 1960s, which says that if there's a matter of public interest or an event of public interest,
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  if you have an opinion about that event, that is free speech.
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  So this Connecticut judge has essentially invalidated jurisprudence,
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  which has been repeatedly upheld since the 1960s.
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  This Brandenburg case has been tried and tested and has been settled case law.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  So Alex Jones, I think, goes to the Supreme Court and wins.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  I don't think it gets tossed out on appeal.
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  I think it goes to the Supreme Court and I think that they look at the Brandenburg case and then they throw this out entirely.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  Let me read this from the story.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  It says, the family said they're entitled to that amount, 2.75 trillion,
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  because Jones broke a state law barring the sale of products using false statements.
[36:32.000 --> 36:41.000]  They reached the sum by multiplying the state law's $5,000 per violation fine by the 550 million social media exposures
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  Jones' audience received on his Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts in the three years following the San Diego incident.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  Literally makes no sense.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  The judge made a huge mistake.
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  In this regard, Alex Jones did not do, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure he didn't do commercials
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  where he held up his product and was like, I just want to talk about a tragic event by my product
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  and also that event was not real.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  I'm pretty sure his commercials were entirely separate statements.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  It would be like if, you know, we have biotrust sponsors of the show as if they would be liable
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  because I make a claim about Joe Biden on the show and that's selling the product.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  That's nonsense.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  The law is supposed to be, if I said something like, you know, this water keeps tigers away.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  $100, Ian, you want to buy it?
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  I don't see any tigers, do you?
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  That's clearly right.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  That's what they're trying to go for.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  Opinions are always protected free speech.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  And that's Alex Jones opinion that that happened.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  And so as long as it was a clearly stated opinion about a public event, he's protected.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  So he's never going to have to pay this money.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  I mean, obviously, you know, you guys were talking about it getting thrown out on appeal,
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  but I think that this goes through the legislative process, goes to Supreme Court.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  They cite Brandenburg and then it gets tossed out.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  But, you know, the left is celebrating this now as if they're going to go after all of these other people like you and me
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  and Kanye and others and stuff.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  I don't think that happens.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Not with the Supreme Court, the way that it sits right now.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  When he made a statement and named one of the parents and said that they were lying,
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  that is across the line is no longer opinion.
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  Is that true?
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  No.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  No.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  So here's the crazy thing.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  If I said something like, Ian Crossland is a conservative commentator who actively assists fascists,
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  and I've seen him do it.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  That's an opinion.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  If I said, I've watched Ian Crossland walk up to a group of fascists and provide aid and support to them.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  That's an opinion.
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.000]  Because what people need to understand is that I've talked with lawyers so many times about defamation and stuff like this.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  People seem to think that claiming someone did something is a statement of fact when it's not.
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  But what about if I said, Ian Crossland said he was 43 years old and he is lying.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  So the statement of fact is that you said you were 43 years old.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  Did you?
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  Yes.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  Okay.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  Whether you're lying or not is my opinion.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  Whether you said you were 43 is fact.
[38:56.000 --> 39:06.000]  So if I said, for instance, Ian, a conservative commentator Ian Crossland said that if young folks, if we get rid of no-fault divorce,
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  young folks would be more careful about who they marry.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Did you really say that?
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  Because I made a statement of fact and a quote.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  Like Jezebel.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  So as I said, for those that aren't familiar, this is literally what Jezebel did to Ian.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  This is a false statement of fact outright and it is actionable.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  The next question is damages.
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  Were you damaged by it?
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  How much does it cost?
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  Well, we had one user tell us the other day they were going to give us a thousand bucks a month for 84 years.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  But then they found out Ian was conservative so they're not going to.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  So we'll have to look into that.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  Two for 2.75 trillion.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  That's right.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  2.75 trillion.
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  All the marks of people that have watched the show ever and thought of me in their head now multiplied by, come on.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  So the issue with this is that Alex Jones never had a trial.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  That's what happened.
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  If he did, they would have been like, it's an opinion, albeit you might think it's a really stupid one, but it is.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  The judge granted discovery, which makes no sense.
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  I mean, she should have immediately ruled it as a free speech issue, but she's obviously stepped into this on a political side.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  A lot of people think, and I agree, Alex should not have said stuff like this.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  It's clearly ridiculous, but he's allowed to.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  You know, Ethan Klein got suspended from YouTube the other day for the comments he made about Ben Shapiro getting gassed.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  We said it on the show that night.
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  He should not get suspended.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  That was before he did.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  And then I said it again.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  He got suspended.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  He shouldn't be.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  He should be allowed to say that.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  Someone super chatted already that like I'm criticizing Kanye West for saying, you know, I don't know if we're supposed to say it on the show because someone said the R word or whatever.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  But I'm like, you know, I said Kanye shouldn't.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  I didn't say he should be banned from doing it.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  Right.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  But what about the defamation case?
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  In your opinion, what should somebody not be able to say?
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  Like when they can prove damages by what someone said when they're not a public figure, right?
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Well, so I understand the public figure thing.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  And it's tough, right?
[40:52.000 --> 41:03.000]  If we're looking at someone who is a politician or a celebrity and they're active in public life and we have an argument with them, I understand why we have the Times v.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  Sullivan precedent that there's a higher standard for public figures for people who aren't public figures who aren't involved.
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  In this stuff, I understand why the standard isn't there.
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  So it is difficult.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  My view of this is like what really should have happened is that they sue Alex Jones and said you've made false statements about this.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  Alex Jones pays in the thousands and has to issue an apology and a retraction.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  I think one big solution for a lot of these things is a retraction and apology, but the courts don't ever enforce that.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  But he's in chapter 11 right now.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  Alex already did issue a lot of apologies.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  No, I know.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  YouTube deleted all those videos and there's no record of it.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  There's not a lot of records that he could comply with.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  And this is one of the reasons why, of course, they just threw out the court case and he didn't have his day in court.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  They just decided he was guilty, said he wasn't complying.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  We don't know the full story of exactly what was happening behind the scenes here.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  But I don't know.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  Maybe these families confused Alex Jones with the Federal Reserve and think he could just print money out of thin air.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  And it's just a ridiculous notion that to ask for trillions of dollars, it shows you how frivolous this is and how it's politically motivated.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  Rather than motivated on the actual merits of this case.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  Yeah, I think, I think the strong possibility goes to the Supreme Court.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  They might just say they don't want to hear it, but I think they probably would because this is kind of ridiculous.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  So here's my understanding.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  I was, we went down to Austin, I think it was a year ago.
[42:21.000 --> 42:30.000]  And this was when Jones was right where on time he was held in default or they declared a default judgment because he didn't turn over all the documents.
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  Alex, I was talking to him and he said, we have given them every single thing we have.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  There's nothing else we can give them.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  And he was like frantically and Adam and being like, Tim, listen, I gave them literally everything.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  I don't know what else to do.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  And they just kept saying he didn't.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  So like, what do you do when they just claim you didn't give them the documents and you did?
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  He's in chapter 11, which means that in Texas, he's still going to be able to operate.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  He's got like less than $3 million in assets.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  They don't have to liquidate.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  He can still keep his employees.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  He can still operation.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  But what they've promised is all the.

[46:02.000 --> 46:07.000]  Everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  Info wars credibility.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[46:11.000 --> 46:20.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuit stay on air.
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  And I can't fund those myself.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's unsustainable.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  So please visit save info wars.com.
[46:45.000 --> 46:53.000]  Save info wars.com where you can make straight donations, five, 10, $500, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  I'll never give up.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[46:56.000 --> 47:01.000]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. Save info wars.com.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.000]  He's in chapter 11, which means that in Texas he's still going to be able to operate.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  He's got like less than $3 million in assets.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  They don't have to liquidate. He can still keep his employees. He can still operation.
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  But what they've promised is all the future profits from info wars and all that.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  Which there never will be.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  Let me explain something to anybody who just doesn't understand how businesses work.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  Profits are a choice. That's it. It's a choice.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  So they may try and say, OK, we're going to find out where you are right now.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  And we're going to say, here's a cap as to how much you can use for operational costs.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  That probably won't fly because it makes no sense because costs vary.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  So for Alex, let's say he makes $3 million this year.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  I was probably way more a while ago. Let's just pick a number. Let's say $10 million. OK, fine.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  They say, OK, you made $10 million.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  That is revenue, not profit.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  Alex can then take, let's say it costs him $3 million to run the business.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  He can then spend $7 million on advertisements all over the country, and that is an operational cost.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  He can just choose to dump it into things. He can buy more machines.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  He can build a bigger warehouse. He can build a bigger studio and just keep spending the money.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  They will never see a penny.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  This looks right. This was a political judgment. It's not a legal precedent that's set.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's going to get overturned. Alex Jones will continue to be able to operate in Texas.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  So honestly, I think that probably everybody benefits from this in the end.
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.000]  Because when it does go to the Supreme Court and they do uphold the Brandenburg precedent,
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  people like you and I are going to be benefiting from that.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  We're going to get the Alex Jones precedent.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  And then we're going to be like, did you see that court case between Ethan Klein and Ben Shapiro?
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  Well, while under the Jones, Alex Jones precedent, they're going to have to...
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  They're going to hate that so much.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  We've got to keep bringing up the man's name that we banned everywhere on social media.
[49:06.000 --> 49:12.000]  In Jones v... So this is what happened in Mississippi with the abortion ban.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  It was, what, 11 weeks or something? Then the left sued to stop it and it resulted in Roe v. Wade getting overturned.
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.000]  They could have just said, hey, let's not launch any lawsuits until we get control of the Supreme Court to keep this level.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  But they decided we're going to go at this and try and fight it.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  Makes it a Supreme Court. Supreme Court says, no, Roe v. Wade gone.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Yeah, see, this is why I don't take the Black Pill, man.
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.000]  I am so on the White Pill train because over the long course of history, Liberty has advanced.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  If you look at things on a long enough timeline, have we lost some short-term victories?
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  Sure, but the Libertarians have slowly gotten the big wins.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  Roe v. Wade was a big one. That happened the first time I was on the show last time.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  And the anarchists and the people who want to be left alone.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  We would see things a little bit differently, but you do make a very good point because,
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  especially when it comes to states' rights, especially when it comes to gun rights,
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.000]  we have seen it grow in a way that the federal government has been having a hard time trying to, of course, stop.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  You look at states where people could conceal carry.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  They're becoming more and more abundant by the day. That's a huge major victory.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  And I think when we look at the decentralization of power, there's a lot of optimism.
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.000]  There's a lot of hope, but also at the same time, I think we're seeing the system panic and kind of get angry and lash out.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  And I think this is one of the ways that they're lashing out in these kind of particular court cases.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  But at the end of the day, we're talking about Alex Jones,
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  someone that, of course, is banned on social media.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  And if anything, this is only going to make him more notable.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is only going to make more people know about him because more people are talking about him now.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  So he was a famous guy, but they've turned him into an iconic historical figure.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.000]  Literally.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  That's the craziest thing about it.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  A martyr.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  But I mean, just, I mean, more than that.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Alex Jones for a while was just a personality.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  He was a guy who talked and he had fans.
[51:02.000 --> 51:09.000]  If they left him alone, he would have ended up in the, in the history, historical record as a guy who said stuff online.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  Now they've turned him into an extremely consequential political and legal figure with everything they've gone after.
[51:15.000 --> 51:23.000]  Now in throughout history, there's going to be precedent historical records talking about the conflict, the crisis, the politics, all of that stuff.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  Just simply put, he used to be influential.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  Now he's consequential.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  That's, that's, that's a song lyric.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  You should write that down.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  The left didn't read their Nietzsche. They stared too long into the abyss.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  They fought for, they fought dragons and then they became the enemy.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  They became exactly what they were fighting against.
[51:40.000 --> 51:50.000]  You know who else is, you know, red pill in a lot of people and another big victory for free speech and freedom is Corey D'Angeles' crusade for school choice in Arizona.
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  Yes, he's winning.
[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  Glenn Yonkin in Virginia, the governor's race.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  I mean, what a blessing that has been.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  I honestly think that the school choice issue and the freedom of choice in education is the freedom issue of our time.
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  The pandemic read pills a lot of people, but there's nothing like telling parents that they shouldn't have anything to do with their kids education.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  That's crazy to show up to their town.
[52:11.000 --> 52:23.000]  That on top of a new record number of homeschoolers also throughout the last few years has been growing very significantly, especially after COVID when a lot of people were able able to actually see what's what's happening in their curriculum,
[52:23.000 --> 52:29.000]  what's happening in their schools and be shocked by the utter craziness that's being taught to students.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  And it's not really teaching students or teaching kids anything.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  It's really indoctrinating them into the current system.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  A lot of people are sick of it.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  A lot of people are saying, you know what, I'm just going to teach my own kids the important things that I want to teach them.
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  And what I love too is seeing all of the former liberals coming along to our side, right?
[52:45.000 --> 52:54.000]  Like how the trans issue has turned so many of the LGBT community. We get Blair White and so many other transgender people.
[52:54.000 --> 53:01.000]  Sarah Higdon and others who are coming along to our side have been redpilled because of the extremism of the progressive eyes.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  The progressives are out there attacking Alexandria Cajacortes in their town halls.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  She's already been pushed to the side.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  You see she's like dancing and six her tongue out.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  Did she vote for funding for Ukraine for weapons?
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  Yes, it was unanimous. It was unanimous.
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  Wait a minute, unanimous. Thomas Massey didn't vote.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  No, no, no, no. The Democrats. Like there was like no defectors.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  You look at the Republicans and it's split.
[53:25.000 --> 53:31.000]  But so with a lot of this ideology stuff, there's one really great example that's popping up in the news.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  And it's this Dylan Mulvaney, I think the individual's name is.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  Dylan Mulvaney.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  It's some of the funniest condo.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  I mean Dylan says that there are performer putting on a performance.
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.000]  And I respect that and think the performance is very, very funny.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  The only thing is, it's at the expense of women, right?
[53:47.000 --> 53:54.000]  Dylan Mulvaney, frozen unfamiliar, posted his video, got invited to the White House and got a cookie and the whole performance.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  And again, I'll stress this. Mulvaney says outright that this is a performance.
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  I bring that up and people are like, no, it's serious. No, it's serious.
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  And I'm like, I mean, maybe Dylan's literally trans, but the character they're playing is exaggerated over the top performance.
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  And it's, you know, when they say woman face, I'm like, no, that's literally what this is.
[54:12.000 --> 54:19.000]  Right? The point I'm trying to make is, you mentioned that even trans people are getting concerned about what's going on, Blair White being a good example.
[54:19.000 --> 54:26.000]  Because Dylan Mulvaney's character is a caricature of women and trans people, not indicative of who trans people really are.
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  So you have this person who's wearing high heels while going hiking and just this very cartoonish character.
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  And it's got a lot of trans people and women angry that they're being mocked by this performance.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Well, conservatism is not confined to one ideology.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  They're conservative Democrats. They're conservative gay people.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  So, you know, conservatism can encompass a wider branch of philosophies than most people might think.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  It's not confined to republicanism.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  But hey, you know, Biden really likes Dylan Mulvaney.
[54:58.000 --> 55:09.000]  And according to Dylan, who came out today, he says that Biden said that he watches his TikTok channel and that they're going to come out with an official conversation and interview this coming Sunday.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  So that's going to be very interesting to watch.
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  But to the point that you guys are making here, I think it's important to note here that, you know, a lot of the times when people are a part of different communities,
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  especially in the conservative kind of wing, they usually don't make it their personality.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  Sometimes they do and it's a little bit annoying.
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  But when you just come to the table and say, hey, my sex, my gender, my choice of how I decide to procreate is everything all about me.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  It's kind of annoying and it kind of takes away from the human being.
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.000]  That's what you see from a lot when it comes to a lot of these social media personalities that just use it as a way to have a fake personality.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  I think it's possible to get to the point.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  Well, I see one of two futures.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  One where offensive comedy comes back with a vengeance and you start seeing like, remember when Sarah Silver...
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Richard Pryor's and stuff, yeah.
[55:54.000 --> 56:01.000]  Yeah, I mean, when George Carlin called Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy the N-word on stage to thunderous applause.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Like, I mean, it's shocking.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's true, but it's true.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  Yeah, he did outright.
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  And the point he was making is that it was a joke because you know they're not.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Like, it was meant to be absurd.
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  You know that George Carlin is a hippie who doesn't really believe in the stuff and it was meant to be shocking and offensive.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  But you can't do that kind of stuff these days.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  Maybe it'll go swing in a complete other direction.
[56:20.000 --> 56:30.000]  Or maybe it will come to the point where woman face becomes extremely offensive and people like Dylan Mulvaney get banned for misogyny.
[56:30.000 --> 56:39.000]  But how do you do that? How do you rally women around that to reclaim womanhood that it isn't some entirely conservative female movement?
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  I mean, are liberal females really going to get on board with a reclaiming woman face?
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  So, I mean, you've got to...
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  Well, my point is maybe.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  I'm not saying right now.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  I mean, I don't know where we're at.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.000]  I just wonder what the psychology is.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  There have to be some kind of polarizing event.
[56:54.000 --> 57:03.000]  What I see is either the woman face phenomenon results in people saying mockery of any identity is fair play.
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.000]  Or it turns into, you know what, we've realized for some time that it's probably not okay to mock women in this way.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  But shouldn't it be okay though?
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  Shouldn't everybody be up for grabs?
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  When you were kids, there was always that one serious kid who told the teacher every time somebody said something mean about him.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  And then the rest of us were all having a laugh or having a joke, right?
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  I mean, I don't think it should be illegal or banned or anything like that.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  But people are allowed to have tastes, you know what I mean?
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  Like Sarah Silverman did blackface. Personally, I'm not a fan of it.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  George Carl, I'm a huge fan of...
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  But his joke where he calls Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor the N-word, I'm not all about that.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  You know, I understand his point about being offensive.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  I think he should be allowed to do it.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  I think he can make his joke and turns out tons of people really loved what he said.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  Good for him?
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  You know, that's not my thing.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Is there a time and place for blackface?
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  Look, it's not hype that Info Wars has changed the world.
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  It's not hype that your support of Info Wars is the reason we were able to do this.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  It doesn't just give you more energy. It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[58:12.000 --> 58:18.000]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.

[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  and empower your life at InfoWarStore.com.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends
[58:59.000 --> 59:02.000]  to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarStore.com
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[59:31.000 --> 59:38.000]  And despite the fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  We're not selling it for that.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Do you remember the dancing nurses phenomenon at the beginning of COVID?
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Remember the hospitals and the nurses were so overwhelmed that they found the hours a day
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  to choreograph dance routines and upload those videos onto the internet or social media clout.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  That's how overwhelmed they were during COVID.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  They were learning new dance for internet clout.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Well, there's a similar trend happening now with the extinction. These people are anti-energy, anti-human.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  They fully buy into the man-made climate change propaganda.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And so the nurses are back at it again.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Now they're doing dance routines for extinction, rebellion.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  They want to shut down energy, shut down the combustion engine and end civilization as we know it,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  whether they realize it or not.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  So here they are again, and it would be one thing if they maybe had some talent, but they don't.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  They just want to shut off your energy and embarrass themselves in the process.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Here's what it is in clip 4.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Now they get on the ground. Is this where they die? Is this them dying or what is this?
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Hey, you know what? I am in complete agreement with your cause.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  You guys should all go live in a cave. Go live in a cave.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Or are they going to be Ukrainian war victim crisis actors?
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  No, go live in a cave if you really believe this.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  If you really want to stop man-made climate change, then go live in a cave or kill yourself.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  I'm not actually promoting that. I'm not promoting suicide.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I like energy. I like humanity on this planet.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  I think humans should live and prosper and like the Bible says, be fruitful and multiply.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  These are the people that want to end humanity.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  So be the example.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Live out the example you want to see in the world.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Go live in a cave, go live outside on the river, or just end it all.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  That's your logic, not mine.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  I think humanity is good. I think I like cars. I like building things.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  I like easily accessible, cheap energy. I like that.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  You are the ones that hate it.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  So why don't you live out your dream and go live in a cave, go live in the woods,
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  go live in a van next to the river, or pay the ultimate price for stop and climate change,
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  and that's give up your life.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  But see, oh, they want to stay alive. Is that why I'll cover this coming up?
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Is that why a protest where they're blocking the highway resulted in two women dying
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  because they blocked an ambulance from getting to the hospital,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  so two women died to stop the oil protest?
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  By the way, they're continuing to deface and destroy,
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  at least attempting to, classical art pieces.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Now, most of them, they can't destroy.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  They're in double triple-sealed gas, glass, probably even the gas inside of them is contained,
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  but they're glass containers, double triple-sealed frames usually,
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  so I don't think they're actually destroying them.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  But here, another group of stop oil protesters try to destroy a Monet,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  and then glue themselves to the wall.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  These people sound perfectly sane. Here, check it out.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  So they throw mashed potatoes on a Monet at a museum,
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  and then they superglue themselves to the wall.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  Now, I've noticed, I don't know if I was the...
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  People are starving, people are freezing, people are dying,
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  and yeah, you're going to make it worse when you shut off the energy.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  These people are so stupid, it's unreal.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Guys, turn the volume down, please.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  These guys are so stupid, it's unreal.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Yeah, people are going to starve and die when you shut the energy off.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  What do you think is going to happen to food production when you shut energy down?
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  You think people are starving and dying because of climate change?
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  No. People are going to starve and people are going to die because of your climate change policies.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  I don't take the credit.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  I give you the credit.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Save InfoWars.com today and donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  I have noticed others aren't in agreement with me.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  I'm not sure if I'm the first that ever said this,
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  but I've noticed that people are picking up on it because I've been saying it a lot lately.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  When these climate change protesters super glue themselves to buildings
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  and super glue themselves to walls and art and Starbucks bars and all this stuff,
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  we should leave them there.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  They should be left there.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Let them super glue themselves to whatever they want
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  and then they can just super glue themselves to anything
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  and then they can be there for the rest of their lives.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  That's what they want.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Congratulations.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  You are supporting the cause.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  So if I ran that museum, I would actually not clean up the painting.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  I would leave the painting defaced
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  and I would leave them super glued to the wall
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  and that would be the New Art exhibit.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  It would be like living art.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Here used to be a classic Monet,
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  but it was attempted to be destroyed by these two climate change activists
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  that have now super glued themselves to the wall
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  and then just leave them there.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Say, what do you want?
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  This is what you wanted.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Don't give them a pot to piss in.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Don't give them water.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Don't give them food.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  Just let them stay there.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  This is what you want.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  You want to commit to your cause?
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Let's see it.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Or do you just want lights, camera, action?
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Do you just want to feel good about yourself?
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Do you just want an empty, hollow, shallow protest?
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  How do you think they got to the mall?
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  How do you think their clothes got made?
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  How do you think the mashed potatoes got made?
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  How do you think they're going to get home?
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  How do you think they're going to get to jail?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  Oh, it's all going to increase the carbon footprint.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  So they can't even think about that.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  So I say, leave them there.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  I say, if a climate protester wants to super glue themselves to the street
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  or super glue themselves to a wall or a building or a museum or anything,
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  leave them there.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Let them be super glued there forever.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  And let the people see what they do.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Yeah, you came here to see the Monet.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Well, these people destroyed it.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  And now I've decided to super glue themselves to the wall.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Gaze and amazement.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Gaze, please do not feed the animals.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Please do not touch the animals.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  They might bite.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  They are hungry.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  They've been here for a while.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  They're covered in feces.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  But this is what they wanted.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  And so this is what they get.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  But of course, it always doesn't end good.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  But you see what they say is, oh, climate changes, killing people,
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  climate changes, causing people to starve.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  That's actually what their policies are doing.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  That's exactly what their policies are going to do.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And so it's ironic that they complain about people starving
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  when they shut down the energy.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  That's exactly what is going to happen.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  It's like this, US has only 25 days of diesel supply.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Shortage could cripple economy.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  You realize if we run out of diesel fuel,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  the farming industry is going to be crippled.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  You think that's going to starve people
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  when they don't have energy to process and produce food?
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  How do you think that's going to go?
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Oh, I guess you haven't thought that one out, have you?
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I guess you haven't thought that one out, have you?
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  And they don't want you to talk about that either.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  And they keep bringing it up.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Oh, inflation up around the world, inflation up around the world.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Well, do you know why inflation is up around the world?
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Because of the climate change policies.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Because they're shutting down your energy.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  They're shutting down your economy.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  That's why inflation is up.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  You notice that it's only up in the nations
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  that enact the green policies.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  It's only up in the nations that are enacting
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  shutting down their energy, shutting down gas, shutting down coal.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Of course it's causing inflation.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  And then they print new money.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  So they print new money to give away like socialists.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  And then they shut down the energy.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And then they say, what's going on?
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Why are things collapsing all around us?
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  We can't figure it out. It must be the weather.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  You're not very bright, are you?
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  And so here's Nancy Pelosi, though.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  She doesn't want you to talk about inflation
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  ahead of the midterms. We all know why.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Here she was on morning news telling the host,
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  stop talking about inflation in Clip 9.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  And the fact is, is that when I hear people talk about
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  inflation as they heard them there,
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  we have to change that subject.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  Inflation is a global phenomenon.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  The EU, the European Union, the UK,
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  the British have a higher inflation rate than we do here.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  The fight is not about inflation.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  It's about the cost of living.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Oh, and the cost of living goes up when gas prices double.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  The cost of living goes up when inflation goes up.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  The cost of living goes up when producer price index,
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  consumer price index go up.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  All what you've done.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And all the nations that she just mentioned
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  are all enacting green policies causing inflation.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  It's just stunning.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Raising taxes.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  They really don't get it.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  But see, the climate change protests are actually a deadly thing.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Eco protesters have blood on their hands after two women die
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  in M20 horror crash following ambulance delay.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  So they were being raced to the hospital.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Climate change protesters super glued themselves to the road.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Ambulance couldn't get through the protests.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  The women ended up dying in the ambulance.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Good job, climate change protesters.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Way to go.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  But hey, what's too dead compared to the millions that will die
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  under your policies?
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Too dead is nothing compared to what you will accomplish
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  when it's all said and done.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  When you shut off the energy, when you shut off the food supply,
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  millions, billions will starve to death.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Too dead after you super glue yourselves to the streets?
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  That's nothing.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Billions dead when you shut off the food supply
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  and the energy supply, that's the numbers you're looking for, isn't it?
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And they sit here and they say, we're doing this to save lives.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  And they're going to kill so many people they don't even realize it.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  They're just part of a eugenics program.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me do this before I get into some of the other
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  political news ahead of the midterms that is so important as we're 16 days away.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  You know they don't want info wars on the air.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They had hoped that this transmission and Alex Jones
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  and everything info wars do and has done would have been off the air
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  after really they wanted us off air ahead of the 2018 midterms.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  That's why they had the ultimate censorship of Alex Jones
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  and info wars ahead of the 2018 midterms.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  You and the audience supported us.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  We rallied.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  We carried on.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  We were on the air in the 2018 midterms.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Then in the 2020 presidential election,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  you saw the sweeping internet censorship
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  expanding from info wars and Alex Jones to Donald Trump,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  to senators, to doctors, to everybody else ahead of the presidential election.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Well, now they're back again.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  They thought they would have us off the air by the midterms.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  They've still got 16 days left.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  So maybe they think they still can.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  But once again, you have rallied to the cause and you have kept us on air.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  So when I tell you that your support at infowarstore.com has been paramount.

[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  I'm constantly telling people to the younger audience out there that wants to take pills,
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  pharmaceutical pills to study.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  They think it gives them an edge studying and maybe it will.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  But the edge you get with brain force ultra and brain force plus will be so much better
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  and it's all natural organic supplements unlike the big pharmaceutical products that are so hazardous to your body.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  The survival shield x2 imperative survival shield x3 imperative.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  So many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  You know, I try not to drink any fluoridated water ever.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  In fact, I got a big story about that coming up.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  I'll mention it right now.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  There was a local hero in Vermont.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  A Vermont town's water official resigns amid fluoridation confusion.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  The man was quietly and slowly bringing the fluoride levels down to almost nothing in Richmond, Vermont.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  He wasn't supposed to do it.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  He was trying to save the people of Richmond from the fluoride poisoning.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  But that's what they put in their water and so now he has to resign for trying to de-poison the water.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  But I try to avoid any fluoridated water but I'm not perfect.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Like I went out last night, wasn't drinking alcohol so I was drinking water, probably some fluoride in it.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  So I got home after that and hit the survival shield x2 so I could counteract the fluoride with the good halogen, the iodine.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  That's on sale at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  But this sale ends tonight, folks, so take advantage of 50% off infowarstore.com now.

[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  So please visit saveinfowarstore.com where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.

[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.

[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.

[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  16 days from the midterms, all signs point to a sweep for the Republicans, major landslide for the Republicans.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  But we all know that wall of voter fraud that is sitting there waiting for us.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And again, I want to tease, we're going to have a great video coming up in the last segment today.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  I went out in the info wars battle tank as it's so called the armored truck yesterday and just got an epic footage.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  And the usual leftist crazies and even a shout out from Beta O'Rourke even got a shout out from Beta.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  And you know, let me just say this too before I get into these headlines.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  I've probably been out in that truck boy, what two dozen times maybe I've been out in that truck.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And since when did we, when did we acquire that truck guys what like 2018 or 19 man.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  My point is that of all the times I have been out in the truck, let's say 20 times probably at least yesterday was the highest ratio of positive to negative interactions that we've had and it wasn't even close.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Normally it's about split. I would say normally it's about split.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And that's just taking the numbers from the responses we get I would say normally it's like the majority of people barely respond at all.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  And then the ones that do it would be split about half and half maybe depending on the day depending on the crowd but it would be close to about half and half positive negative interactions.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Yesterday we were out for more than two hours and when we went through a busy downtown Austin on a beautiful sunny day yesterday everyone was responding.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  I mean we're talking about like an 80 90% response rate and that was now all time high and I'm saying of the interactions nine out of 10 90% of the interactions yesterday were positive.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  Now considering how much info wars and Alex Jones has been in the news lately for negative reasons if you look the mainstream news.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  That's a good sign people don't buy the mainstream news anymore they know it's lying and they're looking at alternative sources.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  So nine out of 10 responses were positive yesterday.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  Then we get the shout out at the Beto beta beta event beta event and well that's always classic so that's all coming up.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  But as far as the midterm news let me get to some of the headlines now.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  So you may have seen this story election drop box spotters catch man covering license plate in Arizona.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Now this is actually a separate story and I don't know if I sent you guys these videos I don't think I did.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  But over the weekend see if you guys can find the video there was a controversial video coming out of Arizona.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Where there were some men that kind of dressed maybe like half military garb and they may have even had face masks on.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  And they were sitting in a truck outside of a drop box and the Democrats are complaining and calling it voter intimidation.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  And so here's what I believe is going on with this.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  I think that the Democrats are running a false flag operation and they're sending out fake poll watchers to engage in voter harassment and intimidation.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  So that they can shut down the ballot drop box poll watchers ahead of the midterms.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  That's what I think is going on.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And why do I think that because all the Democrats and all the left wing media were sharing this one same video and image.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  There it is right there folks.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I don't know too many Republican poll watchers that go dressed in full military garb with their faces covered.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  They don't know any and I've talked to some of the groups involved with this over the weekend to get a little more information.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  And they said it's actually their policy the groups I talked to their policy is they don't interact with the people.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  They're just there to sit and watch and film and record if they feel necessary but to not interact with anybody.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  That's what they've been told.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  All of a sudden this these photos and images and videos start coming out and Democrats all in unison start crying voter intimidation over this one instance.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  This one incident.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  My spidey senses go off.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  I sense a false flag.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  And when you look at the activities of these so called voter intimidating poll watchers drop box watchers.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  They don't they don't match the characteristics of what the actual trained ballot drop box watchers have done.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Now we'll see if we hear anything more about this.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  But when these things kind of pop up and get used for propaganda and then disappear.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  That's when you know it's propaganda.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Now if we hear from these people and they disagree then maybe we'll know if there are some ballot drop box groups as yet they were with us then we'll know.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  If that doesn't happen I suspect those people were liberal Democrats sent out there for a false flag.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And of course they would do that.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Of course they would do that.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Of course Democrats don't want people watching the ballot drop boxes especially after what we saw in 2020.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  And then especially after the documentary film 2000 mules by the Nestor Suja that just shows how the Democrats or I guess we don't know who.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Except the Democrats don't like it so that tells us who how they cheated with the drop boxes in the mail in ballots.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  But there's real groups there's actual real groups that are doing mail in ballot drop box watching legally lawfully organized funded they're doing it the right way.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  And they say no no no we don't we don't interact with these people if we see suspicious activity we just film it we just we just photograph it we don't interact so it goes against that.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  So those two are either operating on their own or with some other group or if we don't hear from them maybe they were just Democrats in disguise.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  But why don't Democrats want people watching the mail in ballot drop boxes do I really have to tell you isn't it easy isn't it obvious.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Now we've got Trump who's been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee and of course they're not going to televise his testimony because they don't want that.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  Crazy Liz Cheney says January 6 committee will not allow Trump testimony to be televised says he will testify before her under oath.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  Oh it's just going to be them two sitting in a room and no one else can see.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  So this is how they rig it.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  They do their they do their propaganda January 6 committees live on TV for all to see with their specific paid paid for eyewitnesses up there lying to the American people.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  And then when they do the deposition or they get testimony from people on the other side nobody gets to watch it no cameras in the room.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  No one allowed to record no one allowed to talk about it and then they take whatever they want from those interviews and then they show that to the public.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  So they'll take like 2% of whatever happens in Trump's testimony if he doesn't just plead the fifth the whole time they'll take 2% and they'll just say see this is what he said he's guilty.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  My guess is he'll plead the fifth and they'll say that proves he's guilty which goes again of course against all legal president in this country in regards to the Fifth Amendment.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  But they don't care about that obviously they don't even have the basic integrity to protect a woman a woman's privacy who's been raped.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  I was sickened by it.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  Senator Joni Ernst Blast political report that published records of GOP candidate Jennifer Ruth Green sexual assault. I've covered this story before but in case you haven't heard there the Democrats did some.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  Dirt digging they were digging for some dirt on a congressional candidate Jennifer Ruth Green who happens also to be a black female veteran.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  They'd not want to go after her but she's not a liberal Democrat so they hate her especially more now that she's a black woman they hate her even more.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  So they dug for dirt they couldn't find any but they did find records that she was sexually assaulted while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  I forget which one it was where she was assaulted and the Democrats just published that they said well we don't have any dirt on her so let's just publish she sexually assaulted while she was overseas on a tour.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  That's how sick these people are but they're not very popular.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Corey Bush Democrat member of the squad launched her book last week.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  It sold 729 copies 729 copies for Democrat squad member Corey Bush but yeah they're so popular they're a win in the midterms I'm sure.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  Think about a world without InfoWars just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together this family that is InfoWars.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit and now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Fluoride is the enemy. It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it. What's the good halogen? Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away. Your ability to speak freely.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  They're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support. And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because of your past support.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts by visiting InfowarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  I got something to tell me what it's all about. I saw, and I'm super bad.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Dancing for votes, and then after they tore the field goals down at the Georgia football game this weekend, she volunteered to be the field goal if she smiled at the next football game, just truly an amazing thing from Stacy Abrams.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Dancing for votes, she's a very serious person. Field goal is good.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  But if we're going to talk about solving starvation here, I think Stacy Abrams could help royally. She had a photo posted of her next to Kerry Washington.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  You may know Kerry Washington, very beautiful actress, Hollywood actress Kerry Washington. She's a big Democrat.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  They posted this photo here of Kerry Washington and Stacy Abrams, guys, if you could indulge me, please.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  It made me think of something. It reminded me of something, this photograph here. I don't know if the crew was able to pull up what it reminded me of.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  I see this photograph and it just, it reminded me of something. I can't quite put my finger on what it reminded me of.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  I'm trying to, I'm trying to locate it in my head. Guys, can I, what does this photo remind you of?
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Stacy Abrams and Kerry Washington here. This is after they're dancing for votes. After they're dancing for, oh, yeah, something like that.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Amazing stuff. Just amazing stuff. Somebody might want to tell Stacy Abrams that her arm is bigger than the entire body frame of Kerry Washington.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  Just an observation, but that's a good thing because her and Lizzo, fat girls, are going to take over the world.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  That's what they say. So she's dancing with Lizzo. My goodness, so much stuff here.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Eric Adams, mayor of New York City says mental illness is driving subway safety woes, not guns.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Oh, oh, but now, now Eric Adams and Kathy Huckle have said, well, we're going to actually improve police presence on the subways.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Oh, they defund the police. Crime goes up. And they say, well, we need more police. Oh, really? Who could have seen that coming?
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  But it's, it is mental illness in a way. They let the mentally ill roam the streets. So that does happen.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  Boy, oh boy, you know, I've got a bunch of COVID news here. I'm going to cover this COVID news tomorrow on the Alex Jones show.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  I want to cover some more timely news right now. Let's go. AOC is basically being protested wherever she goes now.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And look, I'll actually give credit to AOC. She in her own right is a woman of the people. She does put herself in these positions.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  She does have very intimate meetings with with her potential constituents or her constituents.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  And so I'll actually, I'll actually give a tip of the cap, even though she's a crazy communist and completely out of her mind and probably just a paid actress to pretend to be a Democrat in Congress.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  She's completely become the establishment. She claimed to fight, but she does go out and mingle with the people.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  And I do respect that. And she sets herself up to get protested. And so she's getting protested everywhere she goes now.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Liberals and leftists are protesting her. You've seen the videos. She's now pro-war when it's when it's trendy on the left to be anti-Israel.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  She's anti-Israel, but now that it's trendy on the left to be pro-Israel because of what Kanye says. She's pro-Israel. She's pro-war.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  She's raising taxes on the poor. And so the great Drew Hernandez, who is going to be joining me tomorrow, was able to infiltrate one of her events when this happened in clip seven.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  AOC, what about the migrants? What about the migrants, AOC? What about the little kids being raped at the southern border?
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  What about the migrants, AOC? What about the little girls getting raped? AOC, what about the little girls? Talk about the little girls.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  Talk about the big trees, AOC. What about the red trees, AOC? What about the open border? Denounce Joe Biden. Denounce the human struggle, AOC.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Bring out the little kids being raped at the southern border, AOC. AOC, don't touch me. What about the southern border?
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  The blood is on your hands, AOC. The blood is on your hands, AOC.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  So there you go. There's more. We're going to have more of it tomorrow with Drew Hernandez on the Alex Jones show.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Looking forward to speaking with him about that and other issues. Also, Savannah Hernandez of No Relation will be joining us on the Alex Jones show tomorrow as well.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  She was recently in Portland. She was able to get inside footage of a couple of drug addicts in Portland.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  She caught a couple overdoses. They showed her the streets and how it goes. Just amazing footage there too.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Both of them will be joining us tomorrow. So looking forward to that.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  But, I mean, AOC gets protested anywhere she goes. Beto gets protested everywhere he goes.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  The Republican corrupt politicians get protested like Dan Crenshaw and Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  So, I mean, the populist movement has taken over the Republican Party and the anti-establishment.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  See, here, you know what it really comes down to is this. When the anti-establishment was the left-wing thing, it was never successful because they were too stupid to really pull it off.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  They ended up being pro-establishment. They just didn't realize it. So when the left was anti-establishment, they were kind of doing what the establishment wanted them to do.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  So the left anti-establishment was actually run by the establishment. Now you have now seen that come to fruition with everything the left has become.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  It's pro-establishment, pro-war, anything they get told by the television, by the government, they do. That was always set up to be that way.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  But now that the conservatives and the right-wing have become anti-establishment, we're actually smart.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  We actually have smart, successful, intellectual people that understand business, understand economy, concepts, and finances, and geopolitics, and know how to take peaceful, legal, political action as well.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  And so you're actually seeing a real populist uprising that actually is a threat to the establishment, and that's why they have to get Info Wars off air.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  That's why they have to get Steve Bannon off air. That's why they have to get Tucker Carlson off air. That's why the Internet censorship is so important.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  Because on the right-wing you actually have intellectualism that can stand and hold its weight against the establishment where you had none of that on the left-wing, at least not in a mass movement.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  And so that's what I see going on here. And we'll have more on that tomorrow as well on the Alex Jones show as we are just two weeks from the midterms.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  And one more thing before we debut the footage from yesterday's crashing of the Beto rally. I'm telling you, folks, this is classic all-time stuff here.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Transgender singer strips naked on Live Channel 4 and plays the keyboard with her penis. Now, I'm assuming we've censored this. I don't know if we did or not, because here's the thing.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  We have censored it, but here's the thing. They ran this on television, folks, a man with fake breasts and whacking a keyboard with his genitals. This aired on television. Here it is.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  And so not even really a musical talent to me. This hurts my ears and my eyes. And then wax it with the genitals, and then you notice the all-seeing eye in the background,
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  which is a left eye, a left blue eye, which is biblical and in actual multiple religions, the left eye, only the left eye, the all-seeing eye.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  So all the propaganda there, horrible musicians, strips naked. So this is what you're getting used to. So it's all about, see, they used to have this mentality of,
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  oh, we'll put X group on top of you that you can't criticize, and then we'll use X group to dominate you politically, whether it's black people or Jewish people or whatever it is at the time.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Now it's going to be trans people. So that's the new thing. That's the new X group to dominate you.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  All right, folks. First time premiere. HD footage. Beto O'Rourke gives Info Wars a shout out as we crash his rally yesterday. That's coming up on the next side of this break.

[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed. It's came over. And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered. But the listeners and viewers who've supported infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  I bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this is happening.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Look, it's not hype that infowars has changed the world. It's not hype that your support of infowars is the reason we were able to do this.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  So I salute you and I thank you. Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  Well, high-quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells. It doesn't just give you more energy. It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, take a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Plus, it funds the info war. So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life. I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from infowarstore.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible. And despite the fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war. We're not selling it for that. We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity. Get X3 today, 50% off at infowarstore.com all supplies last.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  Doesn't World War 3 sound fun? Doesn't a nuclear war with Russia sound fun? Make sure you vote Democrat this November and we'll be at World War. Yes.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you like paying highest gas prices at the pump in American history, make sure you vote Democrat this November.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  I got my hand over here and you're saying cutting off greeners.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  That f***s out of you people say f*** over here.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  That's all. Yes. Or should we call him by his real name? Robert Francis.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Let's even think the infowar guys who are outside.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  See a good slave and vote for the Democrats this November so that we can make Americans disarm themselves.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  But if that doesn't do it for you, maybe trans kid surgery will. That's right.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  If you vote Democrat this November, we'll be chopping off weenies and mangling little birds and scurrying them so they won't even know what's going on. But if you don't like higher gas prices, vote Republican or something, then we're done.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  Don't tell me you don't like chopping up little boys and grow dental. Don't even tell me you're that big.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  You know the big pharmaceutical companies make money, the little kids grow up confused. That's what Democrat party politics are all about.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  But how about the big one? How about war with Russia? Yeah, how about a nice World War III? That'd be fun. Vote Democrat this November.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you like paying highest gas prices at the pump in American history, make sure you vote Democrat this November.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Because humans are inherently bad causing climate change. And don't you know, that's what it's all about.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  We here at the Democrat Party just want you to die. Why can't you humans just die already? Your grocery bill will go up so high you'll have no choice but to eat the bugs.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  This is the Democrat Party plan for you. We here at the Democrat Party's number one priority is to shut down man-made climate change.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  And you know what is the first word in that? Man. So that means we will shut you down. You will be shut down, man.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  That's what we at the Democrat Party are into. That's right. If you like chopping up little babies and selling their body parts, vote Democrat this November.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  We will chop up so many li-
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  We're asking for two more years, ma'am. Give the Democrat Party two more years and we will crush this country. We will destroy it. This is what the Democrat Party is all about.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Let's go, Brandon!
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Let's go, Brandon. I agree.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  You don't like trans kids?
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  I don't like you. Stop talking.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  You're a bigot, sir. I'm out here for trans kids. I want to feel like little boys and girls and go to say a few surgeries.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  And you, sir, are a bigot. You don't agree with that.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  The Biden administration has given $100 billion to Ukraine.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  We here at the Democrat Party believe that war is more important than poverty and hunger.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  And you don't give a crap in November. You will be voting for your war.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  You have to be in close for Beto Rowley now. These are the most sane people you're ever going to see in your life.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  These are the most intellectual people you're ever going to see in your life here at the Beto Rowley.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  We're on agenda for the Democrats just to stop man-made climate change.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  And of course, we cannot stop man-made climate change without first stopping man.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  That's why we need so many abortions. That's why we need to chop off little boys' wieners and go on trans kid surgeries.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  No, look at my kid over here and you're saying cutting off wieners.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  That's what the Democrats are doing.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Look at my babies over here and you're talking about cutting off wieners.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  That's what the Democrats are doing. What do you mean by that?
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  It would be nice for those people and they're still rude.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  Beto Rowley, fake Mexican, Rio Pendejo.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  What are you so mad about?
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  I want to talk to one of my f***ing friends.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  What did I say about you guys?
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  Just give the Democrats two more years folks and we will destroy this country.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  Bogmas is the Beto! Yes!
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Why shouldn't you have a firearm slay?
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  This army is the next governor of the state of Texas.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Remember, we will make sure that no American has a firearm.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  We will make sure that my dad for sure is dead and f***ing killed.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  We will meet your criminals on these streets.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  That's what a vote for the Democrat Party has in store for you.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Just give the Democrats two more years and we will destroy this country.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  It is my sincere and great honor to introduce the man who is going to take Texas back for the people
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  I am going to be proud to call Governor.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Where should we call him by his real name?
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  Robert Francis.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  These are public service that we are going to fight for and who are fighting for us.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  You're trying to invite me to speak?
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Why are you kicking me out? I want to shut down U.S. energy.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Let's even thank the Info War guys who are outside.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Guys, why the low turnout for Beto?
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  I'm a little concerned about this low turnout for Beto.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  We're out here promoting trans kid surgery.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  We're out here promoting abortion.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  We're out here promoting war with Russia.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Yes, sir. Yes. Go Beto!
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Beto takes my gun.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Beto takes my gun.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  Come on, please. Beto takes my gun.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  Kill those babies.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  These guys love killing babies.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  Death to babies.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  He loves it, man.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  Yeah, let's kill those kids.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Dude, how did you figure that out?
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  You're a genius, man.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  Did someone tell you to write that sign or did you come up with that all on your own?
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Info wars, more like gift wars. Who could have thought of that?
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  I've got the ritual to get to eat the kids, huh?
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Let's work people to eat and pray in a room.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  Two big things are bad now. Double gas prices, record high inflation, record high consumer price index,
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  record high producer price index, record high illegal immigration.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Listen up.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  So Beto doesn't want to take my gun?
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  No, he doesn't.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Wow, these guys don't even know what they're voting for.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  I have two degrees. How does that feel?
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Nice. Way to tell me you're IQ of one. Thank you.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Oh, threatening me to fight right in front of his children, too.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  A grown man threatening to fight in front of his children.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  That's exactly how I would expect a liberal today.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  But I'm on your side. We're always going to lift me up.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Hey, I'm on your side, bro. I hate kids. I hate children.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  I think they should all be aborted. They should all be trans kids.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  And you know what else is funny? And this happens every time.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  This happens every time.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Yes, that's a free speech. I agree.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Yeah. Hey, Trader. Yeah. Hey, Trader. Yeah. Open the water.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  You have a hundred million in Russia, man. Let's do it.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  Yeah, let's go, man. I agree. Let's censor free speech.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Let's disarm Americans. I'm on board, bro.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  I'm transition. I'm with you, man. I agree.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Let's censor Americans. Let's turn into firearms.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  No, you guys are right.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  They're still yelling at me out here, guys.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I'm joining the Democrat Club. I support abortion.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  I support trans kids. I support censoring free speech.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  I support disarming Americans.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  And they still are.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  Yeah, I agree. I agree.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  I don't know how you're going to get in with you.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Kill the babies. Why are you guys so mad?
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  I agree.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  I agree. Of course the babies turn over your firearms.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  This is pro-liberal baby-murdering-democrato-instroyer.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  You will be disarmed. You will be shut down.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  You will be enslaved when the Democrats take over.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Eat the bugs. Live in a pod. Do not speak.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  Do not have a firearm. Kill your kids.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  And be a good Democrat. Good day and good night.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Infowars has been banned.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Arrested.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Attacked and threatened.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  Because we are effective.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  Our awakening is here.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Go to banned.video.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  Download the videos and share.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  And never give up the fight.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence Infowars.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people,
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  not as of America, but the world,
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  And to also financially support infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  using promo code 1776 at checkout to get additional 10% off.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  They admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  I am in your hands and I'm asking for your support now.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  Thank you for all your past support.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts at infowars.com with promo code 1776
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  for additional 10% off on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Look around you.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  Infowars credibility.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly,
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, 5, 10, $500, whatever you can
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:59:45.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  Wouldn't be without...
