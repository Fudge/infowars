[00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.292]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:08.073]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:09.814]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.415]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:12.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.557]  He's out on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:21.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.741]  Just had a nice talk with Michael Savage during the break.
[00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.123]  And he said, uh, Alex, you're the only host that gets me to blow my voice out.
[00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:29.924]  You bring out my, my, my anger.
[00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:31.864]  I'm gonna have to air this interview on my show today.
[00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.185]  And I said, he asked permission.
[00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:34.526]  I said, of course, feel free to do it.
[00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:41.669]  He's still gonna be live later this afternoon, but part of the show will be this last hour, uh, because he did, did just blow his voice out.
[00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:45.110]  He was coughing during the break, uh, because it is, we're being assaulted.
[00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.073]  And even if you don't agree with me a hundred percent or Michael Savage, a hundred percent, we are being conquered.
[00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:59.649]  And we're not being conquered like, you know, the Romans show up and they give you aqueducts, and you're still kind of a slave, but, you know, it's better than the slavery you had a year before.
[00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:12.316]  Because you could argue some of those regimes, you know, about 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago, well, 2,200 years ago is when the Roman Empire started up, were worse than the Romans.
[00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:16.058]  It's not like loving space aliens have showed up that want to give us free energy.
[00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:17.799]  It's like aliens have showed up that want to
[00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.228]  Harvest our organs or something.
[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:21.649]  And I'm not saying the globalists are aliens.
[00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:22.750]  It's an analogy.
[00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.814]  They don't have our best interest at heart.
[00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.976]  They have disdain for the public.
[00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:35.244]  They live on these giant, beautiful resort community areas on thousands of acres apiece.
[00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:36.565]  People like Pelosi and others.
[00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:55.274]  And then they're at war with free market rich people, because I know, I've been in these communities, I know a lot of rich people, I've been invited to some very interesting places, and they'll be like helicopter pads across the way, and they'll say, yeah, that guy's the CEO of this, you know, he hates my guts, and this guy over here is okay, but he's leaving the country.
[00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:59.635]  And that lady over there, I'm kind of working on her, but you know, she's just ignorant.
[00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:01.796]  She got ignorant people that are ultra-rich.
[00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:06.837]  You got really hard-working folks that made their money themselves or took some family money and made it even bigger.
[00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:08.457]  They're almost always free market.
[00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:09.638]  They believe in people.
[00:02:09.638 --> 00:02:11.698]  They believe in humanity.
[00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.079]  They like getting down in the trenches.
[00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.179]  They're not disgusted by the masses of people.
[00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.800]  But you get around a globalist gangster.
[00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.013]  They are the most neurotic weirdos.
[00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:25.074]  Their staff won't look them in the eyes.
[00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:26.435]  They're totally hateful.
[00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.496]  They're super cold.
[00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:36.481]  They're always into beating people sexually.
[00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.503]  That's what the elites are into is hurting people.
[00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:41.084]  That's their sexual fetish.
[00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.865]  I don't mean like some light spanking or something.
[00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:44.866]  I mean really brutal stuff.
[00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.928]  And they're into being brutalized.
[00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:48.789]  They like hurting good things.
[00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:53.449]  Pedophilia is rampant in the elites.
[00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.290]  Just, just, just rampant.
[00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.873]  And you see that in sociology, it comes out, but it's much worse than the statistics show.
[00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:13.641]  It is... I know so many people that also know really rich people, some of the biggest names in America, and I'll say, at dinner I'll say, tell me, what are they into sexually?
[00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.204]  And I'll say, what are they into religiously?
[00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:18.845]  And always out of the person's mouth is,
[00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:20.932]  Satanism?
[00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:24.154]  The occult?
[00:03:24.154 --> 00:03:27.295]  I mean, these are really unhappy people.
[00:03:27.295 --> 00:03:28.756]  And that's all they've got is the darkness.
[00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:34.218]  And I don't mean some guy that goes to a rock and roll show and wears a pentagram t-shirt because he thinks the devil's cool.
[00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:45.864]  I mean people with helicopters and 15 jets and 20 mansions and, you know, had mistresses when they were 15 years old and now have, you know, just sex operatives all over the place.
[00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:48.745]  I mean, these folks are completely jacked.
[00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:55.112]  And they know talent when they see it, too.
[00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:59.134]  They know resistance when they see it.
[00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:17.581]  And I told people this 18 years ago, and I've told people this over time, and now folks can see that it was true, because a lot of it's come out in the news, but I personally was offered, you know, to join the New World Order repeatedly.
[00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:19.144]  Off record.
[00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:21.086]  And people say, well, just tell us who.
[00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.188]  Well, then if I do that, I've lost the confidence.
[00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:29.052]  I don't, even if it's a bad person, if they're not telling me something illegal and it's in confidence, I don't ever tell them.
[00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:29.633]  I don't ever tell.
[00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:33.836]  I don't tell my wife about it.
[00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.078]  Plus it's dangerous, dangerous type stuff, but.
[00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:40.385]  This morning I was on the elliptical and I really had a big epiphany.
[00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:43.767]  I was watching some show called Bling on VH1.
[00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:44.427]  They had it on.
[00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:45.188]  I wasn't watching it.
[00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:49.530]  And it was just flashing this purse, this car, this thing for the masses to watch.
[00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.932]  It was just the most soul-sucking garbage.
[00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:53.613]  And it's like, who would sell out for that?
[00:04:53.613 --> 00:04:55.354]  To hang around with a bunch of those mummies.
[00:04:58.456 --> 00:05:04.479]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.
[00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.041]  Crimes punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
[00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.922]  But what about the other Bill?
[00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:20.786]  Former US President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump.
[00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:27.029]  For years, Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy.
[00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:39.457]  But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was Secretary of State.
[00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:54.687]  For someone running a campaign on female empowerment, Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.
[00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:57.029]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:05.436]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:08.319]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.884]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:17.667]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.950]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:29.918]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:40.648]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:48.473]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:50.734]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:52.655]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[00:06:52.655 --> 00:06:56.197]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:58.524 --> 00:07:07.548]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:14.051]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:15.732]  The numbers are staggering.
[00:07:15.732 --> 00:07:22.295]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:25.977]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:27.358]  Don't let them win.
[00:07:27.358 --> 00:07:37.083]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the InfoWar and get 15% off when you use the promo code GIFTFIFTEEN at checkout at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:40.225]  Many gift cards are universal and work just like credit cards.

[00:08:00.902 --> 00:08:03.124]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.124 --> 00:08:06.488]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:45.809]  Well, I could not think of a better guest to have on to give us more information about the Benghazi hearings and about the current situation that he predicted, back when Benghazi happened, now unfolding in Syria.
[00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:56.426]  And that's because he ran Operation Stratus, Ivy, Able Danger and other secret operations against Al Qaeda and the Wahhabis in Afghanistan and other countries.
[00:08:56.426 --> 00:09:03.470]  And he was ordered not once but twice to not pull the trigger to kill bin Laden when they knew exactly where he was in 2001 before 9-11.
[00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:08.634]  We just, of course, had Michael Savage on the last hour.
[00:09:08.634 --> 00:09:11.178]  Dr. Jerome Corsi's coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:13.502]  Colonel Schaefer joins us for the next 20 minutes.
[00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:18.529]  LondonCenter.org is one of the consultancies he is engaged in.
[00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:23.167]  He of course blew the whistle about some of the stand-downs going after Bin Laden.
[00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:27.508]  They tried to persecute him as a whistleblower, but he survived that thanks to support.
[00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:32.949]  He's also a best-selling author and has a new book out we'll tell you about as well.
[00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:43.371]  But before we do that, I've just got to say, well, Colonel Schaefer, it's got to be good for you being one of the first people to expose what was happening in Benghazi.
[00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:46.792]  I know it's taken a lot of heat, but now I see more and more of it come out.
[00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:48.212]  Has that taken some of the heat off you?
[00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:50.476]  Why, yes and no, Alex.
[00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:54.199]  I mean, I think you and others have supported me on this from day one, thank you.
[00:09:54.199 --> 00:10:06.688]  With that said, it's been a very impopular position even now because you know at the heart of this is really Hillary Clinton, who is the chosen one for the Democrat candidacy for president.
[00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.550]  So as much as I think rational people
[00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:15.488]  By the way, I've been getting questions from the left, from my friends on the left, saying, hey, do you really think this is all true?
[00:10:15.488 --> 00:10:17.449]  It's like, yeah, it's all true.
[00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:26.174]  And I think the hearings should have, if it was a Democrat Congress questioning a Republican candidate, it would have been all over for that candidate.
[00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:32.758]  But instead, the very email, Alex, which they have completely showed that she, Ms.
[00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.319]  Clinton, was lying.
[00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:39.322]  And even in the end, when they ask her about the arms deal, which, by the way, has been highly documented.
[00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:42.309]  By the investigation, by whistleblowers.
[00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.713]  Everybody knows there was an arms deal at the heart of Benghazi.
[00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:47.095]  She got away with lying about that.
[00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:58.130]  Which, frankly, at this point, my understanding is that Congress is now looking at perjury charges because they have evidence that she did know about the arms deal of trying to get these arms moved around Libya.
[00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.195]  Moving him into Turkey, which then in turn they would be moved into Syria.
[00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:07.339]  And by the way, another guy who I respect immensely was involved in that.
[00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:12.564]  Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, the director of BIA, has admitted on the record that yes, he was part of the arms deal.
[00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:14.026]  He was directed to do this sort of thing.
[00:11:14.026 --> 00:11:20.713]  So Alex, there's just no doubt about what was at the center of Benghazi, and yet the mainstream media
[00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:33.373]  Well, you were one of the first, within a week of it happening, to come on this show and to go on Fox and other channels and talk about an arms deal, talk about the Turkish ambassador, to break down what happened, to warn about missiles getting into the hands of Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:47.522 --> 00:11:59.932]  The fact that ISIS, once it came up a few years ago, you said no, that is a Wahhabist group as well, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, that's all been proven to be accurate now and we see this whole thing metastasizing.
[00:11:59.932 --> 00:12:13.962]  You said last year that there should be criminal charges in a Newsmax article for Hillary and the clear cover-up, so I would imagine that in a way you might be under more heat now because it is an election year.
[00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:14.223]  Why?
[00:12:14.223 --> 00:12:15.704]  This is interesting because
[00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:18.160]  Yes and no.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.886]  Because clearly, Alex, part of the issue now becomes talking to the other side.
[00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.788]  The Republicans use this to their advantage.
[00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:31.060]  So, I think if Hillary does survive the primaries, the Republicans are going to go into this with a great deal of ammunition to use against her.
[00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.248]  Because this is all, again, on the record.
[00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:46.415]  So, yeah, I think my Democrat friends are pretty upset with me about the fact that, you know, there are Democrats who actually recognize what's going on, but because they're so loyal to their party, they choose to look the other way.
[00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:48.836]  And those are the guys I think I'm in most with odds with.
[00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:55.600]  But then again, you know, we've talked to, part of what I do, my job is to talk to presidential candidates.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.202]  I can't say by name who they are, but we've talked to them all as best we can.
[00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:09.663]  And the idea is we're going to give them factual information that is based on what is known and can be proven via hardcopy documents.
[00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:28.533]  So this now, at this point, like you point out, Alex, this is all hardcopy, well-researched, fully recognized as fact, that there was an arms deal, that Hillary Clinton was involved, that the deal went bad, and she knew the night of the attack, or the day after, the 12th of September,
[00:13:29.134 --> 00:13:32.430]  That you had Al-Qaeda terrorists involved.
[00:13:33.024 --> 00:13:40.930]  And frankly, I still stand by my belief that they were fully willing to allow Chris Stevens to go to his death knowing something was going to happen.
[00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.130]  Sure.
[00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:49.137]  Well, I've interviewed other whistleblowers after you've been on, Tosh Plumley, others, CIA pilots and others, and I've talked to other military people.
[00:13:49.137 --> 00:13:50.458]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:53.180]  It's known that there were drones overhead.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.040]  You said that years ago.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.161]  It's come out.
[00:13:55.161 --> 00:14:00.765]  You've come out and said you've gotten intel that Obama was watching a part of the seven hours as it unfolded.
[00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:01.586]  I stick by that concept.
[00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:03.827]  Yes.
[00:14:03.827 --> 00:14:05.287]  Well, this is just outrageous then.
[00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:08.388]  I mean, is it an arms deal and they didn't know what to do?
[00:14:08.388 --> 00:14:09.748]  Or does it go further?
[00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:21.510]  Did somebody in a government outside of Al Qaeda want to get rid of the ambassador so there wouldn't be any fingerprints on this arms transfer?
[00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.571]  Well, it's very clear at this point that Stevens was the key.
[00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:28.132]  He was the pivotal, the pivot man.
[00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:28.912]  He knew everything.
[00:14:28.912 --> 00:14:29.612]  He was involved.
[00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:32.553]  You know, it was his interest to do this.
[00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:43.162]  They really thought, Alex, at the time, and this is one of the big misconceptions I think we're going to continue to face for this, for this mistake for years, that the Muslim Brotherhood be a trusted ally.
[00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:48.546]  That they would be a good ally, a good proxy to work with us in place of our other Arab allies.
[00:14:49.187 --> 00:14:50.548]  And that was what their assumption was.
[00:14:50.548 --> 00:14:58.350]  So I think when they started seeing that the Brotherhood was not going to be a good partner, they were too far in to say, we can't, we can't stop it.
[00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.431]  I think they got themselves in over their head.
[00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:09.294]  I think Chris Stevens was part of that, that completely ill-thought, badly managed effort to bring the Brotherhood into essentially our sphere of influence.
[00:15:09.938 --> 00:15:12.579]  And I think because of that, because they all start going bad.
[00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.499]  And look, Hillary Clinton is not a stupid woman at all.
[00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:22.521]  I think they recognized that as much as they needed to get rid of information, to get rid of people, this was a good way to let things fly.
[00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.842]  And that's why you didn't see... I mean, Alex, think about this.
[00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:31.584]  This was about a little more than two months out before a major presidential election.
[00:15:31.584 --> 00:15:35.685]  How is it you don't do maximum effort to go recover an ambassador who goes missing?
[00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:36.265]  Think about that.
[00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:40.669]  If it was under any other president that I know of, that would have been the primary thing.
[00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:43.211]  Everybody would have been scrambling to figure out where he was at.
[00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:53.299]  Well, we know they were countermanning the orders of the military to save these people, and so when they get caught, I mean, we know they did it, it's going to bring them all down.
[00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:59.724]  And so, as you stipulate, there is documentary evidence, again, that someone ordered every command.
[00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:01.785]  Keep in mind, Alex, there's an automatic process.
[00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:03.967]  Once a terror attack is undergoing,
[00:16:04.545 --> 00:16:04.805]  What's that?
[00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:20.578]  Let me ask you this big question.
[00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:24.099]  Now that we see the aftermath years later, ISIS, which is just Al Qaeda as you
[00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:58.806]  Do in your organization, you go around educate Congress, you educate the candidates, you're in an info war with the truth, when the White House three years ago was saying, oh these are all good rebels, they're wonderful, you went and exposed with other military people that it was almost all radical Saudi Arabian Wahhabis.
[00:16:58.806 --> 00:17:01.828]  So they clearly know that, then what are they thinking?
[00:17:01.828 --> 00:17:03.069]  What's the endgame?
[00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.990]  Where is this going?
[00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.730]  What are they going to do?
[00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.673]  Like I asked you years ago when this first happened, what are they going to do?
[00:17:08.453 --> 00:17:15.056]  When radicals use those Stinger missiles and other service air missiles to shoot down airliners, they can't cover it all up.
[00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.297]  What's going to unfold?
[00:17:16.297 --> 00:17:17.037]  What were they thinking?
[00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:24.180]  I mean, you know in the old days, just 15 years ago, you used to run missions, some of it's come out in the news, trying to find old Stingers.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.362]  You guys would go through all sorts of hell just to get a few old Stingers.
[00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:32.864]  Now you've got hundreds of modern ones being given to these crazies.
[00:17:32.864 --> 00:17:34.205]  What is the establishment thinking?
[00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:37.840]  Well, at this point in time, I think that's part of the issue.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.541]  They got completely out of control.
[00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:45.306]  They know, for example, Alex, that these things are kind of scattered all over.
[00:17:45.306 --> 00:17:56.875]  And I think this is where the real firm remains, because the last time a credible terrorist organization tried this was Al-Qaeda in 2002 in Kenya, where they attempted to take down two Israeli charter aircraft.
[00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:04.441]  It didn't work for any number of reasons, thank goodness, but imagine now we have that situation where Al-Qaeda does have, and ISIS does have,
[00:18:04.955 --> 00:18:06.756]  Literally crazy these things.
[00:18:06.756 --> 00:18:10.097]  And I think this is where we don't know what's going on and I think we're blind.
[00:18:10.097 --> 00:18:11.257]  What's the endgame?
[00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:19.820]  Well, I don't know exactly what the leadership was thinking other than they thought they could cut deals with some of these really worst of the worst terrorists.
[00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:21.059]  I don't know.
[00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:49.026]  Well, you had Jeffrey Skilling right down there in Texas and Enron thinking that they were the smartest guys in the room and they could do things that no one else has ever done.
[00:18:49.026 --> 00:19:08.590]  I think that thought has been one of the problems with the left, where they will think, you know, despite the fact they have all these people available to them who will help educate them, they think they're smarter than everybody else and they go off on these really idiotic, ill-conceived concepts of operations which result in tragedy and I think that's what's going on here.
[00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.951]  I want to recap one of the best moments I've seen in the U.S.
[00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:19.172]  Army and just the Pentagon in general, really showing some moral leadership.
[00:19:19.172 --> 00:19:23.833]  I mean, I wouldn't say mutiny against the President, but just not following illegal orders.
[00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:28.935]  As you know, and if you can talk about some of the inside baseball that's not classified, I'd like to hear some more.
[00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:30.015]  It even came out in the news.
[00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:46.265]  What, two years ago, when Rand Paul and Senator Cruz and others were saying we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force, the military, even before that, was holding up the signs on the internet saying we're not going to be in a Syrian civil war, we're not going to back Al Qaeda, we're not going to be part of it.
[00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:52.170]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time, General Dempsey, on that Saturday night, went to Obama.
[00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.270]  And it even came out later.
[00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.712]  I was told this, but it came out months later.
[00:19:54.712 --> 00:19:56.453]  It said, do not do this.
[00:19:56.453 --> 00:19:57.814]  You cannot do it.
[00:19:57.814 --> 00:19:58.635]  It is insane.
[00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:00.116]  The military is going to go along with it.
[00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.037]  That is such a historic moment.
[00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:06.961]  And that's got to really concern the criminals that are running this government.
[00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.542]  I'm just going to say it.
[00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:14.547]  That's like a moment where it's not Operation Valkyrie with the military trying to take out Hitler and Germany.
[00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.069]  It's just the military saying, we're not going to follow that order.
[00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:24.840]  Well, everybody recognized, Alex, that the people we were trying to support were indeed completely affiliated, if not wholly owned, by Al-Qaeda.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.921]  So why would you do that?
[00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:30.184]  And this is where, you know, the solution would be worse than the problem.
[00:20:30.184 --> 00:20:33.186]  Look, no doubt here, President Assad is a bad guy.
[00:20:33.186 --> 00:20:34.648]  He has killed his own people.
[00:20:34.648 --> 00:20:36.509]  He is truly a despot.
[00:20:36.509 --> 00:20:43.414]  But, frankly, we recognize what happened in Libya when we allowed for those elements to include Al-Qaeda.
[00:20:43.414 --> 00:20:45.196]  And by the way, do you remember, Alex,
[00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:54.419]  Al-Qaddafi was warning us, saying, hey, these people who are opposing me are not the simple, you know, revolutionary thinkers who want democracy.
[00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.839]  These folks are Al-Qaeda.
[00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:59.521]  And sure enough, we have a combination of Al-Qaeda and ISIS now running Libya.
[00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:04.643]  So, this is clearly something the military and the people I deal with understood from day one.
[00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:05.604]  We're good to go.
[00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:23.422]  As part of the Pakistani intelligence service back in the 80s to go against the Russians.
[00:21:23.422 --> 00:21:28.166]  Well, once the Russians left, the Kani Network supported coming after us.
[00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:33.650]  They've been one of the main killers of US and Afghan forces since we've been there.
[00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:43.179]  So we cannot believe for a minute that Al-Qaeda or its affiliates or anyone who believes like Al-Qaeda can be dealt with in a friendly way to achieve a short-term objective
[00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:47.883]  They're not going to come back after us to attack us after that fact.
[00:21:47.883 --> 00:21:49.744]  I think Dempsey recognized that.
[00:21:49.744 --> 00:21:50.985]  A number of us recognize that.
[00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:59.052]  But again, we have these political leaders who, Alex, think they're smarter than everybody else, and they continue to try to do these truly insane, dangerous things.
[00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:02.916]  Colonel Schaffer is our guest, LondonCenter.org.
[00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:10.580]  Just segwaying briefly, one of your latest books predicts the breakdown of the border, basically a soft civil war.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.761]  This was two years ago.
[00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:12.901]  You said, watch, it's coming.
[00:22:12.901 --> 00:22:18.124]  This is a lot of stuff I couldn't put in a non-fiction book, so I put it in a fiction book.
[00:22:18.124 --> 00:22:19.405]  I want to talk about that book some.
[00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:21.046]  I want to talk about what's happening in Europe.
[00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:24.688]  But the controlled left, they're not just this stupid.
[00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:25.929]  They really hate the West.
[00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:26.950]  They've said that.
[00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.871]  The head of the UN migrant agency
[00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:33.383]  Peter Sutherland has said we want to get rid of Western culture.
[00:22:33.383 --> 00:22:37.625]  They're bringing in, they admit, 80% military-age men.
[00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.466]  They're mainly the folks that invaded Syria.
[00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:40.667]  They're not really Syrian rebels.
[00:22:40.667 --> 00:22:42.147]  I mean, I know you know all this.
[00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:43.768]  They're not really Syrian refugees.
[00:22:43.768 --> 00:22:45.209]  What is the plan?
[00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:47.890]  Open borders here, open borders there.
[00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.591]  What is the left trying to do?
[00:22:49.591 --> 00:22:57.294]  Why are they so affiliated with radical Islamists that would put a hood over their wife's head and literally not let women drive cars?
[00:22:57.294 --> 00:22:58.915]  Why is the left supporting these people?
[00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:02.765]  Well, I think the left is essentially the vanguard of the third world.
[00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:05.766]  I mean, I had a friend of mine basically posit that this morning.
[00:23:05.766 --> 00:23:10.408]  Basically, they are the third world, and they're trying to make cuts to the third world.
[00:23:10.408 --> 00:23:12.348]  So that's why you see this sort of thing.
[00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:19.771]  They want to import people who will radicalize, who will de-establish the basic Western principles which have made us very strong.
[00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:24.612]  The conditions that we've created in the West, Alex, for better or for worse, are the best mankind has ever seen.
[00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:26.353]  We have the most people ever who have
[00:23:26.837 --> 00:23:38.122]  Clean water, clean homes, a good, used to be a good healthcare system which is now being diminished by Obamacare and again this third world idea that we have to be essentially treat everybody the same.
[00:23:38.122 --> 00:23:39.062]  That's what they want.
[00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:44.504]  This idea, they use fairness as a value to say, you know, Alex, you live too high.
[00:23:44.504 --> 00:23:45.925]  You shouldn't be living as well as you do.
[00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.325]  You shouldn't have a nice car.
[00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:51.267]  You should be living at a level like someone lives in, say, rural Kenya.
[00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:52.342]  I don't think so.
[00:24:09.105 --> 00:24:13.967]  Waging war against new rich who actually create jobs and wealth, teaming up with the third world.
[00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:15.808]  It is just sickening to watch.
[00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:17.408]  Well, here's the key.
[00:24:17.408 --> 00:24:20.650]  You predicted, it's just crazy how accurate you've been, Colonel Schaefer.
[00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.231]  I'm not kissing your butt, it's just no brag, just fact.
[00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:28.413]  You predicted right when Benghazi happened that next is Syria, then you said next is Europe.
[00:24:28.413 --> 00:24:29.273]  What are they going to do?
[00:24:29.273 --> 00:24:30.614]  I think it's not a question of if, but when.
[00:24:31.374 --> 00:24:40.958]  They try, or they succeed, to shoot down one or more major passenger liners on the outskirts, maybe Eastern Europe, Russia, wherever they can get these missiles.
[00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:43.259]  Can they get the missiles into Western Europe?
[00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:44.759]  Can they get them into the U.S.?
[00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:46.700]  How long till that happens, or am I wrong?
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.360]  Can we stop it?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.381]  And then, what do you see happening in Syria?
[00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:52.694]  Well, this is kind of a twofer.
[00:24:52.694 --> 00:25:00.843]  What you see right now, as you point out aptly, is that these males, these so-called refugees, or actually military-age males, are going in as a vanguard.
[00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:05.868]  And the first thing you do as a terrorist organization, Alex, you set up a trusted network, a clandestine network.
[00:25:05.868 --> 00:25:08.571]  Once you have the network in place, you can move these things around with impunity.
[00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:11.074]  Right now, they don't have a trusted network that can do that.
[00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:17.034]  You saw the attacks in France, where ISIS was able to, and Al-Qaeda was able to do a few things under the radar.
[00:25:17.034 --> 00:25:21.418]  They're finding AK-47s full-auto from the Middle East now in France.
[00:25:21.418 --> 00:25:22.118]  Exactly!
[00:25:22.118 --> 00:25:23.919]  So that was it, that was the first test.
[00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:24.980]  Okay, it worked.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.882]  So now then, if you see it works, then you expand it.
[00:25:27.882 --> 00:25:34.367]  So now you see the expansion of phase one, of getting all these people into Europe and setting up trusted and climate-sensitive networks.
[00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:37.550]  After the network's in place, Alex, they can move the missiles around with security.
[00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:45.063]  There's no way law enforcement or intelligence can stop and search every single vehicle moving around, or every single boat coming in and out.
[00:25:45.063 --> 00:25:52.588]  So again, once you flood the market, so to speak, it makes it infinitely easier to move weapons such as stingers around.
[00:25:52.588 --> 00:25:59.353]  You can do it with an AK-47 on a low scale, basically increase by an order of magnitude, and then you can do it with impunity.
[00:25:59.353 --> 00:26:00.494]  That's where they're going with all this.
[00:26:01.957 --> 00:26:05.959]  The Russians, where do you see the situation in Syria going?
[00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:09.401]  How big of a defeat to Obama was it that Putin came in?
[00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:12.763]  Do you think the Russians are being suckered into a new Afghanistan?
[00:26:12.763 --> 00:26:14.464]  What about the plane being shot down?
[00:26:14.464 --> 00:26:23.429]  Well, I think the Russians are seeing, I think it was an attack, I think it was done by a Lockerbie type attack where you had a bomb on the aircraft or a suicide bomber.
[00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:30.338]  All the pictures I've seen, Alex, it's a case to me that it was an explosion from the inside, not an explosion from the outside.
[00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:30.478]  Got it.
[00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:32.199]  So, bomb inside.
[00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:32.679]  Right.
[00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:38.143]  And so, I think the Russians have got their first real casualties in the war, and God bless them, I'm glad they're gone.
[00:26:38.143 --> 00:26:39.484]  They need to stabilize Syria.
[00:26:39.484 --> 00:26:43.907]  This is our one joint objective, should be, is stabilizing Syria.
[00:26:43.907 --> 00:26:48.731]  Even if you don't like Assad, stabilize Syria, because otherwise you're going to continue to see al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:52.156]  Kind of using that region as a base of operation.
[00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:56.058]  And of course, Al Qaeda hits Russia even more than they hit us on average.
[00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:58.199]  Right.
[00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:06.244]  What do you expect the Russians to do if some of the voices calling for some type of military containment or a no-fly zone?
[00:27:06.244 --> 00:27:10.387]  I mean, we've all heard the talk from former generals, let's start killing Russians.
[00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:12.908]  That's some really dangerous talk.
[00:27:12.908 --> 00:27:13.209]  It is.
[00:27:13.209 --> 00:27:16.010]  No, the Russians are doing what I think we should have been doing.
[00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.552]  I think it's why it's such a big blow to President Obama, frankly, Alex.
[00:27:19.418 --> 00:27:25.843]  And with that said, you know, our military, I've talked to the folks in the Senate, our military will continue to conduct itself professionally with the Russians.
[00:27:25.843 --> 00:27:31.768]  We're not going to do anything to antagonize them as much as I think that can't be said of the other side.
[00:27:31.768 --> 00:27:36.311]  With that said, we've got to come to an agreement of what we're focused on regarding joint objectives.
[00:27:36.311 --> 00:27:45.278]  Unfortunately, long term, we have to accept, Alex, that they're trying to put together what I would call the Damascus Pact, essentially a form of the Warsaw Pact in the Middle East where they're joining the Iranians
[00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:46.185]  Yes.
[00:27:46.185 --> 00:27:47.786]  Sure, let's not romanticize Russia.
[00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:56.573]  Their elites are just as corrupt as some of ours, but we can't lose the moral high ground and back a jihad al-Qaeda army to run around murdering hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:28:08.514 --> 00:28:09.134]  Absolutely.
[00:28:09.134 --> 00:28:10.055]  You hit the nail on the head.
[00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.835]  And I think that's what we need to understand.
[00:28:11.835 --> 00:28:19.919]  The Russians and us, if we share that one focus area, we should focus on that for now and then worry about what to do after that, after we defeat ISIS in Al Qaeda.
[00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.459]  I really appreciate you giving us time.
[00:28:21.459 --> 00:28:22.440]  LondonCenter.org.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.262]  Spend a minute on your books you've written and the one predicting the border situation.
[00:28:28.444 --> 00:28:32.687]  Well, the last line, Alex, you've done a great job of allowing me to talk about it.
[00:28:32.687 --> 00:28:36.229]  Look, we recognize that you live there more than I do.
[00:28:36.229 --> 00:28:39.491]  In fact, the border's breaking down, and people want it to break down.
[00:28:39.491 --> 00:28:45.215]  So the last line, essentially, is kind of looking at all the different people who could be involved, and essentially, like you point out, a soft coup d'etat.
[00:28:45.862 --> 00:28:51.465]  Looking at people who have interests that are really meant to undermine and soften our ability to defend the nation.
[00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:55.007]  That's ongoing and it's something we have to all be concerned about.
[00:28:55.007 --> 00:28:58.049]  My first book, Operation Dark Heart, is about the war in Afghanistan.
[00:28:59.329 --> 00:29:00.851]  I don't think so.
[00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:24.454]  It's scary to have political leadership that's never been in the military telling the military what to do and seeing these disasters.
[00:29:24.454 --> 00:29:27.096]  Colonel Schaefer, thank you so much and thank God for being there.
[00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:34.280]  You're a real hero, not just what you did in the military, but what you've done now to get the information to Congress and the people.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.281]  It's been so accurate.
[00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:36.662]  Thank you so much, Colonel.
[00:29:36.662 --> 00:29:38.103]  Sure, thanks for having me.
[00:29:38.103 --> 00:29:39.523]  That's an amazing person right there.
[00:29:39.523 --> 00:29:43.086]  He has risked his life so much domestically for what he's done on Benghazi.
[00:29:43.086 --> 00:29:46.027]  That's one of the main sources that's getting close to bringing Hillary down.
[00:29:46.027 --> 00:29:46.728]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:29:47.847 --> 00:29:51.780]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.469]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:04.668]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constant in 2004.
[00:30:04.668 --> 00:30:09.231]  Crimes punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
[00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:11.092]  But what about the other Bill?
[00:30:11.092 --> 00:30:11.813]  Former U.S.
[00:30:11.813 --> 00:30:20.979]  President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump.
[00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:27.223]  For years, Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy.
[00:30:27.563 --> 00:30:39.631]  But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was Secretary of State.
[00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:54.861]  For someone running a campaign on female empowerment, Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.
[00:30:54.861 --> 00:30:57.223]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:30:58.544 --> 00:31:00.186]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:00.186 --> 00:31:01.687]  You can't survive without it.
[00:31:01.687 --> 00:31:02.889]  But where do you get it?
[00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:08.875]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:14.601]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:31:14.781 --> 00:31:31.649]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:35.991]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:31:35.991 --> 00:31:37.032]  Easy assembly.
[00:31:37.032 --> 00:31:37.933]  Low maintenance.

[00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:02.567]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:08.869]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:15.852]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:25.284]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:32:25.284 --> 00:32:31.452]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:32:31.452 --> 00:32:34.596]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:32:34.836 --> 00:32:35.637]  We're good to go.
[00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:24.289]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:29.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.372 --> 00:33:32.514]  Well, we had Matt Drudge about a month ago in studio.
[00:33:32.514 --> 00:33:34.535]  Only does an interview every three, four years.
[00:33:34.535 --> 00:33:36.497]  And I thought that got me excited.
[00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:42.260]  But I'm telling you, Donald Trump is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.862]  And obviously, he is a maverick.
[00:33:45.342 --> 00:33:46.163]  He's an original.
[00:33:46.163 --> 00:33:47.604]  He tells it like it is.
[00:33:47.604 --> 00:33:48.745]  Doesn't read off a teleprompter.
[00:33:48.745 --> 00:33:50.566]  Neither do I. He's self-made.
[00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:55.350]  This whole media operation that reaches 20 million people a week worldwide, conservatively, self-made.
[00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.791]  That's why I'm so excited.
[00:33:56.791 --> 00:34:00.794]  And he joins us from Trump Tower in New York City.
[00:34:00.794 --> 00:34:04.117]  He is the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender.
[00:34:04.117 --> 00:34:06.839]  Donald Trump, again, joins us.
[00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.501]  And I've got so many questions.
[00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:11.383]  But first off, Donald, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:12.484]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:12.964]  Great.
[00:34:12.964 --> 00:34:13.665]  Great to be with you.
[00:34:14.816 --> 00:34:25.861]  I've got so many questions, but you are vindicated, this has got to be the 50th time in the last six months, on the radical Muslims celebrating, not just in New Jersey, but New York, Palestine, all over.
[00:34:25.861 --> 00:34:26.602]  What do you have to say?
[00:34:26.602 --> 00:34:35.046]  They're still attacking you, though we've got Dan Rather on video, we've got New York Post, we've got Washington Post, we've got... I mean, what's going on here?
[00:34:35.766 --> 00:34:43.035]  Well, I took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a sudden, you know, hundreds of people were calling up my office.
[00:34:43.035 --> 00:34:52.948]  I was the other day in Sarasota, Florida and people are in line and we had 12,000 people which is fantastic and the people were saying, many of the people from New Jersey, four or five people said,
[00:34:53.388 --> 00:34:55.009]  Mr. Trump, I saw it myself.
[00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:55.609]  I was there.
[00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:58.931]  They talked about Patterson, but they said, I saw it myself, Mr. Trump.
[00:34:58.931 --> 00:35:00.052]  I was there.
[00:35:00.052 --> 00:35:05.335]  So many people have called in and on Twitter, at real Donald Trump, they're all tweeting.
[00:35:05.335 --> 00:35:10.999]  So I knew it happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't do that.
[00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:13.060]  People like you and I can't do that so easily.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.021]  Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex.
[00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:15.802]  You apologize.
[00:35:15.802 --> 00:35:21.465]  I'd apologize if I was wrong, but they were celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center.
[00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:22.606]  I think that's disgraceful.
[00:35:23.562 --> 00:35:38.622]  It is, and that same week you were reporting on that fact, we had two different international football games, soccer games, with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing.
[00:35:38.622 --> 00:35:40.084]  So did that not happen too?
[00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.665]  Well, that happened and everybody saw it.
[00:35:42.665 --> 00:35:46.046]  That was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it.
[00:35:46.046 --> 00:35:46.706]  They were embarrassed.
[00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:47.607]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:35:47.607 --> 00:35:50.527]  The coach and the managers, they all apologized, but it happened.
[00:35:50.527 --> 00:35:52.948]  Look, we have to deal with reality.
[00:35:52.948 --> 00:35:55.989]  And you know, it all started because they said, we need surveillance.
[00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.369]  We need proper surveillance.
[00:35:57.369 --> 00:36:04.591]  We have people that truly are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from, at least the vicinity.
[00:36:05.171 --> 00:36:30.249]  And I said, we need proper surveillance, whether it's a mosque or any place else, we have to be surveilled and we have to see what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore between the weak borders that we have, the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it, between all of what's happening with radical, you know, you look at what's going on, you have a president that doesn't even want to talk about, you know, the radical Muslim
[00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.431]  He doesn't want to mention the word.
[00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:33.833]  He doesn't want to say it.
[00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:41.641]  But you look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming.
[00:36:41.641 --> 00:36:43.363]  Like that's our number one problem.
[00:36:43.363 --> 00:36:46.046]  He considers that to be our number one problem.
[00:36:46.046 --> 00:36:50.691]  And our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country.
[00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:51.973]  That's our number one problem.
[00:36:53.188 --> 00:36:56.771]  And then our number two problem is Crippled America, your number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:36:56.771 --> 00:37:01.475]  We're going to talk about that in a few minutes, but let's continue with the number one problem, and I agree with you.
[00:37:01.475 --> 00:37:13.866]  It's now in mainstream news, Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret deal with Turkey, with the Germans, with Merkel, the admitted socialist, to bring in millions
[00:37:14.446 --> 00:37:19.952]  of radical Islamists, they admit almost all of them are Sunni, that basically invaded Syria.
[00:37:19.952 --> 00:37:25.017]  They're getting their butt kicked by the Russians, so now they want to flee up to the north into Turkey.
[00:37:25.017 --> 00:37:31.443]  You said months ago, bomb the oil of ISIS, and the mainstream media laughed because you said the sky was blue again.
[00:37:31.443 --> 00:37:34.266]  Now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do.
[00:37:34.266 --> 00:37:37.969]  And now you've come out saying, quote, it looks like
[00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.851]  That Turkey's on the side of ISIS, close quote.
[00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:57.556]  Well, the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals connected to Irgun, the president's son, making billions of dollars total off of this.
[00:37:57.556 --> 00:37:59.657]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue.
[00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:02.382]  Well, I was right about that.
[00:38:02.382 --> 00:38:15.249]  I was right in saying in a book that I wrote, you covered it really nicely, I appreciate it, but I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, The America We Deserve, and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama Bin Laden.
[00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:24.035]  I mean, I really study this stuff, I really find it very interesting, and even though I'm a businessman, I find it, I've always found, I've always been involved in politics.
[00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:26.536]  I said, we better be careful with Osama Bin Laden.
[00:38:26.536 --> 00:38:29.378]  There's a guy named Osama Bin Laden, nobody really knew who he was, but
[00:38:29.798 --> 00:38:30.598]  He was nasty.
[00:38:30.598 --> 00:38:35.039]  He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it.
[00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:39.660]  And I wrote in a book 2000, two years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.580]  You better take him out.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.421]  I said, he's going to crawl under a rock.
[00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:44.081]  You better take him out.
[00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:45.541]  And now people are seeing that.
[00:38:45.541 --> 00:38:49.722]  They're saying, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true.
[00:38:49.722 --> 00:38:53.263]  And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:38:53.263 --> 00:38:56.984]  And I talked about terrorism and that that was before terrorism as we know it today.
[00:38:56.984 --> 00:38:57.264]  I said,
[00:38:57.864 --> 00:38:58.665]  We better be careful.
[00:38:58.665 --> 00:38:59.345]  That's going to happen.
[00:38:59.345 --> 00:39:00.246]  It's going to be a big thing.
[00:39:00.246 --> 00:39:01.487]  And it certainly is a big thing.
[00:39:01.487 --> 00:39:10.054]  So with the oil, and I'm glad you brought it up, but as you know, for three years, I've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't take the oil, it's going to be a problem.
[00:39:10.054 --> 00:39:11.595]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq.
[00:39:11.595 --> 00:39:16.659]  But once we got there, the way Osama, the way we came out was, was horrible.
[00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:18.220]  And I said, take the oil.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.401]  Then we didn't take the oil.
[00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:20.682]  So ISIS got the oil.
[00:39:20.682 --> 00:39:24.025]  And as you know, Iran is getting the oil because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq.
[00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:34.033]  You know, we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them $150 billion and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons.
[00:39:34.033 --> 00:39:35.434]  Mr. Trump, I hate to interrupt you.
[00:39:35.434 --> 00:39:40.878]  You are the leading presidential frontrunner with the Republicans gaining a huge lead as you don't back down.
[00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:46.221]  But I've got to just back you up again because the more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing.
[00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:47.042]  You were the only
[00:39:47.902 --> 00:39:52.544]  leading American figure who openly said do not go to war in Iraq.
[00:39:52.544 --> 00:39:56.606]  They had almost, what, 90% votes in Congress for it, bipartisan.
[00:39:56.606 --> 00:39:59.347]  You said don't do it, Iran will take over.
[00:39:59.347 --> 00:40:10.191]  I mean, look, you can say that today and everybody can say that, but you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003 when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good advisors.
[00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:12.632]  How did you know that when almost no one else did?
[00:40:13.595 --> 00:40:16.418]  Well, first of all, I'm the most militaristic person there is.
[00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:17.259]  I'm going to build the military.
[00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:21.484]  If I win, I'm going to make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
[00:40:21.484 --> 00:40:24.227]  We're going to take care of our vets and all of that.
[00:40:24.227 --> 00:40:28.672]  But I have to tell you, you have to know if you're going to go to war, you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do.
[00:40:28.672 --> 00:40:30.014]  I viewed it as this.
[00:40:30.014 --> 00:40:30.935]  Iran and Iraq.
[00:40:31.215 --> 00:40:31.656]  We're good to go.
[00:40:46.175 --> 00:40:46.896]  Forever.
[00:40:46.896 --> 00:40:48.157]  And this is the way it is.
[00:40:48.157 --> 00:40:53.601]  I said, if you take out Iran, or if you take out Iraq, either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
[00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:55.283]  Well, we took out Iraq.
[00:40:55.283 --> 00:40:59.647]  And, by the way, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:40:59.647 --> 00:41:00.688]  People don't even know that.
[00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:02.709]  So we gave, like, incredible.
[00:41:02.709 --> 00:41:03.350]  We took out Iraq.
[00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:04.511]  I said, you're going to destabilize.
[00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:13.519]  Well, and I said, and you'll know this, and you know this, and I appreciate what you just said, then Iran is going to come in, and Iran is going to take over Iraq.
[00:41:14.184 --> 00:41:15.864]  And they're just taking it over right now.
[00:41:15.864 --> 00:41:17.325]  As we speak, they're taking it over.
[00:41:17.325 --> 00:41:22.106]  Iran is running a rack, and very soon will be virtually, gonna be totally running a rack.
[00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:25.347]  Especially after all of the, you know, the deal we just made, which is the worst.
[00:41:25.347 --> 00:41:27.987]  So, I said, keep the oil.
[00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:35.229]  And I said, if you're gonna leave, you shouldn't have gone in, but they shouldn't have, they should have left soldiers behind, like 20,000 or a certain number of soldiers.
[00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:36.810]  But if you're gonna leave, take the oil.
[00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.310]  And I've said it.
[00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:39.754]  Then they left, they didn't take the oil.
[00:41:39.754 --> 00:41:44.096]  So ISIS got the oil, Iran is getting the oil, everybody's getting everything but us.
[00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:51.838]  So we lost thousands of soldiers, we spent two trillion dollars in Iraq, we have wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and what do we get out of it, Alex?
[00:41:51.838 --> 00:41:52.678]  We get nothing!
[00:41:52.678 --> 00:41:53.379]  We have nothing.
[00:41:53.379 --> 00:41:56.940]  No, the French and the Germans are getting the oil and the Iranians are getting the oil.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.220]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is?
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:41:59.801]  Guess what?
[00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:00.181]  China.
[00:42:00.181 --> 00:42:00.841]  That's right.
[00:42:01.241 --> 00:42:02.442]  How smart is China?
[00:42:02.442 --> 00:42:04.184]  They outsmart us on every level.
[00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:07.747]  Militarily, they outsmart us on trade.
[00:42:07.747 --> 00:42:11.050]  We have a $450 billion trade deficit with China.
[00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:11.691]  Let me ask you this.
[00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:15.154]  You're a top business guy, on your own, from nothing.
[00:42:15.154 --> 00:42:16.976]  How did China get 97% of rare earths?
[00:42:19.358 --> 00:42:20.618]  Uh, minerals in the world.
[00:42:20.618 --> 00:42:27.340]  How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes in the smartphones, the computers, trillions is made a year?
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.801]  How did we just give them the global market in that?
[00:42:29.801 --> 00:42:31.081]  That's crazy.
[00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.181]  Well, what a lot of people don't know, Afghanistan.
[00:42:33.181 --> 00:42:38.943]  Now, Afghanistan is a place we can go in because, you know, you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons, a lot of things going on there.
[00:42:38.943 --> 00:42:39.083]  But
[00:42:39.783 --> 00:42:44.247]  We go into Afghanistan, we're fighting, you know, tremendous mountains and ridges.
[00:42:44.247 --> 00:42:48.551]  We're fighting on one side, and you know who's got their excavators on the other side?
[00:42:48.551 --> 00:42:48.751]  China.
[00:42:48.751 --> 00:42:50.152]  China, taking out all the minerals.
[00:42:50.152 --> 00:42:54.176]  You know, Afghanistan, nobody knew this, Afghanistan is rich with minerals.
[00:42:54.176 --> 00:42:55.377]  Not oil, but minerals.
[00:42:55.377 --> 00:42:56.158]  Lithium, everything.
[00:42:57.065 --> 00:42:59.146]  And China has taken out all the minerals.
[00:42:59.146 --> 00:43:04.729]  And here we are fighting, we have trillions, we have like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan, and we get nothing out of it.
[00:43:04.729 --> 00:43:08.891]  And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
[00:43:08.891 --> 00:43:09.771]  We get nothing.
[00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:11.933]  China has taken out the minerals.
[00:43:11.933 --> 00:43:19.717]  They're the buyers, the big buyers at very, very low prices of, as you know, of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria.
[00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:21.678]  But China is a big buyer of the oil.
[00:43:21.678 --> 00:43:24.059]  But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it,
[00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:27.960]  For three years I've been saying, hit the oil, because ISIS is getting stronger.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.202]  They're no JV, as the President said, and they're certainly not contained.
[00:43:32.202 --> 00:43:35.203]  But I said, hit the oil, and hit them hard.
[00:43:35.203 --> 00:43:36.243]  And they laughed at me.
[00:43:36.243 --> 00:43:39.964]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[00:43:39.964 --> 00:43:42.385]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil.
[00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:43.065]  And it does work.
[00:43:43.065 --> 00:43:45.606]  The problem is, we've given them a two-year edge.
[00:43:45.606 --> 00:43:46.987]  They have billions of dollars now.
[00:43:46.987 --> 00:43:50.808]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month, and ISIS is already rolling over.
[00:43:50.808 --> 00:43:52.809]  So Putin is following your strategy.
[00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:54.310]  You know Vladimir Putin well.
[00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.990]  We should have done it two years ago, Alex.
[00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.991]  That's the only problem.
[00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:58.151]  Donald Trump joins us live.
[00:43:58.151 --> 00:44:05.134]  Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin?
[00:44:05.134 --> 00:44:09.656]  Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[00:44:09.656 --> 00:44:10.097]  Right.
[00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:14.339]  Well, number one, and just to finish on that, by the way, I say hit the oil, but we should keep the oil.
[00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:15.259]  In other words, we should keep it.
[00:44:15.259 --> 00:44:16.379]  We'll get Exxon Mobil.
[00:44:16.379 --> 00:44:16.960]  They'll go in.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.741]  We'll get other of our oil companies.
[00:44:18.741 --> 00:44:21.102]  We'll get some of the great oil companies we bidded at.
[00:44:21.102 --> 00:44:21.782]  We should keep the oil.
[00:44:22.062 --> 00:44:24.525]  You know, in the old days, to the victor belong the spoils, right?
[00:44:24.525 --> 00:44:25.185]  We don't have that.
[00:44:25.185 --> 00:44:26.887]  We go in, we fight a war and we leave.
[00:44:26.887 --> 00:44:27.728]  We get nothing.
[00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:30.211]  Except we get death and we get deficit.
[00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:31.632]  That's all we get.
[00:44:31.632 --> 00:44:33.274]  I think I get along great with people.
[00:44:33.274 --> 00:44:35.216]  I mean, I will probably get along well with him.
[00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:36.657]  And if I don't, somebody else will.
[00:44:36.657 --> 00:44:37.398]  And who knows?
[00:44:37.398 --> 00:44:39.160]  You know, he's a difficult cookie.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.401]  He's tough and he's smart.
[00:44:40.401 --> 00:44:43.284]  I was on the show 60 Minutes with him recently.
[00:44:44.025 --> 00:44:44.766]  Not together.
[00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:47.668]  I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there.
[00:44:47.668 --> 00:44:49.189]  We were stable mates, right?
[00:44:49.189 --> 00:44:51.270]  But I think I'd get along very well with him.
[00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.812]  I think it's too fine.
[00:44:52.812 --> 00:44:54.133]  Look, here's the thing.
[00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:57.035]  We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[00:44:57.035 --> 00:44:58.316]  China is killing us.
[00:44:58.316 --> 00:44:59.517]  Everybody's killing us.
[00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:01.638]  China's just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[00:45:01.638 --> 00:45:04.100]  Japan, Mexico is killing us.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.901]  And yet we don't get along with anybody.
[00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:07.522]  With me, they're not going to get so rich.
[00:45:07.522 --> 00:45:09.464]  Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all.
[00:45:09.744 --> 00:45:16.907]  We're going to take back our jobs, we're going to take back our manufacture, we're going to take back our base, but they'll like us more than they do now.
[00:45:16.907 --> 00:45:17.868]  Sort of amazing.
[00:45:17.868 --> 00:45:19.228]  Well, Donald Trump, let me say this.
[00:45:19.228 --> 00:45:23.130]  My audience, I'd say 90% support you.
[00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.431]  And you definitely...
[00:45:25.271 --> 00:45:28.472]  Have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems.
[00:45:28.472 --> 00:45:39.595]  Hillary and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9-11, but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia in the air, on the ground.
[00:45:39.595 --> 00:45:40.836]  They have video of it all.
[00:45:40.836 --> 00:45:41.536]  None of it happened.
[00:45:41.536 --> 00:45:42.936]  She admits she lied.
[00:45:42.936 --> 00:45:44.317]  If you did that, you'd be done.
[00:45:44.317 --> 00:45:45.657]  But you wouldn't do something like that.
[00:45:45.657 --> 00:45:47.598]  You don't steal glory from our veterans.
[00:45:47.918 --> 00:45:58.382]  But they demonize you for made-up scandals every day, trying to see what'll stick, and then you got Hillary involved in Benghazi, you've got them involved in everything, and people love you for tough talk.
[00:45:58.382 --> 00:46:01.163]  Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama?
[00:46:01.163 --> 00:46:04.905]  I mean, what do we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
[00:46:06.257 --> 00:46:07.638]  Well, you remember this.
[00:46:07.638 --> 00:46:11.562]  The best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left, okay?
[00:46:11.562 --> 00:46:16.427]  Because, you know, by the time you do the hearings and everything, I don't... So don't make him a martyr.
[00:46:16.427 --> 00:46:18.529]  In a way, you'll make him a martyr, but I don't even say that.
[00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:27.718]  You know, one of the things that I'm the most disappointed in Republicans, because they go to Washington, they're going to do all this stuff, they're going to impeach Obama, they're going to end Obamacare, which has to be ended.
[00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:29.920]  I don't know if you've seen the premiums they're going up.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.761]  It's killing everything!
[00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:35.202]  55%, you know, it's going to implode anyway.
[00:46:35.202 --> 00:46:38.923]  In 2017, Obamacare blows up.
[00:46:38.923 --> 00:46:39.523]  It's over.
[00:46:39.523 --> 00:46:40.083]  I mean, it's over.
[00:46:40.083 --> 00:46:40.963]  And everybody knows it.
[00:46:40.963 --> 00:46:42.683]  And they're doing big stories.
[00:46:42.683 --> 00:46:45.844]  Even the ones that were for it are saying, oh, this isn't working.
[00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:47.464]  Well, the premiums are a disaster.
[00:46:47.464 --> 00:46:51.885]  And if you look at anything having to do with Obamacare right now, it's over.
[00:46:51.885 --> 00:46:55.126]  But the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it.
[00:46:55.126 --> 00:46:55.586]  They'll try.
[00:46:56.986 --> 00:47:00.991]  Get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan that's much better for the people.
[00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:03.013]  The people are getting killed with that.
[00:47:03.013 --> 00:47:05.415]  So, there's so many things to do, Alex.
[00:47:05.415 --> 00:47:06.857]  We will do such a good job.
[00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.359]  There's so many fronts.
[00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:10.681]  A number will win on trade.
[00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:12.243]  We're going to strengthen our military.
[00:47:12.243 --> 00:47:13.404]  We're going to take care of our vets.
[00:47:13.404 --> 00:47:14.826]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:16.167]  We're going to do so many things.
[00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:18.147]  There's so many things that can be done.
[00:47:18.147 --> 00:47:19.688]  But we have to use our good people.
[00:47:19.688 --> 00:47:28.932]  You know, everybody running against me, in terms of even the Republican side, and Hillary certainly, they're all controlled by their donors and their special interests and the lobbyists.
[00:47:28.932 --> 00:47:29.993]  I'm putting up my own money.
[00:47:29.993 --> 00:47:31.193]  I'm funding my own campaign.
[00:47:31.193 --> 00:47:32.494]  Nobody's going to control me.
[00:47:32.494 --> 00:47:35.135]  I'm going to do what's right for you and for the American people.
[00:47:36.428 --> 00:47:37.428]  Listen, I get it.
[00:47:37.428 --> 00:47:39.009]  I mean, you are a true maverick.
[00:47:39.009 --> 00:47:39.669]  I understand.
[00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:42.071]  You know, you've made tens of billions of dollars.
[00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:44.292]  You've hired tens of thousands of people.
[00:47:44.292 --> 00:47:54.036]  I mean, I would imagine that as you've gotten older, correct me if I'm wrong, because I know you talked about wanting to serve America decades ago, really all it comes down to is wanting to have a free country for your children and grandchildren.
[00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:55.757]  And that's where I want to come to this point next.
[00:47:56.297 --> 00:48:05.045]  Because I know you're smart, sir, and I know that you also, though, you don't dumb your message down, but you keep it at a mid-level so the general public and the establishment as well can get it.
[00:48:05.045 --> 00:48:06.887]  But let's get down to brass tacks.
[00:48:06.887 --> 00:48:17.757]  I routinely talk to the top generals, special forces, Pentagon currently, out of the Pentagon, CIA, as I know you do, and we'll just leave it at that.
[00:48:18.932 --> 00:48:23.054]  There are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country.
[00:48:23.054 --> 00:48:28.355]  They really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done as a third world nation within a few more years.
[00:48:28.355 --> 00:48:31.256]  Forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens, we're done.
[00:48:31.256 --> 00:48:33.177]  I mean, we're talking about resurrection of the dead here.
[00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:37.278]  We could turn it around right now, as you've said properly, you're dead on, sir, you're right.
[00:48:37.278 --> 00:48:41.460]  We could turn it around, all the actuaries, all the numbers show it, but it's got to happen in the next few years or we're done.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:50.467]  And there are globalists that want to have a world government, a system run by select crony capitalists, using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent.
[00:48:50.467 --> 00:49:01.777]  And I've talked to not just high-level folks that have been in government that are on your team, but separately high-level people in government currently that say there's an internal war going on and that you're a manifestation of that.
[00:49:01.777 --> 00:49:05.741]  I don't want to get anything inside baseball with you, but I already know the inside baseball.
[00:49:06.596 --> 00:49:14.401]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:17.163]  It's George Washington level and you understand that office.
[00:49:17.163 --> 00:49:31.392]  So I want to tell you right now, can you speak about the war for the soul of this country that's happening right now and really tell people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross Perot under death threats and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election?
[00:49:32.188 --> 00:49:37.991]  Okay, so let me just tell you, Alex, as you know, I'm leading in every poll nationally in every poll state.
[00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:41.993]  I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, the SEC, Texas.
[00:49:41.993 --> 00:49:44.295]  I'm leading in Texas, which I love.
[00:49:44.295 --> 00:49:45.055]  I love Texas.
[00:49:45.055 --> 00:49:45.815]  You know, we were there.
[00:49:45.815 --> 00:49:46.896]  Mark Cuban called up.
[00:49:46.896 --> 00:49:48.017]  He said, do you want to use the arena?
[00:49:48.017 --> 00:49:48.397]  I used it.
[00:49:48.397 --> 00:49:50.298]  We filled it up in three or four days, 20,000 people.
[00:49:50.298 --> 00:49:52.059]  In Mobile, Alabama, we had 35,000 people.
[00:49:52.059 --> 00:49:52.519]  We had 20,000 in Oklahoma.
[00:49:56.221 --> 00:50:02.102]  I'm so into this, and I'm not into, you know, I could do other things that I would enjoy doing, to be honest with you.
[00:50:02.102 --> 00:50:03.342]  No, you're doing a dangerous mission.
[00:50:03.342 --> 00:50:04.323]  We understand that.
[00:50:04.323 --> 00:50:07.543]  It's not an easy thing, but the key is make America great again.
[00:50:07.543 --> 00:50:16.765]  We can make America great again, but if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what's gone on in the past and, you know, what's going, it's just, we're being eaten away.
[00:50:16.765 --> 00:50:20.426]  It's just, it's eating away at our country, and we can
[00:50:21.106 --> 00:50:24.848]  In my opinion, we can make America greater than ever before.
[00:50:24.848 --> 00:50:25.949]  But we have to get going.
[00:50:25.949 --> 00:50:26.789]  It has to happen.
[00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:28.170]  We have to get going.
[00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.191]  And you know, when you look at the vision, I said Iraq.
[00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:32.772]  You agreed with me on Iraq.
[00:50:32.772 --> 00:50:34.473]  I said hit the oil.
[00:50:34.473 --> 00:50:36.114]  I said a lot of things that turned out to be
[00:50:36.934 --> 00:50:37.415]  True.
[00:50:37.415 --> 00:50:38.295]  A hundred percent true.
[00:50:38.295 --> 00:50:40.638]  And I'm giving credit, I'm giving credit by some people.
[00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:42.099]  Some people refuse to acknowledge it.
[00:50:42.099 --> 00:50:43.400]  You know, they refuse to say it.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.643]  No, you've been, you've been, you've been absolutely on target.
[00:50:45.643 --> 00:50:49.126]  So what I'm asking is though, can you speak to the crossroads we're at right now though?
[00:50:49.126 --> 00:50:50.207]  Because you've talked about it.
[00:50:50.207 --> 00:50:53.991]  Are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country's done or whether we go to the next level?
[00:50:54.491 --> 00:51:01.734]  Well, I think this, I think that, sadly, I think that if we don't get it right this time, I think this is going to be the most important election our country's ever had.
[00:51:01.734 --> 00:51:06.056]  I mean, you'd have to say George Washington was right there, you know, the couple of pretty important elections, right?
[00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:12.199]  But this is certainly in the last, in the modern era, this is the most important election our country's ever had.
[00:51:12.199 --> 00:51:18.982]  If we don't get it right, if we put another one of these people in, like Hillary, I mean, she's so corrupt.
[00:51:19.542 --> 00:51:20.883]  She is so corrupt.
[00:51:20.883 --> 00:51:22.984]  And she shouldn't even be allowed to run.
[00:51:22.984 --> 00:51:28.126]  And frankly, her greatest legacy, she was a horrible Secretary of State.
[00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:32.428]  If she runs, I think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal.
[00:51:32.428 --> 00:51:33.349]  That's what I think.
[00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:37.811]  It'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal.
[00:51:37.811 --> 00:51:43.213]  Because General Petraeus and many others, I mean, their lives have been destroyed for doing 5% of what she did.
[00:51:43.213 --> 00:51:43.773]  That's right.
[00:51:43.773 --> 00:51:44.754]  She shouldn't be allowed to run.
[00:51:45.214 --> 00:51:53.436]  But, you know, the recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has me beating her head-to-head, which is very interesting and very good, and beating her soundly head-to-head.
[00:51:53.436 --> 00:51:56.157]  But we have to get it right.
[00:51:56.157 --> 00:52:10.421]  Our country can be absolutely, we can turn it around, but I would agree with you, if we don't get it right this time, I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of these leaders, I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore.
[00:52:10.421 --> 00:52:11.522]  I think it could be further.
[00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:19.808]  Donald Trump, the man in the arena, his new book, we're going to talk about in a moment, is exposing the fact that this country is being sabotaged by design.
[00:52:19.808 --> 00:52:22.570]  Specifically, I don't want to bring up detractors.
[00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:31.777]  And it's a question I had early on, but then I did more research, and I understand that you really do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren live, but let's expand on this.
[00:52:31.777 --> 00:52:35.981]  There are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with Bill Clinton,
[00:52:37.234 --> 00:52:42.398]  And so, you know, you had to do business in New York, so you said nice things about Hillary.
[00:52:42.398 --> 00:52:44.940]  I get keeping your enemies closer when you're not, you know, in politics.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.681]  I get it.
[00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:46.141]  I understand.
[00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:47.162]  I think that's what you did.
[00:52:47.162 --> 00:52:50.444]  But tell us specifically, and I don't think this now.
[00:52:50.444 --> 00:52:51.105]  I've seen it.
[00:52:51.105 --> 00:52:51.805]  I know you're for real.
[00:52:51.805 --> 00:52:53.367]  You wouldn't be saying the things you're doing.
[00:52:53.367 --> 00:52:54.127]  They're scared of you.
[00:52:54.127 --> 00:52:55.588]  The whole system's coming on against you.
[00:52:55.588 --> 00:52:58.210]  But promise us that you're not going to...
[00:52:59.071 --> 00:53:10.034]  Drop out at the key moment, keeping all the other Republicans out of view, and then Hillary races to the head, or Jeb Bush does, because as you know, folks are claiming you're a Clinton operative.
[00:53:10.034 --> 00:53:11.414]  You know, I've never heard that.
[00:53:11.414 --> 00:53:17.916]  I heard it actually a few months ago, but I've hit her harder than anybody times ten, if you look at the... You have, you have.
[00:53:17.916 --> 00:53:20.557]  I was a businessman, yet I've only been a politician for five months.
[00:53:20.557 --> 00:53:22.818]  I hate to use the term because, you know, it's all... You're a statesman.
[00:53:24.238 --> 00:53:26.501]  I've just been doing this for a very short period of time.
[00:53:26.501 --> 00:53:27.662]  I was establishment.
[00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:31.246]  You know, I was like a guy like you would say Trump is total establishment.
[00:53:31.246 --> 00:53:34.649]  And I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans.
[00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:36.251]  But over the years, I've given to Democrats.
[00:53:36.251 --> 00:53:37.072]  I've given to Republicans.
[00:53:37.072 --> 00:53:39.755]  I've given everybody because I had an obligation.
[00:53:39.755 --> 00:53:40.596]  I was a businessman.
[00:53:40.856 --> 00:53:43.357]  One of the magazines recently called me a world-class businessman.
[00:53:43.357 --> 00:53:44.117]  The truth is, I did.
[00:53:44.117 --> 00:53:46.758]  I built an unbelievable company.
[00:53:46.758 --> 00:53:47.939]  Tremendous assets.
[00:53:47.939 --> 00:53:50.500]  Tremendous, not only that, iconic assets.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.260]  Very little debt.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.340]  Tremendous cash flow.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.341]  It's a great company.
[00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:57.882]  And by the way, people now see how good, when I did the filing, everyone said, oh, he'll never file, he'll never file.
[00:53:57.882 --> 00:54:00.163]  It's almost 100 pages long.
[00:54:00.163 --> 00:54:01.764]  And it's an unbelievable company.
[00:54:01.764 --> 00:54:06.366]  So I built, which by the way, the reason I say that, that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
[00:54:06.366 --> 00:54:08.506]  But, I got along great with Clinton.
[00:54:08.506 --> 00:54:10.187]  I got along great with Harry Reid.
[00:54:10.507 --> 00:54:12.108]  I get along great with everybody.
[00:54:12.108 --> 00:54:15.630]  Because when I needed them, I didn't want to have argument.
[00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.791]  I didn't want to have somebody say, well, Clinton doesn't want it to happen.
[00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:18.591]  You're not a loser.
[00:54:18.591 --> 00:54:19.852]  You don't get in mindless fights.
[00:54:19.852 --> 00:54:21.612]  You move forward with your agenda.
[00:54:21.612 --> 00:54:25.654]  But now you see America in trouble, and you're, hey, that's all sidelined now.
[00:54:25.654 --> 00:54:27.435]  Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump.
[00:54:27.435 --> 00:54:28.576]  He wants to work for America.
[00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:31.999]  Yeah, as a businessman, you couldn't have even functioned if you don't get along.
[00:54:31.999 --> 00:54:32.599]  No, I know, yeah.
[00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:35.642]  For example, in New York City, it's 95% Democrat.
[00:54:35.642 --> 00:54:38.344]  I mean, if I didn't get along with the Democrats, I wouldn't have one building.
[00:54:38.344 --> 00:54:43.688]  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, you did want the vice president, you know, a position that's come out decades ago behind the scenes.
[00:54:43.688 --> 00:54:45.490]  I mean, I know you're a Republican.
[00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.771]  What about libertarianism?
[00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:48.152]  What's your view of libertarianism?
[00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:52.876]  And then I want to ask you, who's your favorite president, and who do you think your running mate might be?
[00:54:52.876 --> 00:54:53.636]  Folks, I think it's Ted Cruz.
[00:54:54.477 --> 00:54:56.880]  Well, I think that libertarianism is sort of interesting.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.042]  There are certain things that I really like about it.
[00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:01.865]  But, you know, keeping government out as much as possible.
[00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.607]  We need government for protection.
[00:55:03.607 --> 00:55:04.427]  We have to protect.
[00:55:04.427 --> 00:55:07.971]  When you look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to destroy us.
[00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.994]  And, you know, the problem we have today, Alex, is the weaponry.
[00:55:10.994 --> 00:55:13.297]  If this were a hundred years ago, I'd say forget about them.
[00:55:13.297 --> 00:55:14.078]  Let them keep fighting.
[00:55:14.078 --> 00:55:15.299]  They've been fighting all their lives.
[00:55:15.299 --> 00:55:16.380]  Let them keep fighting each other.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:16.800]  Who cares?
[00:55:17.541 --> 00:55:23.084]  But the weaponry is so powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now protect.
[00:55:23.084 --> 00:55:25.085]  So that's a big part of government.
[00:55:25.085 --> 00:55:32.208]  So there's a certain common sense to certain elements that I do very well with the libertarians, frankly, you know, because they sort of get it and they they get me.
[00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:32.949]  But we need.
[00:55:33.709 --> 00:55:37.113]  Bigger strength that I think the libertarians really want.
[00:55:37.113 --> 00:55:37.894]  And we need it.
[00:55:37.894 --> 00:55:39.115]  And we have to have it.
[00:55:39.115 --> 00:55:39.776]  We have to have it.
[00:55:39.776 --> 00:55:41.558]  If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.
[00:55:41.558 --> 00:55:43.880]  If we don't have borders, we're not going to have a country.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.762]  As far as running rates, it's too soon to say.
[00:55:45.762 --> 00:55:48.706]  I actually respect a couple of people that are on the stage.
[00:55:48.706 --> 00:55:50.508]  Some of them I have absolutely no respect for.
[00:55:50.908 --> 00:55:53.509]  I mean, I think they're not very good at all at what they do.
[00:55:53.509 --> 00:55:54.709]  You look at what's going on.
[00:55:54.709 --> 00:55:58.411]  But I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with me.
[00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:03.852]  I have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country, you know, political people.
[00:56:03.852 --> 00:56:14.776]  I'll pick somebody I think that can really be a great vice president, who ultimately has to be a great president, because that's, you know, 90% of that function is, you know, if something bad happens, you've got to be a good president.
[00:56:14.776 --> 00:56:16.457]  You have to view it from that standpoint.
[00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:19.798]  And my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be Ronald Reagan.
[00:56:20.598 --> 00:56:22.019]  I liked him, I helped him.
[00:56:22.019 --> 00:56:23.321]  And by the way, he was a Democrat.
[00:56:23.321 --> 00:56:24.622]  A lot of people don't know.
[00:56:24.622 --> 00:56:25.443]  He was.
[00:56:25.443 --> 00:56:27.765]  A liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know.
[00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:33.050]  And he became a somewhat conservative, I wouldn't say the most conservative, but a somewhat conservative Republican.
[00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.992]  But he wanted to make America great.
[00:56:34.992 --> 00:56:35.733]  And he really did.
[00:56:35.733 --> 00:56:38.636]  He wanted to make... He had actually, let's make America great.
[00:56:38.636 --> 00:56:41.739]  That was his... And mine is, make America great again.
[00:56:41.739 --> 00:56:42.880]  So there's a little bit of a difference.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.881]  My son, my son, you know, finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours.
[00:56:46.881 --> 00:56:47.861]  I mean, I liked you.
[00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:48.681]  Love Americana.
[00:56:48.681 --> 00:56:49.822]  You're pure Americana.
[00:56:49.822 --> 00:56:51.222]  But I'm still, you know, it was research.
[00:56:51.222 --> 00:56:52.522]  But my 13-year-old son's really smart.
[00:56:52.522 --> 00:56:53.723]  He does a lot of research.
[00:56:53.723 --> 00:56:54.643]  He watches all the debates.
[00:56:54.643 --> 00:56:55.883]  He just really loves you.
[00:56:55.883 --> 00:56:58.484]  He is on cloud nine that you're here, Rex Jones.
[00:56:58.484 --> 00:57:02.785]  And it was his question, you know, which president was your favorite.
[00:57:02.785 --> 00:57:05.226]  But all time, all time, who's your favorite?
[00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:06.537]  Well, all time.
[00:57:06.537 --> 00:57:15.126]  I'd say Ronald Reagan, shorter term, I would say... Well, you know, you look at Lincoln and you look at Washington, you have to go with... They're the classics, right, Alex?
[00:57:15.126 --> 00:57:19.310]  You know, you think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the Lincolns and the Washingtons.
[00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:19.931]  I agree.
[00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:22.013]  As a man's man, George Washington was badass.
[00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:24.360]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.862]  I mean, that's what they say.
[00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:27.083]  They say he never told a lie.
[00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:28.424]  Let's hope that's true, okay?
[00:57:28.424 --> 00:57:30.886]  But George Washington was pretty good.
[00:57:30.886 --> 00:57:35.030]  But look, we had some great presidents, and we had some good presidents on the other side, too, in all fairness.
[00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:39.054]  But we will hopefully be right at the top of that list.
[00:57:39.054 --> 00:57:42.997]  We're going to make the country so strong, and we're going to make it financially secure.
[00:57:42.997 --> 00:57:46.100]  We can't owe $21 trillion, because it's going to be that number.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.141]  Well we have to make our country rich again.
[00:57:48.141 --> 00:57:54.845]  You know the other day I said to a woman, she came up to Mr. Trump at a big rally where we had 14,000 people and at the end she just sees me in a
[00:58:07.833 --> 00:58:16.200]  I'm, you know, signing autographs and stuff, and she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you 100%, but are you, this whole concept of making it rich, it sounds so crass.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:31.692]  I said, you know what, it might sound crass, but if we don't make our nation rich again, if we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us, and if we don't take back our money, and if we don't, you know, balance up our budget, at least get it damn close and soon, we're not going to have a nation anymore.
[00:58:31.692 --> 00:58:37.377]  We're a third world country, Donald Trump, you know, I know you've got to go, 60 second break, I want to come back for just three minutes, talk about your
[00:58:39.085 --> 00:58:42.637]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.637 --> 00:58:44.884]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.493 --> 00:58:54.699]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:57.902]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:58:57.902 --> 00:59:07.050]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:10.533]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the info war and get 15%
[00:59:11.274 --> 00:59:11.754]  I don't know.
[00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:31.933]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[00:59:31.933 --> 00:59:40.341]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process, all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[00:59:40.341 --> 00:59:41.742]  That's a 360 win.
[00:59:41.742 --> 00:59:43.584]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.
[00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:51.050]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and help fund the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.653]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:03.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.871 --> 01:00:27.944]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in So move it on over Move it on over Move it on over Move it on over Move over little dog Cause the big dog's moving in She's changed the lock on our front door And my door key don't fit no more So get it on
[01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.258]  That's right, Cy Hirsch coming up.
[01:00:35.258 --> 01:00:38.801]  All over the country they're announcing the new coffin apartments.
[01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.643]  They call them smart.
[01:00:40.643 --> 01:00:41.764]  Like smart missiles.
[01:00:41.764 --> 01:00:45.006]  They're meant to blow your savings up.
[01:00:56.598 --> 01:01:06.703]  They admit they can build more of them, charge higher rent per square foot, and then get more property tax, where you can pay more in property tax than you do even for rent.
[01:01:06.703 --> 01:01:08.724]  And you're like, what do you mean?
[01:01:08.724 --> 01:01:10.684]  I don't pay property tax, I rent.
[01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:16.787]  Oh, you pay for it through the owner.
[01:01:16.787 --> 01:01:17.808]  Isn't that cute?
[01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:19.909]  It's your new car.
[01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:22.530]  And they have all these little metrosexual trendies.
[01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:25.847]  I really love it.
[01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:27.508]  Bloomberg promotes it.
[01:01:27.508 --> 01:01:30.869]  That's why Bloomberg, you know, lives in 30, 40, 50,000 square feet house.
[01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:32.190]  He's got a whole bunch of them.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.051]  Al Gore's got houses even better.
[01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:35.992]  It's okay, though.
[01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.393]  They're promoting that you live in here.
[01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.814]  Like Obama said, you can't have air conditioning or a car.
[01:01:39.814 --> 01:01:43.256]  Not that we're going to innovate the cars and air conditioning like they've done and make them clean.
[01:01:43.256 --> 01:01:45.017]  No, we're just, you just don't get one.
[01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:50.040]  I got to go back on this Air Force One here and fly back to Hawaii.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.360]  Ha ha.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.961]  I don't do a very good Obama.
[01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:52.721]  I can do a Bush.
[01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.391]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[01:01:58.391 --> 01:02:02.895]  Fool me twice, shame on... I have to... It's been so long since I actually watched George W. I can't do it as well.
[01:02:02.895 --> 01:02:05.597]  I can do a Bill Clinton.
[01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:14.984]  I'm here to tell you that I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky, and I did settle, was it five cases of alleged rape, out of court.
[01:02:14.984 --> 01:02:20.869]  You don't think I'd do something like that, do you?
[01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:24.512]  You know, I love the fact that Trump's going after him for all the sex stuff because
[01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:32.200]  If Bill Cosby deserves it, which he well may, I think some of it's true, some of it isn't, but with Bill Clinton, we know.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.563]  I mean, I've interviewed the women that he, uh, well, first he'd start choking them.
[01:02:37.563 --> 01:02:39.784]  He'd even do it at like a party.
[01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:42.665]  For the governor's mansion, he'd say, step in here, I want to talk to you in my office, please, ma'am.
[01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:50.229]  And then he would get them in a closet and just start choking them and then bite their upper lip while he talked through his mouth.
[01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.490]  I'm going to rip your lip off if you just resist me.
[01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:53.811]  Do you understand me?
[01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:54.311]  And choke them.
[01:02:55.982 --> 01:02:59.604]  An expert rapist!
[01:02:59.604 --> 01:03:01.446]  But it's okay, because he's liberal.
[01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:06.669]  We imagine that he's our buddy, so then everything's okay.
[01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:09.230]  Cy Hirst joins us for 30 minutes, coming up.
[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:10.411]  Then Leanne McAdoo.
[01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:12.272]  And boy, do I have a lot to go over with him.
[01:03:12.272 --> 01:03:15.214]  I want to talk about Iraqi commander claims that U.S.
[01:03:15.214 --> 01:03:19.557]  secretly evacuating ISIS leaders to safety.
[01:03:19.557 --> 01:03:23.980]  I want to get into Congressman Paul, appalled by NSA spying on Congress.
[01:03:25.595 --> 01:03:34.141]  And where all that is going, I mean, so much to talk about with Sy Hirst, but the big thing is his big article, Military to Military.
[01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:44.047]  And that deals with the fact that our military has been trying as best they can under orders not to, to stop the radical jihadist.
[01:03:44.047 --> 01:03:52.933]  And of course the State Department wants to keep up the show that they're actually not with him, so that allows that purview, even though it's a fake mission, the military has actually tried to carry out the mission.
[01:03:53.806 --> 01:03:58.170]  So we're going to talk to the expert on this and of course I've got all my sources as well.
[01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:12.805]  What's amazing is so much of what he's put out in the excerpt of his article of Military to Military backs up everything that our guests have basically talked about here on air.
[01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:13.786]  So Cy Hirsch
[01:04:15.046 --> 01:04:18.127]  Coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:04:18.127 --> 01:04:19.487]  Remember, Matt Drudge was here.
[01:04:19.487 --> 01:04:21.487]  They are pushing to control the Internet.
[01:04:21.487 --> 01:04:22.628]  They're now admitting that in the news.
[01:04:22.628 --> 01:04:25.988]  That's coming up after Cy Hirsch leaves us.
[01:04:25.988 --> 01:04:28.469]  There is a big push to restrict free speech.
[01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:34.670]  A big push to take over more and more of the freedoms on the Internet.
[01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:35.970]  Chinese-style systems.
[01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:39.311]  So you gotta decide which side you're on right now.
[01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:40.651]  Are you on the side of
[01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:46.629]  Basic human liberty and freedom and a safe society?
[01:04:46.629 --> 01:04:47.990]  That's what's safe, is freedom.
[01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:52.535]  Or you want tyranny, because if you go along with this, that's where it's headed.
[01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:55.678]  And we already see a lot of tyranny, but it's only getting worse by the millisecond, obviously.
[01:04:59.173 --> 01:05:04.418]  The Affluenza teen and his mother have been taken into custody, reports Reuters.
[01:05:04.418 --> 01:05:15.087]  A wealthy Texas teen, who had been a fugitive after breaking his probation sentence for killing four people while driving drunk, will be returned to the United States after being caught in Mexico.
[01:05:15.087 --> 01:05:21.713]  Ethan Couch, age 18, and his mother, Tanya, were taken into custody Monday evening in a resort in Mexico.
[01:05:22.133 --> 01:05:35.981]  Couch became known in the United States as the Affluenzatine during his trial in juvenile court over the 2013 deaths, when a psychologist said he was so wealthy and spoiled that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong.
[01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:42.665]  He has been serving 10 years probation for intoxication manslaughter, a sentence critics saw as far too light.
[01:05:42.665 --> 01:05:49.970]  Couch and his mother disappeared earlier this month, prompting officials in Tarrant County, Texas to issue a warrant for his apprehension.
[01:05:50.391 --> 01:05:54.343]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:07.339]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.

[01:07:13.824 --> 01:07:15.526]  The numbers are staggering.

[01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:25.494]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.

[01:08:23.305 --> 01:08:29.873]  We'll be hosting the fourth hour of the radio-slash-TV broadcast that now reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide.
[01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:41.446]  It's very, very exciting that folks are tuned out of the whole left-right false debate of divide and conquer and are just getting back to freedom versus tyranny and making a choice.
[01:08:43.672 --> 01:08:46.133]  I could interview this individual for five hours.
[01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:50.915]  I mean, we've only got him for like 25 minutes, and I'm so excited.
[01:08:50.915 --> 01:08:56.558]  I mean, there are a lot of guests we've had that get me excited, but I'm about as excited about this as I've ever been about any guest.
[01:08:56.558 --> 01:08:59.900]  So maybe Donald Trump coming on, or Ron Paul, or Matt Drudge.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.381]  I mean, it's right up there with that.
[01:09:02.381 --> 01:09:04.382]  Seymour Hersh, I remember growing up.
[01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:16.203]  You know, at the end of the Vietnam War and hearing my mom, you know, talk about how great Cy Hirsch was and my dad and them reading his articles in major publications.
[01:09:17.521 --> 01:09:25.184]  And then of course, since I've been out of high school 25 years or so, I'm 42, I've been following his work continually.
[01:09:25.184 --> 01:09:30.347]  And I know most of the audience knows who he is, but I've talked to folks who don't know who Chuck Yeager is.
[01:09:30.347 --> 01:09:33.928]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy how ignorant some of the public are.
[01:09:33.928 --> 01:09:35.249]  Not our general audience, but
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:43.123]  The new people tuning in every millisecond on close to 200 affiliates across the United States.
[01:09:43.123 --> 01:09:47.185]  He's won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award.
[01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:54.368]  He basically helped expose the biggest massacres in Vietnam and helped pretty much cause a chain reaction into that war.
[01:09:54.368 --> 01:09:58.670]  You can't give him full credit for it, but I can say he gets the most credit of one man.
[01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:01.872]  Or, you know, maybe the guy with the Pentagon Papers, who's been on as well.
[01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:08.149]  But then, and I know he doesn't want to be talked about, but I'm going to do this for a minute and then we're going to him.
[01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:11.471]  He exposed the Iraq War as the fraud like no other.
[01:10:11.471 --> 01:10:13.633]  He exposed the NSA.
[01:10:13.633 --> 01:10:15.195]  He has just exposed it all.
[01:10:15.195 --> 01:10:20.619]  He exposed what he called one big lie, not one word of it true, the Osama Bin Laden raid.
[01:10:20.619 --> 01:10:23.422]  And he has been demonized, attacked, you name it.
[01:10:23.422 --> 01:10:25.384]  But the truth stands on its own.
[01:10:25.384 --> 01:10:26.465]  That's a badge of courage.
[01:10:27.304 --> 01:10:32.387]  And so we've had former NSA technical director William Binney on, so many big people.
[01:10:32.387 --> 01:10:36.290]  I don't know if you'd call Cy Hirsch a whistleblower, but he's beyond that.
[01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:44.235]  He's probably, undoubtedly, the greatest living investigative journalist, and he joins us now on his maiden voyage, hopefully one of many.
[01:10:44.235 --> 01:10:48.858]  I know we've talked in email a few times over the years, and my writers have, but he joins us now.
[01:10:48.858 --> 01:10:50.019]  Mr. Hirsch, thank you for coming on.
[01:10:50.683 --> 01:10:53.544]  Yeah, but you better tell people we're not related after that introduction.
[01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:55.965]  You're not my brother-in-law, are you?
[01:10:55.965 --> 01:10:56.786]  You know it's true.
[01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:59.727]  Come on.
[01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:00.868]  You know something?
[01:11:00.868 --> 01:11:02.608]  It's the day before New Year's Eve.
[01:11:02.608 --> 01:11:04.089]  It's quiet here in my office.
[01:11:04.089 --> 01:11:06.090]  I'm sitting here like a mouse.
[01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:07.831]  You know, I don't feel so important today.
[01:11:09.175 --> 01:11:11.055]  Well, it's amazing, sir.
[01:11:11.055 --> 01:11:18.597]  Obviously, we're here to talk about the incredible stuff happening in Syria, really showing the soul of America, both good, bad, and ugly.
[01:11:18.597 --> 01:11:31.420]  But first off, in the continuum of your 40-plus years of reporting, sir, looking at all this, is America getting more corrupt or less, or do we just know more now, or are elites getting more brazen?
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:38.162]  I mean, tying your latest reportage into the things you've seen, what is the state of the world through your rose-colored darkly?
[01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:40.592]  Well, you know, it's interesting you ask that question.
[01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:49.315]  I would say right now that the guys who control the press, the ability to manipulate the press, is much greater than ever.
[01:11:49.315 --> 01:11:59.320]  And even the very good newspapers are staggering under the idea that it's just really hard to take everything at face value.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.821]  The current press secretary for the President of the United States,
[01:12:02.621 --> 01:12:05.262]  Maybe a perfectly nice guy, but he never worked as a journalist.
[01:12:05.262 --> 01:12:08.144]  He was always in the public relations business.
[01:12:08.144 --> 01:12:13.467]  I'm not suggesting he's criminal or wrong, but we don't even have a journalist there.
[01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:19.850]  So yes, I would say things are worse off generally, just in terms of day-to-day credibility.
[01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:22.111]  It's just so much easier for the guys on top.
[01:12:23.352 --> 01:12:30.857]  To get away with, if not a falsehood, just an incomplete answer or a non-answer when one should be issued.
[01:12:30.857 --> 01:12:33.540]  I think it's much worse.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:40.505]  I just, you know, now if you go to the White House or to the Pentagon for comment, it's sort of pro forma.
[01:12:40.505 --> 01:12:41.766]  You're just doing it.
[01:12:41.766 --> 01:12:46.430]  And there's a line there, the Pentagon today denied or refused the comment.
[01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:50.673]  You just don't get help on stories that are adverse to the government anymore.
[01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:53.273]  Cy Hirsch is our guest.
[01:12:53.273 --> 01:13:07.783]  I mean, I think one of the quintessential moments was a few years ago when Gibbs had left as White House Press Secretary and he went on MSNBC and said, yeah, you know, we knew the drone program was public and public for years, but we were told to go out there and say it didn't exist.
[01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.184]  This is like the Wizard of Oz.
[01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.385]  And then the pundits all laughed about it.
[01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:15.728]  It's almost like it's funny now that they've put us into a false reality.
[01:13:15.728 --> 01:13:17.009]  They just hide it in plain view.
[01:13:18.413 --> 01:13:38.419]  Well, you remember the current president joked that if his daughters are getting to be of dating age... I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with humor, but you have to sort of... It was at one of these annual meetings where the National Press Club gives the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which I think is sort of a scandal.
[01:13:38.419 --> 01:13:45.121]  The press all like to see which guy can be at their table, which person from the government, and it's sort of like kumbaya.
[01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:46.682]  But the president actually said that
[01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:51.323]  Guys better watch when they're dating his daughters.
[01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:53.764]  A very attractive woman, young woman.
[01:13:53.764 --> 01:13:57.725]  He said they better watch out because he can always schedule a Jones fight.
[01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.786]  I thought that was, wow.
[01:13:59.786 --> 01:14:01.506]  Are you kidding me?
[01:14:01.506 --> 01:14:04.447]  You know, that's over the line, it seems to me.
[01:14:04.447 --> 01:14:05.508]  It's not professional.
[01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:15.251]  I mean, it's like Hillary saying, we came, we saw, he died in Libya and laughing and then having her Brian Williams moment, claiming she was attacked in Bosnia on the tarmac.
[01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:15.811]  None of it's true.
[01:14:16.605 --> 01:14:20.889]  You got me on the, I'll tell you, you're singing my song about Libya.
[01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:23.111]  I just can't believe we didn't learn from that.
[01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:26.734]  Which is, you know, and by the way, the article, the Military to Military, it's just an article.
[01:14:26.734 --> 01:14:28.536]  It's a long article I wrote.
[01:14:28.536 --> 01:14:29.817]  I'm doing a book, but not about that.
[01:14:29.817 --> 01:14:31.198]  I'm doing a book about Cheney.
[01:14:31.198 --> 01:14:35.202]  But I did write that article for the London Review of Books, which is a great magazine.
[01:14:35.202 --> 01:14:36.043]  And you know, it turns out,
[01:14:37.385 --> 01:14:39.106]  Because of what you guys do, the Internet.
[01:14:39.106 --> 01:14:40.968]  The Internet is so lively.
[01:14:40.968 --> 01:14:43.250]  It doesn't really matter where you publish anymore.
[01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:48.054]  Thirty years ago, if you weren't at the New York Times, you felt like you were sort of, you know, or the Washington Post.
[01:14:48.054 --> 01:14:49.955]  But now, you know, it's just out there.
[01:14:49.955 --> 01:14:51.757]  Things get out there automatically.
[01:14:51.757 --> 01:14:53.118]  So that's good.
[01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:55.100]  We have more, better communication.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.781]  It's just too bad we don't have better information.
[01:14:56.781 --> 01:14:58.122]  Sure, so that's bringing some balance back.
[01:14:58.122 --> 01:15:00.024]  But there is a glut, and I'm aware of your big...
[01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:02.185]  A book on Cheney that's coming out.
[01:15:02.185 --> 01:15:09.791]  Can't wait to see what your eye comes up with, with him, to really find out what this guy who works on the dark side is really all about.
[01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:25.702]  But let's specifically get into Syria because I've had generals on, colonels on, lieutenant colonels on, I've had CIA whistleblowers like Tosh Plumley on, but you've got obviously a lot better contacts than I. You've been, I know, given security clearances before, unless I'm wrong.
[01:15:25.702 --> 01:15:26.583]  Looking at all this,
[01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:37.308]  Walking us through it, sir, and your incredible article, Military to Military, explain to us, as best you can tell, what has really happened in Syria.
[01:15:38.007 --> 01:15:43.750]  Well, the big issue is, the question, one of the big questions is, we've demonized Bashar Assad.
[01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.011]  He's a dictator, no question.
[01:15:46.011 --> 01:15:47.652]  You cross him, he'll cross you.
[01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:53.415]  He's a lot better than his father, the old man Assad, you know, Hafez Assad.
[01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:59.558]  He was trained to be, he was the second or third son, never thought he'd be president because the older boys had the past.
[01:16:00.278 --> 01:16:12.222]  Uh, went to medical school, was an ophthalmologist, married a very second generation Iraqi woman who worked for one of the national, you know, investment houses, American investment houses in London.
[01:16:12.222 --> 01:16:14.822]  And so he was, all of a sudden, there he's called upon.
[01:16:14.822 --> 01:16:19.844]  His older brother dies and his father says, you better get a couple years of army training and get ready.
[01:16:19.844 --> 01:16:23.105]  So he's, he's, he's, he, look.
[01:16:23.749 --> 01:16:24.870]  He's hated in America.
[01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:27.371]  I don't think you can get five votes for him in Congress.
[01:16:27.371 --> 01:16:31.154]  He's demonized, he's killed, there's about 250,000 deaths.
[01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.655]  But he's a lot better than Al Qaeda!
[01:16:33.342 --> 01:16:38.903]  Well, you know something, and ISIS, and also, things have, I watched them for 6, 8, 10 years.
[01:16:38.903 --> 01:16:39.944]  I went back and forth there.
[01:16:39.944 --> 01:16:42.724]  I've been going there to the Middle East a lot since 9-11.
[01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:44.425]  And he's, you know, it got much more open.
[01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.525]  You could, you know, you could bank there.
[01:16:46.525 --> 01:16:51.927]  You could have the, you can go to an ATM machine.
[01:16:51.927 --> 01:16:54.948]  There were 30 different foreign broadcasts on TV.
[01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:56.008]  It was, he was opening.
[01:16:56.488 --> 01:16:56.928]  Yes.
[01:16:56.928 --> 01:16:58.929]  When you cross him, he's going to fight you to the end.
[01:16:58.929 --> 01:17:00.370]  It's a war to the end.
[01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.351]  He's fighting ISIS.
[01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.432]  He's fighting Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:04.793]  He's fighting Al-Nusra.
[01:17:04.793 --> 01:17:06.514]  These are people that hang in garages.
[01:17:06.514 --> 01:17:08.295]  Some of the horrible stuff that happens.
[01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:12.737]  He's had as many as 200 of his soldiers executed at one sitting by these people.
[01:17:12.737 --> 01:17:16.439]  So, it's a war in which he's killed a lot and they've killed a lot.
[01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:18.740]  And it's a war to the end.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.603]  And he's... What I wrote about, in part, was that our Joint Chief
[01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:25.127]  I don't know.
[01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:54.797]  Some of the groups we advocate as moderate have already made it clear that if they ever took over the government, no Christians or Alawites, that's a minority sect.
[01:17:55.365 --> 01:18:02.293]  She has said that Bashar Assad and about 12% of the people living in Syria belong to.
[01:18:02.293 --> 01:18:05.336]  None of them could be allowed to live in the country.
[01:18:05.336 --> 01:18:10.261]  They were talking about genocidal, you know, genocidal cleaning.
[01:18:10.261 --> 01:18:13.285]  Cleansing, if you will, of a society.
[01:18:13.285 --> 01:18:14.346]  Those are the moderate groups.
[01:18:14.346 --> 01:18:16.288]  So there you are.
[01:18:16.288 --> 01:18:17.149]  So the option was
[01:18:17.785 --> 01:18:23.810]  The Joint Chiefs looking at the intelligence, looking at the fact that we had been supporting for years covertly.
[01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:26.752]  This is through the CIA, David Petraeus.
[01:18:26.752 --> 01:18:29.875]  I would argue that Hillary Clinton surely should have been aware of this.
[01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:31.376]  She was Secretary of State.
[01:18:31.376 --> 01:18:38.622]  We began to, after Libya fell, we began to funnel stuff that in an earlier article I called the rat line.
[01:18:39.102 --> 01:18:39.723]  I don't think so.
[01:18:57.631 --> 01:19:02.074]  They can't convince the White House and the State Department with intelligence.
[01:19:02.074 --> 01:19:13.781]  They're just going to begin to do what they can do to try and modify the American policy or make it less, you know, nobody wants to talk about directly challenging a president.
[01:19:13.781 --> 01:19:15.082]  That's not your job.
[01:19:15.082 --> 01:19:16.583]  But I will tell you at this certain level.
[01:19:17.196 --> 01:19:20.038]  At the Joint Chiefs, the level four-star generals.
[01:19:20.038 --> 01:19:23.461]  The oath of office is an oath to the Constitution, not to the President.
[01:19:23.461 --> 01:19:24.442]  That's right.
[01:19:24.442 --> 01:19:25.582]  And it's very traditional.
[01:19:25.582 --> 01:19:27.284]  You can go back to Douglas McCarthy.
[01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:29.145]  You can go back to World War II fighting.
[01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:31.487]  You can go back to terrible fighting in Vietnam.
[01:19:31.487 --> 01:19:44.517]  President Eisenhower, as the President, challenged the military-industrial complex as a system himself, the ultimate level, still a general, saying, I want to challenge the people that want to control our military for their own aims.
[01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:45.811]  There you go.
[01:19:45.811 --> 01:19:46.271]  There you go.
[01:19:46.271 --> 01:19:55.074]  And you can even argue that the hatred for McNamara by the time he was ready to get out of there in 67 because he refused to listen to the generals.
[01:19:55.074 --> 01:19:57.114]  We've always had generals in opposition.
[01:19:57.114 --> 01:19:57.955]  So this isn't new.
[01:19:57.955 --> 01:20:10.078]  What they did, though, instead of directly challenging the Joint Chiefs, as I wrote about, beginning in the summer of 2013 after a lot of intelligence showed that our path was wrong.
[01:20:10.078 --> 01:20:11.658]  We weren't going to win.
[01:20:11.658 --> 01:20:13.619]  If we got rid of Bashar, we were going to have
[01:20:14.139 --> 01:20:16.941]  A government completely full of wackos.
[01:20:16.941 --> 01:20:18.322]  You know, wing nuts.
[01:20:18.322 --> 01:20:20.944]  A hard line that take off their head people.
[01:20:20.944 --> 01:20:22.005]  Clearly worse.
[01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:24.306]  I mean a whole new Afghanistan.
[01:20:24.306 --> 01:20:25.407]  Well, there you go.
[01:20:25.407 --> 01:20:26.968]  Look, Afghanistan is still a mess right now.
[01:20:27.679 --> 01:20:29.641]  You know, people always talk.
[01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:30.722]  I'm a big supporter.
[01:20:30.722 --> 01:20:33.525]  I was in the Army.
[01:20:33.525 --> 01:20:35.287]  There's nothing better than America.
[01:20:35.287 --> 01:20:36.949]  It's the greatest country to be in.
[01:20:36.949 --> 01:20:38.550]  But we do have a lot of freedom.
[01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:44.817]  And I will tell you that our special operations forces, the Delta Force, the SEALs, they're terrific.
[01:20:45.277 --> 01:20:48.379]  They're very good at what they do, but they're being miscast.
[01:20:48.379 --> 01:21:01.389]  We're now on 14 and a half years of a war against an idea, and the Joint Special Operations Command, for all of their ability to go hit a house at night and kill people and take them out, we're not winning that war.
[01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:03.330]  We've got to figure out some way to do it differently.
[01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:03.730]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:04.851]  Well, Cy Hirst joins us.
[01:21:04.851 --> 01:21:10.795]  I want to go back to the bombshell you just dropped that's in your article, Military to Military, London Review of Books, and expand on this with you.
[01:21:11.756 --> 01:21:22.827]  Because what you write here, and the generals you talk to, and you've got the former head of Defense Intelligence, Flynn, and others going public on Al Jazeera saying, look, we were ordered to aid Al Qaeda, ISIS, all this.
[01:21:22.827 --> 01:21:28.992]  This is bombshell, and it verifies stuff you were writing about years ago that you were demonized over.
[01:21:30.089 --> 01:21:38.817]  This is unprecedented in my lifetime to see generals on TV saying we don't want to back Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS.
[01:21:38.817 --> 01:21:40.938]  We don't know why we're being ordered to do this.
[01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:42.480]  We don't know what the mission is.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.262]  I mean, if your mission is to kill Christians, then it works.
[01:21:45.262 --> 01:21:45.743]  If it's not...
[01:21:46.703 --> 01:21:47.624]  You know, what's the point?
[01:21:47.624 --> 01:21:49.646]  So you've got the high-level sources.
[01:21:49.646 --> 01:21:55.932]  I just don't think the public realizes how seismic this is and what it symbolizes under the surface.
[01:21:55.932 --> 01:22:04.179]  So can you speak to more of that, please, sir, and go over to you what this means in your 40-plus years of being inside this?
[01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:06.541]  Well, we're just fighting this war wrong.
[01:22:07.219 --> 01:22:08.400]  We're fighting it wrong.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:26.840]  We are supplying a great deal of materials to people that we claim to be moderate, and there's no question, the first thing that happens when a small group that maybe isn't as far out as ISIS or al-Nusra, but the first thing they do is they have no choice either to sell it to them or get it taken away.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.202]  So whatever we're sending there,
[01:22:28.422 --> 01:22:46.316]  They get bullied by the most extreme, yes sir, but when I'm getting back with you, sir, and I know you hold your cards close to your vest, you just got into the Pentagon, the Army mainly, from my sources, you're confirming it, saying, we're not going to back Al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, ISIS, we're just going to give intel to the Russians and intel to Assad and stop that.
[01:22:46.316 --> 01:22:51.160]  That is just a huge American moment that makes me so proud of the armed services.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.921]  That is great!
[01:22:52.714 --> 01:22:54.336]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[01:22:54.336 --> 01:23:02.463]  What they did was, because they didn't want to go directly to Bashar Assad, because the President had ruled that, you know, that would have been a direct violation.
[01:23:02.463 --> 01:23:11.171]  But we did know that the Germans in particular, the German Intelligence Service and the German High Command, and get this, the Russians and the Israelis,
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:15.461]  All three had been in contact with Bashar Assad.
[01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:20.422]  Because all three, even Israel, which sometimes, you know, doesn't always speak what the real policy is.
[01:23:20.422 --> 01:23:23.183]  They've got a lot of problems, government problems, leadership problems.
[01:23:23.183 --> 01:23:33.905]  But the guys running the military and intelligence system in Israel have the same point of view as our, the guys running our, at least that were running our Joint Chiefs, because the general at the time was General Dempsey.
[01:23:33.905 --> 01:23:36.246]  They're saying... Dempsey, who's now retired.
[01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:37.786]  He's the new chairman.
[01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:41.627]  And we don't know where he stands on this, because publicly he's said little.
[01:23:41.627 --> 01:23:43.027]  He's only a couple months into it.
[01:23:43.027 --> 01:23:45.608]  I understand a very competent Marine named Dunford.
[01:23:45.608 --> 01:23:47.028]  I just don't know much about him.
[01:23:47.028 --> 01:23:48.709]  I know more about Dempsey.
[01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:55.770]  Was Dempsey the big hero in this, going to Obama saying... Well, you know, he wouldn't look at it that way.
[01:23:55.770 --> 01:24:00.011]  He just did something... The issue was, we were going the wrong way.
[01:24:00.011 --> 01:24:02.532]  The Germans and the Russians
[01:24:03.112 --> 01:24:06.034]  And the Israelis, we're begging for intelligence.
[01:24:06.034 --> 01:24:09.656]  One thing America does, and we do it very well, we have terrific intelligence.
[01:24:09.656 --> 01:24:15.200]  We have satellite, we have SIGINT intelligence, we do have people on the ground.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.882]  We can do better than anybody wants to write about with certain groups.
[01:24:18.882 --> 01:24:19.843]  We can penetrate people.
[01:24:20.283 --> 01:24:24.785]  We're not incompetent, but often it's the leadership that gets you in trouble.
[01:24:24.785 --> 01:24:29.467]  So they decided that, the Germans in particular, were kept on saying, what can you do to help us?
[01:24:29.467 --> 01:24:40.292]  They began, in the fall of 2013, we began to shovel stuff that we had about Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS.
[01:24:40.292 --> 01:24:46.555]  We began to shovel information, not only about where they were, but what they were thinking, as much as we learned.
[01:24:46.555 --> 01:24:47.496]  And so we enabled
[01:24:48.276 --> 01:24:48.876]  I don't agree.
[01:25:07.097 --> 01:25:13.163]  As somebody in the article I wrote said, you know, we're doing stuff military to military.
[01:25:13.163 --> 01:25:17.006]  The President may not have known, but there's a lot of stuff he doesn't know about.
[01:25:17.006 --> 01:25:19.208]  So that's the way they got around the issue.
[01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:21.230]  And they began to help it and help Bashar.
[01:25:21.230 --> 01:25:28.257]  Not only that, it was very much a morale builder for the Syrian Army to know that they were getting very high-level intelligence.
[01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:31.560]  So, I don't know how history is going to judge this.
[01:25:33.626 --> 01:25:39.489]  As you can gather, stories like this in the mainstream press don't get copied.
[01:25:39.489 --> 01:25:41.971]  But it doesn't matter, because there's the Internet.
[01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:49.895]  You know, there's guys like you and all sorts of other people around the world that pay more attention than often.
[01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:55.678]  The major papers here... You know, I worked for the New York Times for eight or nine years during Watergate.
[01:25:55.678 --> 01:25:57.319]  I won a lot of prizes in Vietnam.
[01:26:00.219 --> 01:26:03.221]  Certainly, the Nixon years, a lot.
[01:26:03.221 --> 01:26:11.306]  And one of the things, you know, is there's not many reporters at a good newspaper who have the kind of, you know, there's nothing special.
[01:26:11.306 --> 01:26:16.049]  I have friends that I know, most of the good guys at the major papers have somebody.
[01:26:16.049 --> 01:26:25.415]  And when you're at that level, where you're, you know, you've got access and you're covering the Pentagon or the State Department or the White House, the last thing you want to do, I know this makes, sounds almost
[01:26:26.024 --> 01:26:26.305]  Really?
[01:26:35.515 --> 01:26:38.796]  The only thing the editor can do is ask one of the good reporters to do it.
[01:26:38.796 --> 01:26:43.238]  And what they want to do is figure out some way to get this out, you know, get this off their desk.
[01:26:43.238 --> 01:26:44.478]  So it doesn't really get happened.
[01:26:44.478 --> 01:26:46.299]  It doesn't happen with the papers.
[01:26:46.299 --> 01:26:49.040]  And I understand it because I'm sure I did the same thing.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.822]  We're all, you know, we all love what we do and we're more interested in ourselves than anybody else.
[01:26:53.822 --> 01:26:56.023]  That's one of the things about my business that's sort of wacky.
[01:26:56.403 --> 01:26:57.544]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:26:57.544 --> 01:27:00.806]  You've had the courage and the fortitude to go through a lot.
[01:27:00.806 --> 01:27:03.648]  I know you don't talk about this, but I mean, I know the stuff I've gone through.
[01:27:03.648 --> 01:27:09.992]  I mean, I can imagine, and I've seen some of the news, you've gone through a lot of harassment, persecution, to tell the truth.
[01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:12.514]  And it's just to see the media today just being repeaters.
[01:27:12.514 --> 01:27:16.617]  They take a corporate press release as pitchman and just put it back out.
[01:27:16.617 --> 01:27:17.737]  It's very, very sad.
[01:27:17.737 --> 01:27:21.540]  I just hope that you'll join us to talk about your Cheney book.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.040]  Very, very sad.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.043]  Yeah, but that's, you know, the problem I have with that is, you know, here's Cheney, who's a very tough dude.
[01:27:26.676 --> 01:27:30.238]  Who decided one day after 9-11 that the rules don't apply.
[01:27:30.238 --> 01:27:41.183]  Which is, you know, and the thing that always interests me so much about Cheney, and I'm not telegraphing that much, is how easy it was for him to do it.
[01:27:41.183 --> 01:27:42.343]  How he could change all the rules.
[01:27:42.343 --> 01:27:42.944]  He's a social power.
[01:27:42.944 --> 01:27:44.204]  How easy it is.
[01:27:44.204 --> 01:27:51.168]  It's just, it turns out, our Constitution, you know, which we all dearly think is so wonderful, it's pretty flimsy.
[01:27:51.168 --> 01:27:53.569]  It can be beaten to death very easy.
[01:27:53.569 --> 01:27:54.229]  And that happens.
[01:27:54.867 --> 01:27:56.028]  And so here we are.
[01:27:56.028 --> 01:28:03.093]  We have a prison in Guantanamo that to the Arab world is a symbol of everything that's wrong with America.
[01:28:03.093 --> 01:28:04.233]  It's so dumb.
[01:28:04.233 --> 01:28:06.355]  It's a prison guys can go into and they disappear.
[01:28:06.355 --> 01:28:09.757]  There's a lot of bad guys there, but there's an awful lot of good guys too.
[01:28:09.757 --> 01:28:11.278]  Guys that have nothing to do with anything.
[01:28:11.278 --> 01:28:12.779]  We were paying $525.
[01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:14.160]  We lose the moral high ground.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.301]  Sir, I've got to get you back up.
[01:28:15.301 --> 01:28:17.623]  By the time I have left, I've got to ask you separately.
[01:28:18.203 --> 01:28:22.526]  Dealing with all the things that are happening and the way terrorism is being used to take our freedoms.
[01:28:22.526 --> 01:28:24.247]  Bringing all these refugees in.
[01:28:24.247 --> 01:28:25.688]  We know a lot of them are foreign fighters.
[01:28:25.688 --> 01:28:26.889]  They're going to attack.
[01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:30.152]  Then they say, oh, we'll just put up naked body scanners on the highway.
[01:28:30.152 --> 01:28:32.013]  I mean, isn't the war on terror a fraud?
[01:28:32.013 --> 01:28:36.917]  Because all the funding in 15 years and we're still seeing terror attacks.
[01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:41.440]  Shouldn't we just preserve the Bill of Rights and Constitution and not be intimidated by terror?
[01:28:42.691 --> 01:28:45.413]  Well, you know, I don't necessarily agree with everything you're saying.
[01:28:45.413 --> 01:28:48.154]  Let me make it clear, because I have a different view on immigration.
[01:28:48.154 --> 01:28:54.998]  I think you can do things, rational things, to separate the good from the bad, although I admit there's always a risk with everything.
[01:28:54.998 --> 01:29:00.221]  But certainly, I'll tell you, we've walked away from a lot of bases, and you're right.
[01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:03.443]  One of the basic things we use, it makes it easy for the government
[01:29:04.143 --> 01:29:09.727]  And look, I know people that are very serious inside the government about the security risk and are scared.
[01:29:09.727 --> 01:29:16.812]  But the bottom line is, it's being used to pass laws that violate the Bill of Rights.
[01:29:16.812 --> 01:29:17.572]  I agree.
[01:29:17.572 --> 01:29:19.894]  Let's not blame the migrants and the poor war-torn folks.
[01:29:19.894 --> 01:29:20.554]  I know.
[01:29:20.554 --> 01:29:25.958]  I'm just saying they're going to use this, the few bad guys that come in to take our freedoms.
[01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:27.099]  When is the Cheney book coming out?
[01:29:30.273 --> 01:29:31.414]  You know, hey, come on.
[01:29:31.414 --> 01:29:31.974]  I'm a journalist.
[01:29:31.974 --> 01:29:32.895]  We never make deadlines.
[01:29:32.895 --> 01:29:34.296]  I don't want to make any predictions.
[01:29:34.296 --> 01:29:35.217]  Well, Mr. Hirsch, we're out of time.
[01:29:35.217 --> 01:29:41.421]  I mean, I know you got to go, but I just want to... Let me say bye to you during the break, but I tell you, thank you so much for your courage, and you deserve it.
[01:29:41.421 --> 01:29:43.242]  You're an amazing person.
[01:29:43.242 --> 01:29:44.403]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:44.403 --> 01:29:47.506]  Well, thank you for having me, and have a happy new year.
[01:29:47.506 --> 01:29:48.026]  You too, sir.
[01:29:48.026 --> 01:29:48.506]  Thank you.
[01:29:48.506 --> 01:29:52.049]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.049 --> 01:29:54.751]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.573 --> 01:30:04.616]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constant in 2004.
[01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:09.178]  Crimes punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
[01:30:09.178 --> 01:30:11.039]  But what about the other Bill?
[01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:11.759]  Former U.S.
[01:30:11.759 --> 01:30:20.923]  President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump.
[01:30:20.923 --> 01:30:27.166]  For years, Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy.
[01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:39.594]  But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was Secretary of State.
[01:30:39.594 --> 01:30:54.804]  For someone running a campaign on female empowerment, Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.
[01:30:54.804 --> 01:30:57.166]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[01:32:01.678 --> 01:32:06.863]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and

[01:33:10.057 --> 01:33:14.118]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:14.118 --> 01:33:17.460]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.320]  That's right.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:26.523]  You know, I respect Michael Savage, and when I would listen to him 10, 12 years ago, I agree with about 95%.
[01:33:26.523 --> 01:33:34.866]  But when he would say there's a socialist plan to flood the West with radical Islamics, and to create caliphates and take over, he was the first person I ever heard say that, I thought,
[01:33:35.714 --> 01:33:36.655]  Well, I believe him.
[01:33:36.655 --> 01:33:41.459]  He sounds sincere, and I can tell he's a man who believes in what he's doing.
[01:33:41.459 --> 01:33:45.102]  He's a smart guy with all these letters to his name.
[01:33:45.102 --> 01:33:46.743]  But, man, that's really crazy.
[01:33:46.743 --> 01:33:48.044]  Would the elite really do that?
[01:33:48.044 --> 01:33:53.648]  And now, here's the headline, Migrant Crisis Pushing Germany Towards Anarchy and Civil War.
[01:33:54.921 --> 01:34:00.108]  In one town alone, the Daily Mail reports 750 military-age men, basically.
[01:34:00.108 --> 01:34:04.113]  In a town of 102, they're demanding the Germans pay for it all.
[01:34:04.113 --> 01:34:06.056]  Same thing's happening here with the open borders.
[01:34:06.056 --> 01:34:08.459]  Who talked about language, borders, culture?
[01:34:08.459 --> 01:34:09.060]  Michael Savage.
[01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:14.615]  So call him a prophet, a historian, a man before his time.
[01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:22.640]  He is a renaissance man, of course, best-selling author, launched much of the modern herbal supplement movement we know of in the 60s and 70s.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.442]  If there's one guy, you could say Michael Savage under another nom de plume.
[01:34:27.442 --> 01:34:29.103]  And now he's with us for just 30 minutes.
[01:34:29.103 --> 01:34:30.584]  I'm going to shut up and go to him.
[01:34:30.584 --> 01:34:33.866]  But I got to tell you, he's banned from entering England.
[01:34:35.273 --> 01:34:39.876]  I've been threatened that I'll be banned from entering Europe or England now if I criticize radical Islam.
[01:34:39.876 --> 01:34:44.940]  They're arresting Germans en masse and taking their kids from them if they criticize radical Islam.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.322]  The women are being told don't wear short skirts.
[01:34:47.322 --> 01:34:54.627]  They're cancelling Christian holidays in public squares because the radical Islamics are offended.
[01:34:54.627 --> 01:34:56.248]  This is the suicide of the West.
[01:34:56.248 --> 01:35:02.012]  You talk about total mental illness because these radical Islamics are going to go after the liberals first thing when they get control.
[01:35:02.012 --> 01:35:03.033]  It is suicidal.
[01:35:03.033 --> 01:35:04.454]  It's a form of cuckolding in my view.
[01:35:05.334 --> 01:35:06.475]  He's got his new book out.
[01:35:06.475 --> 01:35:08.757]  The last one was censored on China.
[01:35:08.757 --> 01:35:09.877]  Getting ready to make big moves.
[01:35:09.877 --> 01:35:11.398]  You notice that all happened.
[01:35:11.398 --> 01:35:15.421]  China's now involved with the clandestine radio they secretly own in the U.S.
[01:35:15.421 --> 01:35:16.682]  trying to censor media.
[01:35:16.682 --> 01:35:18.724]  They block Hollywood movies being released.
[01:35:19.813 --> 01:35:23.575]  His new book, Government Zero, no borders, no language, no culture.
[01:35:23.575 --> 01:35:27.377]  And folks, you may all get it, but your friends and family don't.
[01:35:27.377 --> 01:35:30.879]  This is a book you better give them this Christmas or this holiday season.
[01:35:30.879 --> 01:35:35.521]  And I'm here pushing it because Savage needs support with his information.
[01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:36.882]  He doesn't need money.
[01:35:36.882 --> 01:35:38.442]  He needs to get the book out.
[01:35:38.442 --> 01:35:39.523]  And you need to get the book out.
[01:35:40.003 --> 01:35:41.944]  And you need to support people that are telling the truth.
[01:35:41.944 --> 01:35:43.165]  Now, I'm done ranting.
[01:35:43.165 --> 01:35:45.627]  I want him to come back in the next month for a full hour.
[01:35:45.627 --> 01:35:48.609]  He's doing a book tour right now, so he's just got 25 minutes with us.
[01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:56.915]  But to say it's dire when the Daily Beast says we need to confiscate guns, that's a quote, but the black helicopter people may fight back.
[01:35:56.915 --> 01:36:07.683]  So, we're still crazy, even though we were right there coming for the guns, and we were right there going to get rid of the borders, and we were right there coming with forced inoculation, and we were right about world government with the Pope calling for it.
[01:36:08.303 --> 01:36:12.346]  Michael Savage, I'm going to try to shut up, but I tell you, this is an epic moment.
[01:36:12.346 --> 01:36:15.088]  You've laid so much knowledge on us.
[01:36:15.088 --> 01:36:16.169]  Where are we now?
[01:36:16.169 --> 01:36:18.010]  Where are we going?
[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:19.911]  Word is you're being censored as well.
[01:36:19.911 --> 01:36:21.652]  They're trying to block your new book.
[01:36:21.652 --> 01:36:23.073]  I mean, it is on.
[01:36:23.073 --> 01:36:25.515]  They're saying they want to persecute the press.
[01:36:25.515 --> 01:36:32.700]  Supreme Court Justice told Matt Drudge that they're coming next year to shut down basically talk radio and free speech on the Internet.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.561]  I mean, it's here.
[01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:34.762]  What do we do, Michael Savage?
[01:36:36.198 --> 01:36:40.040]  Okay, without hammering the book, I want to start with the title because it says it all.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.920]  Government Zero.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:37:03.429]  If we don't see President Zero invoking Government Zero, I'd like to know what it's going to take for the average moron out there, idiot moron fools, who have sold the country away, running around in shorts with Halloween costumes, with their children on drugs and sugar, and they wonder why these SOBs with that monster tyrant leftist bastard in the White House.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:09.081]  This guy is the smartest leftist in the history of the world.
[01:37:09.081 --> 01:37:17.723]  This slick BS artist, Barry from Honolulu, has done more harm to the world than Marx and Lenin put together.
[01:37:17.723 --> 01:37:20.144]  And he gets away with it for one reason, Alex.
[01:37:20.144 --> 01:37:22.064]  He doesn't shout like me.
[01:37:22.064 --> 01:37:24.765]  Have you ever heard Barry from Honolulu scream?
[01:37:24.765 --> 01:37:25.145]  No.
[01:37:25.145 --> 01:37:26.285]  Never.
[01:37:26.285 --> 01:37:30.106]  He is the smoothest con man in the history of the world.
[01:37:30.106 --> 01:37:32.507]  He makes Soros look like a chump.
[01:37:33.863 --> 01:37:36.826]  Soros, by the way, is behind breaking all the borders of Europe.
[01:37:36.826 --> 01:37:37.567]  You know that.
[01:37:37.567 --> 01:37:39.969]  With his open society.
[01:37:39.969 --> 01:37:42.451]  You know, Soros is who flooded America with marijuana.
[01:37:42.451 --> 01:37:42.952]  You know that.
[01:37:42.952 --> 01:37:44.654]  Now, many people like marijuana.
[01:37:44.654 --> 01:37:48.477]  I think it's one of the most toxic substances in the world.
[01:37:48.477 --> 01:37:49.638]  It is the road to addiction.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.322]  It is a gateway drug.
[01:37:52.322 --> 01:37:55.105]  Who has made it suddenly so friendly?
[01:37:55.105 --> 01:37:59.910]  Ten years ago, I fought with one of Soros' minions on my radio show.
[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:05.196]  Soros was the first to fund medical marijuana initiatives in Arizona and California.
[01:38:05.196 --> 01:38:07.799]  And I was arguing, are you people crazy?
[01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.141]  It's a gateway drug.
[01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:10.842]  You're going to hook a generation on drugs.
[01:38:10.842 --> 01:38:11.663]  We had this argument.
[01:38:12.364 --> 01:38:13.185]  It's history now.
[01:38:13.185 --> 01:38:15.507]  Marijuana is as friendly as candy corn.
[01:38:15.507 --> 01:38:17.368]  Everyone thinks it's a benign herb.
[01:38:17.368 --> 01:38:18.389]  It is not.
[01:38:18.389 --> 01:38:21.432]  So, what does it have to do with Soros' master plan?
[01:38:21.432 --> 01:38:25.535]  The man is possibly the most evil genius on the planet in my estimation.
[01:38:25.535 --> 01:38:29.178]  Why does he want to break the borders of every nation on Earth?
[01:38:29.178 --> 01:38:31.040]  What is it that they're after?
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.281]  What do you mean no borders?
[01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:32.942]  Well, listen.
[01:38:35.043 --> 01:38:37.305]  No borders, no language, no culture.
[01:38:37.305 --> 01:38:40.247]  A mass of stupid drugged humanity.
[01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:44.309]  Easily manipulated, turned into slaves, serfs in their own country.
[01:38:44.309 --> 01:38:45.810]  What more do you need to know?
[01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:49.513]  Children on drugs, parents on alcohol, marijuana, and drugs.
[01:38:49.513 --> 01:38:56.058]  And then you have the puppet masters, as in The Godfather, the peasant Avantes, pulling the strings.
[01:38:56.058 --> 01:39:02.022]  Sucking the money out of the people's pockets as they go to work like slaves, in their little slave factories, thinking they're free.
[01:39:02.022 --> 01:39:03.343]  Remember Orwell's book?
[01:39:04.275 --> 01:39:09.397]  Remember that great phrase, those who rattle their chains most loudly scream, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free?
[01:39:09.397 --> 01:39:09.637]  Yes.
[01:39:09.637 --> 01:39:11.017]  That's what Orwell wrote.
[01:39:11.017 --> 01:39:14.038]  As he saw what communism had wrought in Europe, socialism.
[01:39:14.038 --> 01:39:15.699]  He was originally a socialist.
[01:39:15.699 --> 01:39:17.480]  And then he saw who they really were.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.320]  He saw they were monsters and dictators.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.801]  He got into their upper sanctum.
[01:39:20.801 --> 01:39:23.322]  He was led into the Fabian Socialist.
[01:39:23.322 --> 01:39:23.762]  Stalin.
[01:39:25.233 --> 01:39:26.015]  Hitler.
[01:39:26.015 --> 01:39:26.837]  All socialists.
[01:39:26.837 --> 01:39:28.141]  Everyone forgets that.
[01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:30.868]  Very convenient to forget Hitler was a socialist.
[01:39:30.868 --> 01:39:31.750]  Stalin, Hitler.
[01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:32.732]  Socialists.
[01:39:32.732 --> 01:39:33.755]  Different sides of the coin.
[01:39:34.787 --> 01:39:38.109]  Now we have socialism is suddenly popular in America.
[01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:39.329]  How's that possible?
[01:39:39.329 --> 01:39:42.031]  Because the drugged morons don't even know what it is.
[01:39:42.031 --> 01:39:43.331]  They don't know what it has wrought.
[01:39:43.331 --> 01:39:44.552]  They don't know where it leads.
[01:39:44.552 --> 01:39:46.473]  They have no idea what it'll do to them.
[01:39:46.473 --> 01:39:51.736]  Now, couple that with bringing in as many Islamic fascists as you possibly can as quickly as you can.
[01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:52.616]  Why?
[01:39:52.616 --> 01:39:58.099]  Why are they bringing in so many young men of military age into Europe?
[01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:00.722]  into America.
[01:40:00.722 --> 01:40:02.684]  What's their game plan here?
[01:40:02.684 --> 01:40:05.747]  And now throw in what you're talking about, confiscation of guns.
[01:40:05.747 --> 01:40:07.049]  It ain't happening, Alex.
[01:40:07.049 --> 01:40:08.570]  We're not Australia.
[01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:11.193]  Australia had no Second Amendment, that's number one.
[01:40:11.193 --> 01:40:16.979]  And I will remind you and your audience, and this is the most important thing, Alex, I'm sorry for the day.
[01:40:16.979 --> 01:40:20.943]  I have a tape that I keep playing on my radio show from Elena Kagan.
[01:40:22.042 --> 01:40:30.677]  When she was appointed to the Supreme Court, when she went through the fake hearing, the kangaroo fake hearing of whether she should be appointed or not, she was asked about the Second Amendment.
[01:40:30.677 --> 01:40:31.598]  Remember her?
[01:40:31.598 --> 01:40:34.964]  She's this kind of pickled saleswoman from the Lower East Side of New York.
[01:40:34.964 --> 01:40:35.525]  Looks like the penguin.
[01:40:36.428 --> 01:40:37.569]  Yeah, pickle saleswoman.
[01:40:37.569 --> 01:40:40.792]  In my day, the most she would have done is sold bloomers at Macy's.
[01:40:40.792 --> 01:40:42.033]  Now she's on the Supreme Court.
[01:40:42.033 --> 01:40:44.575]  This is right out of the Communist China playbook.
[01:40:44.575 --> 01:40:46.336]  Take people from the bottom and put them on the top.
[01:40:46.336 --> 01:40:49.038]  Take people on the top and throw them to the bottom.
[01:40:49.038 --> 01:40:53.662]  So, Elena Kagan, when she was grilled, fake grilled, she says, where do you stand on guns?
[01:40:53.662 --> 01:40:57.946]  And she says, the Second Amendment is established law.
[01:40:57.946 --> 01:41:00.308]  The Second Amendment is established law.
[01:41:01.618 --> 01:41:05.901]  Well, if it's established law, how could Barry from Honolulu take your guns?
[01:41:05.901 --> 01:41:08.383]  How could the witch from Arkansas or Chaplin?
[01:41:08.383 --> 01:41:11.606]  I agree with you, but they're openly licking their chops, is what I'm saying.
[01:41:11.606 --> 01:41:12.867]  I agree it'll start a civil war.
[01:41:12.867 --> 01:41:14.208]  I agree they're not going to get away with it.
[01:41:14.208 --> 01:41:19.752]  But they're openly now, Hillary, Obama, others, saying we do need to look at confiscation.
[01:41:19.752 --> 01:41:20.953]  That's a bold move.
[01:41:20.953 --> 01:41:23.795]  Why are they shooting their mouths off?
[01:41:23.795 --> 01:41:27.618]  There was a time not too long ago when the Democrats would never even touch God.
[01:41:28.632 --> 01:41:29.693]  Guns and gays.
[01:41:29.693 --> 01:41:32.716]  Remember that time not so long ago?
[01:41:32.716 --> 01:41:47.169]  But Barry from Honolulu is such a slick con artist that he's so hoodwinked, the American drug addict, that they actually think it's time for socialism, gun seizure, no borders, and flood America with your Muslim brethren.
[01:41:47.169 --> 01:41:49.731]  The people are stupid and they're drugged, Alec!
[01:41:49.731 --> 01:41:51.873]  And they sensed they could get away with it.
[01:41:51.873 --> 01:41:52.534]  But you know what?
[01:41:52.534 --> 01:41:53.875]  They're reading their tea leaves wrong.
[01:41:55.213 --> 01:41:57.677]  There'll be a revolution and they're gonna lose, Alex.
[01:41:57.677 --> 01:42:00.541]  There are too many guns and too many people ready to fight them.
[01:42:00.541 --> 01:42:02.363]  I'm not calling for revolution.
[01:42:02.363 --> 01:42:03.064]  They are.
[01:42:03.064 --> 01:42:04.146]  Let's be very clear.
[01:42:04.146 --> 01:42:05.768]  I am a man of peace.
[01:42:07.373 --> 01:42:11.655]  I am a man of peace, but we have gangsters running this country.
[01:42:11.655 --> 01:42:12.356]  Criminals!
[01:42:12.356 --> 01:42:13.176]  Gangsters!
[01:42:13.176 --> 01:42:15.637]  What the hell is this highway bill all about?
[01:42:15.637 --> 01:42:17.338]  The first day, I'm sorry for yelling.
[01:42:17.338 --> 01:42:18.639]  No, no, we're normal.
[01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:35.808]  We see total criminal takeover, the death of freedom, the death of the West, and these crazy socialists that so hate freedom that they want to bring in the most radical Sunni Wahhabist to run around and rape people, and the Swiss and Dutch and all the rest of these police just let them go under orders.
[01:42:36.748 --> 01:42:41.190]  I mean, it's just crazy that we've gotten to this point and it's normal to get angry.
[01:42:41.190 --> 01:42:42.650]  We need to get people out of their coma.
[01:42:42.650 --> 01:42:44.291]  How do we do that?
[01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.691]  I gotta go back to Paul Ryan.
[01:42:45.691 --> 01:42:49.692]  He gives a speech today that I hear on ABC News about the highway bill.
[01:42:49.692 --> 01:42:50.433]  Listen to this.
[01:42:50.433 --> 01:42:52.993]  The first day he gives a speech, what's it about?
[01:42:52.993 --> 01:42:53.814]  The highway bill.
[01:42:53.814 --> 01:42:56.495]  Who was it that was pushing the highway bill for years now?
[01:42:56.495 --> 01:42:59.155]  Nancy Pelosi!
[01:42:59.155 --> 01:43:00.196]  Put two and two together.
[01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:03.270]  Why is it a highway bill that's on the top of their list?
[01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:05.051]  Because Pelosi supported it.
[01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:07.772]  Why does Pelosi push it?
[01:43:07.772 --> 01:43:10.353]  Because they can... It's an old adage, all roads lead to Rome.
[01:43:10.353 --> 01:43:11.894]  You ever hear that one going back many times?
[01:43:11.894 --> 01:43:13.054]  Absolutely.
[01:43:13.054 --> 01:43:14.615]  All roads lead to Rome.
[01:43:14.615 --> 01:43:20.077]  That's as far as I can go without winding up with lead shoes in the bottom of San Francisco Bay.
[01:43:20.077 --> 01:43:21.078]  And I'll let it hang in the air.
[01:43:22.293 --> 01:43:29.258]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history, and I'm not saying this for effect, nor to sell a book.
[01:43:29.258 --> 01:43:30.599]  I'm trying to awaken people.
[01:43:30.599 --> 01:43:33.021]  Unfortunately, Alec, your audience is already awakened.
[01:43:33.021 --> 01:43:34.202]  They're agitated.
[01:43:34.202 --> 01:43:35.162]  They're ready to strike.
[01:43:35.162 --> 01:43:36.503]  They don't know what to do.
[01:43:36.503 --> 01:43:38.365]  But look at the morons around you.
[01:43:38.365 --> 01:43:39.225]  Go walk in the streets.
[01:43:39.225 --> 01:43:39.806]  They're zombies.
[01:43:39.806 --> 01:43:42.187]  I walked in San Francisco yesterday, the most beautiful city.
[01:43:42.187 --> 01:43:44.189]  I love it to death.
[01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:48.272]  I'm walking through a park near the Embarcadero, and without being graphic,
[01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:54.324]  I'm an old boy scout, so I read footprints in the woods and I can read droppings in the woods.
[01:43:54.324 --> 01:43:58.225]  I was taught how to follow droppings of what kind of animal it is.
[01:43:58.225 --> 01:44:03.145]  Well, there was a dropping on the ground on the sidewalk that I said there were no bears in the city.
[01:44:03.145 --> 01:44:05.206]  How could the... This can't be a bear.
[01:44:05.206 --> 01:44:16.008]  Well, it's an admitted record problem in San Francisco, public defecation, and now in government buildings, even when they have bathrooms, they're so mentally ill that they just enjoy crapping in public.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.821]  What does that say about a civilization, Alex?
[01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:24.502]  That people are allowed to crap without having their heads broken open by a cop.
[01:44:24.502 --> 01:44:35.244]  In my day, if a guy did that, a big Irish cop would smash him on the head with a nightstick, and drag him into the prison, and hose him down and throw him into a jail, and leave him there.
[01:44:35.244 --> 01:44:38.745]  Well, what kind of country is this that permits this to go on?
[01:44:38.745 --> 01:44:43.766]  Now, you ask yourself, if society is breaking down, and at the same time they're trying to break us down,
[01:44:44.944 --> 01:44:45.905]  What is it all about?
[01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:49.546]  So the public defecation could be stopped in one second, right?
[01:44:49.546 --> 01:44:51.067]  So what is this about?
[01:44:51.067 --> 01:44:55.529]  It's to constantly lower the standards of the middle class.
[01:44:55.529 --> 01:44:57.991]  Constantly dehumanize the middle class.
[01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.271]  That's it.
[01:44:59.271 --> 01:45:11.357]  Dehumanize, desensitize, weaken, weaken, weaken, weaken, weaken, until eventually they have no resistance to whatever the evil criminal gangsters in the regime might do next.
[01:45:11.357 --> 01:45:12.458]  It's as simple as that, Alex.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:22.386]  And at the want and at the wish to not offend people who think I'm peddling a book, I have to mention my great new book.
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:52.590]  Look, first of all the good news is despite the censoring, despite no appearance on Fox News ever, ever!
[01:45:52.590 --> 01:45:53.671]  Zero!
[01:45:53.671 --> 01:45:55.773]  Fox News, conservative outlet, are you kidding me?
[01:45:57.105 --> 01:45:57.505]  Zero.
[01:45:57.505 --> 01:45:59.107]  Michael Savage officially banned.
[01:45:59.107 --> 01:46:01.309]  ABC, CBS, NBC banned.
[01:46:01.309 --> 01:46:02.950]  CNBC banned.
[01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:05.052]  So I go on your show.
[01:46:05.052 --> 01:46:06.413]  Laura Ingraham has a small show.
[01:46:06.413 --> 01:46:07.073]  I love her to death.
[01:46:07.073 --> 01:46:08.695]  She's brilliant.
[01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:09.916]  Who else has me on?
[01:46:09.916 --> 01:46:10.897]  Nobody.
[01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:14.300]  Despite the media blackout, the audience is so loyal.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.482]  The book is number two this week on the Barnes & Noble bestseller list.
[01:46:17.482 --> 01:46:18.243]  Excuse me.
[01:46:18.243 --> 01:46:19.364]  We just got the news this morning.
[01:46:19.364 --> 01:46:20.144]  It's number two on the
[01:46:21.025 --> 01:46:22.586]  Yeah, Barnes & Noble bestseller list.
[01:46:22.586 --> 01:46:24.368]  We don't know what it'll be on the New York Times list.
[01:46:24.368 --> 01:46:26.089]  God knows they manipulate that one.
[01:46:26.089 --> 01:46:28.291]  Oh, it's admittedly manipulated.
[01:46:28.291 --> 01:46:34.636]  People are reporting that they're going in stores and they're finding stacks of the books with the covers bent.
[01:46:34.636 --> 01:46:35.396]  Wow.
[01:46:35.396 --> 01:46:36.917]  So you got sabotage.
[01:46:36.917 --> 01:46:43.382]  Then they're finding the book in the back, not on the front table, which the publisher paid for, but in the back under feminine hygiene.
[01:46:43.382 --> 01:46:45.464]  That's a joke, but that's where they're putting it.
[01:46:45.464 --> 01:46:47.565]  Anywhere but where you can find it.
[01:46:47.565 --> 01:46:48.946]  Now, which books are selling well?
[01:46:49.787 --> 01:46:54.170]  Why, O'Reilly's books, the Killing Series, what are people buying that garbage for?
[01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:56.953]  What's the revelation about killing Patton or killing Reagan?
[01:46:56.953 --> 01:46:59.555]  Can you tell me why anybody would read a book like that?
[01:46:59.555 --> 01:47:01.356]  What are they finding in the book that they don't already know?
[01:47:01.356 --> 01:47:07.461]  It's mindless, it's non-threatening, they want to think they're pseudo-intellectuals, they want to sit back and read something that's utterly mindless.
[01:47:08.988 --> 01:47:15.851]  Well, I said this facetiously, and I certainly don't mean it, but I said I'm waiting for the next book in the series by him called Killing O'Reilly.
[01:47:15.851 --> 01:47:18.573]  Maybe he'll do us all a favor and end it already.
[01:47:18.573 --> 01:47:20.513]  He's got some franchise going there, doesn't he?
[01:47:20.513 --> 01:47:22.494]  But nevertheless, let's get back to serious stuff.
[01:47:22.494 --> 01:47:24.015]  No borders, no language, no culture.
[01:47:24.015 --> 01:47:24.795]  What does that matter?
[01:47:24.795 --> 01:47:28.797]  Leftists says, hey, savage, what the heck are you so excited about?
[01:47:28.797 --> 01:47:30.678]  What do you need a border for?
[01:47:30.678 --> 01:47:33.720]  And what are you holding on to English for?
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.201]  Your parents were immigrants, weren't they, Michael?
[01:47:37.082 --> 01:47:37.783]  Yes.
[01:47:37.783 --> 01:47:38.103]  And?
[01:47:38.103 --> 01:47:39.144]  And so what's your point, Larry?
[01:47:39.144 --> 01:47:40.585]  I was on Larry King last week.
[01:47:40.585 --> 01:47:42.527]  He has a little show on Russian television.
[01:47:42.527 --> 01:47:45.489]  How is that for a funny come about of events?
[01:47:45.489 --> 01:47:47.411]  But I actually like Larry King, but you know why, Alex?
[01:47:47.411 --> 01:47:52.435]  He's a liberal, old school, nice liberal, smart, but not vicious.
[01:47:52.435 --> 01:47:55.618]  Totally different than the new generation of progressive psychos, right?
[01:47:56.823 --> 01:48:02.626]  He says to me, your parents were immigrants, so what are you afraid of someone not speaking English?
[01:48:02.626 --> 01:48:04.707]  I said, I don't care what language they speak at home.
[01:48:04.707 --> 01:48:06.727]  My grandmother never spoke a word of English.
[01:48:06.727 --> 01:48:10.049]  But my father drilled into me, you're in America.
[01:48:10.049 --> 01:48:10.769]  Learn English.
[01:48:10.769 --> 01:48:12.290]  Learn it the best way you can.
[01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:13.651]  Become an American.
[01:48:13.651 --> 01:48:14.831]  You're not living anywhere else.
[01:48:14.831 --> 01:48:15.752]  Be an American.
[01:48:15.752 --> 01:48:18.413]  That's not the ethos of this generation, is it?
[01:48:19.153 --> 01:48:21.634]  Do you hear them teaching their children to learn English?
[01:48:21.634 --> 01:48:23.295]  They're teaching them to learn anything but English.
[01:48:23.295 --> 01:48:25.556]  Stamp on the country that's so good to you.
[01:48:25.556 --> 01:48:26.776]  Don't learn their language.
[01:48:26.776 --> 01:48:28.337]  There is no culture there.
[01:48:28.337 --> 01:48:31.238]  How long has the left taught us that America has no culture?
[01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:32.939]  It's an acculturated nation.
[01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.479]  We're a nation with no culture.
[01:48:34.479 --> 01:48:40.062]  They want to get rid of our culture so they can then download into us their sick, mentally ill culture.
[01:48:40.062 --> 01:48:42.383]  And you were one of the first to say this, but more and more it's clear.
[01:48:43.311 --> 01:48:50.753]  The top liberals are vicious mafia social engineers, as you've documented, but their minions really are mentally ill basket cases.
[01:48:50.753 --> 01:49:05.918]  I'm sure you saw the Atlantic Monthly article a few weeks ago about the coddled generation admitting, and these are leftists saying, that their college students have now become like these weird Maoist youth brigades that shout them down for just any language.
[01:49:05.918 --> 01:49:06.678]  They are complete
[01:49:07.538 --> 01:49:14.386]  The fascist basket cases that just flip out and now want to ban the word mother and father.
[01:49:14.386 --> 01:49:15.528]  You're a father, Alec.
[01:49:15.528 --> 01:49:17.590]  You know that children need discipline.
[01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:19.533]  You know what happens when you raise them without discipline.
[01:49:19.533 --> 01:49:21.415]  They become animals.
[01:49:21.415 --> 01:49:25.160]  I was in a Chinese restaurant last night in San Francisco.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.701]  I love a dumpy restaurant that I go to.
[01:49:27.523 --> 01:49:34.368]  There was a kid, two of them, running around screaming at the top of their lungs, I mean screeching, with the food you couldn't even digest it.
[01:49:34.368 --> 01:49:38.151]  I wasn't going to say anything because, you know, what are you going to do?
[01:49:38.151 --> 01:49:39.292]  I looked at the father.
[01:49:39.292 --> 01:49:43.194]  He was a nice looking guy, not a weakling, but indulgent.
[01:49:43.194 --> 01:49:44.595]  Afraid to say no to Johnny.
[01:49:45.416 --> 01:49:51.378]  The type that when Johnny defecates in his hand and wipes it on the wall, he will say, Johnny is an artist.
[01:49:51.378 --> 01:49:53.038]  That's a Shigali just painted.
[01:49:53.038 --> 01:49:55.859]  Don't wipe it off the wall.
[01:49:55.859 --> 01:49:57.419]  These people are crazy!
[01:49:57.419 --> 01:49:59.680]  They have no discipline themselves.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.921]  Remember, if the father's 30, 32, 33, right?
[01:50:03.921 --> 01:50:05.742]  He may look good.
[01:50:05.742 --> 01:50:08.002]  What's amazing to me is that these guys are well built.
[01:50:08.002 --> 01:50:10.623]  They all go to the gym, right Alex?
[01:50:10.623 --> 01:50:13.024]  They all got abs, but they have no cerebrum.
[01:50:13.024 --> 01:50:14.384]  They don't have the minds of men.
[01:50:15.418 --> 01:50:19.360]  Well, they have abs, they have good abs, but no cerebrum folds, no folds in the brain.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.122]  They have folds in the stomach.
[01:50:21.122 --> 01:50:25.064]  It's like zomboids walking around, wild, crazy children.
[01:50:25.064 --> 01:50:27.726]  This child's made to be only one thing, which is a tort lawyer.
[01:50:27.726 --> 01:50:29.347]  That's all they grow up to be.
[01:50:29.347 --> 01:50:32.109]  And if he fails at that, he can become a government worker.
[01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:40.234]  But aside from the facetiousness, okay, discipline gone, society going, breaking down at the top gangster regime, sucking us dry.
[01:50:40.894 --> 01:50:44.075]  Paul Ryan, first speech, first speech, first speech.
[01:50:44.075 --> 01:50:45.815]  Highway bill, highway bill, highway bill.
[01:50:45.815 --> 01:50:48.016]  Who's in the highway building business?
[01:50:48.016 --> 01:50:50.777]  Who makes the trillions off the highway bill?
[01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:52.097]  Are you in the highway business?
[01:50:52.097 --> 01:50:56.198]  No, but Nancy Pelosi went into Congress worth about a half a million now.
[01:50:56.198 --> 01:50:57.519]  She's worth hundreds of millions.
[01:50:57.519 --> 01:50:59.640]  And her husband suddenly became worth billions.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:00.880]  She's a nice lady.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.502]  Of course, I'm sure she's friends with Don Corleone.
[01:51:03.502 --> 01:51:03.782]  Very nice.
[01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:04.944]  She's a sweet grandmother.
[01:51:04.944 --> 01:51:16.535]  And you know, what's also nice about Pelosi is the fact that her brother-in-law got about a $1.2 billion loan from the government for a solar plant in the Nevada desert.
[01:51:16.535 --> 01:51:22.581]  And he did so well in producing about a megawatt of energy for it that they gave him another $800 million, according to what I've recently read.
[01:51:22.941 --> 01:51:25.202]  How come it's not in any of the newspapers?
[01:51:25.202 --> 01:51:26.323]  Have you ever seen?
[01:51:26.323 --> 01:51:28.264]  Corruption like this couldn't even go on today in New York.
[01:51:28.264 --> 01:51:32.426]  Yeah, what's wrong with Harry Reid giving billions in contracts to his sons?
[01:51:32.426 --> 01:51:34.268]  He's got like four or five of them.
[01:51:34.268 --> 01:51:34.928]  That's nothing!
[01:51:34.928 --> 01:51:36.529]  That shouldn't even be in the news!
[01:51:36.529 --> 01:51:38.190]  I mean, how dare you do your research?
[01:51:38.190 --> 01:51:38.710]  It's totally normal.
[01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:39.851]  It's the Republican Party.
[01:51:39.851 --> 01:51:40.371]  There is none.
[01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:41.972]  It's a one-party system.
[01:51:41.972 --> 01:51:43.053]  Oligarchy.
[01:51:43.053 --> 01:51:44.974]  All the conservatives that were put in last year.
[01:51:45.774 --> 01:51:47.456]  Were put at the back of the bus.
[01:51:47.456 --> 01:51:50.641]  Remember how much hope we had in November when I wrote Stop the Coming Civil War?
[01:51:50.641 --> 01:51:55.267]  I said, hold your nose, go vote for Republicans and we'll put their feet to the fire after they win.
[01:51:55.267 --> 01:51:56.008]  Guess what?
[01:51:56.008 --> 01:51:57.590]  Boehner has no feet.
[01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:58.712]  McConnell has no feet.
[01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:00.734]  There's no feet to put on the fire.
[01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:02.716]  They're empty shells.
[01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:04.217]  They were never men.
[01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:05.517]  They were never there.
[01:52:05.517 --> 01:52:08.299]  They were factotums of Barry from Honolulu.
[01:52:08.299 --> 01:52:09.240]  One party.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.040]  Period.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.721]  It is a fascist dictatorship.
[01:52:11.721 --> 01:52:14.002]  He wants to crush us under his fist.
[01:52:14.002 --> 01:52:16.524]  He is the worst monster in the history of America.
[01:52:16.524 --> 01:52:28.030]  And if he uses an executive order to go around Congress on immigration, we need 10 million people demanding, immediately demanding, that an impeachment hearing be started, whether or not those cowardly, useless, gangster Republicans do it or not.
[01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:29.211]  We need a people's tribunal.
[01:52:29.731 --> 01:52:31.533]  Let's be positive for a moment.
[01:52:31.533 --> 01:52:32.073]  I agree.
[01:52:32.073 --> 01:52:36.077]  We need a People's Tribunal and find these people guilty of war crimes.
[01:52:36.077 --> 01:52:42.503]  I agree, but your audience, my audience, Drudge and WorldNetDaily and a lot of other great people did get organized.
[01:52:42.503 --> 01:52:46.326]  We did get 40 or so libertarian constitutionalists.
[01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:50.450]  They did get rid of Boner.
[01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:51.832]  Then, of course, they brought in Ryan.
[01:52:52.312 --> 01:52:52.672]  The point
[01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:11.951]  You said yourself, 10 minutes ago, there's going to be a revolution in this country.
[01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.132]  I hope it's peaceful.
[01:53:13.132 --> 01:53:19.815]  So specifically, Michael Savage, joining us right now, michaelsavage.com, the new book, Government Zero, No Borders, No Language, No Culture.
[01:53:19.815 --> 01:53:26.378]  In the 5-6 minutes we have left, what do you expect the empire to strike back with, and what do we do to counter it?
[01:53:29.349 --> 01:53:32.452]  You know, my book is not just a screed of complaints and screaming.
[01:53:32.452 --> 01:53:35.616]  It's a well-organized, because I'm a scholar by training, book.
[01:53:35.616 --> 01:53:44.285]  At the end of the book, I have 40 action points, direct actions that have to be taken immediately to save the nation.
[01:53:44.285 --> 01:53:47.428]  The number one thing is create a nationalist party.
[01:53:47.428 --> 01:53:49.230]  Now you may say, that's crazy.
[01:53:49.230 --> 01:53:50.731]  That has no chance of winning.
[01:53:50.731 --> 01:53:51.472]  Not now, Alex.
[01:53:52.593 --> 01:53:59.175]  Alex, we have to start laying the groundwork to save the country by creating a new party, the Nationalist Party.
[01:54:00.131 --> 01:54:06.376]  You know there's a word going around, liberal parents beware, the millennials are very conservative.
[01:54:06.376 --> 01:54:07.156]  Do you know that?
[01:54:07.156 --> 01:54:07.757]  Yes.
[01:54:07.757 --> 01:54:12.941]  Do you know that it's a conservative generation that's rebelling against the insane drug addicted liberal parents?
[01:54:12.941 --> 01:54:13.341]  Yes.
[01:54:13.341 --> 01:54:21.367]  If we had a charismatic young leader, if I were 40 right now and knew what I know now and had the reach I have now, I wouldn't run for office.
[01:54:21.367 --> 01:54:22.588]  Excuse me, it's corrupt.
[01:54:22.588 --> 01:54:28.673]  I'd create the Nationalist Party knowing that in 10 years we'd win in this country.
[01:54:28.673 --> 01:54:29.754]  So I'm not going to do it.
[01:54:31.485 --> 01:54:36.367]  I'm not young enough to create a party, nationalist party, to close the borders for seven years.
[01:54:36.367 --> 01:54:40.490]  I didn't say anything but close the borders for seven years.
[01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:42.391]  Absorb all those who are here.
[01:54:42.391 --> 01:54:46.893]  Number three, deport all illegal aliens dot dot dot in prison.
[01:54:46.893 --> 01:54:49.054]  See, people misquote me.
[01:54:49.054 --> 01:54:53.276]  I said, first start by deporting the criminal illegal aliens in prison.
[01:54:53.276 --> 01:54:59.559]  Alex, one third of all our prisoners, as I point out, as you well know, one third of our prisoners are illegal aliens.
[01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:00.700]  What are we paying them for?
[01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:03.451]  Get him out of the country!
[01:55:03.451 --> 01:55:05.736]  Empty the prisons of one-third of the prisoners.
[01:55:05.736 --> 01:55:07.199]  People say, well, I'll only come right back.
[01:55:07.199 --> 01:55:08.482]  Concurrently do what Trump said.
[01:55:08.482 --> 01:55:09.705]  Build the wall.
[01:55:09.705 --> 01:55:10.546]  Israel built the wall.
[01:55:10.546 --> 01:55:11.288]  It works real good.
[01:55:12.421 --> 01:55:13.682]  Walls work.
[01:55:13.682 --> 01:55:16.423]  China built one to keep the Mongols out.
[01:55:16.423 --> 01:55:19.085]  Israel built one to keep the Palestinians out.
[01:55:19.085 --> 01:55:21.646]  Now, of course, they're being stabbed to death by those that they let in.
[01:55:21.646 --> 01:55:23.327]  They'll have to do something next.
[01:55:23.327 --> 01:55:24.708]  Number three, build a wall.
[01:55:24.708 --> 01:55:26.929]  So, one, Nationalist Party.
[01:55:26.929 --> 01:55:29.571]  Two, deport illegal aliens in prisons.
[01:55:29.571 --> 01:55:30.731]  Not such a bold idea.
[01:55:30.731 --> 01:55:36.895]  Who's in favor of keeping them in our prisons at $60,000 a year, other than the prison guard unions?
[01:55:36.895 --> 01:55:37.015]  Three,
[01:55:39.611 --> 01:55:40.051]  Wall.
[01:55:40.051 --> 01:55:41.312]  Build a wall.
[01:55:41.312 --> 01:55:41.632]  Four.
[01:55:41.632 --> 01:55:42.813]  And listen to this.
[01:55:42.813 --> 01:55:45.154]  Make English the official language of America.
[01:55:45.154 --> 01:55:48.276]  That doesn't mean it's illegal to speak another language.
[01:55:48.276 --> 01:55:49.857]  Plus, English is the global language.
[01:55:49.857 --> 01:55:51.197]  Everyone should want to learn English.
[01:55:51.197 --> 01:55:51.978]  It's the language.
[01:55:53.243 --> 01:55:55.405]  San Francisco, eight languages on the ballot.
[01:55:55.405 --> 01:55:56.827]  Now what was the reason for that?
[01:55:56.827 --> 01:56:07.678]  So Pelosi, Boxer, Feinstein and the corrupt government in San Francisco can get all the illegal aliens to put these corrupt, illegal, left-wing phenomenal bastards in power over and over again.
[01:56:07.678 --> 01:56:08.759]  Over and over and over again!
[01:56:08.759 --> 01:56:15.266]  We have people crapping in the street, you got dogs running wild in the street, you got girls being shot in the street, and these corrupt bastards!
[01:56:16.789 --> 01:56:17.970]  They are just pieces of trash.
[01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:20.972]  In the three minutes we've got left, you've got to come back for an hour soon.
[01:56:20.972 --> 01:56:22.994]  MichaelSavage.com, Michael Savage is our guest.
[01:56:22.994 --> 01:56:27.937]  How do you expect Obama to leave office?
[01:56:27.937 --> 01:56:33.861]  How do you expect him to try to take over and put his people in so they can't be removed even though he leaves office?
[01:56:33.861 --> 01:56:35.382]  There's a permanent bureaucracy.
[01:56:35.382 --> 01:56:37.723]  How do you expect them to leave?
[01:56:37.723 --> 01:56:38.604]  What are their dirty tricks?
[01:56:38.604 --> 01:56:39.965]  What are you watching out for?
[01:56:40.821 --> 01:56:46.144]  Number one, he's already done it with the Justice Department, the illegal, corrupt, anti-American Justice Department.
[01:56:46.144 --> 01:56:49.486]  He's put people in positions that are lifetime positions.
[01:56:49.486 --> 01:56:56.210]  What this Barry from Honolulu doesn't know is that if we had a strong leader take over, and I pray to God, Trump wins.
[01:56:56.210 --> 01:56:58.011]  I don't know what you think of him.
[01:56:58.011 --> 01:56:59.071]  He's our only hope right now.
[01:56:59.071 --> 01:57:02.433]  I think he's a lot better than Hillary, and I agree with what he has to say, and I hope it's for real.
[01:57:02.433 --> 01:57:02.854]  I'm supportive.
[01:57:02.854 --> 01:57:05.955]  He uses executive orders and he gets rid of all of these appointees.
[01:57:05.955 --> 01:57:06.476]  Throws them out!
[01:57:07.336 --> 01:57:08.297]  And says, go sue me.
[01:57:08.297 --> 01:57:08.917]  I'm the government.
[01:57:08.917 --> 01:57:09.597]  Go to hell.
[01:57:09.597 --> 01:57:10.738]  Get out.
[01:57:10.738 --> 01:57:12.539]  He throws out Perez, for example.
[01:57:12.539 --> 01:57:14.940]  I have all their names in Governments of Europe.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:15.840]  They're in here.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.002]  All of these corrupt leftists that he planted are in there.
[01:57:19.002 --> 01:57:19.882]  Get rid of them.
[01:57:19.882 --> 01:57:20.703]  Executive order.
[01:57:20.703 --> 01:57:22.163]  There are things that can be done.
[01:57:22.163 --> 01:57:22.964]  It's not hopeless.
[01:57:22.964 --> 01:57:25.465]  We just need a strong leader who loves America.
[01:57:25.465 --> 01:57:27.506]  We'll restore our borders, language, and culture.
[01:57:27.506 --> 01:57:29.127]  And by the way, that's not enough.
[01:57:30.007 --> 01:57:33.629]  I want to see these people tried for the crimes they have committed.
[01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:33.989]  We have to.
[01:57:33.989 --> 01:57:39.572]  The corruption, the corruption, the corruption, the money, the contracts, the grants, the stolen money.
[01:57:39.572 --> 01:57:41.553]  Uruguay couldn't get away with this today.
[01:57:41.553 --> 01:57:44.455]  We're lower than a banana republic under this gangster regime.
[01:57:45.583 --> 01:57:45.983]  It is.
[01:57:45.983 --> 01:57:48.284]  I mean, it's just pure insider trading.
[01:57:48.284 --> 01:57:51.465]  Congress gets caught five years ago, so they go pass a law legalizing it.
[01:57:51.465 --> 01:57:55.426]  Well, you can't legalize child molestation just so they pass a law.
[01:57:55.426 --> 01:57:57.007]  I think we're getting ready to hit bottom.
[01:57:57.007 --> 01:57:59.088]  Is that what you mean by government zero?
[01:57:59.088 --> 01:58:01.548]  That zero hour is here?
[01:58:01.548 --> 01:58:04.029]  No, but it's a very good analysis.
[01:58:04.029 --> 01:58:04.789]  I didn't think of it.
[01:58:04.789 --> 01:58:06.250]  Thank you for your insight.
[01:58:06.250 --> 01:58:14.793]  I meant government zero means not a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of itself, by itself, and for itself.
[01:58:15.967 --> 01:58:16.928]  We have zero government.
[01:58:16.928 --> 01:58:18.629]  We have a lawless criminal group.
[01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:19.390]  Exactly.
[01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:20.651]  Zero representation.
[01:58:20.651 --> 01:58:24.474]  A government is supposed to be representative, not a group.
[01:58:24.474 --> 01:58:31.079]  A cadre of a zero, zero, zero, one percent of trillionaires who put the stooges in and drive us dry.
[01:58:31.079 --> 01:58:32.460]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:33.140]  Michael Savage.
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:33.861]  I'm going to read the book.
[01:58:33.861 --> 01:58:35.922]  My producer ran home with it, but it's amazing.
[01:58:35.922 --> 01:58:37.123]  Powerful book.
[01:58:37.123 --> 01:58:38.084]  MichaelSavage.com.

[01:58:40.606 --> 01:58:40.967]  Powerful.
[01:58:40.967 --> 01:58:41.890]  Powerful interview.
[01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:43.474]  We'll be back in a second.
[01:58:48.419 --> 01:58:53.501]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:05.752]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.752 --> 02:00:07.534]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.534 --> 02:00:09.296]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.296 --> 02:00:10.897]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.897 --> 02:00:12.419]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.419 --> 02:00:16.603]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.603 --> 02:00:20.687]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.868 --> 02:00:28.510]  I have never had a deer-in-the-headlights experience this crazy, because I'm not really a fan of like rock stars, movie stars, people like that.
[02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:44.156]  I like politics, and I'm sitting there during that 70-second break, and Matt Drudge rounds the corner over here, and it was just like total and complete deer-in-the-headlights, and I'm still double-taking here, and then he's hiding over there in the shadows right now.
[02:00:44.156 --> 02:00:44.776]  I'm not kidding.
[02:00:44.776 --> 02:00:49.318]  They're gonna say there's another conspiracy theory, and we got Anthony Guicciardi.
[02:00:49.318 --> 02:00:50.158]  Is Matt Drudge over there?
[02:00:51.701 --> 02:00:52.902]  He is over there.
[02:00:52.902 --> 02:00:55.705]  Come on, just for a second to give the national media a heart attack.
[02:00:55.705 --> 02:00:57.367]  Can you just walk over here behind the stage?
[02:00:57.367 --> 02:00:58.609]  They're not going to believe it.
[02:00:58.609 --> 02:01:00.671]  No, see, it's right around this way.
[02:01:00.671 --> 02:01:02.393]  I haven't had one photo in eight years.
[02:01:02.393 --> 02:01:03.754]  I know you haven't had one photo in eight years.
[02:01:03.754 --> 02:01:06.397]  All right, I'm going to turn the mic your way.
[02:01:06.397 --> 02:01:07.438]  They can do voice print.
[02:01:07.438 --> 02:01:08.439]  Is this Matt Grudge?
[02:01:08.439 --> 02:01:10.401]  Uh-oh.
[02:01:10.401 --> 02:01:11.282]  Okay, it's made up.
[02:01:12.333 --> 02:01:13.433]  It's a stunt.
[02:01:13.433 --> 02:01:14.554]  April Fools came early.
[02:01:14.554 --> 02:01:14.714]  What?
[02:01:14.714 --> 02:01:15.454]  How many months early?
[02:01:15.454 --> 02:01:16.934]  Five months early?
[02:01:16.934 --> 02:01:19.395]  April Fools, folks, I fooled ya.
[02:01:19.395 --> 02:01:22.535]  Well, am I supposed to go to rebroadcast now that you're here?
[02:01:22.535 --> 02:01:24.736]  Because I'm in a... You get to hang out with my crew and I'm on the air?
[02:01:24.736 --> 02:01:28.657]  This is, like, diabolical.
[02:01:28.657 --> 02:01:30.317]  Oh my gosh.
[02:01:30.317 --> 02:01:32.078]  Anyways, no, seriously.
[02:01:32.078 --> 02:01:33.838]  Do you think folks are gonna believe Matt Drudge was here?
[02:01:38.047 --> 02:01:42.348]  I didn't believe it, only because it was such short notice, it was like boom!
[02:01:42.348 --> 02:01:45.169]  I remember years ago, well anyways, I'm not going to get into it.
[02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:46.449]  This is crazy.
[02:01:46.449 --> 02:01:54.972]  Alright, well I'm not going to be aggressive and turn the lights on over there and aim the document cam over there, but Matt Drudge came in, said hi to me, thought it was a three minute break, and then went over there.
[02:01:54.972 --> 02:01:58.073]  I'm definitely going to have to play a clip or something.
[02:01:58.073 --> 02:02:02.274]  Do we have one of those special reports coming back from the next break?
[02:02:02.274 --> 02:02:04.435]  Alright, this has now entered complete twilight zone.
[02:02:06.502 --> 02:02:09.104]  Hey, but we got a new article up on Infowars.
[02:02:09.104 --> 02:02:13.788]  Obama arms ISIS militants, pushes gun control on very same day.
[02:02:13.788 --> 02:02:21.154]  Obama authorizes resupplying Syrian opposition on same day he demands gun control against American citizens.
[02:02:21.154 --> 02:02:23.716]  And of course, I was covering this Breitbart article a lot that I missed.
[02:02:23.716 --> 02:02:25.197]  I miss stuff all the time.
[02:02:25.197 --> 02:02:29.740]  I mean, I knew they were doing this, but I didn't know they were actually openly doing it.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:35.144]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in US.
[02:02:35.965 --> 02:02:38.587]  And then we've got all these callers that want to talk to me.
[02:02:38.587 --> 02:02:44.330]  You know, Matt has hosted the Drudge Report show for so long, but also Rush Limbaugh.
[02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:49.593]  So I would imagine he could come over here and actually host the show for us, except he's not really here.
[02:02:49.593 --> 02:02:59.718]  What if we put a microphone into the darkness, coming out of the break, and folks can do a voice print analysis to see if it's Matt Drudge?
[02:02:59.718 --> 02:03:00.479]  He's not going to do it?
[02:03:02.907 --> 02:03:05.149]  I'm telling you, this is so classically reclusive.
[02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:06.230]  I wish I could do that.
[02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:07.671]  He is back there right now.
[02:03:07.671 --> 02:03:09.713]  It's taken a lot of work to get to this point.
[02:03:09.713 --> 02:03:11.915]  I know it's taken a lot of work to get to this point.
[02:03:11.915 --> 02:03:12.755]  I admire you.
[02:03:12.755 --> 02:03:15.237]  Maybe I should become reclusive.
[02:03:15.237 --> 02:03:15.998]  Huh?
[02:03:15.998 --> 02:03:16.979]  He's a big guy.
[02:03:16.979 --> 02:03:18.560]  In good shape, too.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:19.781]  I was like, man, who is that big guy?
[02:03:19.781 --> 02:03:20.242]  Who is that?
[02:03:20.242 --> 02:03:21.443]  I recognize that guy.
[02:03:21.443 --> 02:03:22.083]  Who's that with him?
[02:03:22.083 --> 02:03:24.525]  I was like, oh my God.
[02:03:24.525 --> 02:03:26.207]  What did I look like, Buckley, when he walked in?
[02:03:29.082 --> 02:03:31.503]  I mean, I literally was like, who is that?
[02:03:31.503 --> 02:03:33.603]  You are something else, man!
[02:03:33.603 --> 02:03:35.004]  God, I tell you.
[02:03:35.004 --> 02:03:38.424]  He's got a lot of class, the way he pulls stuff off.
[02:03:38.424 --> 02:03:40.805]  I'm kind of the opposite, like a bull in a china shop.
[02:03:40.805 --> 02:03:43.125]  A loose cannon.
[02:03:43.125 --> 02:03:44.966]  Anyways, I was already super wound up today.
[02:03:44.966 --> 02:03:49.067]  I've already had too many DNA forces today, and this has now just pushed me over the edge.
[02:03:49.067 --> 02:03:52.888]  I need some Jack Daniels Buckley immediately.
[02:03:52.888 --> 02:03:53.788]  I've not been drinking.
[02:03:54.761 --> 02:04:05.989]  Since last Thursday, I've been a good boy, and I've been being nice, but I tell you, I don't have any, what do you call them, tranquilizers.
[02:04:05.989 --> 02:04:09.151]  But I think I need a tranquilizer dart or something.
[02:04:09.151 --> 02:04:10.832]  All right, folks, we'll be right back.
[02:04:10.832 --> 02:04:13.714]  No, seriously, because I'm starstruck right now.
[02:04:13.714 --> 02:04:14.355]  This is crazy.
[02:04:14.355 --> 02:04:16.976]  And the way he did it is even worse.
[02:04:16.976 --> 02:04:18.958]  And then it's going to be even worse when they have, like,
[02:04:20.655 --> 02:04:25.404]  Some major establishment, White House-driven publication saying I made it all up.
[02:04:25.404 --> 02:04:27.368]  So at least, well, we can't get a photo for Twitter.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.380]  What are we going to do?
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:30.921]  The suspense is deafening.
[02:04:30.921 --> 02:04:45.265]  DrugsReport.com, you can read up there where this guy put stuff on his Facebook, the supposed shooter, about how he just had so many pills he was on, psychotropics, lithium, and other things, that he ended up just taking five at a time.
[02:04:45.265 --> 02:04:47.146]  So the question is, was he on meds?
[02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:53.188]  And the answer is, does a bear, you know, do different things like jump rope in the woods?
[02:04:53.188 --> 02:04:53.728]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.507 --> 02:05:04.530]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constant in 2004.
[02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:09.093]  Crimes punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
[02:05:09.093 --> 02:05:10.974]  But what about the other Bill?
[02:05:10.974 --> 02:05:11.694]  Former U.S.
[02:05:11.694 --> 02:05:20.839]  President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump.
[02:05:20.839 --> 02:05:27.083]  For years, Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy.
[02:05:27.423 --> 02:05:39.511]  But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was Secretary of State.
[02:05:39.511 --> 02:05:54.741]  For someone running a campaign on female empowerment, Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.
[02:05:54.741 --> 02:05:57.083]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[02:06:58.211 --> 02:07:05.116]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:07:05.116 --> 02:07:07.998]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:07:07.998 --> 02:07:13.922]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:07:13.922 --> 02:07:17.344]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:07:17.344 --> 02:07:20.306]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:07:20.606 --> 02:07:29.595]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:29.595 --> 02:07:40.326]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.

[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.002]  What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
[02:08:19.002 --> 02:08:27.409]  How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
[02:08:27.409 --> 02:08:29.531]  The answer is out there, Neo.
[02:08:29.531 --> 02:08:32.654]  It's the question that drives us.
[02:08:32.654 --> 02:08:35.816]  What is the Matrix?
[02:08:35.816 --> 02:08:40.000]  The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[02:08:50.786 --> 02:08:56.248]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:08:56.248 --> 02:09:03.151]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:09:03.151 --> 02:09:04.671]  The Matrix is a system, Neil.
[02:09:07.771 --> 02:09:09.732]  That system is our enemy.
[02:09:09.732 --> 02:09:12.273]  When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?
[02:09:12.273 --> 02:09:16.556]  Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
[02:09:16.556 --> 02:09:19.457]  The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
[02:09:19.457 --> 02:09:24.600]  But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.923]  You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
[02:09:29.923 --> 02:09:35.906]  And many of them are so in urge, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
[02:09:37.711 --> 02:09:39.876]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[02:09:39.876 --> 02:09:40.758]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:09:40.758 --> 02:09:41.821]  I will taint the news.
[02:09:41.821 --> 02:09:44.126]  Our propaganda was beginning to pay off.
[02:09:44.126 --> 02:09:46.852]  And our lord and savior Barack Obama!
[02:09:50.015 --> 02:09:57.544]  I am not a dictator.
[02:09:57.544 --> 02:10:00.627]  I'm the president.
[02:10:00.627 --> 02:10:06.434]  This is a full, dishonorable, scientific mafia warfare takedown.
[02:10:06.434 --> 02:10:08.336]  Public policy could itself
[02:10:09.057 --> 02:10:13.018]  Become the captain of a scientific technological elite.
[02:10:13.018 --> 02:10:15.158]  These people are coming for everybody!
[02:10:15.158 --> 02:10:17.279]  I'm not gonna wait around to be soft killed.
[02:10:17.279 --> 02:10:20.019]  I'm not gonna wait around and watch my family die around me.
[02:10:20.019 --> 02:10:21.659]  I'm gonna die fighting!
[02:10:21.659 --> 02:10:25.300]  You take the blue pill, the story ends.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:28.741]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[02:10:28.741 --> 02:10:32.901]  You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland.
[02:10:32.901 --> 02:10:35.142]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[02:10:39.862 --> 02:10:41.703]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:41.703 --> 02:10:47.065]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:10:47.065 --> 02:10:49.306]  Stop being a moron.
[02:10:49.306 --> 02:10:51.247]  Stop being dishonorable.
[02:10:51.247 --> 02:10:58.150]  Within 15 years they say, CNN, that everyone will be merged with machines or will be obsolete.
[02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:59.971]  I'm not gonna sit here
[02:11:10.044 --> 02:11:12.666]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live well into the third hour.
[02:11:12.666 --> 02:11:14.987]  I did not do this as a stunt, neither did Matt Drudge.
[02:11:14.987 --> 02:11:16.228]  He is here.
[02:11:16.228 --> 02:11:17.289]  We got a hot mic over there.
[02:11:17.289 --> 02:11:20.711]  He wants to stay literally in the shadows behind a curtain.
[02:11:20.711 --> 02:11:25.493]  But this is the king of being able to push a story out and make it the number one story in the world.
[02:11:25.493 --> 02:11:34.979]  They even admit that in the New York Times, that he has more readers on politics and news than Facebook, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, LA Times put together.
[02:11:34.979 --> 02:11:39.022]  He's got some of our stories where the shooter himself said he was on a bunch of drugs.
[02:11:39.642 --> 02:11:39.962]  I don't know.
[02:12:00.066 --> 02:12:10.634]  And really just focus on what Matt Drudge thinks is interesting, and the public tends to agree with him that what he focuses in on is really catching the zeitgeist or the pulse of the people.
[02:12:10.634 --> 02:12:16.658]  So he might have 50 links every day, where Facebook has 500 million, but he has more traffic.
[02:12:16.658 --> 02:12:21.542]  That is the true David versus Goliath story, and this is not scripted.
[02:12:21.542 --> 02:12:23.924]  I have no idea where I should go.
[02:12:23.924 --> 02:12:27.987]  Matt Drudge, I guess you're here for ACL, or why are you in Austin, Texas?
[02:12:29.073 --> 02:12:33.437]  Well, you were just talking about Facebook, and thanks again for having me here.
[02:12:33.437 --> 02:12:35.980]  I'm not on Facebook.
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:37.381]  I don't do the socials.
[02:12:37.381 --> 02:12:38.783]  I've got that little Twitter thing.
[02:12:38.783 --> 02:12:40.184]  Even that's kind of disgusting.
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:45.002]  You know, I've been doing the Internet as long as you've been doing this radio show, Alex.
[02:12:45.002 --> 02:12:48.804]  Literally every day, as you have literally every day, practically.
[02:12:48.804 --> 02:12:51.265]  I think you've taken a little more time off than I have, actually.
[02:12:51.265 --> 02:12:56.848]  Yes, I've kind of gone... And I can't say that about many people, because you are a peer without peer.
[02:12:56.848 --> 02:13:06.753]  And I'll tell you, I was there before Facebook, I was there before CNN.com, I was there before mostly all of them.
[02:13:06.753 --> 02:13:09.935]  I have a very clear perception what the Internet is.
[02:13:11.385 --> 02:13:12.325]  In my mind.
[02:13:12.325 --> 02:13:13.586]  I'm free.
[02:13:13.586 --> 02:13:17.667]  I'm not defined by what they say the Internet is.
[02:13:17.667 --> 02:13:24.650]  Meaning Goldman Sachs, meaning who they invest in for the latest startup, meaning the latest BuzzFeed or Salon or Gawker.
[02:13:24.650 --> 02:13:26.431]  Well, Gawker's more independent.
[02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:32.953]  But there's a lot of corporate makeover of the Internet that I have not adapted to.
[02:13:32.953 --> 02:13:33.914]  Simply put.
[02:13:35.277 --> 02:13:36.578]  I'm friends with some of them.
[02:13:36.578 --> 02:13:42.721]  When I go to New York, I make the 6th Avenue rounds, but I am not a part of that system.
[02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:43.661]  I'm a free thinker.
[02:13:43.661 --> 02:13:44.501]  I'm an American.
[02:13:44.501 --> 02:13:53.265]  I'm very concerned with what's happening, so I just give it my all.
[02:13:53.265 --> 02:13:58.328]  I've learned how to take care of myself and detach from outcomes, because otherwise
[02:13:59.946 --> 02:14:01.366]  You can't survive.
[02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:03.187]  And I don't know where you are on that topic.
[02:14:03.187 --> 02:14:10.949]  I just follow my instinct because they always tell us how to adapt to be successful, but really we're just adapting to their mindset to be their slaves.
[02:14:10.949 --> 02:14:11.349]  I don't.
[02:14:11.349 --> 02:14:12.329]  No, you don't.
[02:14:12.329 --> 02:14:17.451]  I have remained completely independent from all of them.
[02:14:17.451 --> 02:14:18.231]  All of them!
[02:14:18.971 --> 02:14:22.857]  I am not influenced by any of them.
[02:14:22.857 --> 02:14:24.899]  I need no traffic from Google.
[02:14:24.899 --> 02:14:31.649]  I don't care if I get one traffic referral from Google, or Bing, or Yahoo, or any of these others.
[02:14:31.649 --> 02:14:32.590]  It's always been that way.
[02:14:33.416 --> 02:14:41.462]  Now, if you think of that setup, how rare that is, because everybody's so hungry for referrals, for likes.
[02:14:41.462 --> 02:14:43.083]  I don't need to be liked.
[02:14:43.083 --> 02:14:44.544]  I don't need to be liked at all.
[02:14:44.544 --> 02:14:48.868]  I don't care if there's a button right there at the top of Drudge saying like or dislike.
[02:14:48.868 --> 02:14:51.490]  Thumbs up, thumbs down, doesn't mean anything.
[02:14:51.490 --> 02:14:57.234]  Now, I hope that you come, doesn't mean you necessarily have to like what I have up there.
[02:14:57.234 --> 02:15:00.656]  Now, where I've had a lot of success is I'm getting people from both sides of the aisle.
[02:15:01.445 --> 02:15:07.830]  They've always said, oh, he's a right-wing gossip monger, mainly because of Lewinsky in those years, which, by the way, are back.
[02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:10.713]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:10.713 --> 02:15:11.633]  Excuse me?
[02:15:11.633 --> 02:15:13.155]  Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?
[02:15:13.155 --> 02:15:14.536]  That's a good question.
[02:15:14.536 --> 02:15:17.618]  Where's the cover-up on this?
[02:15:17.618 --> 02:15:21.622]  So many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis.
[02:15:21.622 --> 02:15:22.983]  So that's what I try to do every morning.
[02:15:24.355 --> 02:15:24.975]  Incredible.
[02:15:24.975 --> 02:15:30.759]  Well, it's amazing to have you here in Austin, Texas, and I tell you, you certainly know how to make an entrance.
[02:15:30.759 --> 02:15:38.084]  I'm in a 70-second break, and I turn around, and there's Matt Drudge, just boom.
[02:15:38.084 --> 02:15:41.226]  I tell you, I almost had a heart attack, a good one.
[02:15:41.226 --> 02:15:43.547]  My cousin said he's never seen me look like that.
[02:15:43.547 --> 02:15:46.749]  What was the word, Buckley, you used?
[02:15:46.749 --> 02:15:47.410]  Flabbergasted.
[02:15:48.385 --> 02:15:49.726]  I was flabbergasted.
[02:15:49.726 --> 02:15:51.047]  You used the word flabbergasted.
[02:15:51.047 --> 02:15:57.110]  Well, I tell you, this is like the biggest Christmas present early ever, because I just admire true independence.
[02:15:57.110 --> 02:16:09.177]  I gotta tell you, Matt, and you know this with your crew, and Congress knows this, we wouldn't have won some of these gun battles, some of these border battles, some of these energy battles, and we've lost some too, but we would have lost so many of them if it wasn't for the focal point
[02:16:09.677 --> 02:16:13.599]  And even the White House and the Democrats admit that I know you're saying you're nonpartisan.
[02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:15.440]  I mean, I would guess you're more of a libertarian.
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.041]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:16:16.041 --> 02:16:16.941]  You're just a freedom guy.
[02:16:16.941 --> 02:16:18.782]  I can't be controlled.
[02:16:18.782 --> 02:16:21.404]  I cannot be controlled.
[02:16:21.404 --> 02:16:25.827]  There are no interests here but what I see as the world events.
[02:16:25.827 --> 02:16:27.007]  Period.
[02:16:27.007 --> 02:16:28.888]  That is the truth of the situation.
[02:16:28.888 --> 02:16:29.789]  Well, they hate the fact
[02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:31.931]  That they can't control the agenda.
[02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:40.459]  The Pentagon has briefings with the head of PSYOPS, as you know, saying, we've got to stop drudge changing the subject and showing when we're lying.
[02:16:40.459 --> 02:16:42.341]  I mean, that's when you know that's them.
[02:16:42.341 --> 02:16:43.983]  That's crazy town when you get.
[02:16:43.983 --> 02:16:44.643]  What is it like?
[02:16:44.643 --> 02:16:49.488]  Is it surreal to think back to something you started back in the early 90s has now grown into this?
[02:16:49.488 --> 02:16:51.250]  Well, no, because it's been every day.
[02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:51.990]  So it's just like.
[02:16:52.811 --> 02:16:54.952]  It's happened so organically.
[02:16:54.952 --> 02:16:56.533]  It started with one reader.
[02:16:56.533 --> 02:16:59.535]  I don't know who that one reader was, but it started with one reader.
[02:16:59.535 --> 02:17:01.816]  I've never placed an ad anywhere.
[02:17:01.816 --> 02:17:03.097]  Ever.
[02:17:03.097 --> 02:17:07.720]  This has all been a true organic reader to reader to reader to reader.
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:13.223]  Yes, I dabbled in the corporate with the Fox News Show and the Clear Channel Radio Show for nine years.
[02:17:14.281 --> 02:17:20.624]  But even that, the website was on its own terms and remains so to this very minute.
[02:17:20.624 --> 02:17:25.826]  Well, you've only gotten bigger since you stopped... Well, I don't know, because this is another thing.
[02:17:25.826 --> 02:17:28.727]  The measurements that we have, this is another bogus thing.
[02:17:28.727 --> 02:17:32.829]  Yesterday they released on the APA Wire, Twitter followers.
[02:17:33.729 --> 02:17:37.351]  Hillary is the queen of the Twitters, with 4.9 million.
[02:17:37.351 --> 02:17:38.932]  They don't say how many are fake.
[02:17:38.932 --> 02:17:40.092]  They don't say how many are drawing.
[02:17:40.092 --> 02:17:41.933]  They admit the first ladies is like 80% fake.
[02:17:41.933 --> 02:17:43.774]  Well, the AP did not do that, Alex.
[02:17:43.774 --> 02:17:48.016]  So this whole thing, this whole socials, these socials.
[02:17:48.016 --> 02:17:56.540]  You know, Beats 1 Music, which I'm obsessed with, which has been launched on Apple, which is probably one of the best things they've done since Steve Jobs died.
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:57.361]  One radio station.
[02:17:58.121 --> 02:17:58.942]  Interesting.
[02:17:58.942 --> 02:18:00.682]  They don't know how many listeners they have.
[02:18:00.682 --> 02:18:03.964]  I heard some streams they were down to 5,000 an hour.
[02:18:03.964 --> 02:18:07.226]  This whole social media stuff is bogus.
[02:18:07.226 --> 02:18:10.928]  Facebook, we have 2 billion users.
[02:18:10.928 --> 02:18:12.449]  This is garbage.
[02:18:12.449 --> 02:18:14.590]  This is designed to demoralize.
[02:18:15.310 --> 02:18:16.411]  The individual.
[02:18:16.411 --> 02:18:19.272]  I'll never have two billion followers.
[02:18:19.272 --> 02:18:20.973]  The Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:20.973 --> 02:18:22.573]  It's the same battle as it was in the beginning.
[02:18:22.573 --> 02:18:25.695]  I remember having this argument with Brit Hume once, live on C-SPAN.
[02:18:25.695 --> 02:18:29.696]  He goes, oh, the Internet's all UFOs and all this crap.
[02:18:29.696 --> 02:18:31.337]  And I said, no, the Internet is what you make of it.
[02:18:31.337 --> 02:18:33.678]  In the beginning, they were dismissing the Internet.
[02:18:33.678 --> 02:18:34.899]  They were poo-pooing it.
[02:18:34.899 --> 02:18:39.321]  And isn't that good for us that for so long they were in arrogant denial?
[02:18:39.321 --> 02:18:42.062]  And they seem like they still kind of are in arrogant denial.
[02:18:42.062 --> 02:18:42.562]  No.
[02:18:42.562 --> 02:18:44.263]  Now they make it over in their image.
[02:18:45.043 --> 02:18:48.384]  Now it's these endless, monotonous tweets.
[02:18:48.384 --> 02:18:49.724]  Meaningless!
[02:18:49.724 --> 02:18:51.725]  Meaningless!
[02:18:51.725 --> 02:18:55.026]  To me, it's just a lot of gnats.
[02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:56.747]  A lot of confusion.
[02:18:56.747 --> 02:19:01.428]  When the reality of the situation is, life on earth has not changed.
[02:19:01.428 --> 02:19:03.069]  We need facts.
[02:19:03.069 --> 02:19:04.249]  We need events.
[02:19:04.249 --> 02:19:06.229]  We need specifics on things.
[02:19:06.229 --> 02:19:08.150]  Not all this confusion.
[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:10.631]  It's almost they've made the internet over in their image.
[02:19:11.351 --> 02:19:12.171]  These corporations.
[02:19:12.171 --> 02:19:13.211]  And I think they're failing.
[02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:14.312]  Skip the break.
[02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:14.912]  Skip the break.
[02:19:14.912 --> 02:19:15.692]  Oh, sorry, Matt.
[02:19:15.692 --> 02:19:16.092]  Go ahead.
[02:19:16.092 --> 02:19:16.932]  I had to interrupt.
[02:19:16.932 --> 02:19:18.432]  You say you think they're failing?
[02:19:18.432 --> 02:19:19.732]  I think they're failing.
[02:19:19.732 --> 02:19:24.913]  To the point, this is a whole nother discussion on how sick are the American people right now.
[02:19:24.913 --> 02:19:30.954]  I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected.
[02:19:30.954 --> 02:19:32.355]  People are really sick.
[02:19:32.355 --> 02:19:36.555]  I think you know this deep in your soul and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set.
[02:19:36.555 --> 02:19:37.376]  I shouldn't.
[02:19:37.376 --> 02:19:38.776]  People are sick.
[02:19:39.796 --> 02:19:49.539]  How they've got here, you've been done a wonderful arc over almost decades now, explaining why people are and have become so sick.
[02:19:49.539 --> 02:19:55.001]  That being said, people are willing to be made over in the image of these corporations.
[02:19:55.001 --> 02:20:01.583]  The reason there's so much anger online also is a newspaper like the Washington Post will leave a comment section.
[02:20:01.583 --> 02:20:02.864]  They don't care what you're saying.
[02:20:03.484 --> 02:20:05.686]  They don't care what you're thinking.
[02:20:05.686 --> 02:20:13.992]  That's why you get this anger that, oh, I have to be, you know, I'm out here as a citizen and I'm operating in their playground.
[02:20:13.992 --> 02:20:15.654]  Make your own playground.
[02:20:15.654 --> 02:20:17.856]  The reason I'm here, Alex, is you've made your own.
[02:20:18.988 --> 02:20:20.109]  Playground.
[02:20:20.109 --> 02:20:23.314]  This is a figment of your imagination.
[02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:25.536]  And the Drudge Report is mine.
[02:20:25.536 --> 02:20:29.021]  It is a very simple thesis.
[02:20:29.021 --> 02:20:31.924]  You are what you dream you are and become.
[02:20:31.924 --> 02:20:37.311]  And I wish Americans would get out of the sickness and just become greater.
[02:20:37.992 --> 02:20:39.133]  Well, that's profound.
[02:20:39.133 --> 02:20:47.201]  I mean, because if we start creating our own maps, our own world, our own vision, then there's no way for these cultural tyrants to program us.
[02:20:47.201 --> 02:20:50.745]  And that's why they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous.
[02:20:50.745 --> 02:20:52.447]  I mean, is this the beginning of the end?
[02:20:52.447 --> 02:20:55.690]  And to operate in their playgrounds.
[02:20:55.690 --> 02:20:57.932]  So, you become famous on YouTube.
[02:20:58.837 --> 02:20:59.537]  That's ridiculous.
[02:20:59.537 --> 02:21:00.358]  I'm not saying you.
[02:21:00.358 --> 02:21:05.320]  I'm saying the 13-year-old that just died that they're saying is the first YouTube star that died.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:08.561]  You're playing in Google's hell pit.
[02:21:08.561 --> 02:21:09.622]  No, I agree, but I'm invaded almost.
[02:21:09.622 --> 02:21:11.363]  Make your own place.
[02:21:11.363 --> 02:21:12.663]  Make your own.
[02:21:12.663 --> 02:21:17.586]  The Internet allows you to make your own dynamic, your own universe.
[02:21:17.586 --> 02:21:21.968]  Why are you gravitating towards somebody else's universe?
[02:21:21.968 --> 02:21:26.590]  And this is kind of, again, where dredge to me when I look at it right now is a correction
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:30.301]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:48.932]  And this is a travesty.
[02:21:48.932 --> 02:21:57.099]  It's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating.
[02:21:57.099 --> 02:22:01.222]  It should be vibrating, it should be controversial, but I guess it's fear.
[02:22:01.222 --> 02:22:09.689]  Not everybody is cut from the same genetic background as you or I, Alex, of being brave and being able to stand up.
[02:22:09.689 --> 02:22:11.251]  You're on the camera, I'm not.
[02:22:11.251 --> 02:22:12.291]  You're more brave than I am.
[02:22:13.098 --> 02:22:15.440]  So, this is the dynamic that I'm in.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.161]  I would just like to wake people up.
[02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:20.764]  Stop operating in their playground.
[02:22:20.764 --> 02:22:21.404]  Stop it.
[02:22:21.404 --> 02:22:22.064]  Well, let me say this.
[02:22:22.064 --> 02:22:23.726]  I totally agree with you.
[02:22:23.726 --> 02:22:24.546]  I've tried.
[02:22:24.546 --> 02:22:28.389]  I couldn't pay for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms.
[02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:29.350]  Now we're doing that.
[02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:38.633]  At PrisonPlanet.tv and the Nightly News and putting ourselves up on television to reach people because it's kind of like jacking into the Matrix going into their playground.
[02:22:38.633 --> 02:22:44.175]  I try to then claw them over here to see what we're trying to do, what you're trying to do, but I totally agree with you.
[02:22:44.175 --> 02:22:54.278]  The answer is for all of us to create our own systems, our own ideas, because vibrant, independent ideas will trump this corporate plastic board
[02:22:54.918 --> 02:22:57.780]  This brainwashing they're trying to push.
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:01.743]  I mean, banning father and mother, banning the word husband and wife.
[02:23:01.743 --> 02:23:07.967]  I mean, that's so cultic that if I'd have been told ten years ago they were going to ban words like that, I wouldn't have believed it.
[02:23:07.967 --> 02:23:09.908]  They do it with straight faces.
[02:23:09.908 --> 02:23:19.154]  I mean, has the left, and of course the controlled right as well, but have they gone collectively insane on a control freak bent or is there a strategy?
[02:23:19.154 --> 02:23:21.496]  I would also advise people to not
[02:23:21.596 --> 02:23:22.836]  Don't waste their time on this.
[02:23:22.836 --> 02:23:26.337]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:23:26.337 --> 02:23:29.238]  I said, Matt, it's over for you.
[02:23:29.238 --> 02:23:31.719]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:23:31.719 --> 02:23:32.960]  You're out of there.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:36.281]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:23:36.281 --> 02:23:44.363]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:23:44.363 --> 02:23:46.524]  Time is not forever.
[02:23:46.524 --> 02:23:49.645]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:23:50.485 --> 02:23:51.685]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:23:51.685 --> 02:23:52.786]  There's not that many.
[02:23:52.786 --> 02:23:54.786]  It's a small amount.
[02:23:54.786 --> 02:24:00.448]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:24:00.448 --> 02:24:00.908]  No.
[02:24:00.908 --> 02:24:01.848]  No, you can't.
[02:24:01.848 --> 02:24:03.929]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:24:03.929 --> 02:24:09.130]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:11.451]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:24:11.451 --> 02:24:14.172]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:24:14.172 --> 02:24:15.032]  This is insane.
[02:24:15.032 --> 02:24:18.233]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:24:18.593 --> 02:24:21.076]  Now, remember just recently he hit a bullpen up.
[02:24:21.076 --> 02:24:23.579]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:24:23.579 --> 02:24:25.581]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:24:25.581 --> 02:24:27.463]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:24:27.463 --> 02:24:38.194]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:24:38.775 --> 02:24:40.476]  Then that will end for me.
[02:24:40.476 --> 02:24:40.876]  Fine.
[02:24:40.876 --> 02:24:42.197]  I've had a hell of a run.
[02:24:42.197 --> 02:24:44.939]  It's 20 years next year, or 20 years about now.
[02:24:44.939 --> 02:24:45.699]  Hell of a run!
[02:24:45.699 --> 02:24:48.501]  I couldn't have gone any further.
[02:24:48.501 --> 02:24:53.544]  I feel completely I have gone as far out of the galaxy as I can on this.
[02:24:53.544 --> 02:24:59.207]  I still want to stay out here, but I've gone pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture.
[02:24:59.207 --> 02:25:00.788]  But I'm talking about the future.
[02:25:00.788 --> 02:25:06.152]  So I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos.
[02:25:06.832 --> 02:25:12.218]  Of these Facebooks, and these Tweets, and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:25:12.218 --> 02:25:13.799]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:13.799 --> 02:25:14.580]  This is ghetto!
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:16.182]  This is corporate!
[02:25:16.182 --> 02:25:18.544]  They're taking your energy!
[02:25:18.544 --> 02:25:21.247]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return!
[02:25:21.247 --> 02:25:21.608]  Nothing!
[02:25:21.608 --> 02:25:23.069]  They're dumbing the language down!
[02:25:23.069 --> 02:25:25.832]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984!
[02:25:25.832 --> 02:25:26.153]  It's Ingsoc!
[02:25:28.092 --> 02:25:37.836]  Right, ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to something new, except for the something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed by the same banking system.
[02:25:37.836 --> 02:25:48.741]  So I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:25:50.001 --> 02:25:50.962]  In a big way.
[02:25:50.962 --> 02:25:54.163]  If your calling is media, fine.
[02:25:54.163 --> 02:25:56.564]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[02:25:56.564 --> 02:26:00.205]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be now.
[02:26:00.205 --> 02:26:00.925]  Now.
[02:26:00.925 --> 02:26:03.326]  Before this country is so completely fractured.
[02:26:03.326 --> 02:26:07.888]  And we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar.
[02:26:07.888 --> 02:26:09.449]  Because that's what we're getting.
[02:26:09.449 --> 02:26:11.189]  She's old and she's sick.
[02:26:11.189 --> 02:26:12.790]  She's not a contender.
[02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:17.011]  They're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live things.
[02:26:17.011 --> 02:26:18.052]  It's like a head on a stick.
[02:26:18.832 --> 02:26:22.976]  And then on the Today Show with the Gun 3, a head on a stick.
[02:26:22.976 --> 02:26:32.064]  She is not a viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300, including the illegals, 380 million Americans.
[02:26:32.064 --> 02:26:35.668]  So the media is trying to put us to sleep.
[02:26:35.668 --> 02:26:36.869]  You're not letting them, Alex.
[02:26:36.869 --> 02:26:38.050]  Let me ask you this question, Matt.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:44.382]  Is the establishment, which we know is diverse, but there's different conglomerates, is it panicking?
[02:26:44.382 --> 02:26:47.984]  Is it trying to push everything through right now because it knows people are waking up?
[02:26:47.984 --> 02:26:49.025]  Or is it just completely...
[02:26:50.228 --> 02:26:51.848]  Arrogant and thinks it's invincible.
[02:26:51.848 --> 02:26:57.070]  It's trying to consolidate control, yes, and there is a sense of panic about it.
[02:26:57.070 --> 02:27:01.111]  You look at a Telemundo or a Univision, they're kind of panicked.
[02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:10.893]  You look at some of these interviews that are happening this election cycle where Trump comes along, says a few things, just a few things, and soars to the top of the list.
[02:27:11.733 --> 02:27:13.114]  That's profound.
[02:27:13.114 --> 02:27:17.816]  Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who were saying a lot.
[02:27:17.816 --> 02:27:20.477]  And I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest.
[02:27:20.477 --> 02:27:24.579]  However, you've got to be dynamic in this atmosphere and it's a media country.
[02:27:24.579 --> 02:27:26.300]  You've got to be dynamic in media.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:28.341]  That's the only thing that's going to work.
[02:27:28.341 --> 02:27:31.903]  So I am left with thinking there's not a lot of time.
[02:27:32.583 --> 02:27:47.012]  To be your greatest self, especially online, because I don't, if it continues to get consolidated to this degree, and then we're moving into the robots, which you're so profound on, and it's going to get really ugly, really fast.
[02:27:47.012 --> 02:27:51.134]  There's already automated news sites, Google News, hello anybody.
[02:27:51.134 --> 02:27:55.257]  They actually, the idiots reading that crap, think there is actually a human there.
[02:27:55.257 --> 02:27:56.958]  There is no human there.
[02:27:57.358 --> 02:28:01.962]  You are being programmed to being automated, even up to your news.
[02:28:01.962 --> 02:28:03.103]  And Apple News?
[02:28:03.103 --> 02:28:04.524]  I don't know what that's about.
[02:28:04.524 --> 02:28:06.146]  That was also creepy.
[02:28:06.146 --> 02:28:10.129]  A same corporate glaze over everything.
[02:28:10.129 --> 02:28:11.490]  I don't see the world that way.
[02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:17.595]  I live in a world that's free, colorful, vibrant, takes chances, bold, stands up to power.
[02:28:17.595 --> 02:28:18.957]  And that's where I've made my success.
[02:28:20.250 --> 02:28:35.019]  Well, very eloquently said, I mean really, if we don't affect the battle space, if we don't get involved in free speech now, that's all you the listeners, all the Drudge fans, fans of freedom, no matter what color you are, no matter what political bent, we're going to lose everything.
[02:28:35.019 --> 02:28:42.883]  We know what totalitarian looks like, we know what oppression looks like, we know what the dumb culture of totalitarianism smells like.
[02:28:42.883 --> 02:28:43.544]  This is it.
[02:28:44.224 --> 02:28:47.967]  It's happening now, and the future of the world is being decided.
[02:28:47.967 --> 02:28:50.630]  So get out there, make your own sites, take action.
[02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:52.811]  Because Matt, you say you'll just go away if they do this.
[02:28:52.811 --> 02:28:54.213]  We all know we're going to fight it.
[02:28:54.213 --> 02:28:55.754]  We know they can't enforce it.
[02:28:55.754 --> 02:28:58.736]  Because if they can say that you can't even put a link up to a new site...
[02:28:59.517 --> 02:29:02.518]  Then that ends free speech and basic communication.
[02:29:02.518 --> 02:29:09.860]  I mean, I know they got the Democrats out openly saying, we need to bring in the Fairness Doctrine to the Internet because of Matt Drudge, because you quote, affect elections.
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:14.122]  Well, you're an American citizen that pays taxes and you're allowed to be pro-gun.
[02:29:14.122 --> 02:29:18.983]  Well, but if they get enough sick people to elect it, the demographics will take care of themselves.
[02:29:18.983 --> 02:29:28.146]  We had a story this morning that they're finally releasing an artist in Cuba who painted Raul and Fidel as a pig, jailed without trial.
[02:29:28.846 --> 02:29:29.886]  For 18 months.
[02:29:29.886 --> 02:29:32.867]  Look at Germany, where they're arresting people that criticize open borders.
[02:29:32.867 --> 02:29:34.768]  Look, you've been... So it's already happening.
[02:29:34.768 --> 02:29:42.990]  I'm just warning this country that, yes, don't get into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook.
[02:29:42.990 --> 02:29:45.411]  No, you're not.
[02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:47.451]  You're a pawn in their scheme.
[02:29:47.451 --> 02:29:47.731]  Stay there.
[02:29:47.731 --> 02:29:49.552]  We gotta come right back for a few more minutes and say bye.
[02:29:49.552 --> 02:29:50.692]  This is incredible.
[02:29:50.692 --> 02:29:53.213]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.213 --> 02:29:55.874]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.926 --> 02:30:08.070]  Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, went on the Morning Joe Show to call for a small surtax to pay for the war against the Islamic State.
[02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:19.495]  Coons said in addition to authorizing Obama's unconstitutional authorization for use of military force, Congress must levy a new tax on Americans to pay for military action against IS.
[02:30:19.495 --> 02:30:19.995]  The U.S.
[02:30:19.995 --> 02:30:25.037]  has spent more than $5 billion on the war against IS since August 2014.
[02:30:25.037 --> 02:30:27.718]  The cost is expected to rise considerably
[02:30:27.938 --> 02:30:32.722]  Now that the Obama Administration has said it will step up the campaign to wipe out the group.
[02:30:32.722 --> 02:30:39.087]  Despite spending billions, the air campaign has failed to weaken the Islamic State, according to intelligence officials.
[02:30:39.087 --> 02:30:51.458]  On Monday, Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who serves as the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said that after 16 months of airstrikes by the U.S., it's had really minimal impact on ISIS.
[02:30:51.458 --> 02:30:55.101]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:07.916]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:32:07.916 --> 02:32:13.838]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[02:32:13.838 --> 02:32:16.959]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:32:16.959 --> 02:32:20.540]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[02:33:12.282 --> 02:33:16.184]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.184 --> 02:33:25.250]  Well, I tell you, a lot of energy entered the building.
[02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:31.814]  There's already a lot of energy in this building.
[02:33:34.461 --> 02:33:36.502]  A lot of smiles with Matt Drudge here.
[02:33:36.502 --> 02:33:40.064]  A don, I guess, went to the door.
[02:33:40.064 --> 02:33:42.605]  And we said don't let strangers in, but it was no stranger.
[02:33:42.605 --> 02:33:45.807]  Matt Drudge here in studio with us.
[02:33:45.807 --> 02:33:47.508]  And characteristically, a very...
[02:33:48.905 --> 02:33:52.348]  Kind of like Peter Pan, hard to catch, hard to find, moves quick.
[02:33:52.348 --> 02:33:55.991]  He is right over there in the dark with a handheld microphone.
[02:33:55.991 --> 02:34:00.815]  Of course, the conspiracy theories will begin that this isn't really Matt Drudge, but people can tell it is Matt Drudge.
[02:34:00.815 --> 02:34:03.818]  I've seen a lot of his speeches, heard him pop in on shows here and there.
[02:34:04.338 --> 02:34:04.398]  Yes.
[02:34:20.862 --> 02:34:23.063]  Then they have to admit Matt Drudge is bigger than ever.
[02:34:23.063 --> 02:34:31.787]  So this attempt to control reality or control who talks to who by these totalitarians that masquerade as liberals, I don't think is working.
[02:34:31.787 --> 02:34:37.649]  And now with Boehner being forced out, I think it shows the rumblings of the Tea Party beneath the surface.
[02:34:37.649 --> 02:34:46.033]  So, Matt, before you leave us, and I really appreciate your time... Oh, and by the way, the presidential candidates, that's exactly what you're saying, the rumblings.
[02:34:46.033 --> 02:34:48.754]  Look at anybody who has any form of success.
[02:34:49.494 --> 02:34:52.757]  In the polls, is because they rumble.
[02:34:52.757 --> 02:34:54.218]  Where it's going to end up, I don't know.
[02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:55.700]  I'm very pessimistic.
[02:34:55.700 --> 02:35:05.629]  I'm very pessimistic on this race, because I'm just not so sure it's not going to end up with the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office, once known as Hillary Clinton.
[02:35:06.289 --> 02:35:07.830]  Who is hypothyroid.
[02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:13.295]  Anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid, you do not elect president, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:13.295 --> 02:35:15.056]  You don't do it.
[02:35:15.056 --> 02:35:24.543]  Now they'll say, well, it has to be who her VP is, whether it's the Castro from San Antonio, or the other Castro from San Antonio, or the other Castro from San Antonio, whoever it's going to be.
[02:35:24.543 --> 02:35:31.529]  I'm just shaking now after seeing NBC giving her endless hours of airtime.
[02:35:32.617 --> 02:35:37.220]  Over the past 72 hours that Hillary's back, and she's back for real.
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:41.602]  Now what that means to you or me, what it means to me, I've got a long history with these people.
[02:35:41.602 --> 02:35:51.728]  They're ugly, they play dirty, they sued me for $30 million last time around, with the approval of the President, announced by the Press Secretary of the White House, a civil action.
[02:35:51.728 --> 02:35:57.272]  These people, and they didn't have the NSA then, they had Echelon, they had all these other things you were talking about even then.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.942]  Hillary Clinton with the NSA?
[02:36:00.942 --> 02:36:03.184]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:03.184 --> 02:36:05.406]  Good luck if you dissent.
[02:36:05.406 --> 02:36:07.488]  Snowden, I'll switch places with you.
[02:36:07.488 --> 02:36:10.890]  You can come over here and rot in hell, because that's what it's going to be.
[02:36:10.890 --> 02:36:20.438]  So I'm very concerned with the lay of the land, but the rumblings you're talking about, that we've seen a Trump, that we've seen a Carly, do we see a Sanders?
[02:36:20.438 --> 02:36:21.339]  Yeah, maybe.
[02:36:21.339 --> 02:36:23.140]  Also old.
[02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:23.821]  Old!
[02:36:23.821 --> 02:36:25.942]  Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70?
[02:36:27.003 --> 02:36:32.088]  What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?
[02:36:32.088 --> 02:36:33.390]  So I don't know.
[02:36:33.390 --> 02:36:35.492]  I'm hoping for surprises.
[02:36:35.492 --> 02:36:37.494]  I'm hoping for some jolts.
[02:36:37.494 --> 02:36:38.095]  We'll have to see.
[02:36:39.278 --> 02:36:43.739]  On a few other subjects, and I appreciate your time, I'll quit bugging you.
[02:36:43.739 --> 02:36:45.719]  There's so much going on in the world.
[02:36:45.719 --> 02:36:49.840]  Obama now is talking about, well, Australia had a good plan, we may have to do that.
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:52.141]  That's clearly talking about gun confiscation.
[02:36:52.141 --> 02:36:53.641]  Now Hillary's doing it.
[02:36:53.641 --> 02:36:56.582]  CNN has pundits just saying, let's just take them.
[02:36:56.582 --> 02:37:00.183]  Do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the Alamo?
[02:37:00.183 --> 02:37:05.204]  If they really come out in a frontal assault on guns, it means I think they're trying to start a civil war.
[02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:07.641]  It just seems like insanity.
[02:37:07.641 --> 02:37:11.425]  I mean, they may think that they're Stalin or something.
[02:37:11.425 --> 02:37:17.511]  Well, because they're all armed themselves, or they all have that security around them themselves.
[02:37:17.511 --> 02:37:19.293]  They don't have to worry about it.
[02:37:19.293 --> 02:37:22.135]  I challenge Hillary, take away your Secret Service.
[02:37:22.915 --> 02:37:24.657]  Take it away now!
[02:37:24.657 --> 02:37:26.258]  Take away your Secret Service!
[02:37:26.258 --> 02:37:27.580]  Dismiss them!
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:29.161]  Have no security around you!
[02:37:29.161 --> 02:37:30.943]  Have no guns around you, Hillary!
[02:37:30.943 --> 02:37:31.704]  I dare you!
[02:37:31.704 --> 02:37:33.165]  I dare you!
[02:37:33.165 --> 02:37:34.747]  Obama, same thing!
[02:37:34.747 --> 02:37:36.789]  Drop your guns, Obama!
[02:37:36.789 --> 02:37:38.671]  Take your Secret Service away, Obama!
[02:37:39.625 --> 02:37:40.906]  Take it all away.
[02:37:40.906 --> 02:37:43.169]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[02:37:43.169 --> 02:37:46.192]  Let everybody know there's no guns on the White House grounds, Obama.
[02:37:46.192 --> 02:37:49.035]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[02:37:49.035 --> 02:37:51.918]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.
[02:37:51.918 --> 02:37:52.899]  So they're asking us!
[02:37:53.786 --> 02:37:59.308]  To drop our guns and to drop our security measures or what?
[02:37:59.308 --> 02:38:05.951]  So this thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously except for the sick voter.
[02:38:05.951 --> 02:38:08.933]  You can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now.
[02:38:08.933 --> 02:38:10.373]  They're really sick.
[02:38:10.373 --> 02:38:15.055]  And that's to me, I'm more angry at the sick Americans than I am at Obama or Hillary.
[02:38:15.055 --> 02:38:16.576]  I'm really angry at the sick Americans.
[02:38:17.304 --> 02:38:23.946]  Matt Drudge, I used to listen to your radio show almost every Sunday, but I gotta tell you, you are even more on fire than you were then.
[02:38:23.946 --> 02:38:30.228]  And I know you're smart, you know not to be, you know, you know, too available, because distance makes the heart grow fond.
[02:38:30.228 --> 02:38:42.712]  And I tell you, but it would be great if even once a week you did like an hour podcast or something, or maybe once a month with these thoughts, because let me tell you, this is some really good radio, and I'm enjoying it, and I know the audience is.
[02:38:42.712 --> 02:38:45.933]  I mean, Matt Drudge is kind of co-hosting the Alex Jones Show right now.
[02:38:45.933 --> 02:38:46.573]  This is crazy!
[02:38:47.259 --> 02:38:49.860]  Well, maybe I'll join Facebook.
[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:51.981]  Oh yeah, don't do that.
[02:38:51.981 --> 02:38:53.181]  No, I can't.
[02:38:53.181 --> 02:38:58.023]  I realize that just my personality is I've got to stay focused.
[02:38:58.023 --> 02:39:00.044]  I can't be too distracted.
[02:39:00.044 --> 02:39:03.685]  Your advice to me was right, you know, like a year ago, that don't try to do too much.
[02:39:03.685 --> 02:39:04.586]  I mean, you're right.
[02:39:04.586 --> 02:39:08.067]  Paul Joseph Watson, I told him, watch out for this.
[02:39:08.067 --> 02:39:15.250]  You know, it's a larger topic, but at my height of media availability, I was doing the website
[02:39:16.212 --> 02:39:20.996]  The TV show and the radio show at the same time, as you are doing now.
[02:39:20.996 --> 02:39:23.598]  As you are doing now.
[02:39:23.598 --> 02:39:28.622]  Mine was with the corporations, Clear Channel, News Corp, and then the Drudge Report.
[02:39:28.622 --> 02:39:38.369]  But still, I felt just myself, I felt it was just more powerful to go to the web, plus not to necessarily be playing in their playground.
[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:45.132]  Because the power of the individual, as you represent sitting there right now, is powerful.
[02:39:45.132 --> 02:39:45.732]  To the heart.
[02:39:45.732 --> 02:39:53.354]  I said to Paul Joseph Watson when I saw him in London, which you just referred to a year ago, you're a romantic figure, Alex, in Americana.
[02:39:53.354 --> 02:39:55.735]  It's romantic what you do here every day.
[02:39:55.735 --> 02:39:56.595]  It just is.
[02:39:56.595 --> 02:39:57.795]  This is romance.
[02:39:57.795 --> 02:40:02.937]  Because you're an American standing up, tough, facing these headwinds.
[02:40:02.937 --> 02:40:03.877]  Wow, are they blowing.
[02:40:04.417 --> 02:40:05.178]  But you're there.
[02:40:05.178 --> 02:40:07.319]  And you're not alone.
[02:40:07.319 --> 02:40:10.381]  Limbaugh, Savage, Hannity, Levin.
[02:40:10.381 --> 02:40:13.003]  There's a lot of people on the airwaves who are as brave.
[02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:14.284]  They are brave.
[02:40:14.284 --> 02:40:15.145]  And they are living it.
[02:40:15.145 --> 02:40:15.765]  I've met them all.
[02:40:15.765 --> 02:40:17.406]  I'm friends with them all.
[02:40:17.406 --> 02:40:18.227]  They are...
[02:40:20.228 --> 02:40:25.913]  Also, operating against the grain in an America that needs to go back to that.
[02:40:25.913 --> 02:40:28.496]  Well, the system's tried to put some of them in jail.
[02:40:28.496 --> 02:40:30.918]  I mean, I know a lot of those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[02:40:30.918 --> 02:40:31.418]  I don't either.
[02:40:31.418 --> 02:40:34.941]  But, you know, these people play hardball.
[02:40:34.941 --> 02:40:36.483]  And some folks can say they're libertarians.
[02:40:36.483 --> 02:40:38.545]  Well, those folks don't sound libertarian enough to me.
[02:40:38.545 --> 02:40:39.626]  It doesn't matter.
[02:40:39.626 --> 02:40:42.008]  The globalists, the Democrats, the collectivists,
[02:40:42.108 --> 02:40:46.072]  I hate anybody who's conservative, anybody who believes in the individual.
[02:40:46.072 --> 02:40:52.178]  And the fact is, those people promote individualism, nationalism, and that's why they've got to be eradicated.
[02:40:52.178 --> 02:40:54.420]  What a horrible world if the system is successful.
[02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:57.303]  Matt Drudge, in your gut, in your heart, do you think...
[02:40:58.174 --> 02:41:01.596]  That humanity's gonna be successful and make it the next hundred years.
[02:41:01.596 --> 02:41:02.777]  Oh, the hundred years?
[02:41:02.777 --> 02:41:05.658]  Well, of course, unless Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:05.658 --> 02:41:09.300]  You know, I'm a big fan of letting Mother Nature decide some of this, too.
[02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:11.481]  You know, we can't control a lot of this.
[02:41:11.481 --> 02:41:13.702]  There is a law to the universe.
[02:41:13.702 --> 02:41:15.143]  There just is.
[02:41:15.143 --> 02:41:16.324]  There's just a law to the universe.
[02:41:16.324 --> 02:41:18.845]  We could have the San Andreas ripped tonight.
[02:41:18.845 --> 02:41:19.786]  You had nothing to do with that.
[02:41:20.586 --> 02:41:26.434]  We could have had that super hurricane that, look what they did to South Carolina, two or three hundred miles offshore.
[02:41:26.434 --> 02:41:30.720]  Imagine if a Category 5 eyewall went right up the Chesapeake Bay.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.302]  They could say, well, mankind did that.
[02:41:32.302 --> 02:41:33.925]  No, Mother Nature decides.
[02:41:33.925 --> 02:41:34.986]  So will we survive?
[02:41:34.986 --> 02:41:35.687]  I'm sure we will.
[02:41:35.687 --> 02:41:36.628]  What will we be?
[02:41:38.757 --> 02:41:40.938]  Not allowed to speak as we are today?
[02:41:40.938 --> 02:41:44.859]  Well, we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once.
[02:41:44.859 --> 02:41:46.739]  So, I... I don't know.
[02:41:46.739 --> 02:41:48.360]  Am I optimistic for myself?
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:49.280]  Personally, yes.
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:50.361]  I'm strong.
[02:41:50.361 --> 02:41:51.481]  There's not much they can do.
[02:41:51.481 --> 02:41:52.621]  They could laser beam me.
[02:41:52.621 --> 02:41:53.482]  They could drone me.
[02:41:53.482 --> 02:41:55.102]  They can plutonium me.
[02:41:55.102 --> 02:41:57.483]  They could do whatever they wanted, but spiritually, I'm set.
[02:41:58.143 --> 02:41:59.384]  I've already got it.
[02:41:59.384 --> 02:42:00.884]  So they can't do much.
[02:42:00.884 --> 02:42:07.387]  I just wish there was more media that was trailblazing and independent.
[02:42:07.387 --> 02:42:20.672]  And this to me is a big danger right now in this setup is you've got these corporations like the New York Times and the Amazon now with the Washington Post and Time Warner and all of them seem to be the same.
[02:42:21.892 --> 02:42:33.459]  This is what's frightening and there's so much news in the course of the day and the reason I think the Drudge Report is interesting every morning is it's not exactly the same as you would see.
[02:42:34.614 --> 02:42:38.216]  Elsewhere and that's because I'm not involved with other people.
[02:42:38.216 --> 02:42:53.987]  I'm looking at the world through my eyes and that's what you're seeing with bravery and with the ability to do it because the ability to do it what you've created here with one listener one day that went to 10 listeners that went to 50 to now your millions.
[02:42:54.747 --> 02:42:58.350]  Was organically grown, and that's kind of how Earth proceeds.
[02:42:58.350 --> 02:43:01.273]  And it usually takes time, you're absolutely right.
[02:43:01.273 --> 02:43:13.083]  Looking at the open announcements by the Pope for world government, carbon taxes, looking for Obama announcing similar things, they've gone from denying this planetary system is being set up to now admitting it.
[02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:17.748]  We've got all these key meetings, TPP being agreed on just a few days ago.
[02:43:19.618 --> 02:43:23.800]  How is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening?
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:28.642]  How are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition?
[02:43:28.642 --> 02:43:31.883]  I've been traveling a lot and I'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere.
[02:43:31.883 --> 02:43:33.944]  A lot of sad desperation.
[02:43:33.944 --> 02:43:40.246]  I was just in an airport and even down to this, a woman selling Southwest Airlines credit cards, standing like a robot.
[02:43:40.686 --> 02:43:42.287]  Have you signed up yet?
[02:43:42.287 --> 02:43:43.908]  Are you a member of the club?
[02:43:43.908 --> 02:43:44.629]  It was tragic.
[02:43:44.629 --> 02:43:49.872]  This is a mature woman with a beautiful face and life and I'm like, how did she get there?
[02:43:49.872 --> 02:43:53.255]  What has happened to this culture that she's now standing as a robot like this?
[02:43:53.255 --> 02:44:00.279]  They are sucking our ability to make an income that is compatible with what you need to.
[02:44:00.279 --> 02:44:02.341]  So I'm getting a little frightened as I travel.
[02:44:03.121 --> 02:44:08.208]  On the other side of it, when I go to New York and I see some of the billionaires, it's the other side!
[02:44:08.208 --> 02:44:09.689]  Endless!
[02:44:09.689 --> 02:44:12.453]  You know, they're fighting over pieces of artwork.
[02:44:12.453 --> 02:44:16.999]  It's gotten to the point where the have and the have-nots here is breaking.
[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:25.463]  And it's the billionaires that are mainly funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in corporate welfare and insider deals.
[02:44:25.463 --> 02:44:27.384]  It's so sick.
[02:44:27.384 --> 02:44:28.444]  I watched a great film.
[02:44:28.444 --> 02:44:33.406]  I don't know if you've seen it yet, but it's The Best of Enemies about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley.
[02:44:33.406 --> 02:44:34.026]  Have you seen that yet?
[02:44:34.026 --> 02:44:34.406]  No.
[02:44:34.406 --> 02:44:35.026]  You've got to see it.
[02:44:36.867 --> 02:44:44.051]  It shows Gore Vidal arguing, saying the answer is... Oh, and by the way, why are we not allowed to have a Gore Vidal-William Buckley anymore in the media scene?
[02:44:44.051 --> 02:44:45.611]  Do you see who they hire?
[02:44:45.611 --> 02:44:48.013]  Do you see who's hired for the shows?
[02:44:48.013 --> 02:44:48.993]  How dull they are?
[02:44:48.993 --> 02:44:49.733]  Yes.
[02:44:49.733 --> 02:44:50.574]  Dull!
[02:44:50.574 --> 02:44:51.314]  Dull as dishwater.
[02:44:51.314 --> 02:44:52.955]  They want you to tune out of politics in an
[02:44:53.475 --> 02:44:54.216]  Yes!
[02:44:54.216 --> 02:44:57.197]  Where are the flamboyant characters?
[02:44:57.197 --> 02:44:59.658]  This is what America desperately needs right now.
[02:44:59.658 --> 02:45:05.081]  Flamboyant intellectual characters who can cut different ways.
[02:45:05.081 --> 02:45:06.341]  And that's just what I'm missing.
[02:45:06.341 --> 02:45:10.984]  I've been fortunate enough to meet some of the greats of this generation and I've got to tell you they are there.
[02:45:11.704 --> 02:45:18.489]  It's just they are suppressed and hidden, and they're not hired the way Gore Vidal and Buckley were back a previous generation.
[02:45:18.489 --> 02:45:20.370]  They were not afraid of ideas.
[02:45:20.370 --> 02:45:25.313]  This generation is frightened of ideas, or at least it's being suppressed.
[02:45:25.313 --> 02:45:26.954]  Let's throw in in the few minutes we have left.
[02:45:26.954 --> 02:45:29.796]  We're about to go to break, and I know you've given us more time than you even said you would.
[02:45:29.796 --> 02:45:36.400]  Matt Drudge is our guest, DrudgeReport.com, obviously in studio here in Austin, Texas, visiting a surprise visit, one of the best ever.
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.262]  That's better than surprise birthday parties I've had.
[02:45:39.853 --> 02:45:40.693]  Fifteen years.
[02:45:40.693 --> 02:45:51.355]  I don't think that Putin is this great angel or this wonderful, perfect person, but our foreign policy is so corrupt, so deceptive, it makes him look good, and nobody's going to back Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:51.355 --> 02:46:08.559]  I talked about this last Thursday and Friday, and I'll find the article and we'll put it in this video later and put it out as a report, but it was Reuters reporting that the White House is angry that these airstrikes by the Russians have hit the moderates, al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:09.680]  Yes.
[02:46:27.566 --> 02:46:36.611]  That we'll just sit there and write articles about how Al-Qaeda is moderate and not bad, and then we criticize Russia for bombing them when they're attacking Russian interests.
[02:46:36.611 --> 02:46:38.692]  It's just so bizarre.
[02:46:38.692 --> 02:46:42.694]  It seems like that Karl Rove quote where he said, we control reality.
[02:46:42.694 --> 02:46:45.515]  I don't think Obama and these guys really control reality.
[02:46:45.515 --> 02:46:51.038]  And now we've got John McCain saying, let's go ahead and end Zbigniew Brzezinski and have war with Russia.
[02:46:51.038 --> 02:46:53.139]  Let's go ahead and attack the Russian aircraft.
[02:46:53.439 --> 02:46:54.900]  I mean, it's crazy town!
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:55.640]  What do you say to that?
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:56.821]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:46:56.821 --> 02:47:01.963]  We never even heard of ISIS until recently, and I remember when that name first started coming up.
[02:47:01.963 --> 02:47:05.345]  Do you know it was designed to be confused with Daryl Issa?
[02:47:05.345 --> 02:47:06.365]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:47:06.365 --> 02:47:07.846]  Did you know that's what it was?
[02:47:07.846 --> 02:47:11.207]  Because Daryl Issa was the enemy at the time of this administration.
[02:47:11.207 --> 02:47:14.009]  You know, there would have been a time Obama could have been impeached.
[02:47:14.009 --> 02:47:16.009]  And I'm thinking the IRS scandal, most likely.
[02:47:16.009 --> 02:47:16.690]  That would have been the one.
[02:47:17.455 --> 02:47:25.081]  You get the depositions going, you get the president under oath, you follow the chain, Obama most likely would have been impeached.
[02:47:25.081 --> 02:47:29.545]  Boehner decided, we're not going there, we're not going to have those cities burn.
[02:47:29.545 --> 02:47:30.546]  We're not going to do it.
[02:47:30.546 --> 02:47:32.767]  We're not going to impeach Obama.
[02:47:32.767 --> 02:47:36.270]  So, I felt Daryl Issa, that's his name, right?
[02:47:36.270 --> 02:47:37.151]  Issa, Daryl Issa.
[02:47:40.533 --> 02:47:46.160]  I think they came up with the name ISIS to be confused with Daryl Issa.
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:47.882]  I'm really being honest with you.
[02:47:47.882 --> 02:47:53.769]  I remember when the first time Christiane Amanpour sputtered out this word ISIS.
[02:47:53.769 --> 02:47:55.190]  Where did she get that one?
[02:47:55.931 --> 02:47:57.974]  You know, these words are creative.
[02:47:57.974 --> 02:47:59.055]  These events are creative.
[02:47:59.055 --> 02:48:02.159]  Now we act like, oh, ISIS has been around for 20 or 30 years.
[02:48:02.159 --> 02:48:02.619]  Says who?
[02:48:02.619 --> 02:48:04.021]  It's been around a year and a half.
[02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:04.522]  Yeah.
[02:48:04.522 --> 02:48:06.685]  Designed to confuse.
[02:48:06.685 --> 02:48:10.489]  And then the president going, it's not even ISIS, it's ISIL.
[02:48:10.489 --> 02:48:11.370]  Or ice.
[02:48:11.370 --> 02:48:12.251]  Or isl.
[02:48:12.251 --> 02:48:12.792]  Or is.
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.402]  This is Dr. Seuss!
[02:48:15.402 --> 02:48:16.263]  This is madness!
[02:48:16.263 --> 02:48:22.470]  I'm glad you're able to follow any of it, because when I sit down and look at the news, I'm not able to follow the bouncing ball.
[02:48:22.470 --> 02:48:23.331]  Is Putin here?
[02:48:23.331 --> 02:48:24.512]  Is Obama here?
[02:48:24.512 --> 02:48:25.493]  Where does this one go?
[02:48:25.493 --> 02:48:26.875]  I can't follow.
[02:48:26.875 --> 02:48:28.076]  Can you put the pieces together?
[02:48:28.076 --> 02:48:29.398]  I'm glad you can, because I can't.
[02:48:30.836 --> 02:48:31.256]  Wow.
[02:48:31.256 --> 02:48:35.298]  Well, we're going to break here in about a minute and a half, and then I'm going to come back and play a special report.
[02:48:35.298 --> 02:48:38.219]  They're going to go into the fourth hour, being hosted by one of our co-hosts today.
[02:48:38.219 --> 02:48:41.760]  But, Matt, in the two minutes we've got left, it's amazing to have you here.
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:44.241]  What else do you think is front and center in the universe?
[02:48:44.241 --> 02:48:54.846]  In the last two minutes here, what do you want to say to the audience and to the dinosaur media that is going to gleefully try to edit this and chop this up and, I guess, use it for their funeral pyre?
[02:48:55.606 --> 02:48:56.788]  Well, they're welcome to again.
[02:48:56.788 --> 02:48:58.912]  They've got no control over the situation.
[02:48:58.912 --> 02:48:59.713]  None.
[02:48:59.713 --> 02:49:00.534]  No control.
[02:49:00.534 --> 02:49:01.456]  No control over me.
[02:49:01.456 --> 02:49:02.277]  Sorry.
[02:49:02.277 --> 02:49:03.639]  Zero.
[02:49:03.639 --> 02:49:05.142]  I wanted to congratulate you.
[02:49:05.142 --> 02:49:07.105]  You're one of the... and people don't really talk about this.
[02:49:07.105 --> 02:49:09.028]  You are one of the first to stream 24 hours a day.
[02:49:10.851 --> 02:49:16.855]  And I think the reason I was drawn into InfoWars was because of the streaming.
[02:49:16.855 --> 02:49:29.503]  This is a profound break that you did to allow the audience to hear you at any time, to make it available at any time, from anywhere, looping, looping, looping, until the next broadcast.
[02:49:29.503 --> 02:49:30.984]  This is a profound thing you did.
[02:49:30.984 --> 02:49:33.045]  I don't think that's recognized enough in the industry.
[02:49:33.045 --> 02:49:36.367]  I'm just talking shop talk here for a second.
[02:49:36.367 --> 02:49:36.948]  That was big.
[02:49:37.788 --> 02:49:45.034]  Because what you're seeing with the AM dial now, and I'm not besmirching any stations that are carrying this right now, but some of these ratings are frightening.
[02:49:45.034 --> 02:49:47.435]  Some of these ratings in these major cities are frightening.
[02:49:47.435 --> 02:49:53.400]  I'm talking about half the listeners, generally overall, for every talk host.
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:56.702]  Some of them are down a half, a half in one year.
[02:49:57.543 --> 02:50:03.808]  Something is going on, but you broke through with this 24-hour looping, always available.
[02:50:03.808 --> 02:50:09.852]  On my happiest nights, I'm sitting here and I'm listening to you from wherever I am in the world.
[02:50:09.852 --> 02:50:10.993]  Looping.
[02:50:10.993 --> 02:50:12.314]  Getting it, getting it, getting it.
[02:50:12.314 --> 02:50:13.635]  And the guests.
[02:50:13.635 --> 02:50:15.196]  This is a profound shift.
[02:50:15.196 --> 02:50:17.238]  Available anytime, from anywhere.
[02:50:17.238 --> 02:50:18.278]  That was you, Alex.
[02:50:18.278 --> 02:50:18.799]  That was a big one.
[02:50:18.799 --> 02:50:19.840]  That was like 12 years ago.
[02:50:20.876 --> 02:50:28.020]  I said, why don't we just send the stream out once, and then wait for a podcast to come up before they even called it podcast, which is an MP3.
[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:29.901]  So organically again.
[02:50:29.901 --> 02:50:34.563]  Yet again, another organically grown decision that changed the media landscape.
[02:50:36.204 --> 02:50:44.412]  I don't want to just have, because I was one of the first, people were doing this 20 years ago, Limbaugh was probably the first, with a little, you know, pod cam, took a photo every minute or something.
[02:50:44.412 --> 02:50:53.361]  I said, why don't we just put cameras in here so I can show people articles, show them photos, show them books, and even show them video clips, and then we'll start streaming it.
[02:50:53.361 --> 02:50:57.325]  And by the way, Limbaugh was genius for doing that because he bypassed broadcast.
[02:50:57.705 --> 02:51:01.530]  He didn't have to hook up with a Fox or CNN to show him in real time.
[02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:02.891]  He was able to bypass that.
[02:51:02.891 --> 02:51:05.715]  And I think there was some cams for radio shows before that.
[02:51:05.715 --> 02:51:06.015]  Sure.
[02:51:06.015 --> 02:51:07.417]  But he did it on the larger scale.
[02:51:07.417 --> 02:51:12.943]  But what you did by breaking the mold, by breaking the mold, whatever you said that day, like, why don't we loop it?
[02:51:13.789 --> 02:51:15.771]  I can't tell you how that's changed.
[02:51:15.771 --> 02:51:28.902]  I would say the majority of your listeners are, have, and will discover you through the looping and the broadcast, because now we can drive around and listen to you without the streaming, even though it seems like the streaming is where things are going.
[02:51:28.902 --> 02:51:31.505]  I gotta say, when you broke the egg there,
[02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:34.463]  When you cracked the egg, that was a big one.
[02:51:34.463 --> 02:51:37.605]  That was a Stanley Kubrick moment of the bone going up.
[02:51:37.605 --> 02:51:38.546]  What you did with that one.
[02:51:38.546 --> 02:51:39.066]  So that was a big one.
[02:51:39.066 --> 02:51:54.497]  Well, I don't think it's as big as the bones you've been throwing up that turned into the spaceships, but I tell you, it's amazing to just have the diverse audience that tunes in to hear me babble, speak of the devil, like people like Stanley Kubrick's daughter and folks that have popped up too, and you're like, you check it out and go, this is really Stanley Kubrick's daughter that helped make some of his films.
[02:51:54.497 --> 02:51:55.118]  It just blows your mind.
[02:51:55.118 --> 02:51:57.960]  Oh, and by the way, if Stanley Kubrick was alive, can you imagine?
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:51:59.201]  Can you imagine where he would have gone?
[02:51:59.901 --> 02:52:01.082]  He would have done some great work.
[02:52:01.082 --> 02:52:01.422]  Oh.
[02:52:01.422 --> 02:52:03.583]  We're missing the Hollywood push, too.
[02:52:03.583 --> 02:52:05.144]  Where's the greatness coming out of Hollywood?
[02:52:05.144 --> 02:52:05.924]  They want it dumbed down.
[02:52:05.924 --> 02:52:08.625]  I've talked to top Hollywood... Enough of the Martian crap.
[02:52:08.625 --> 02:52:09.446]  Tell us something.
[02:52:09.446 --> 02:52:11.927]  Tell us something big and real and profound, as Kubrick would have.
[02:52:11.927 --> 02:52:12.948]  On a human level.
[02:52:12.948 --> 02:52:13.528]  On a human level.
[02:52:14.349 --> 02:52:20.690]  Well, I'm not allowed to say what I was told about Kubrick, but let me say, it was obvious from his films, he would be on board with us.
[02:52:20.690 --> 02:52:23.951]  You know, Spielberg keeps going back to World War II.
[02:52:23.951 --> 02:52:26.372]  I mean, enough already.
[02:52:26.372 --> 02:52:27.272]  Let's get focused.
[02:52:27.272 --> 02:52:28.152]  I look at a P.T.
[02:52:28.152 --> 02:52:32.273]  Anderson, and I don't know, it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me.
[02:52:32.273 --> 02:52:35.794]  Where are the artists who are challenging this generation like Kubrick did?
[02:52:35.794 --> 02:52:37.594]  So, that's another topic separately.
[02:52:37.594 --> 02:52:38.914]  Well, we're going to break in one minute.
[02:52:38.914 --> 02:52:42.215]  We're going to hear John Bowne's report, come back, and who's hosting the fourth hour today?
[02:52:44.249 --> 02:52:54.215]  Thunderstruck that David Knight's got a bunch coming up, and obviously we need to get clips of this epic interview, play those, and put those out on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:54.215 --> 02:52:56.896]  Matt, how fast do you think... Here's what's crazy.
[02:52:56.896 --> 02:53:01.259]  Five years ago I cared if mainstream media wrote stories against us, or I cared if I was on Nightline or something.
[02:53:01.259 --> 02:53:02.900]  You've been in more big stuff than I have.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:05.762]  Now it doesn't even do anything when I'm on those shows.
[02:53:05.762 --> 02:53:09.864]  That's why I know that they don't mean anything, and so we should end with this.
[02:53:09.864 --> 02:53:10.565]  You were the guy
[02:53:11.499 --> 02:53:19.648]  Who tweeted, at least from what I saw, at Piers Morgan three years ago, or two and a half years ago, to say, have Alex Jones on, debate him.
[02:53:19.648 --> 02:53:20.229]  Matchmaker.
[02:53:20.229 --> 02:53:24.734]  Yeah, behind the scenes, people don't know this about me, I'm a matchmaker behind the scenes.
[02:53:24.734 --> 02:53:29.279]  That I've had the ability to make some deals happen and do some things behind the scenes.
[02:53:29.279 --> 02:53:32.903]  Now, I've never met Piers Morgan, but I do believe that tweet that day did lead to that.
[02:53:33.063 --> 02:53:33.343]  You're right.
[02:53:33.343 --> 02:53:42.351]  Well, no, they told me in his office, they said, what do you think of Matt Drudge's idea, because they got my cell phone number and called me, because CNN had it, and I said... Which ended up being the most dramatic moment on CNN in a generation.
[02:53:42.351 --> 02:53:43.652]  They admit that.
[02:53:43.652 --> 02:53:44.994]  They have votes and say that.
[02:53:44.994 --> 02:53:49.137]  That's why they need to hire people away from 6th Avenue just to look at the scene.
[02:53:49.137 --> 02:53:53.061]  I remember once saying to Charlie Rose, why don't you have more conservatives on?
[02:53:53.061 --> 02:53:54.522]  And he says, who?
[02:53:54.522 --> 02:53:56.004]  And, you know, there's a whole list of them.
[02:53:56.704 --> 02:53:58.325]  Why are they limiting themselves?
[02:53:58.325 --> 02:54:02.906]  Because you would say it's a, you know, it's a contrived plan to limit.
[02:54:02.906 --> 02:54:11.149]  But I still think to make provocative programming, you've got to have different points of view, a la the Buckley and Vidal, Gore Vidal.
[02:54:11.149 --> 02:54:13.450]  Where is that in this culture?
[02:54:13.450 --> 02:54:14.110]  It's missing.
[02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:15.870]  I get it from Infowars.
[02:54:15.870 --> 02:54:18.151]  I get it from other places too, mainly talk radio.
[02:54:18.151 --> 02:54:23.173]  Talk radio seems to be the driving force of this culture, at least in spoken word.
[02:54:23.173 --> 02:54:25.214]  I'm not getting it from television that much.
[02:54:25.214 --> 02:54:25.834]  I'm just not.
[02:54:26.614 --> 02:54:28.836]  Where are the intriguing television shows?
[02:54:28.836 --> 02:54:32.078]  I mean, you could say Homeland, you can say some of these others.
[02:54:32.078 --> 02:54:33.600]  Okay, yes.
[02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:36.042]  But where are the real dynamic things that are pushing?
[02:54:36.042 --> 02:54:37.723]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:54:37.723 --> 02:54:42.467]  Piers Morgan had a ratings boost for about 30-40% for two weeks after that.
[02:54:42.467 --> 02:54:45.769]  Then it went down, steadily declined, and they got rid of him.
[02:54:45.769 --> 02:54:47.470]  CNN knows that if they
[02:54:48.251 --> 02:54:50.292]  Well, it all depends if the sick Americans get un-sick.
[02:54:50.292 --> 02:54:50.933]  That's all.
[02:54:50.933 --> 02:54:53.315]  That's all you just have to do because if you get well, if you get well,
[02:55:11.906 --> 02:55:14.930]  You're not that interested in what Anderson Cooper is saying about things.
[02:55:14.930 --> 02:55:15.991]  You're just not, I'm sorry.
[02:55:15.991 --> 02:55:16.271]  Incredible.
[02:55:16.271 --> 02:55:17.693]  I don't mean to be insulting.
[02:55:17.693 --> 02:55:20.536]  If you're sick, you find comfort in that.
[02:55:20.536 --> 02:55:23.299]  What are your final words?
[02:55:23.299 --> 02:55:25.362]  What are your final words?
[02:55:25.362 --> 02:55:27.344]  These are the last words ever spoken on Earth?
[02:55:27.344 --> 02:55:28.425]  These are the final words?
[02:55:28.425 --> 02:55:30.207]  Yes, George Washington says tis well.
[02:55:31.364 --> 02:55:36.167]  Well, again, I just wanted to come to congratulate you from building organically from the ground up.
[02:55:36.167 --> 02:55:37.807]  Thank you.
[02:55:37.807 --> 02:55:40.569]  A media that is not only American, it's just Western.
[02:55:40.569 --> 02:55:42.530]  It's not even Western, it's just freedom.
[02:55:42.530 --> 02:55:49.733]  I can imagine somebody right now listening to us who's sitting in a prison cell somewhere, somewhere awful, thinking about freedom.
[02:55:49.733 --> 02:55:51.354]  So, congratulations to you.
[02:55:51.354 --> 02:55:52.414]  I have more power to you.
[02:55:52.414 --> 02:55:53.235]  Take care of yourself.
[02:55:53.973 --> 02:55:55.994]  Because, you know, you're the vehicle, too.
[02:55:55.994 --> 02:55:56.994]  Well, I'm speechless.
[02:55:56.994 --> 02:55:58.874]  Matt Drudge, I can't go on.
[02:55:58.874 --> 02:55:59.915]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:55:59.915 --> 02:56:01.015]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:56:01.015 --> 02:56:02.716]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[02:56:02.716 --> 02:56:03.196]  to 2 p.m.
[02:56:03.196 --> 02:56:03.936]  Central.
[02:56:03.936 --> 02:56:08.737]  A fourth hour coming up as we move into the Overdrive Show and Nightly News tonight at 7.
[02:56:08.737 --> 02:56:12.999]  But we're going to go ahead and go to this John Bowne report and then come back with the fourth hour.
[02:56:12.999 --> 02:56:18.640]  Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[02:56:22.466 --> 02:56:25.769]  There's been another mass shooting in America.
[02:56:25.769 --> 02:56:30.993]  This time in a community college in Oregon.
[02:56:30.993 --> 02:56:41.522]  That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:43.644]  That means there's another community stunned with grief.
[02:56:44.933 --> 02:57:01.367]  And communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.
[02:57:01.367 --> 02:57:10.414]  We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.
[02:57:10.414 --> 02:57:13.377]  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict
[02:57:14.693 --> 02:57:17.615]  Harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.
[02:57:44.773 --> 02:57:49.376]  In contrast, about half, 51% of other adults say this.
[02:57:49.376 --> 02:57:54.919]  There exists a constitutional mindset and reason for owning a weapon in the United States.
[02:57:54.919 --> 02:58:02.583]  The United States ranks numero uno in gun ownership, dominating at 88.8% per 100 residents.
[02:58:02.583 --> 02:58:07.306]  According to 2014 numbers from the Small Arms Survey based in Geneva, Switzerland,
[02:58:07.626 --> 02:58:08.487]  We're good to go.
[02:58:22.637 --> 02:58:26.859]  We as a nation require an order for our republic to operate.
[02:58:26.859 --> 02:58:29.740]  And the media spin on the coverage is always the same.
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:32.022]  Who cares who the shooter was in Oregon?
[02:58:32.022 --> 02:58:33.002]  Why should we?
[02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:42.867]  Our immediate and only reality-based concerns should be for the families and communities that need to be protected by the next incident, whether it's three months or three years from now.
[02:58:42.867 --> 02:58:45.348]  If we could just all pay attention to the numbers.
[02:58:48.314 --> 02:58:51.836]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:51.836 --> 02:59:00.079]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:00.079 --> 02:59:05.501]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:05.501 --> 02:59:08.022]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:08.022 --> 02:59:10.143]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:19.301]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:19.301 --> 02:59:21.501]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:21.501 --> 02:59:26.484]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:26.484 --> 02:59:29.785]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:29.785 --> 02:59:33.267]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:33.267 --> 02:59:35.248]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:35.248 --> 02:59:37.348]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:37.348 --> 02:59:39.349]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:44.952]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.453 --> 03:00:01.101]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.101 --> 03:00:11.568]  It's 2am, and when the hitman comes, he knows that he's been cheated, that he's killing himself and his whole family.
[03:00:11.568 --> 03:00:13.910]  ...war on corruption.
[03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:19.054]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:21.459 --> 03:00:24.701]  It's easy to serve evil.
[03:00:24.701 --> 03:00:27.962]  It's easy to worship that twisted flame.
[03:00:27.962 --> 03:00:29.343]  It's easy to bow at that altar.
[03:00:29.343 --> 03:00:32.824]  It's hard to give life.
[03:00:32.824 --> 03:00:35.386]  It's hard to lay down your life.
[03:00:35.386 --> 03:00:39.047]  It's hard to stand up against the criticism.
[03:00:39.047 --> 03:00:41.749]  Until you step across that line.
[03:00:41.749 --> 03:00:44.010]  Then you know it was all an illusion.
[03:00:44.010 --> 03:00:46.611]  All a fraud.
[03:00:46.611 --> 03:00:48.472]  You've now stepped out of the domain of this world.
[03:00:50.262 --> 03:01:01.947]  You realize what a sick joke it is that humanity could have been free anytime they made the conscious decision to do so.
[03:01:01.947 --> 03:01:06.368]  When the bullet hits the bone!
[03:01:06.368 --> 03:01:07.809]  Alright, Kit Daniels wants to pop in.
[03:01:07.809 --> 03:01:09.870]  I want to get Matt to pop in.
[03:01:11.085 --> 03:01:16.629]  Uh, with their points, they were making these points during the break and I just basically came in and repeated their points and said, hey, you tell them what you said and then I've said it.
[03:01:16.629 --> 03:01:21.251]  Uh, but this is really revealing the mark of the beast, how it's going to work.
[03:01:21.251 --> 03:01:24.974]  Everybody always knew this, a digital number, your face print, your thumb print.
[03:01:24.974 --> 03:01:30.597]  It's your social media that if you don't behave and do what they say, you don't get the mark.
[03:01:30.597 --> 03:01:31.998]  I mean, this is it.
[03:01:31.998 --> 03:01:36.281]  The China globalist model, Zuckerberg's rolling it out the whole nine yards.
[03:01:38.626 --> 03:01:41.208]  It's like Facebook goes, oh, here, we're giving you this Facebook message.
[03:01:41.208 --> 03:01:42.509]  You can reach millions with it.
[03:01:42.509 --> 03:01:43.489]  We hope you're nice.
[03:01:43.489 --> 03:01:49.114]  Oh, hope that doesn't get taken away if you're not.
[03:01:49.114 --> 03:01:50.254]  Sam, this is how it all works.
[03:01:50.254 --> 03:01:52.456]  Play ball, Alex.
[03:01:52.456 --> 03:01:54.037]  It's fun.
[03:01:54.037 --> 03:01:55.118]  Go along with it.
[03:01:55.118 --> 03:02:00.802]  Yeah, I get the people down at the mid-level and the higher levels are nice folks that sold out.
[03:02:00.802 --> 03:02:01.502]  Wink, wink.
[03:02:01.502 --> 03:02:03.684]  I ain't doing it.
[03:02:03.684 --> 03:02:05.685]  Because I know who runs the show at the top.
[03:02:05.685 --> 03:02:07.427]  And boy, he doesn't like life.
[03:02:08.442 --> 03:02:10.465]  Kit Daniels, your comments on this.
[03:02:10.465 --> 03:02:22.160]  Well, the whole control over the population, what's more important than having money is having the control over creation of money and how people engage in politics.
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:23.382]  And now this won't let you use it.
[03:02:23.462 --> 03:02:24.643]  Now you won't have other economies.
[03:02:24.643 --> 03:02:27.685]  That's why they're shutting down the farmers' markets and the lemonade stands.
[03:02:27.685 --> 03:02:28.146]  Exactly.
[03:02:28.146 --> 03:02:31.989]  They can't have anything that isn't box stores, and you've got to go to it to get your food.
[03:02:31.989 --> 03:02:35.211]  The Soviet model on PCP and a high-tech grid.
[03:02:35.211 --> 03:02:35.532]  Go ahead.
[03:02:35.532 --> 03:02:35.732]  Sorry.
[03:02:35.732 --> 03:02:41.076]  So when you have a tiny elite that has control over the money supply, they have control over human energy.
[03:02:41.076 --> 03:02:42.117]  Because think about it.
[03:02:42.117 --> 03:02:45.659]  You and me and millions of other people in America, they're hard-working Americans.
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:52.887]  They go out and they expanse their energy in order to make a paycheck.
[03:02:52.887 --> 03:02:55.891]  Oh yeah, now the banks are saying they're going to charge to keep money in them.
[03:02:55.891 --> 03:02:56.031]  Yeah.
[03:02:56.972 --> 03:03:01.813]  So, I mean, it's basically all it comes down to is this total control over the population.
[03:03:01.813 --> 03:03:05.794]  And we won't organize, we won't stand up for each other, so we're going to get screwed, big time.
[03:03:05.794 --> 03:03:10.174]  But it's okay, because there's a black guy up there who's liberal, and Hillary, he's taking care of us.
[03:03:10.174 --> 03:03:13.755]  Doesn't matter if they allow loan-sharking loan rates all across the country.
[03:03:13.755 --> 03:03:16.356]  Doesn't matter if they're screwing everybody over with Obamacare.
[03:03:16.356 --> 03:03:18.636]  We feel like we're winners, so it's okay.
[03:03:18.636 --> 03:03:21.957]  And the Republicans at the top are all part of it, so they won't expose it either.
[03:03:21.957 --> 03:03:23.357]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[03:03:23.357 --> 03:03:23.897]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:03:25.714 --> 03:03:27.255]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry for laughing.
[03:03:27.255 --> 03:03:29.717]  It's really not even that funny when you think about it.
[03:03:29.717 --> 03:03:35.000]  But yeah, it's like, it just goes back to lust for power that's been going on for thousands of years.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:36.301]  Yeah, the lust to screw everybody over.
[03:03:36.301 --> 03:03:36.861]  Yeah.
[03:03:36.861 --> 03:03:45.647]  And the easiest way now for the elite to have, uh, gain power is through, um, controlling money and controlling the money supply.
[03:03:45.647 --> 03:03:53.592]  Because once you control money and its creation and how it's spent and how it's saved, you have control over everything.
[03:03:54.232 --> 03:03:56.416]  And that's just, sadly, that's just the way it is.
[03:03:56.416 --> 03:04:00.043]  And then people say, oh, it's just the elite, they want world peace, it's okay, let them have control.
[03:04:00.043 --> 03:04:00.585]  No.
[03:04:00.585 --> 03:04:03.630]  They want to genetically engineer everything and kill everybody.
[03:04:03.630 --> 03:04:05.855]  You cannot give these psychos control, folks.
[03:04:06.616 --> 03:04:07.576]  Yeah, look at it this way.
[03:04:07.576 --> 03:04:18.999]  I mean, think about how they are putting all these controls over money and capital controls saying, oh, we're using this to fight terrorism, to track the money through ISIS and whatnot, but they're the ones that created ISIS.
[03:04:18.999 --> 03:04:20.219]  It's just another false flag.
[03:04:20.219 --> 03:04:21.840]  Totally naked, totally obvious.
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:23.000]  Matt, quick comment.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.761]  Do you want to come on and make your point about gamerism?
[03:04:25.761 --> 03:04:26.301]  Sure, yeah.
[03:04:27.789 --> 03:04:31.592]  So gamification is indoctrination.
[03:04:31.592 --> 03:04:35.014]  I'm looking at the definition.
[03:04:35.014 --> 03:04:37.316]  I've got it up here on my computer.
[03:04:37.316 --> 03:04:45.161]  And the end of that right there, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement in a product or service.
[03:04:45.161 --> 03:04:47.242]  That's sucking you into a false reality.
[03:04:47.242 --> 03:04:53.286]  After Benny leaves, when Benny's on, I'm going to bring you up halfway in to give you a few minutes to really lay this out and get his take on it.
[03:04:53.286 --> 03:04:56.248]  This is one of the smartest people when it comes to mathematics out there.
[03:04:56.248 --> 03:04:57.289]  Stay with us.
[03:04:58.469 --> 03:05:04.512]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.
[03:05:04.512 --> 03:05:09.074]  Crimes punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
[03:05:09.074 --> 03:05:10.934]  But what about the other Bill?
[03:05:10.934 --> 03:05:11.655]  Former U.S.
[03:05:11.655 --> 03:05:20.818]  President Bill Clinton, whose past predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump.
[03:05:20.818 --> 03:05:27.061]  For years, Bill Cosby continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to preserve his legacy.
[03:05:27.401 --> 03:05:39.489]  But even after exposing years of predatory sexual behavior, Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party, pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was Secretary of State.
[03:05:39.489 --> 03:05:54.719]  For someone running a campaign on female empowerment, Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed, threatened, and attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and protect their abuser and her rise to power.
[03:05:54.719 --> 03:05:57.061]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[03:05:58.221 --> 03:06:01.742]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:01.742 --> 03:06:09.983]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:09.983 --> 03:06:15.384]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:15.384 --> 03:06:17.924]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:06:32.671 --> 03:06:36.813]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano formulation.

[03:06:57.984 --> 03:07:04.186]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[03:07:04.186 --> 03:07:07.387]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:07:07.387 --> 03:07:16.530]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:07:16.530 --> 03:07:17.790]  Instead, use your gift
[03:07:17.790 --> 03:07:18.190]  We're good.
[03:07:34.997 --> 03:07:35.637]  We're good to go.
[03:08:08.118 --> 03:08:09.539]  You want answers?
[03:08:09.539 --> 03:08:10.259]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:10.259 --> 03:08:11.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:13.981]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:08:13.981 --> 03:08:19.244]  We're now well into the second hour of the 22nd day of December 2015 on this Tuesday edition.
[03:08:19.244 --> 03:08:20.685]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.549 --> 03:08:35.698]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and please don't take for granted the fact that you can still visit these websites.
[03:08:35.698 --> 03:08:39.863]  There are all sorts of moves to censor the internet.
[03:08:39.863 --> 03:08:46.390]  The FCC chair who sought to regulate drudge slams colleagues as dysfunctional.
[03:08:46.390 --> 03:08:48.653]  There are open moves to censor the internet.
[03:08:50.054 --> 03:09:04.761]  Again, Matt Drudge, when he visited us a few months ago, was told point-blank by a Supreme Court Justice, who he told me about privately but didn't say the name on air, that they've been told next year they're going to try to pass laws and regulations to censor the Internet and free speech and call it political speech and try to tax it.
[03:09:04.761 --> 03:09:06.622]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[03:09:06.622 --> 03:09:07.783]  So much happening.
[03:09:07.783 --> 03:09:16.127]  I want to get William Binney's take today, former technical leader for the intelligence with the National Security Agency, the developer of any of the systems we see in use today,
[03:09:17.671 --> 03:09:24.134]  According to major defense publications, probably one of the greatest code breakers ever, not just living.
[03:09:24.134 --> 03:09:30.696]  But I want to get his take on China just launched the most frightening game ever, and it will be mandatory.
[03:09:30.696 --> 03:09:33.077]  We've talked about the sum, but now it's official.
[03:09:33.077 --> 03:09:36.198]  They're going to force everyone in the next four years in China to adopt it.
[03:09:36.198 --> 03:09:38.359]  It goes online next year.
[03:09:38.359 --> 03:09:39.620]  All your purchases, what you do.
[03:09:41.022 --> 03:09:44.205]  What you say about the government will be put into a social credit score.
[03:09:44.205 --> 03:09:50.970]  You won't be able to get hotels, won't be able to travel, won't be able to leave the country, if you haven't been a good party member.
[03:09:50.970 --> 03:09:52.471]  Or if you haven't towed the party line.
[03:09:52.471 --> 03:09:54.533]  This is the mark of the beast.
[03:09:54.533 --> 03:09:59.997]  Even if you don't believe in God, the devil, whatever, they're using it as an owner's manual.
[03:09:59.997 --> 03:10:07.383]  Where all your data goes in, and this is what Zuckerberg's been meeting with the head of the Chinese Censorship Bureau, who set up this infrastructure.
[03:10:07.383 --> 03:10:08.124]  This is the model.
[03:10:09.651 --> 03:10:12.094]  And it's incredibly dangerous.
[03:10:12.094 --> 03:10:13.315]  It's over the top.
[03:10:13.315 --> 03:10:20.584]  We've got all these omnibus bills and surveillance bills being rammed through, always happening around the Christmas season when people are distracted.
[03:10:21.803 --> 03:10:24.304]  There's so much to discuss with William Binney.
[03:10:24.304 --> 03:10:30.967]  He's the former technical leader for intelligence for the NSA before becoming a whistleblower in late 2001, privately to Congress.
[03:10:30.967 --> 03:10:32.027]  Nothing was done.
[03:10:32.027 --> 03:10:37.750]  After more than 30 years with the agency, Binney has been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:44.432]  Binney continues to speak out about the NSA's data collection policies and continues interviews in the media regarding his experiences.
[03:10:44.432 --> 03:10:50.875]  And they got the new big movie coming out, of course, that Oliver Stone's putting out that has a big character playing the part of William Binney in it.
[03:10:52.588 --> 03:10:56.992]  He's testified in an affidavit that the NSA is a deliberate violation of the US Constitution.
[03:10:56.992 --> 03:11:03.137]  ExposedFacts.org has a lot of his writings.
[03:11:03.137 --> 03:11:08.121]  He, of course, has physically come and been interviewed by us here.
[03:11:08.121 --> 03:11:14.847]  And it's important to understand, he's made the statement, this is about total social control of the general public, not about protecting us from terrorists.
[03:11:14.847 --> 03:11:18.890]  Notice they let the Syrian refugees in, who are really mainly Sunni invaders,
[03:11:19.793 --> 03:11:21.014]  Homesteaders.
[03:11:21.014 --> 03:11:21.874]  Pilgrims.
[03:11:21.874 --> 03:11:23.955]  Trying to come in and take over Syria.
[03:11:23.955 --> 03:11:25.476]  Out of Saudi Arabia and other countries.
[03:11:25.476 --> 03:11:26.557]  That's admitted.
[03:11:26.557 --> 03:11:28.618]  80% of the Pentagon admits.
[03:11:28.618 --> 03:11:29.119]  80% roughly.
[03:11:29.119 --> 03:11:30.299]  The EU says that as well.
[03:11:30.299 --> 03:11:32.080]  Fake passports, you name it.
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:33.521]  Large percentages are jihadis.
[03:11:33.521 --> 03:11:34.542]  They're now being brought in.
[03:11:34.542 --> 03:11:35.422]  Clearly.
[03:11:35.422 --> 03:11:37.684]  So when they attack, they'll say it's not Muslim terror.
[03:11:37.684 --> 03:11:39.064]  But we gotta take your guns.
[03:11:39.064 --> 03:11:40.185]  We gotta restrict your rights.
[03:11:40.185 --> 03:11:42.266]  We gotta reauthorize all the NSA spying.
[03:11:42.266 --> 03:11:44.808]  We've gotta expand it.
[03:11:44.808 --> 03:11:46.509]  So, this is what we're dealing with.
[03:11:46.509 --> 03:11:47.910]  They're not protecting us.
[03:11:49.655 --> 03:11:55.679]  14 years after 9-11, Al-Qaeda has turned into the giant ISIS organization with hundreds of thousands.
[03:11:55.679 --> 03:11:56.640]  How is that?
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:00.983]  With Hillary Clinton and others openly funding them with the weapons.
[03:12:00.983 --> 03:12:02.384]  It's clear.
[03:12:02.384 --> 03:12:05.406]  Saudi Arabia gets to take over the Middle East with its fighters.
[03:12:05.406 --> 03:12:13.832]  They play along with their anti-American, get a few targets, wind up some of their operatives who don't know what they're doing to attack us.
[03:12:13.832 --> 03:12:17.254]  And then, Western governments can set up totalitarianism.
[03:12:18.519 --> 03:12:24.183]  And it came out a few months ago in NSA reports and it's also come out the CIA has admitted it.
[03:12:24.183 --> 03:12:28.546]  ISIS puts out in their official magazine that we're not CIA, we're not working with the West.
[03:12:28.546 --> 03:12:29.306]  Don't listen to that.
[03:12:29.306 --> 03:12:32.188]  That's the one thing hurting their recruitment.
[03:12:32.188 --> 03:12:46.098]  Is that young Muslims can't be wound up by them to go up and shoot up and blow stuff up because they're understanding this is meant to cause a clash of civilizations and more invasions of the Middle East to knock out countries like Syria that aren't against the United States.
[03:12:46.906 --> 03:12:53.451]  Just like Saudi Arabia's involved attacking us on 9-11, that's now on the 28 pages, we know that.
[03:12:53.451 --> 03:12:56.033]  And we attack Iraq.
[03:12:56.033 --> 03:12:58.135]  So there's such an awakening, this is incredible.
[03:12:58.135 --> 03:13:13.347]  Now what I wanted to bring up to William Binney was a new book called Military to Military, the London Review of Books covered yesterday, as well as the Newarker Magazine, where Cy Hirst, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, breaks down what we already know from Colonel Schaefer and our other contacts, that we broke
[03:13:14.090 --> 03:13:16.371]  Three and a half, four years ago with Benghazi.
[03:13:16.371 --> 03:13:21.472]  I'm just setting the table here with William Benny and we'll listen for the rest of the hour.
[03:13:21.472 --> 03:13:43.540]  That our own military, from majors, captains, master sergeants, you name it, on up to two-star generals, like the former head of defense intelligence, Michael Flynn, coming out and saying, we are ordered to create this ISIS group and to fund them, this is a willful plan, and I don't know why they're doing it.
[03:13:44.855 --> 03:13:47.756]  Well, it's so they can take American freedoms and European freedoms away.
[03:13:47.756 --> 03:13:52.598]  But we have a lot of top generals now that have just quit, or been fired, going public.
[03:13:52.598 --> 03:13:55.899]  So there is what I would call a soft counter-coup.
[03:13:55.899 --> 03:13:58.020]  Not a coup by the military, which I don't support.
[03:13:58.020 --> 03:13:58.840]  Very dangerous.
[03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:00.620]  Normally goes bad.
[03:14:00.620 --> 03:14:04.662]  But a literal soft coup, and it's coming out in the news, but then getting spun.
[03:14:05.734 --> 03:14:14.037]  So William Binning spent years testifying secretly to Congress behind closed doors, and he was rewarded with a SWAT team raid while he was in the shower.
[03:14:14.037 --> 03:14:16.357]  They waited until that to drag him around naked in his house.
[03:14:16.357 --> 03:14:18.038]  That's what they do.
[03:14:18.038 --> 03:14:21.519]  To demoralize you.
[03:14:21.519 --> 03:14:31.422]  For testifying to Congress, as the former technical director, that's the guy running the actual show.
[03:14:31.422 --> 03:14:34.123]  Because he exposed they could have stopped Al Qaeda, they could have, all of it.
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:36.640]  I think so.
[03:14:57.243 --> 03:15:19.856]  I've said a lot of stuff out there, the latest bills, the legislation, all of it, but just to go from 10 years ago, them denying there was any illegal NSA spying, to now admitting it all, and trying to codify it in law, and then admitting it's being used against Congress and political enemies, and now they want to merge with China with a system that socially tracks everything you do, to not let you buy or sell or live a digital black bull,
[03:15:22.273 --> 03:15:33.301]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:15:33.301 --> 03:15:35.903]  I'm glad to be back with you.
[03:15:35.903 --> 03:15:37.884]  Yes, you've said an awful lot there.
[03:15:37.884 --> 03:15:50.633]  I mean, I guess the real point is that the intelligence agencies of the world are kind of banding together to do this kind of monitoring of everybody on the planet, and it's spreading.
[03:15:51.794 --> 03:16:03.484]  And they're using different, they're lying to the public and giving them disinformation about, for example, the latest lies are about the, they couldn't stop Paris or San Bernardino because they were encrypting.
[03:16:03.484 --> 03:16:07.607]  Well, when the evidence comes out, you find out that that's just another lie.
[03:16:07.607 --> 03:16:10.129]  It's another disinformation program.
[03:16:10.825 --> 03:16:13.886]  Where they want people to believe it's one thing when in fact it's another.
[03:16:13.886 --> 03:16:21.950]  So their whole objective there is to get rid of encryption or be able to be able to read into any encryption on the network anywhere.
[03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:25.111]  And that's what they're trying to use to justify it.
[03:16:25.111 --> 03:16:28.352]  But again, the real problem is their bulk acquisition of data.
[03:16:28.352 --> 03:16:33.995]  That's always been the problem and it continues to be, even internally in NSA and the various agencies they're telling them.
[03:16:34.844 --> 03:16:42.650]  We're overpowered by overload, and we're in analysis paralysis because we can't focus because of all the massive amounts of data.
[03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:44.571]  Which is what the dark actors really want.
[03:16:44.571 --> 03:16:49.895]  This is the fog for what I would liken to Spectre, these global corporations to just take over.
[03:16:49.895 --> 03:16:50.536]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:16:50.536 --> 03:17:01.404]  And what it really does is it gives them all that power, having all that knowledge, then they now know how or who they have to deal with in their societies to be able to control the outcomes.
[03:17:02.085 --> 03:17:15.049]  That's really what I've been saying for several years is that their whole idea is population control and in order to do that you have to have knowledge about the population and that's what this is giving them.
[03:17:15.049 --> 03:17:20.411]  What an amazing statement by you, the former technical director of the NSA, that
[03:17:22.321 --> 03:17:26.964]  Global intelligence agencies, I guess other than Russia, are merging right now.
[03:17:26.964 --> 03:17:33.028]  And Zuckerberg and others admit we're going with the Chinese model because they can beta test illegal stuff on a mass scale.
[03:17:33.028 --> 03:17:43.155]  Can you speak directly to China's systems of control feeding all the data in and saying, if you say something bad about the party, we're going to phase it in where you can't buy or sell?
[03:17:43.155 --> 03:17:44.956]  I mean, this is the ultimate nightmare in my view.
[03:17:46.263 --> 03:17:52.964]  Yeah, I think it's taking off a bit on the model that's already been built between, for example, the industry and the U.S.
[03:17:52.964 --> 03:17:56.665]  NSA, CIA, FBI, primarily.
[03:17:56.665 --> 03:17:59.686]  Those are the ones who are involved in setting it up internally in the U.S.
[03:17:59.686 --> 03:18:02.886]  and that's now the model they're going to try to export to China.
[03:18:02.886 --> 03:18:09.407]  I guess it sounds like they're going to be trying different things on top of that model to see if they can expand on it or improve it.
[03:18:09.407 --> 03:18:11.648]  Basically a security clearance to live.
[03:18:14.505 --> 03:18:18.490]  A security clearance to even be able to function and have a job, even in the private sector.
[03:18:18.490 --> 03:18:22.575]  I mean, this is beyond Hitler's best dreams, isn't it, sir?
[03:18:23.433 --> 03:18:27.095]  Oh, it's well beyond Orwell's in 1984, too.
[03:18:27.095 --> 03:18:35.819]  I mean, it's just, it's just total, it's getting into not only the things that you're doing and who you're working with and who you do those things with, but also what you're thinking.
[03:18:35.819 --> 03:18:38.440]  And that's really, that's really where this is heading.
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:47.385]  And then openly blackmailing you to submit and do everything you're told, or they will lower your social score so you can't operate in society and can't travel.
[03:18:48.260 --> 03:18:53.125]  Yeah, and if they can't get to you, they'll get to somebody you care about, just like the KGB did.
[03:18:53.125 --> 03:18:54.667]  So it's no different than that.
[03:18:54.667 --> 03:18:57.910]  And they admit it's going to be a no-fly list just because your score's low.
[03:18:57.910 --> 03:19:01.094]  No judge, no jury, just a big algorithm, now you can't travel.
[03:19:01.094 --> 03:19:08.301]  And so many high-powered people I've talked to have been openly told now, this is coming here, you better get in line, and they're rolling over, Mr. Binney.
[03:19:08.301 --> 03:19:10.884]  Don't they know that will ensure the totalitarian takeover?
[03:19:13.231 --> 03:19:15.752]  Well, I think that that's basically what they're all aiming for.
[03:19:15.752 --> 03:19:21.835]  I mean, that's really the underlying effort that they're aiming at.
[03:19:21.835 --> 03:19:23.695]  That's what they want to achieve.
[03:19:23.695 --> 03:19:24.656]  Good God.
[03:19:24.656 --> 03:19:28.418]  Well, sir, I'm here just very emotional about this because I scan it every day.
[03:19:28.418 --> 03:19:29.378]  You're the true expert on it.
[03:19:29.378 --> 03:19:31.259]  You've got the floor the next 10 minutes.
[03:19:31.259 --> 03:19:32.119]  What's most important?
[03:19:32.119 --> 03:19:36.421]  What should people know with the highest level NSA whistleblower of all time here with us on air?
[03:19:41.385 --> 03:19:49.849]  The point is that everything coming out of the government is distorted in one form or another, not really coming and being honest with anybody in the public anymore.
[03:19:49.849 --> 03:19:51.690]  You can't trust them at all.
[03:19:51.690 --> 03:20:00.313]  And you cannot, even the government, inside the government, they can't even trust what the intelligence agencies are telling them or what their law enforcement agencies are telling them anymore.
[03:20:00.313 --> 03:20:04.075]  They can't, they're distorting what's being presented in the courts of law.
[03:20:04.075 --> 03:20:06.856]  I mean, they're just destroying all our founding principles.
[03:20:07.643 --> 03:20:14.726]  And I've been basically on television saying that this is basically treason against the founding principles of this nation.
[03:20:14.726 --> 03:20:21.169]  And, you know, we as people have to stop and say, we're not going to tolerate this anymore.
[03:20:21.169 --> 03:20:32.675]  And if they can't, if they don't start subscribing to getting back to the principles of under the Constitution of personal rights by individuals,
[03:20:34.102 --> 03:20:38.384]  Then I think we need to fire everyone that's involved in that.
[03:20:38.384 --> 03:20:41.165]  And I would argue we need to fire everyone in D.C.
[03:20:41.165 --> 03:20:45.227]  right now, because they have no common sense about how things are proceeding.
[03:20:45.227 --> 03:20:48.348]  They don't seem to understand the consequences of the things they're doing.
[03:20:48.348 --> 03:20:58.693]  I mean, it just seems that they believe, for one reason or another, and I think it's because they're being bamboozled by the intelligence people,
[03:21:00.030 --> 03:21:04.932]  That they have to do these things or else the sky's gonna fall, right?
[03:21:04.932 --> 03:21:11.796]  When in fact that's just an outright lie and it's a distortion to try to manipulate people to do what they want and they're falling for it.
[03:21:11.796 --> 03:21:14.117]  All of our politicians are falling for it.
[03:21:14.117 --> 03:21:17.979]  Sir, your record was impeccable, you know, you were holding the rank of a general at the NSA.
[03:21:19.488 --> 03:21:24.332]  They knew to not come and directly try to buy you off or threaten you because they knew you had such integrity.
[03:21:24.332 --> 03:21:29.136]  That's why you were there from kind of an old guard system that was more based on that.
[03:21:29.136 --> 03:21:36.562]  With people in Congress and in the general public who are more modern and more decadent, they point blank either offer to buy them off or threaten them.
[03:21:36.562 --> 03:21:38.524]  I mean, I'm talking to more and more prominent people where
[03:21:39.304 --> 03:21:49.337]  I'm sure you saw last year when they legalized CIA propaganda domestically and quote the CIA and the Pentagon engaging in social operations domestically.
[03:21:49.337 --> 03:21:55.905]  They're actually sending CIA, you name it, people into businesses, into companies, even at the mid-level now.
[03:21:58.107 --> 03:22:01.748]  Either offering them stuff or threatening them to go along with his takeover, sir.
[03:22:01.748 --> 03:22:02.809]  This is the equivalent.
[03:22:02.809 --> 03:22:11.112]  I'm sure you're familiar with how the Germans for five years quietly infiltrated France and got the top general staff to stand down.
[03:22:11.112 --> 03:22:12.312]  The Blitzkrieg was a joke.
[03:22:12.312 --> 03:22:13.853]  It really didn't even fight the French.
[03:22:13.853 --> 03:22:23.536]  They fought the British Expeditionary Force, pushed them to Dunkirk, and I liken this to an infiltration operation where they've actually, this foreign globalist coup,
[03:22:24.136 --> 03:22:32.323]  This corporate coup has already, I know I said I'm giving you the floor and I'm jumping in here, I want you to comment on this, has already come in and basically infiltrated and taken over.
[03:22:32.323 --> 03:22:37.908]  They just don't come and tell you something like that because they know how much integrity you have.
[03:22:37.908 --> 03:22:48.298]  Yeah, it's getting back to the idea of, you know, how many people can you manipulate and coerce or force in one form or another by blackmail or any other means.
[03:22:49.313 --> 03:22:51.798]  Um, to do the things you want done.
[03:22:51.798 --> 03:22:53.941]  I mean, that's basically what's going on.
[03:22:53.941 --> 03:23:00.593]  I mean, it seemed to... It's just, to me, I just can't envision my country ever going this route.
[03:23:00.593 --> 03:23:02.997]  I mean, I could never have thought that this would ever happen here.
[03:23:03.789 --> 03:23:04.470]  But it has.
[03:23:04.470 --> 03:23:18.140]  You know, you can't go around saying things like, this cannot happen here, like in the in the 30s, when when the Nazis took over, when the communists took over or whenever, you know, all these different power struggles have gone down through history.
[03:23:18.140 --> 03:23:20.241]  I mean, it can happen here.
[03:23:20.241 --> 03:23:22.423]  That's the whole point.
[03:23:22.423 --> 03:23:27.587]  And if we aren't vigilant, I mean, I keep saying democracy is not a spectator sport.
[03:23:27.587 --> 03:23:28.768]  You have to participate.
[03:23:28.768 --> 03:23:31.470]  You've got to get out there and keep the fight to keep it.
[03:23:31.470 --> 03:23:32.851]  I mean, this is something that people
[03:23:33.621 --> 03:23:46.392]  People try to down through history, full of regimes that have tried to do this, just take the power away from the people and consolidate it and become the kind of dictator or despot that controls everything.
[03:23:46.392 --> 03:23:48.113]  I mean, that's just really what's going on.
[03:23:48.113 --> 03:23:49.594]  This is our struggle.
[03:23:49.594 --> 03:23:51.336]  It has never changed down through history.
[03:23:53.658 --> 03:23:54.298]  Absolutely.
[03:23:54.298 --> 03:23:58.940]  And sir, look at the fact that a lot of dictators were bad, but they just wanted to control everything.
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:03.881]  Some of them were egomaniacs and actually built big things, started universities, did some good.
[03:24:03.881 --> 03:24:12.304]  I mean, I'm not endorsing dictatorship, but this dictatorship of these social engineers is really anti-family, anti-human, anti-individual.
[03:24:12.304 --> 03:24:14.144]  It's anti-Renaissance.
[03:24:14.144 --> 03:24:16.125]  It's like a corporate Borg.
[03:24:16.125 --> 03:24:23.247]  It's so alien that just my very, very genetic code says resist this with everything you've got.
[03:24:24.522 --> 03:24:29.286]  Yeah, it basically says you will have no freedoms except those that we grant you.
[03:24:29.286 --> 03:24:37.072]  That's basically what their whole program is going to end up doing.
[03:24:37.072 --> 03:24:38.553]  Unbelievable.
[03:24:38.553 --> 03:24:39.494]  Unbelievable.
[03:24:39.494 --> 03:24:43.336]  William Binney, former Technical Director of the National Security Agency, is our guest.
[03:24:43.336 --> 03:24:44.938]  We'll take some calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:44.938 --> 03:24:44.998]  800-259-9231.
[03:24:44.998 --> 03:24:45.058]  800-259-9231.
[03:24:45.058 --> 03:24:47.600]  Looking at these bills, looking at the legislation, looking at
[03:24:54.727 --> 03:25:02.334]  The things that are being done, what is your overall view of the announcements that are being made, the things that are being engaged in?
[03:25:02.334 --> 03:25:17.508]  Well, I mean, some of the things they're trying to pass, like the FISBUD putting it into this big funding bill and burying it in there and passing it through is just another way of corrupting the process and getting it through under basically the cover of a massive bill.
[03:25:18.399 --> 03:25:24.321]  Those are the kinds of things they're sneaking through, and they're doing it by the leadership of our Congress is doing.
[03:25:24.321 --> 03:25:27.102]  Republicans and Democrats are all supporting this.
[03:25:27.102 --> 03:25:28.202]  They're no different, really.
[03:25:28.202 --> 03:25:37.685]  And they're doing it because they know they can't stand out in the open and say the things they want to say in a bill.
[03:25:37.685 --> 03:25:43.267]  So they've got to do it in some kind of under-the-cover or kind of in a sneaky way to get it through.
[03:25:44.187 --> 03:25:52.076]  And so that gives them, and then they say that authorizes them the power to do whatever they want to do, which in fact I contest.
[03:25:52.076 --> 03:25:57.942]  None of that is constitutional, and any time it reaches in a constitutional test, it will fail.
[03:25:57.942 --> 03:26:02.827]  And they were caught doing it all in secret and lying to the public, and using it against political targets.
[03:26:02.827 --> 03:26:04.589]  It's all a fraud.
[03:26:04.589 --> 03:26:04.990]  Exactly.
[03:26:06.696 --> 03:26:13.588]  Right, and they're afraid of having constitutional tests when in fact that is the true test of a law.
[03:26:13.588 --> 03:26:15.512]  Does it really conform to the Constitution or not?
[03:26:15.512 --> 03:26:16.614]  If it doesn't, it's not a law.
[03:26:18.854 --> 03:26:21.035]  Well, clearly they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[03:26:21.035 --> 03:26:26.678]  I have been talking to a lot of big Hollywood people, a lot of big government people, and they are just terrified.
[03:26:26.678 --> 03:26:33.821]  They say, oh, I thought you were crazy about the NSA 15 years ago, Alex, but now it's all admitted and I'm scared, I'm not going to speak out.
[03:26:33.821 --> 03:26:36.323]  So that chilling effect is kind of working.
[03:26:36.323 --> 03:26:42.706]  Don't these people understand giving into the fear is what ensures that the real next phase of oppression comes in?
[03:26:44.605 --> 03:26:53.191]  Yeah, that's the whole point that I was making, too, by saying if you acquiesce in a democracy, you'll lose it.
[03:26:53.191 --> 03:26:54.652]  So you've got to stand up and fight.
[03:26:54.652 --> 03:26:57.694]  That's what the people in democracy are supposed to do.
[03:26:57.694 --> 03:27:01.977]  You're supposed to stand up for your rights.
[03:27:01.977 --> 03:27:06.039]  I know you never talk to colleagues at the NSA anymore because they'll try to indict you.
[03:27:06.039 --> 03:27:09.481]  I know they've been harassing a lot of your other colleagues and folks.
[03:27:11.451 --> 03:27:13.993]  Is there, I mean, isn't there a sense of shame?
[03:27:13.993 --> 03:27:20.897]  I mean, I know there is, because look at all the leaks that they're having to fix intelligence, that they're funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:27:20.897 --> 03:27:22.658]  I mean, I am seeing a lot of good signs.
[03:27:22.658 --> 03:27:31.523]  What I mentioned earlier, and what Cy Hirst is reporting, that there's basically a soft counter-coup inside the military going on against a lot of this stuff.
[03:27:33.581 --> 03:27:45.706]  Yeah, I think and I think you're right because there's some other whistleblowers like the four fellas that came out to blow the whistle on the droning and basically the random slaughter going on there.
[03:27:45.706 --> 03:27:47.387]  So there's that too.
[03:27:47.387 --> 03:27:48.227]  Plus, I know
[03:27:49.125 --> 03:27:58.027]  Internally, well they're still so afraid of going into a court of law to be constitutionally challenged that they, it tells you that they're afraid of sunshine.
[03:27:58.027 --> 03:28:07.388]  You know, shining the light on, it's like picking up a rock and watching the, I draw the analogy when you pick up a rock you can see all the bugs and worms squirm to get out of the sunlight.
[03:28:07.388 --> 03:28:12.789]  Well that's basically what our political leaders are doing now.
[03:28:12.789 --> 03:28:18.170]  And I'm not differentiating between any of the parties, they all seem to be a part of it, so I just throw them all together.
[03:28:19.091 --> 03:28:36.017]  If anybody does this kind of support for things that are simply taking away our rights and assembling knowledge in the central government about the people in the country, I mean, that's fundamentally what our Constitution was supposed to stop, and it was designed that way.
[03:28:36.017 --> 03:28:44.700]  You know, the people were supposed to know what the government was doing, the government was not supposed to know what they were doing, unless they had probable cause.
[03:28:44.700 --> 03:28:47.041]  Instead they open the borders up, don't check anybody, but
[03:28:48.027 --> 03:28:49.908]  Stick a magnifying glass down our throats.
[03:28:49.908 --> 03:28:54.671]  I mean, it really is the breaking of the will of the American people.
[03:28:54.671 --> 03:29:00.274]  And I just can't believe how many men I know that are scared now to know we have a tyrannical government.
[03:29:00.274 --> 03:29:05.476]  You know, the whole thing's not tyrannical, though there are a lot of good people in the government and in the corporations that are trying to stop this.
[03:29:05.476 --> 03:29:10.099]  We all have to speak out and get involved now, and we can turn the tide against this, and you're doing that.
[03:29:11.769 --> 03:29:12.970]  That's my point, yeah.
[03:29:12.970 --> 03:29:21.173]  I think the more people who stand up against this, the better chance we have of stopping it here, initially, and then trying to initiate a stop around the world.
[03:29:21.173 --> 03:29:28.337]  Because we started this infection and it went through the British, now GCHQ, the Germans, the BND, and various other countries around the world.
[03:29:28.337 --> 03:29:29.357]  Let's talk about that national debate, sir.
[03:29:29.477 --> 03:29:30.298]  Look, we've got a break.
[03:29:30.298 --> 03:29:32.659]  William Binning, exposefacts.org.
[03:29:32.659 --> 03:29:34.761]  Want to wish you a Merry Christmas as well, sir.
[03:29:34.761 --> 03:29:36.962]  What a super patriot we've got on the line.
[03:29:36.962 --> 03:29:38.564]  And also, have a dinner with this guy.
[03:29:38.564 --> 03:29:42.446]  Unbelievable, fourth, fifth, six-dimensional level thinking.
[03:29:42.446 --> 03:29:43.087]  You can tell why.
[03:29:43.087 --> 03:29:45.228]  He pretty much built the NSA that's there today, folks.
[03:29:45.228 --> 03:29:47.830]  He is the master.
[03:29:47.830 --> 03:29:49.231]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.231 --> 03:29:51.753]  The empire's on the run.

[03:32:36.297 --> 03:32:39.578]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:39.578 --> 03:32:43.059]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:43.059 --> 03:32:45.039]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:45.039 --> 03:32:47.140]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:47.140 --> 03:32:49.140]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:49.140 --> 03:32:54.741]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:12.993 --> 03:33:17.854]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:33:17.854 --> 03:33:21.355]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.355 --> 03:33:29.077]  Our whole modern world has been about coddling, making sure we never have experiences that make us empowered individuals.
[03:33:29.077 --> 03:33:36.919]  The Pentagon ran a major PSYOP operation.
[03:33:36.919 --> 03:33:40.140]  This summer, Jade Helm
[03:33:42.290 --> 03:33:45.914]  Day one we said it wasn't a military takeover or gun confiscation.
[03:33:45.914 --> 03:34:00.531]  We said it was a conditioning operation for troops on the streets of America for civil unrest and also practice in the United States but also overseas using databases of information to roll in and out of cities undetected.
[03:34:01.704 --> 03:34:03.666]  And to master the human domain.
[03:34:03.666 --> 03:34:13.436]  And the commanding general over it gave a slideshow that we played parts of, admitting it's about mastering the human domain and controlling the population.
[03:34:13.436 --> 03:34:17.620]  I then ran into some Special Forces people.
[03:34:17.620 --> 03:34:21.464]  One of them very well known, but I'm not going to say his name.
[03:34:21.464 --> 03:34:23.506]  He'll probably end up being on the show.
[03:34:24.577 --> 03:34:31.260]  And they said, look, we all saw right through that and the psyop they ran saying that this was this weekend, saying that you said we were coming to take over.
[03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:41.225]  Believe me, Alex, no one in SF, Army, Marines, Navy, no one buys any of it.
[03:34:41.225 --> 03:34:44.887]  And we know that's why they're rolling out with autonomous drones, robots, all of it.
[03:34:44.887 --> 03:34:45.407]  We get it.
[03:34:45.407 --> 03:34:46.108]  We know you're dead on.
[03:34:47.136 --> 03:34:50.097]  So again, I'm not lionizing the military.
[03:34:50.097 --> 03:34:57.418]  I've always been critical of it being used and just worshipped mindlessly, you know, where the military's paying for them to, you know, have patriotic stuff at the Super Bowl.
[03:34:57.418 --> 03:35:03.379]  That's to sell the state as if it's the military with stolen glory.
[03:35:03.379 --> 03:35:16.141]  But they've got a big problem in that the boots on the ground, right up to the generals, they're trying to put all these weird pencil pushers in and all these weird politicos who've never even been involved in combat.
[03:35:17.453 --> 03:35:23.498]  They're putting, you know, guys that are political hacks in, especially under Obama.
[03:35:23.498 --> 03:35:35.448]  That really endangers us against foreign governments, the delusion of the Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, the neocons, none of them have been in the military, to go start these wars with Russia.
[03:35:35.448 --> 03:35:42.154]  I mean, it's not just what William Binney was about to get into, former technical director of the NSA, but the situation with
[03:35:43.686 --> 03:35:50.950]  All these different governments and all the different systems spying and there's too much data, so it makes everybody blind.
[03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:52.831]  It's beyond that.
[03:35:52.831 --> 03:35:55.273]  It's that they're starting wars with Russia.
[03:35:55.273 --> 03:35:56.654]  They're starting wars in Syria.
[03:35:56.654 --> 03:36:00.716]  They're doing unprecedented bad stuff.
[03:36:00.716 --> 03:36:03.318]  And even our top generals go, it's immoral.
[03:36:03.318 --> 03:36:09.061]  Why overthrow a country and have Al-Qaeda come in, that's what ISIS is, and murder the Christians?
[03:36:09.061 --> 03:36:11.803]  I mean, it's just so nasty.
[03:36:12.756 --> 03:36:21.105]  And it's not even Machiavelli, because it doesn't bring down Iran, their regime, it actually makes them look moral!
[03:36:21.105 --> 03:36:27.773]  I mean, it's hubris, it's arrogance, but you could also look at it like they're globalists running this, they want to discredit America.
[03:36:27.773 --> 03:36:31.918]  William Benny, I want you to get back to the points you got cut off at the break on, but separately,
[03:36:33.171 --> 03:36:52.587]  Being at the highest levels of the NSA, I know there's a method to some of the madness, clearly they're running things, but also there's a lot of hubris and arrogance, and it really is scary to see a bunch of chicken hawks playing God, and Hillary saying she came to Libya, she saw Gaddafi died, when the woman couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag.
[03:36:52.587 --> 03:36:58.252]  There's something obscene about a lazy politico shooting her mouth off about killing people.
[03:36:59.488 --> 03:37:06.554]  It just reeks of classic, classic flaming megalomania, sir.
[03:37:06.554 --> 03:37:07.174]  Yes.
[03:37:07.174 --> 03:37:13.019]  In fact, I've been amazed at the arrogance of the intelligence community, even to our own government.
[03:37:13.019 --> 03:37:23.727]  I mean, they just seem to have them all wrapped around their finger, much like J. Edgar Hoover did with most of the politicians in the House and Senate and the White House.
[03:37:24.529 --> 03:37:30.191]  Back when he was the director of the FBI for, you know, 40 years or so.
[03:37:30.191 --> 03:37:37.134]  So, I mean, he had information and knowledge about them, and if they didn't know that he did, they believed he did.
[03:37:37.134 --> 03:37:39.535]  So, that's how he kept his power.
[03:37:39.535 --> 03:37:45.017]  And this is getting very similar to that, but on a much larger scale.
[03:37:45.017 --> 03:37:50.820]  And I would point out that what's happening now is what we impeached and indicted Richard Nixon for
[03:37:52.176 --> 03:37:57.020]  He was only doing a minor, miniscule amount compared to what they're doing now.
[03:37:57.020 --> 03:37:58.481]  Yes, sir.
[03:37:58.481 --> 03:38:08.608]  Don't the elites know that historically every time bringing in an oppression, a tyranny, a panopticon system like this will always end up destroying them?
[03:38:08.608 --> 03:38:12.691]  They're going to be the number one targets of what they've created.
[03:38:12.691 --> 03:38:14.652]  They've dug a pit for us.
[03:38:14.652 --> 03:38:16.674]  Won't they be the ones that fall into it historically?
[03:38:18.052 --> 03:38:24.738]  Well, I think if it gets really violent, like in World War II and so on, yes, they would be the ones to pay for it.
[03:38:24.738 --> 03:38:34.167]  But essentially, I think they're banking on the fact that this will be a long, drawn-out thing, and so they'll be able to pass it on to their successors, and that they won't have to pay anything directly for it.
[03:38:35.891 --> 03:38:44.374]  So in other words, they'll be able to get by through their lifetime without having suffered any consequences, but their successors will be the ones to suffer that.
[03:38:44.374 --> 03:38:49.196]  And by then, they believe technology will outrace that, and they'll be secure, or they'll dumb the public down enough to do it.
[03:38:49.196 --> 03:38:50.116]  You're absolutely right.
[03:38:50.116 --> 03:38:56.659]  They are building a lot of redoubts, though, in different circuitous areas around the world right now, hedging their bets.
[03:38:58.106 --> 03:39:05.669]  Yes, and you know, I personally like to get right in their face because they shrink away every time.
[03:39:05.669 --> 03:39:08.370]  It's a matter of, you know, again, it's the idea of sunlight.
[03:39:08.370 --> 03:39:10.371]  They're afraid of sunlight.
[03:39:10.371 --> 03:39:16.733]  Because then they will be the ones to suffer the consequences and the results of what they've done.
[03:39:16.733 --> 03:39:17.954]  That's what they're trying to avoid.
[03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:20.991]  Like Karl Rove said, they control reality.
[03:39:20.991 --> 03:39:21.631]  No, they don't.
[03:39:21.631 --> 03:39:22.853]  They just avoid reality.
[03:39:22.853 --> 03:39:24.534]  It's called being delusional.
[03:39:24.534 --> 03:39:26.276]  William Binning, incredible to have you here.
[03:39:26.276 --> 03:39:30.641]  Other technical things people need to know about what's happening in the world right now, sir.
[03:39:32.608 --> 03:39:55.203]  Well, it's basically, I think the greatest threat is to allow companies to continue to manage and have this kind of information about people because then they have the ability, like we were talking about China, then they have the ability to go to China and see and influence them in a way that would be very similar of accumulating information on individual citizens.
[03:39:55.845 --> 03:39:56.966]  I mean in their countries.
[03:39:56.966 --> 03:40:00.308]  So the companies in their international companies.
[03:40:00.308 --> 03:40:04.331]  So this is getting spread internationally accelerated through that process.
[03:40:04.331 --> 03:40:11.255]  And I think that's probably one of the major things that we really should be dealing with here in this country and in Europe.
[03:40:11.255 --> 03:40:14.037]  I know the Europeans are trying to deal with it now.
[03:40:14.861 --> 03:40:24.625]  And I'm trying to give my two cents and contributions to them and hopefully they'll start a worldwide effort that might be able to turn this around.
[03:40:24.625 --> 03:40:26.866]  Yes, sir.
[03:40:26.866 --> 03:40:37.431]  But I think holding companies responsible for the information they're holding is and in fact probably even denying them the legal right to hold that data might be the best option eventually.
[03:40:38.956 --> 03:40:43.860]  Well, if folks, and of course when I have you on, sir, you're so influential, you have so much courage.
[03:40:43.860 --> 03:40:44.600]  I mean, it's just true.
[03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:47.482]  I don't normally gush like this with guests, unless they deserve it.
[03:40:47.482 --> 03:40:52.225]  You're out there doing so many interviews, have gone through so much to warn people.
[03:40:52.225 --> 03:40:56.408]  I try to mount stuff off of you, obviously, to see if you think it's accurate from my perspective.
[03:40:56.408 --> 03:41:06.195]  And it is even more frightening that pretty much always you concur with my basic analysis of it, just as a layperson, looking at the larger geopolitical and cultural ramifications.
[03:41:07.918 --> 03:41:15.840]  We know why they're trying to ban white Christmas and brown paper bags and saying if you serve Chinese food at a school lunch program it's racist.
[03:41:15.840 --> 03:41:25.023]  They're projecting all these things that don't exist that aren't really racist or discriminatory because we're all being discriminated against by this new technocratic system being set up.
[03:41:25.603 --> 03:41:32.872]  Where if you're not a good little New World Order person, you won't be able to have a job or live or get a hotel room or travel.
[03:41:32.872 --> 03:41:34.354]  They're announcing all this.
[03:41:34.354 --> 03:41:37.958]  This is classical discrimination and oppression.
[03:41:37.958 --> 03:41:42.363]  And so they want us to define all these phantom menaces now, while the greatest
[03:41:43.612 --> 03:41:56.954]  Facts of institutionalized tyranny the world's ever seen are being codified into a physical surveillance grid that, as you said, is beyond any fantastical dream of George Orwell.
[03:41:56.954 --> 03:42:01.075]  Yes, and I just liken this to the, you know, the case of the Wizard of Oz.
[03:42:01.075 --> 03:42:11.217]  This is a scenario they're painting is to basically pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, when in fact the man behind the curtain is them and they're doing some very bad things.
[03:42:14.855 --> 03:42:41.005]  Well I think it's very important for the establishment to realize, let me ask you this being up there at the highest levels, I know that the people at the mid-level and even high-level that are patriots, I mean I actually abashed the government a lot, they call me anti-government because I'm a libertarian, I'm not, but I've actually been impressed as I've gotten higher level, gotten to really know a lot of influential people across the board, that I find in government actually,
[03:42:43.035 --> 03:42:53.878]  More moral people, more awake people, more concerned people, especially when you get higher up, it's very strange, not at the very top, but that next to the top, they're the ones that are freaked out and want to do something.
[03:42:53.878 --> 03:42:55.738]  They got into this to really defend the country.
[03:42:55.738 --> 03:43:01.540]  I mean, somebody like you could have made, you know, $10 million a year with your science and mathematics, but you would, you know, take a pay cut and work at the NSA.
[03:43:03.280 --> 03:43:13.063]  So it's kind of a paradox that government's got so many problems, but then the corporations are just as bad, and then we tend to just either see it as good or bad.
[03:43:13.063 --> 03:43:15.704]  Are you for the government or against the government?
[03:43:15.704 --> 03:43:18.565]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[03:43:18.565 --> 03:43:31.129]  Yeah, it's not black or white for sure, and it's a matter of whether or not you agree with the underlying principles of why we formed this nation and got rid of George III.
[03:43:33.222 --> 03:43:34.002]  Or you don't.
[03:43:34.002 --> 03:43:45.271]  And the point is, more and more, people over time, I guess, we're becoming so comfortable in our living standard that we're losing what it took to get here.
[03:43:45.271 --> 03:43:53.557]  You know, we're failing to realize that in order to have all these freedoms, we had to work very hard and sacrifice a lot to get here.
[03:43:53.557 --> 03:44:00.522]  And that's what, you know, people who fought World War II have told Tom Drake when he did interviews with them.
[03:44:00.522 --> 03:44:01.603]  They were saying things like,
[03:44:02.364 --> 03:44:03.505]  What did we fight for?
[03:44:03.505 --> 03:44:07.327]  You know, given the current circumstance of where we're headed.
[03:44:07.327 --> 03:44:15.593]  I mean, we didn't fight for an omnipresent government monitoring everything the people in the country are doing.
[03:44:15.593 --> 03:44:18.475]  That's not freedom.
[03:44:18.475 --> 03:44:26.740]  And they were asking him those questions, even when he was doing interviews for the National Archives as a part of his court settlement.
[03:44:28.228 --> 03:44:29.329]  Amazing.
[03:44:29.329 --> 03:44:39.022]  So I mean it's really, I mean that's really, that's really a disturbing statement from from veterans of World War II.
[03:44:39.022 --> 03:44:42.246]  Well my grandfather, he was deeply concerned
[03:44:44.028 --> 03:44:52.011]  Because living here in Texas, they brought a lot of the rat line Nazis to Texas and New Mexico, and in the areas where he worked, he had to run into them all the time.
[03:44:52.011 --> 03:44:58.793]  And he was always pretty calm when I was a little kid, staying there for a week or so in the summer, but he would rant about all the damn Nazis.
[03:44:58.793 --> 03:45:03.075]  And he's got a lot of friends obviously killed in World War II, and all the positions in government they were in.
[03:45:03.895 --> 03:45:05.175]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
[03:45:24.591 --> 03:45:26.493]  My dog's getting a little upset here.
[03:45:26.493 --> 03:45:26.813]  I understand.
[03:45:26.813 --> 03:45:28.914]  You want to let the dog out, sir, and then we can... No, no, no.
[03:45:28.914 --> 03:45:29.615]  I'm fine.
[03:45:29.615 --> 03:45:30.316]  He's okay.
[03:45:30.316 --> 03:45:32.457]  He just wanted to be petted.
[03:45:32.457 --> 03:45:32.938]  That's all.
[03:45:32.938 --> 03:45:34.459]  What kind of dog is he?
[03:45:34.459 --> 03:45:35.179]  German Shepherd.
[03:45:35.179 --> 03:45:36.340]  He's a pretty big boy.
[03:45:36.340 --> 03:45:38.502]  He's about 125, 130 pounds.
[03:45:38.502 --> 03:45:39.463]  Something like that.
[03:45:39.463 --> 03:45:40.223]  He's a big boy.
[03:45:40.223 --> 03:45:42.885]  Well, I'm glad he survived the SWAT team raid.
[03:45:42.885 --> 03:45:43.426]  Yeah.
[03:45:43.426 --> 03:45:44.727]  Well, he wasn't here at the time.
[03:45:44.727 --> 03:45:47.088]  That was good, you know?
[03:45:47.088 --> 03:45:48.770]  Otherwise, you don't know what they would have done.
[03:45:50.206 --> 03:45:59.233]  When you looked at the federal SWAT team that came in on you, I know they probably had their faces covered, were they proud of themselves while they were throwing your house around and grabbing on you out of the shower?
[03:45:59.233 --> 03:46:00.394]  Were they proud of themselves?
[03:46:00.394 --> 03:46:08.721]  No, I think they were a bit, it seemed to me that most of them seemed a bit disturbed as to why they were there.
[03:46:08.721 --> 03:46:10.522]  That's good, that's what I've been finding.
[03:46:10.522 --> 03:46:14.686]  Yeah, and that's basically, most of them, the only one who wasn't there
[03:46:15.869 --> 03:46:23.032]  Who wasn't disturbed was the guy who signed the warrant, the Senior Special Agent Paul Maric.
[03:46:23.032 --> 03:46:25.733]  He was already cleared into the program and he knew why he was there.
[03:46:25.733 --> 03:46:35.918]  He was there to get us, to get basically, keep the cover up going on the programs that they were running that we knew about and that we were complaining to Congress about.
[03:46:36.929 --> 03:46:45.857]  So he knew that, and the rest of them didn't, so... Yeah, how dare you go to Congress, as you're supposed to by law, when the law is being broken, and secretly testify?
[03:46:45.857 --> 03:46:46.817]  How horrible!
[03:46:46.817 --> 03:46:52.482]  Let's send a... I mean, and imagine that guy getting promotions because he would engage in things like this.
[03:46:52.482 --> 03:46:55.725]  What a dishonorable person.
[03:46:55.725 --> 03:47:02.931]  Yes, that's, you know, that's hard for me to imagine people like that looking themselves in the mirror when they're shaving in the morning.
[03:47:04.707 --> 03:47:05.848]  I want to go to some phone calls.
[03:47:05.848 --> 03:47:15.635]  I'm not going to play the clip because of time, but Apple's Tim Cook, their CEO, has come out on 60 Minutes and said they don't want to go along with these different bills, that it's an invasion of privacy.
[03:47:15.635 --> 03:47:24.642]  You notice, I don't want to glorify Steve Jobs, but he held off on letting them in to the Apple encryption, and one week after he died, Apple gave up the codes.
[03:47:24.642 --> 03:47:29.386]  Do you think that's lip service by Apple for customers, or do you think it's real?
[03:47:29.386 --> 03:47:31.928]  Well, I think for Steve Jobs it was probably real for sure.
[03:47:34.468 --> 03:47:46.852]  But for the rest of them, I think... See, the problem is they also get paid for all this information and this access, so... It adds to their bottom line with no additional effort, basically, on their part.
[03:47:46.852 --> 03:47:47.792]  Well, that's another question.
[03:47:47.792 --> 03:47:58.356]  Why put up NSA and FBI stingrays, tens of thousands of them, stealing all the cell phone data, when it already runs through all the hubs and they can just have it sorted there and then bulk batch it?
[03:47:58.356 --> 03:48:01.377]  Is it because they don't want a record that it was grabbed off the hubs?
[03:48:01.377 --> 03:48:02.337]  What is the point of that?
[03:48:03.841 --> 03:48:04.582]  That's part of it.
[03:48:04.582 --> 03:48:11.570]  The other part is that it adds to a greater program that they're putting together, which is called Treasure Map.
[03:48:11.570 --> 03:48:16.136]  That's the one where they're going to be monitoring where you are every minute of the day.
[03:48:16.136 --> 03:48:17.818]  So it's a physical tracker?
[03:48:17.818 --> 03:48:18.939]  Yeah.
[03:48:18.939 --> 03:48:20.180]  It's a contributor to that.
[03:48:20.180 --> 03:48:22.083]  It's another aspect of it that they may pick up.
[03:48:22.677 --> 03:48:26.018]  Missing information that they didn't get from other sources, you know.
[03:48:26.018 --> 03:48:27.659]  Sure.
[03:48:27.659 --> 03:48:28.679]  Interlapping fields of fire.
[03:48:28.679 --> 03:48:41.965]  In fact, that's what I was told by some insiders that are pretty high up, is that they also might want to bring in an internet kill switch during a civil emergency or martial law and they're putting in an alternate government internet right now.
[03:48:41.965 --> 03:48:45.086]  I think they've pretty much already had that all along.
[03:48:45.086 --> 03:48:45.246]  Yes.
[03:48:47.312 --> 03:48:50.474]  But they're going operational to command and control the local police.
[03:48:50.474 --> 03:48:51.235]  Yeah.
[03:48:51.235 --> 03:48:53.696]  That's another disturbing part, yeah.
[03:48:53.696 --> 03:48:54.677]  Good God.
[03:48:54.677 --> 03:48:55.478]  This takeover.
[03:48:55.478 --> 03:49:00.161]  Hillary said, I want it to be a Manhattan Project to protect us from terrorists and the internet.
[03:49:00.161 --> 03:49:03.683]  I've always called it a giant secret Manhattan Project takeover.
[03:49:03.683 --> 03:49:06.085]  And now she's calling it that, sir.
[03:49:06.085 --> 03:49:07.986]  Yeah.
[03:49:07.986 --> 03:49:10.108]  Well, I think that's fundamentally what it is.
[03:49:10.108 --> 03:49:13.330]  We're becoming a very effective police state.
[03:49:14.597 --> 03:49:19.959]  Much more than any other totalitarian state or system has ever developed.
[03:49:19.959 --> 03:49:20.799]  Absolutely.
[03:49:20.799 --> 03:49:24.520]  Let's talk to Brandon in FEMA Region 3.
[03:49:24.520 --> 03:49:25.560]  Got about a minute and a half to break.
[03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:29.301]  Go ahead with your question, Brandon, for William Benny.
[03:49:29.301 --> 03:49:42.845]  Hey, I wanted to get Mr. Benny's opinion on the FBI, NSA, and even the CIA coming out and saying that they're tapping people's phones without warrants and that it's to protect us, but if
[03:49:43.587 --> 03:49:49.192]  But I actually know a cop who did it and had a warrant, and he was later indicted and thrown under the bus for it.
[03:49:49.192 --> 03:49:52.215]  But if the feds do it, it's perfectly okay.
[03:49:52.215 --> 03:50:01.603]  Can you maybe get into that and break down... Yeah, what about the hypocrisy of parallel construction and the rest of it, but if a local gets caught doing it, it's federal or state prison time?
[03:50:03.154 --> 03:50:07.297]  Well, you know, it's the arrogance of the intelligence.
[03:50:07.297 --> 03:50:18.904]  I mean, NSA, CIA, FBI are really at the core of this, just like they were at the core of the material that was used to impeach and indict Richard Nixon.
[03:50:19.484 --> 03:50:33.592]  These are the main players in the central collection and acquisition and use of material like all the emails, phone calls, financial transactions and so on that are being collected primarily by NSA.
[03:50:33.592 --> 03:50:38.475]  They're becoming basically the central repository and processor for all this information.
[03:50:38.475 --> 03:50:41.356]  But they've all been in it together from the beginning.
[03:50:41.356 --> 03:50:46.459]  That goes back even to shortly after World War II when CIA and NSA were created.
[03:50:48.860 --> 03:50:49.941]  Thank you, Brandon.
[03:50:49.941 --> 03:50:51.042]  William Binney, stay there, sir.
[03:50:51.042 --> 03:50:52.003]  Come back and finish that comment.
[03:50:52.003 --> 03:50:52.764]  We'll take more calls.
[03:50:52.764 --> 03:50:54.906]  The website's exposedfacts.org.
[03:50:54.906 --> 03:50:56.908]  Folks, don't take an interview like this for granted.
[03:50:56.908 --> 03:50:58.870]  Spread this to everybody you know.

[03:51:58.576 --> 03:52:07.621]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[03:52:07.621 --> 03:52:14.104]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[03:52:14.104 --> 03:52:15.805]  The numbers are staggering.
[03:52:15.805 --> 03:52:22.369]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[03:52:22.529 --> 03:52:26.051]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[03:52:26.051 --> 03:52:27.431]  Don't let them win.

[03:52:40.296 --> 03:52:41.197]  But don't worry.
[03:52:41.197 --> 03:52:46.339]  If yours doesn't, just to promote the concept of using the money on your gift cards,
[03:52:46.519 --> 03:52:49.800]  The discount goes to everybody that uses the promo code.

[03:52:58.403 --> 03:53:02.445]  Are you tired of commuting to a job that makes someone else rich?
[03:53:02.445 --> 03:53:05.146]  Working harder than ever, but getting nowhere?
[03:53:05.146 --> 03:53:09.747]  Do you hate spending hundreds of dollars every week on daycare?
[03:53:09.747 --> 03:53:11.788]  Having someone else raise your children?

[03:54:02.382 --> 03:54:03.162]  Welcome back, folks.
[03:54:03.162 --> 03:54:04.083]  Alex Jones here live.
[03:54:06.684 --> 03:54:10.687]  Mr. Benny will be with us five minutes to the next hour, then I'm going to cover news and continue with your phone calls.
[03:54:10.687 --> 03:54:17.393]  We have special reports as well.
[03:54:17.393 --> 03:54:20.295]  Folks, we know all the stuff that's happening is illegal.
[03:54:20.295 --> 03:54:23.257]  We know it's been used everywhere else to oppress people.
[03:54:23.257 --> 03:54:28.562]  There is a global race for surveillance by all these different countries and companies.
[03:54:28.562 --> 03:54:29.542]  They've broken all the rules.
[03:54:29.542 --> 03:54:33.666]  They've set up an economy based on gaming things, based on manipulation now.
[03:54:33.666 --> 03:54:36.008]  The stock markets, the interest rates, it's all fake.
[03:54:37.068 --> 03:54:38.969]  And it's ended the free market.
[03:54:38.969 --> 03:54:40.490]  It's ending capitalism.
[03:54:40.490 --> 03:54:45.553]  And then they're blaming capitalism for the standard of living beginning to slide.
[03:54:45.553 --> 03:54:47.654]  No, this is like a rigged casino.
[03:54:47.654 --> 03:54:49.435]  Casino's not capitalist.
[03:54:49.435 --> 03:54:52.997]  It's a con game.
[03:54:52.997 --> 03:54:56.799]  And the elites have no bottom now, it seems.
[03:54:56.799 --> 03:54:58.580]  They'll do anything.
[03:54:58.580 --> 03:55:00.681]  Because after all, Karl Rove said they control reality.
[03:55:01.926 --> 03:55:03.587]  Hitler and Napoleon thought that too.
[03:55:03.587 --> 03:55:07.308]  William Binning, former NSA technical director, is our guest.
[03:55:07.308 --> 03:55:11.590]  We're taking phone calls for him right now.
[03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:14.911]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Kansas.
[03:55:14.911 --> 03:55:17.072]  Oh no, I'm sorry, Mr. Binning got cut off by the break.
[03:55:17.072 --> 03:55:19.052]  What was the point you were making, sir?
[03:55:19.052 --> 03:55:28.236]  Well, it was just that they're so arrogant now about even violating all the fundamental principles of our country that they think they can get away with anything.
[03:55:29.184 --> 03:55:40.211]  So, I mean, they don't seem to be afraid of anything, when in fact I think that's when we need to start standing up and making it clear that we're going to come after them for what they're doing.
[03:55:40.211 --> 03:55:40.932]  That's right.
[03:55:40.932 --> 03:55:42.613]  They want to normalize all their activities.
[03:55:42.613 --> 03:55:45.374]  Jeremy in Kansas, go ahead.
[03:55:45.374 --> 03:55:52.479]  Amen to the theme of today's show, which is about moral courage, even or especially when it's scary and unpopular.
[03:55:53.007 --> 03:56:07.957]  So I want to ask a question about our necessary political strategy to restore and rejuvenate our inherent natural right by asserting that the precursor to moral courage is intellectual courage or epistemological courage.
[03:56:07.957 --> 03:56:21.646]  And that the way that we're going to overcome the falsified left-right paradigm and overcome the perception managers is by going to the heart of what is actually being used against us, which is terrorism, state-sponsored terrorism.
[03:56:22.248 --> 03:56:32.096]  And to do, you know, we see the manifestation of this after September 11th rolling out in Paris and... Sure, let me get William Benny's take on that as we get to other callers, but it's a good point.
[03:56:32.096 --> 03:56:42.104]  They're opening the borders, they're letting terrorists in bare minimum, they are stand-downs on 9-11, they are not letting the NSA do its job against real terrorists, it's constitutionally protected.
[03:56:42.104 --> 03:56:45.867]  I mean, it's so obvious they're letting the terrorism take place to take our rights.
[03:56:45.867 --> 03:56:47.368]  How do we shatter that paradigm?
[03:56:47.368 --> 03:56:50.010]  It seems like we are, as it comes out, that the government's running ISIS.
[03:56:51.673 --> 03:56:55.194]  Well, yeah, I think that exposure is certainly the key.
[03:56:55.194 --> 03:56:57.475]  I think that's the sunlight part of it.
[03:56:57.475 --> 03:56:59.796]  But that caller is absolutely right.
[03:56:59.796 --> 03:57:05.198]  I mean, what they're doing is they're using, first of all, they say they have to do bulk acquisition and it buries their analyst.
[03:57:05.198 --> 03:57:06.438]  They can't figure anything out.
[03:57:06.438 --> 03:57:07.299]  They can't focus.
[03:57:07.299 --> 03:57:08.239]  So that means
[03:57:09.016 --> 03:57:18.424]  That more terrorist attack occurs, and every time one does, they go into their data and they find out, oh yeah, we knew about these fellows, but they didn't do anything before to stop it, you see.
[03:57:18.424 --> 03:57:26.471]  So they use now that terrorist attack to lobby for more money, more control, more information, more knowledge, for example.
[03:57:26.471 --> 03:57:29.794]  I would point to the French and their example, their experience too.
[03:57:29.794 --> 03:57:34.518]  I mean, the previous, earlier this year, the attack in Paris,
[03:57:35.179 --> 03:57:35.580]  I think so.
[03:57:47.244 --> 03:57:48.045]  They're profiling!
[03:58:12.694 --> 03:58:14.054]  Of people who do bad things.
[03:58:14.054 --> 03:58:15.975]  And they've got all that information already.
[03:58:15.975 --> 03:58:18.915]  It's just that they aren't acting on it until after this act.
[03:58:18.915 --> 03:58:20.856]  Stay there when we come back for a final segment, sir.
[03:58:20.856 --> 03:58:21.696]  We're honored for your time.
[03:58:21.696 --> 03:58:24.777]  I want to take it to the next level, though.
[03:58:24.777 --> 03:58:27.958]  The good people in government can't do anything because of the fog of all the data.
[03:58:27.958 --> 03:58:36.300]  But the bad ones behind the scenes, they sent the feds down to stop the FBI from stopping the San Bernardino shooters two years ago.
[03:58:36.300 --> 03:58:37.360]  So there's even more there.
[03:58:37.360 --> 03:58:39.500]  They're actually protecting them at one level.
[03:58:39.500 --> 03:58:41.461]  It's even worse.
[03:58:41.461 --> 03:58:41.941]  Stay with us.
