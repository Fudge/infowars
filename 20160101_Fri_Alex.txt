[00:00.000 --> 00:12.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.180 --> 00:20.340]  he's Alex on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.340 --> 00:25.500]  just had a nice talk with Michael Savage during the break and he said Alex
[00:25.500 --> 00:29.360]  you're the only host that gets me to blow my voice out you bring out my my
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.280]  anger I'm gonna have to air this interview on my show today and I said
[00:32.280 --> 00:35.120]  yes permission I said of course feel free to do it he's still gonna be live
[00:35.120 --> 00:40.440]  later this afternoon but part of the show will be this last hour because he did
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.000]  did just blow his voice out he was coughing there in the break because it
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.080]  is we're being assaulted and even if you don't agree with me a hundred percent or
[00:47.080 --> 00:52.440]  Michael Savage a hundred percent we are being conquered and we're not being
[00:52.440 --> 00:55.840]  conquered like you know the Romans show up and they give you aqueducts and
[00:55.840 --> 00:58.800]  you're still a kind of a slave but you know it's better than what the slavery
[00:58.800 --> 01:02.520]  you had a year before as you could argue some of those regimes you know about
[01:02.520 --> 01:06.560]  2,000 years ago 3,000 years ago well 2,200 years ago as the Roman Empire
[01:06.560 --> 01:14.200]  started up were worse than the Romans it's not like loving space aliens have
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.440]  showed up that want to give us free energy it's like aliens have showed up
[01:17.440 --> 01:20.760]  that want to harvest our organs or something and I'm not saying the
[01:20.760 --> 01:25.200]  globalist are aliens it's an analogy they don't have our best interest at
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.000]  heart they have disdain for the public they live on these giant beautiful
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.280]  resort community areas on thousands of acres of peace people like Pelosi and
[01:36.280 --> 01:41.840]  others and then they're at war with free market rich people because I know I've
[01:41.840 --> 01:44.720]  been in these communities I know a lot of rich people I've been invited to some
[01:44.720 --> 01:48.320]  very interesting places and they'll be like helicopter pads across the way
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.040]  and they'll say yeah that guy's the CEO of this you know he hates my guts and
[01:52.040 --> 01:56.360]  and this guy over here over here is okay but he's leaving the country and that
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.240]  lady over there I'm kind of working on her but you know she's just ignorant
[01:59.240 --> 02:03.040]  she got ignorant people that are ultra rich you got really hard-working folks
[02:03.040 --> 02:06.240]  that made their money themselves or took some family money and made it even
[02:06.240 --> 02:10.040]  bigger they're almost always free market they believe in people they believe in
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.600]  humanity they like getting down on the trenches they're not disgusted by the
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.000]  masses of people but you get around a globalist gangster they are the most
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.120]  neurotic weirdos their staff won't look them in the eyes they're totally hateful
[02:26.120 --> 02:36.920]  they're super cold they're always into beating people sexually that's what the
[02:36.920 --> 02:41.560]  elites are into is hurting people that's their sexual fetish I don't mean like
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.360]  some light spanking or something I mean really brutal stuff and and they're
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.600]  into being brutalized they like hurting good things
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.920]  pedophilia is rampant in the elites just just just rampant and you see that in
[02:55.920 --> 02:59.920]  sociology it comes out but it's it's much worse than the statistics show it
[02:59.920 --> 03:06.760]  is I know so many people that also know really rich people some of the biggest
[03:06.760 --> 03:13.000]  names in America and I'll say at dinner I'll say tell me what are they into
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.040]  sexually and I'll say what are they into religiously and always out of the
[03:18.040 --> 03:26.680]  person's mouth is Satanism the occult I mean these are really unhappy people and
[03:26.680 --> 03:29.960]  that's all they've got to the darkness and I don't mean some guy that goes to a
[03:29.960 --> 03:32.680]  rock and roll show and wears a pentagram t-shirt because he thinks the
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.000]  devil's cool I mean people with helicopters and in 15 jets and 20
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.720]  mansions and you know had mistresses when they were 15 years old and now have
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.840]  you know just sex operatives all over the place I mean these folks are
[03:46.840 --> 03:56.000]  completely jacked and they know talent when they see it to they know resistance
[03:56.000 --> 04:04.120]  when they see it and I told people this 18 years ago and I've told people this
[04:04.120 --> 04:10.600]  over time and now folks can see that it was true a lot of us come out in the
[04:10.600 --> 04:17.040]  news but I personally was offered you know to join the New World Order
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.640]  repeatedly off record and people said well just tell us who well then if I do
[04:21.640 --> 04:25.640]  that I've lost the confidence I don't even if it's a bad person if they're not
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.240]  telling me something legal and it's in confidence I don't ever tell them I don't
[04:29.240 --> 04:35.760]  ever tell I don't tell my wife about it plus it's dangerous dangerous type stuff
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.560]  but this morning I was on the elliptical and I really had a big epiphany I was
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.200]  watching some show called bling on VH1 that they had it on I wasn't watching it
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.080]  and it was just flashing this purse this car this this thing for the masses to
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.880]  watch it was just the most soul-sucking garbage and it's like who would sell out
[04:52.880 --> 04:57.120]  for that to hang around with a bunch of those of mummies
[04:57.640 --> 05:02.400]  Bill Cosby has been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea
[05:02.400 --> 05:08.360]  Constan in 2004 crimes punishable by five to ten years in prison and a $25,000
[05:08.360 --> 05:13.280]  fine but what about the other bill former US president Bill Clinton whose past
[05:13.280 --> 05:16.960]  predatory behavior is once again in the spotlight after Hillary tried
[05:16.960 --> 05:22.080]  unsuccessfully to play the sexism card against Trump for years Bill Cosby
[05:22.080 --> 05:26.080]  continued raking in millions while the media covered up his dirt in order to
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.880]  preserve his legacy but even after exposing years of predatory sexual
[05:29.880 --> 05:34.120]  behavior Bill Clinton remains a highly revered member of the Democratic Party
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.000]  pulling in tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees while Hillary was
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.240]  Secretary of State for someone running a campaign on female empowerment
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.320]  Hillary can't seem to shake accusations that she defamed threatened and
[05:46.320 --> 05:51.240]  attempted to personally destroy Bill's bimbos in order to silence them and
[05:51.240 --> 05:54.480]  protect their abuser and her rise to power

[08:30.000 --> 08:37.200]  well I could not think of a better guess to have on to give us more information
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.920]  about the Benghazi hearings and about the current situation that he predicted
[08:41.920 --> 08:47.320]  back when Benghazi happened now unfolding in Syria and that's because he
[08:47.320 --> 08:52.720]  ran Operation Stratus IV able danger and other secret operations against
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.320]  Al Qaeda and the Wahhabis in Afghanistan and other countries and he was ordered
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.160]  not once but twice to not pull the trigger to kill bin Laden when they knew
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.480]  exactly where he was in 2001 before 9-11 we just of course had Michael
[09:07.480 --> 09:10.680]  Savage on the last hour about Jerome course he's coming up the next hour
[09:10.680 --> 09:16.160]  Colonel Schaefer joins us for the next 20 minutes LondonCenter.org is one of the
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.600]  consultancies he is engaged in he of course blew the whistle about some of
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.120]  the stand-downs going after bin Laden they tried to persecute him as a whistle
[09:25.120 --> 09:28.360]  lower but he survived that thanks to support he's also a best-selling
[09:28.360 --> 09:34.000]  author and has a new book out we'll tell you about as well but before we do that
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.680]  I just got to say well Colonel Schaefer it's got to be good for you being one
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.880]  of the first people to expose what was happening in Benghazi and I know taking
[09:43.880 --> 09:47.680]  a lot of heat to now see more and more of it come out has that taken some of the
[09:47.680 --> 09:53.000]  heat off you why yes or no Alex I mean I think you and others supported me on
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.560]  this day one thank you what that said it's been a very popular position even
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.360]  now because you know what the heart of this is really Hillary Clinton who is
[10:02.360 --> 10:08.080]  the chosen one for the Democrat candidacy for president so as much as I
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.600]  think rational people and by the way I've been getting questions from the left
[10:12.600 --> 10:15.560]  so my friends on the left saying hey do you really think this is all true it's
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.680]  like yeah it's all true and I think the hearings should have if it was a
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.240]  Democrat Congress questioning a Republican candidate who had been a
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.640]  little over for that candidate but instead the very email Alex which they
[10:29.640 --> 10:35.000]  have completely chose it show that she gave us what was lying and even in the
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.680]  end when they asked her about the arms deal which by the way has been highly
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.160]  documented by the investigation by whistleblowers everybody knows there was
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.200]  an arms deal at the heart of Benghazi she got away with lying about that which
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.000]  frankly at this point my understanding is the Congress is now looking at
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.440]  perjury charges because she they have evidence that she did know about the
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.360]  arms deal of trying to get these arms moved around Libya moving him into
[10:59.360 --> 11:03.640]  Turkey which then in turn they were being moved into Syria and by the way
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.960]  another guy who I respect immensely was involved in that it's been a general
[11:07.960 --> 11:11.640]  Mike Flynn the director of BIA has admitted on the record that yes he was
[11:11.640 --> 11:15.120]  part of the arms deal he was directed to do this sort of thing so Alex that
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.760]  there's just there's just no doubt about what was at center of Benghazi and yet
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.320]  the mainstream media continues to ignore it and people like me here
[11:23.320 --> 11:28.080]  continued to you know media matters can even now consistently says that
[11:28.080 --> 11:32.760]  somehow I'm fantasizing about what happened at Benghazi it's truly it's
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.240]  really bizarre well you were one of the first within a week of it happening to
[11:36.240 --> 11:39.920]  come on this show and to go on Fox and other channels and and talk about an
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.560]  arms deal talk about the Turkish ambassador to break down what happened to
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.520]  warn about missiles getting into the hands of Al Qaeda the fact that ISIS
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.840]  once it came up a few years ago you said no that is a Wahhabist group as well
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.560]  Al Nuzra Al Qaeda that's all been proven to be accurate now and we see this
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.600]  whole thing metastasizing you said last year that there should be criminal
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.600]  charges in a Newsmax article for Hillary and the clear cover-up so I would
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.200]  imagine that in a way you might be under more heat now because it is an
[12:12.200 --> 12:18.400]  election year why this is interesting because that's yes and no because
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.960]  clearly Alex is part of the issue now becomes talk on the other side that
[12:21.960 --> 12:25.480]  we're Republican is used to their advantage so I think if Hillary does
[12:25.480 --> 12:28.160]  survive the primaries that the Republicans are going to go into this
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.640]  with a great deal of ammunition he is against her because this is all again
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.640]  on the record so yeah I think my Democrat friends are pretty upset with me
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.320]  about the fact that you know there are Democrats who actually recognize what's
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.640]  going on but because they are so loyal to their party they choose to look the
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.080]  other way and those are the guys I think I'm most opposed with odds with but then
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.720]  again you know we've talked to a part of what I do my job is to talk to
[12:54.720 --> 12:57.880]  presidential candidates I can't say by name who they are but we've talked to
[12:57.880 --> 13:01.760]  them all as best we can and the idea is what we're going to give them
[13:01.760 --> 13:07.280]  fashionable information that is that is based on what is known and can be
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.560]  proven be a hard copy document so this now at this point like you point out
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.240]  now like this this is all hard copy well researched fully recognized as fact
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.920]  that there was an arms deal that Hillary Clinton was involved that the deal
[13:21.920 --> 13:27.920]  went bad that the she knew the night of the attack or the day after the 12th
[13:27.920 --> 13:34.800]  of September that that you had al-Qaeda terrorists involved and frankly I still
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.040]  stand by my belief that they they were fully willing to allow Chris Stevens to
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.840]  go to his death knowing something is going to happen sure well I've interviewed
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.640]  other whistleblowers after you've been on talks plumbly others CIA pilots and
[13:46.640 --> 13:49.920]  others and I've talked to other military people I'm just gonna leave it at that
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.120]  it's known that there were drones overhead you said that years ago it's
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.160]  come out you've come out and said you've gotten intel that Obama was watching a
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.680]  part of the seven hours as it unfolded I think that I stick by my I stick by that
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.640]  comment yes then well this is just outrageous then I mean is it an arms deal
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.400]  and they didn't know what to do or does it go further did somebody in a
[14:11.400 --> 14:17.400]  government outside of al-Qaeda want to get rid of the ambassador so there
[14:17.400 --> 14:23.040]  wouldn't be any fingerprints on this arms transfer but it's very clear at this
[14:23.040 --> 14:28.360]  point that Stevens was the key he was the pivotal the pivot man he do
[14:28.360 --> 14:32.640]  everything he was involved you know it was his interest to do this he they
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.080]  really thought Alex the time and this is one of the biggest conceptions I think
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.040]  what we're going to continue to pay for this for this mistake for years but the
[14:41.040 --> 14:45.040]  Muslim Brotherhood to be a trusted ally that they would be a good ally a good
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.720]  proxy to work with us in place of our other Arab allies and that was what
[14:49.720 --> 14:53.880]  their assumption was so I think when they started seeing that the Brotherhood was
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.320]  not going to be a good partner they were too far in to say we can't we can't
[14:57.320 --> 15:01.160]  stop it I think they got themselves in over their head I think Chris Stevens
[15:01.160 --> 15:07.160]  was part of that that completely ill pot badly managed effort to bring the
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.000]  Brotherhood into essentially our spirit of influence and I think because of that
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.320]  because they all start going bad and look Hillary Clinton is not a stupid
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.320]  woman at all I think they recognize that as much as they needed to get rid of
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.560]  information to get rid of people this was a good way to let things fly and
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.240]  that's why you didn't see I mean Alex think about this this was about a
[15:27.240 --> 15:30.880]  little more than about a two months out before a major presidential election
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.280]  how was it you don't do maximum effort to go recover and a master who goes
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.360]  missing think about that if it was under any other president that I know of that
[15:39.360 --> 15:41.840]  would have been the primary thing everybody would have been scrambling to
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.960]  figure out where it was at well we know they were countermanning the the the
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.040]  orders of the military to save these people and so when they get caught I
[15:50.040 --> 15:54.560]  mean we know they did it it's going to bring them all down and so as you
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.320]  stipulate that there is documentary evidence again that someone ordered
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.040]  every command and keep in mind Alex there's an automatic process once a
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.040]  terror attack is undergoing once an embassy is under siege there's an
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.280]  automatic process which kicks in that it's basically the the worst-case
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.320]  scenario people start moving someone called around to every command and go
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.400]  headquarters and stopped so that means someone had to literally intercede
[16:19.400 --> 16:23.480]  directly and stopping all of the military actions occurring and this is
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.720]  this remains one of those areas where we we know bits and pieces we don't all
[16:26.720 --> 16:30.320]  take your but yes someone did order all the forces which would have been
[16:30.320 --> 16:34.240]  scrambling to get to Libya stand down so that why would you do that so that
[16:34.240 --> 16:37.640]  that's where I mean let me ask you this big question now that we see the
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.520]  aftermath years later ISIS which is just Al Qaeda as you do in your
[16:43.520 --> 16:46.360]  organization you go around educate Congress you educate the candidates
[16:46.360 --> 16:50.160]  you're in an info war with the truth when the White House three years ago was
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.440]  saying oh these are all good rebels they're wonderful you went and exposed
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.600]  that with other military people that it was almost all radical Saudi Arabian
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.240]  Wahhabist so they clearly know that then then what are they thinking what's the
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.560]  end game where is this going what are they gonna do like I asked you years
[17:05.560 --> 17:09.560]  ago when this first happened what are they gonna do when radicals use those
[17:09.560 --> 17:13.360]  stinger missiles and other service air missiles to shoot down airliners they
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.320]  can't cover it all up what's going to unfold what were they thinking I mean you
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.160]  know in the old days just 15 years ago used to run missions some of us come
[17:21.160 --> 17:25.440]  out in the news trying to find old stingers you guys would go through all
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.600]  sorts of hell just to get a few old stingers now you've got hundreds of
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.840]  of modern ones being given to these crazies what is the establishment
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.920]  thinking why is at this point in time I think that's part of the issues they
[17:37.920 --> 17:43.360]  got completely out of control they know for example I like that these
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.760]  things are kind of scattered all over and I think this is where the real firm
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.600]  remains because the last time a credible terrorist organization tried this was
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.640]  al-Qaeda in 2002 in Kenya where they attempted to take down the two Israeli
[17:55.640 --> 17:58.880]  charter aircraft it didn't work for any number of reasons thank goodness but
[17:58.880 --> 18:04.160]  imagine now we have that that situation where al-Qaeda does have and ISIS does
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.480]  have literally crazy these things and I think this is where we don't know what's
[18:08.480 --> 18:11.840]  going on and I think we're blind what what's the end game well I don't know
[18:11.840 --> 18:15.040]  exactly what the leadership was thinking other than they thought they
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.480]  could deal with some of these these really worst of the worst terrorists to
[18:20.480 --> 18:23.440]  think that they could be our partners in the Middle East to bring some level of
[18:23.440 --> 18:27.640]  different stability and frankly you know the whole thing of trying to partner
[18:27.640 --> 18:32.280]  with the Free Syrian Army and the al-Nusra Front it was all ill-conceived but I
[18:32.280 --> 18:35.920]  think to be honest with you there's an Eric from the left Alex that permeates
[18:35.920 --> 18:39.400]  their thinking where they think they're the smartest people in the room this is
[18:39.400 --> 18:43.240]  that the analogy is in raw we had Jeffrey Skilling right down there in
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.000]  Texas and in raw thinking that they were the smartest guys in the room and they
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.160]  could do things that no one else has ever done I think that that's hot it's been
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.960]  the one of the problems with the left or they will think you know despite the
[18:55.960 --> 18:59.360]  fact they have all these people available then to help educate them they
[18:59.360 --> 19:02.240]  think they're smarter than everybody else they go off on these real really
[19:02.240 --> 19:07.560]  idiotic ill-conceived concepts of operations which result in a tragedy and
[19:07.560 --> 19:11.200]  I think that's what's going on here on a recap one of the best moments I've
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.640]  seen in the US Army and just the Pentagon in general really showing some
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.120]  moral leadership I mean I wouldn't say mutiny against the president but but
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.160]  just not following illegal orders as you know and you can talk about some of the
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.480]  inside baseball it's not classified I'd like to hear some more but even came out
[19:29.480 --> 19:35.120]  in the news what two years ago when Rand Paul and Senator Cruz and others were
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.560]  saying we're not going to be Al Qaeda's Air Force the military even before that
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.400]  was holding up the signs on the internet saying we're not going to be in a
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.240]  Syrian civil war we're not going to back Al Qaeda we're not going to be part of it
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.840]  and then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs the time General Dempsey on that
[19:49.840 --> 19:53.960]  Saturday night went to Obama and it even came out later I was told this but it
[19:53.960 --> 19:58.640]  came out months later and said do not do this you cannot do it it is insane the
[19:58.640 --> 20:02.200]  military is going to go along with it that is such a historic moment and that's
[20:02.200 --> 20:07.240]  got to really concern the criminals that are running this government I'm just
[20:07.240 --> 20:11.920]  going to say it that's like a moment where it's not Operation Valkyrie with
[20:11.920 --> 20:16.000]  the military trying to take out Hitler in Germany it's just the military saying
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.800]  we're not going to follow that order well everybody recognized Alex that the
[20:19.800 --> 20:23.080]  people we were trying to support were indeed completely affiliated it's not
[20:23.080 --> 20:27.040]  wholly owned by Al Qaeda so why would you do that and this is where you know
[20:27.040 --> 20:31.600]  the solution would be worse than the problem look look no down here
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.760]  President Assad is a bad guy he has killed his own people he is truly a death
[20:35.760 --> 20:41.160]  spot but frankly we recognize what happened in Libya when we allowed for
[20:41.160 --> 20:47.000]  those elements to include Al Qaeda and by the way do you remember Alex a Qaddafi
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.360]  was warning us saying hey these people who are opposing me are not the simple
[20:51.360 --> 20:54.960]  you know revolutionary thinkers who want democracy these people these folks are
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.400]  Al Qaeda and sure enough we have a combination of Al Qaeda and ISIS now
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.000]  running Libya so this is clearly it's something the military and the people I
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.040]  deal with understood from day one that you cannot bring in Al Qaeda thinking
[21:07.040 --> 21:10.620]  that they're going to be an ally to get rid of Assad and think somehow they're
[21:10.620 --> 21:14.440]  going to continue to support your position we tried this in Afghanistan
[21:14.440 --> 21:19.440]  that we helped create something called the economy network as part of the
[21:19.440 --> 21:23.560]  Pakistani intelligence service back in the 80s to go against the Russians well
[21:23.560 --> 21:28.280]  once the Russians left the Connie network supported coming after us that
[21:28.280 --> 21:32.880]  they've been one of the main killers of US and Afghan forces since we've
[21:32.880 --> 21:37.240]  been there so we cannot believe for a minute that Al Qaeda or affiliates or
[21:37.240 --> 21:42.000]  anyone who believes like Al Qaeda can be dealt with in a friendly way to achieve
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.440]  a short-term objective and think somehow they're not going to come back after
[21:45.440 --> 21:50.080]  after us to attack us after that fact I think Dempsey recognize that a number of
[21:50.080 --> 21:53.960]  us recognize that but again we have these political leaders who Alex think
[21:53.960 --> 21:57.180]  they're smarter than everybody else and they continue to try to do these
[21:57.180 --> 22:02.000]  truly insane dangerous things Colonel Schaffer is our guest London Center dot
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.120]  org just segueing briefly one of your latest books predicts the breakdown of
[22:07.120 --> 22:12.240]  the border basically a soft civil war this was two years ago you said watch
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.360]  it's coming you know this is a lot of stuff I couldn't put in a nonfiction
[22:16.360 --> 22:19.560]  book so I put it in a fiction book I want to talk about that book someone
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.280]  talk about what's happening in Europe but the controlled left they're not just
[22:23.280 --> 22:27.640]  this stupid they really hate the West they've said that the head of the UN
[22:27.640 --> 22:33.040]  migrant agency Peter Sutherland has said we want to get rid of Western culture
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.120]  they're bringing in they admit 80% military age men they're mainly the
[22:38.120 --> 22:41.500]  folks that invaded Syria they're not really Syrian rebels I mean I know you
[22:41.500 --> 22:45.800]  know all this they're not really Syrian refugees what is the plan open borders
[22:45.800 --> 22:50.240]  here open borders there what is the left trying to do why are they so
[22:50.240 --> 22:54.240]  affiliated with radical Islamists that would put a hood over their wife's head
[22:54.240 --> 22:59.120]  and literally not let women drive cars why is the left supporting these people
[22:59.120 --> 23:03.040]  well I think the left is essentially the vanguard of the third world I mean I
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.400]  had a friend of mine basically positive at this morning basically they are the
[23:07.400 --> 23:11.040]  third world and they're trying to make cuts the third world so that's why you
[23:11.040 --> 23:14.600]  see this sort of thing they want to import people who will radicalize who
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.520]  will be established that the basic Western principles which have made us
[23:18.520 --> 23:22.120]  very strong the conditions that we've created in the West Alex for better for
[23:22.120 --> 23:26.320]  worse of the best mankind has ever seen we have the most people ever who have
[23:26.320 --> 23:31.480]  clean water clean homes a good used to be a good healthcare system which is now
[23:31.480 --> 23:35.400]  being diminished by Obamacare and again this third world idea that we have to
[23:35.400 --> 23:39.880]  be essentially treat everybody the same that's what they want this idea they
[23:39.880 --> 23:45.000]  use fairness as a value to say you know Alex you live too high you shouldn't be
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.240]  living as well as you do you shouldn't have a nice car you should be living at
[23:48.240 --> 23:52.800]  a level like someone lives in in a rural Kenya and their idea of fairness is
[23:52.800 --> 23:56.560]  we're all the same and anything extraordinary anything that's good or
[23:56.560 --> 24:00.440]  bad it's all the same so I think that's why you see the left work so hard here
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.120]  to be able right every Western nation and that's something we have to be aware
[24:04.120 --> 24:07.960]  of and then you've got these ultra rich that make their money off of government
[24:07.960 --> 24:12.040]  contracts waging war against new rich you actually create jobs and wealth
[24:12.040 --> 24:16.560]  teaming up with the third world it is just sickening to watch well well here's
[24:16.560 --> 24:20.720]  the key you predicted it's just crazy how after you've been Colonel Shafer I'm
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.400]  not kissing your butt it's just no brag just fact you predicted right when
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.680]  Benghazi happened that next to Syria then you said next is Europe what are
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.400]  they gonna do I think it's not a question of if it when they try or they
[24:32.400 --> 24:37.760]  succeed to shoot down one or more major passenger liners on the outskirts maybe
[24:37.760 --> 24:41.480]  Eastern Europe Russia wherever they can get these missiles how can they get the
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.640]  missiles into Western Europe can they get them into the US how long till that
[24:45.640 --> 24:49.000]  happens or am I wrong can we stop it and then what do you see happening in
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.600]  Syria well this is kind of a part to a tupper what you see right now as you
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.560]  point out aptly is that these these males these so-called refugees are not
[24:57.560 --> 25:01.320]  actually military age males are going into the vanguard and the first thing
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.520]  you do is a terrorist organization Alex you set up a trusted network to climb
[25:04.520 --> 25:07.480]  this the network once you have the network in place you can move these
[25:07.480 --> 25:10.640]  things around with the community right now they don't have a trusted network that
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.280]  can do that you saw the attacks in France where ISIS was able to and Al-Qaeda was
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.440]  able to a few things under the radar they're finding AK-47s full auto from
[25:19.440 --> 25:23.760]  the Middle East now in France exactly so that was it that was the first test
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.400]  okay it worked so now then if you see it works if you expand it so now you see
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.360]  the expansion of phase one of getting all these people into Europe and setting up
[25:32.360 --> 25:35.800]  trusted and clandestine network after the networks in place Alex they could
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.460]  move the missiles around with the Q2D there's no way law enforcement or
[25:39.460 --> 25:43.480]  intelligence can stop and search every single vehicle moving around or every
[25:43.480 --> 25:46.840]  single boat coming in and out so again once you get it once you flood the
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.400]  market so to speak it makes it it's definitely easier to move weapons such
[25:51.400 --> 25:56.920]  as stickers around you can do with an AK-47 on a low scale it basically increased
[25:56.920 --> 25:59.800]  by an order of magnitude and then you can do it with impurity that's where they're
[25:59.800 --> 26:05.880]  going with all this the Russians where do you see the situation in Syria going
[26:05.880 --> 26:10.600]  how big of a defeat to Obama wasn't that Putin came in do you think the Russians
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.200]  are being suckered into a new Afghanistan what about the plane being shot
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.640]  now I think the Russians are seeing I think it was an attack I think it was
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.640]  done by a Lockerbie type attack where you had a bomb on the aircraft your
[26:22.640 --> 26:27.200]  suicide bomber all the pictures I've now it's the case today that it was a
[26:27.200 --> 26:32.960]  explosion from the inside not an explosion got a bomb inside right and so
[26:32.960 --> 26:36.040]  so I think the Russians have got their first real casualties in the war and
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.800]  God bless them I'm glad they're going they need to stabilize serious they can't
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.360]  this is our one joint objective should be a stabilizing Syria even if you don't
[26:44.360 --> 26:47.080]  like Assad stabilize there because otherwise you're going to continue to
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.280]  be al-Qaeda and I just kind of using that region as a base of operation and
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.320]  of course al-Qaeda hits Russia even more than they had us on average right what
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.720]  do you expect the Russians to do if some of the voices calling for some type of
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.680]  military containment or a no flies on I mean we've all heard the talk from
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.760]  former generals let's start killing Russians that's some really dangerous
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.040]  talk it is no the Russians are doing what I think we should have been doing I
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.600]  think it's why such a big blow to President Obama frankly Alex and with
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.240]  that said you know our military I talked to the post Pentagon our military will
[27:23.240 --> 27:26.560]  continue to judge itself professionally with the Russians we're going to do
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.360]  anything to antagonize them as much as I think that that can't be said of the
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.080]  other side with that said we've got to come to an agreement of what we're
[27:34.080 --> 27:37.640]  focused on regarding joint objectives unfortunately long-term we have to
[27:37.640 --> 27:40.640]  accept Alex that they're trying to put together what I would call the Damascus
[27:40.640 --> 27:44.280]  pack essentially a form of the Warsaw pack in the Middle East where they're
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.440]  joining the Iranians Syria and Russians together and we have to look at how we
[27:48.440 --> 27:51.920]  can counter that long-term but for now we have joint objectives regarding
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.080]  stabilizing Syria yes trying indeed to stabilize the region that's what we
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.280]  should focus sure let's not romanticize Russia their elites are just as
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.240]  corrupt as some of ours but exactly we can't lose the moral high ground and
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.000]  back a jihad al-Qaeda army to run around murdering hundreds of thousands of
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.840]  Christians absolutely get the nail on the head and I think that's what we need
[28:10.840 --> 28:14.640]  to understand the Russians and us if we share that one focus area we should
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.280]  focus on that for now and then worry about worry about what to do after that
[28:18.280 --> 28:21.320]  we just beat out ISIS in al-Qaeda I really appreciate you giving us time
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.800]  London Center dot org spend a minute on your books you've written and the one
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.920]  predicting the border situation well the last line Alex you've done a great
[28:30.920 --> 28:34.640]  job of allowing me to talk about it look we'd we'd recognize that you live
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.640]  there there than I do fact the border is breaking down the people wanted to
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.720]  break down so the last line essentially is a kind of looking at all the
[28:41.720 --> 28:44.120]  different people who could be involved and essentially that you point out a
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.560]  soft coup d'etat looking at people who have interests that are really meant to
[28:48.560 --> 28:52.840]  undermine and soften our ability to defend the nation that's ongoing and it's
[28:52.840 --> 28:56.360]  something we have to all be concerned about my first book operation dark art
[28:56.360 --> 29:02.200]  is about the war in Afghanistan and how we how we need to go about trying to we
[29:02.200 --> 29:05.400]  can still pull victory out there and I'm hopeful that we could do a lot more to
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.520]  stabilize that area as well but it takes parts but does not take political types
[29:10.520 --> 29:14.480]  who wish basically to have to reinforce their own political power enough to not
[29:14.480 --> 29:17.160]  protect the American people and that's what we should be that's what we should
[29:17.160 --> 29:20.440]  focus on it's scary to have political leadership has never been in the
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.400]  military telling the military what to do and we'll see in these disasters
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.560]  Colonel Shaper thank you so much and thank God for being there you're a real

[34:15.240 --> 34:18.960]  many questions but you are vindicated this has got to be the 50th time the
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.160]  last six months on the radical muslim celebrating not just in New Jersey but
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.680]  New York Palestine all over what do you have to say they're still attacking you
[34:27.680 --> 34:31.560]  though we've got Dan rather on video we've got New York post we've got
[34:31.560 --> 34:36.840]  Washington post we've got I mean what's going on here well I took a lot of heat
[34:36.840 --> 34:41.040]  and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a sudden you know
[34:41.040 --> 34:44.560]  hundreds of people were calling up my office I was the other day in Sarasota
[34:44.560 --> 34:49.560]  Florida and people are online and we had 12,000 people which is fantastic and the
[34:49.560 --> 34:52.940]  people were saying many of the people from New Jersey four or five people said
[34:52.940 --> 34:57.360]  mr. Trump I sought myself I was there they talked about Patterson but they
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.440]  said I sought myself mr. Trump I was there so many people have called in and
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.280]  and on Twitter at real Donald Trump they're all tweeting so I knew it happened
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.240]  and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't do that people
[35:11.240 --> 35:15.120]  like you and I can't do that so easily now we can do it if we're wrong Alex you
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.280]  apologize I'd apologize if I was wrong but they were celebrating and they were
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.800]  celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center I think that's disgraceful it is
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.960]  and that same week you were reporting on that fact we had two different
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.320]  international football games soccer games with the Turkish fans and others
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.040]  during the moment of silence for the dead people in in Paris chanting Allah
[35:37.040 --> 35:41.840]  Akbar and booing show did that not happen too well that happened and
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.320]  everybody saw it that was a week ago and the players were out on the field and
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.480]  they couldn't believe it they were embarrassed they didn't know what to do
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.280]  the coach and the managers they all apologized but it happened look we have
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.240]  to deal with reality and you know it all started because they said we need
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.600]  surveillance we need proper surveillance we have people that truly are evil and
[35:59.600 --> 36:03.600]  they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.640]  at least the vicinity and I said we need proper surveillance whether it's a
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.720]  mosque or anyplace else we have to be surveilled and we have to see what's
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.200]  coming at us because we're not gonna have a country anymore between the weak
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.200]  borders that we have the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid
[36:19.200 --> 36:24.320]  to do anything about it between all of what's happening with radical you know
[36:24.320 --> 36:27.400]  you look at what's going on you have a president that doesn't even want to talk
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.520]  about you know the radical Muslim stuff he doesn't want to mention the word he
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.600]  doesn't want to say it but you look at what's happening where we have a
[36:35.600 --> 36:39.240]  president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get
[36:39.240 --> 36:43.440]  everybody excited about global warming like that's our number one problem he
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.240]  considers that to be our number one problem and our number one problem is
[36:47.240 --> 36:50.000]  what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.440]  our country that's our number one problem and then our number two problem is
[36:54.440 --> 36:57.160]  crippled America your number one New York Times bestseller we're gonna talk
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.600]  about that in a few minutes but let's continue with the number one problem and
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.520]  I agree with you it's now in mainstream news associated press and others are
[37:04.520 --> 37:11.480]  reporting that it's a secret deal with Turkey with the Germans with Merkel the
[37:11.480 --> 37:16.520]  admitted socialist to bring in millions of radical Islamists they admit almost
[37:16.520 --> 37:20.640]  all of them are Sunni that basically invaded Syria they're getting their butt
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.120]  kicked by the Russians so now they want to flee up to the north into Turkey you
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.880]  said months ago bomb the oil of ISIS and the mainstream media laugh because you
[37:29.880 --> 37:33.560]  said the sky was blue again now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to
[37:33.560 --> 37:40.040]  do and now you've come out saying quote it looks like that Turkey's on the side
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.480]  of ISIS clothes quote well that the next day the Russians released satellite
[37:44.480 --> 37:48.920]  photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up
[37:48.920 --> 37:53.280]  to the border at these huge terminals connected to your gun the president's
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.560]  son making billions of dollars total off of this again you're in trouble for
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.440]  saying the sky is blue well I was right about that I was right in saying in a
[38:03.440 --> 38:06.840]  book that I wrote you covered it really nicely appreciated but I wrote a very
[38:06.840 --> 38:11.640]  political book years ago in the year 2000 the America we deserve and I said to
[38:11.640 --> 38:15.560]  that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden I mean I
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.560]  really study this stuff I really find it very interesting and even though I'm a
[38:19.560 --> 38:24.080]  businessman I find it I've always said I always have been involved in politics I
[38:24.080 --> 38:27.920]  said we better be careful with Osama bin Laden there's a guy named Osama bin
[38:27.920 --> 38:31.640]  Laden nobody really know who he was but he was nasty he was saying really nasty
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.800]  things about our country and what he wants to do to it and I wrote in the
[38:35.800 --> 38:38.880]  book 2000 two years before the World Trade Center came down I talked about
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.520]  Osama bin Laden you better take him out I said he's gonna crawl under a rock you
[38:42.520 --> 38:46.600]  better take him out and now people are seeing that the saying you know Trump
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.880]  predicted Osama bin Laden which actually is true and then two years later a year
[38:50.880 --> 38:53.800]  and a half later he knocked down the World Trade Center and I talked about
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.240]  terrorism and that was before terrorism as we know it today I said we better be
[38:58.240 --> 39:01.160]  careful that's gonna happen it's gonna be a big thing and it certainly is a big
[39:01.160 --> 39:05.200]  thing so with the oil and I'm glad you brought it up but as you know for three
[39:05.200 --> 39:08.080]  years I've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't take the
[39:08.080 --> 39:12.080]  oil it's gonna be a problem so we shouldn't have been in Iraq but once we
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.440]  got there the way Osama the way we came out was was horrible and I said take the
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.760]  oil then we didn't take the oil so ISIS got the oil and as you know Iran is
[39:21.760 --> 39:25.600]  getting the oil because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq you know we made
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.400]  one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them a hundred
[39:29.400 --> 39:34.000]  and fifty billion dollars and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons one
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.560]  of them I hate to interrupt you you are the leading presidential front-runner
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.320]  with the Republicans gaining a huge lead as you don't back down but I've got to
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.040]  just back you up again because the more I research what you've actually said and
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.920]  done it's amazing you were the only leading American figure who openly said
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.480]  do not go to war in Iraq they had almost what 90% votes in Congress for it
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.280]  bipartisan you said don't do it Iran will take over you said I mean look you
[40:00.280 --> 40:06.040]  can say that today and everybody can say that but you said that in 2001 2002 2003
[40:06.040 --> 40:09.320]  when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.160]  advisors how did you know that when almost no one else did well first of all
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.800]  I'm the most militaristic person there is I'm gonna build the mill if I win I'm
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.280]  gonna make our military so strong so powerful that nobody's gonna mess with
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.240]  us we're gonna take care of our vets and all of that but I have to tell you have
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.040]  to know if you're gonna go to war you have to do it properly and you have to
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.360]  know what to do I view it as this Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.480]  strength and they'd have they've constantly fighting that's all they do as
[40:35.480 --> 40:39.560]  they fight right they go to war all the time and they'd move 10 feet left 10
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.040]  feet right 10 feet left and they'd rest and then they've started again four
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.360]  years that this has been gone on for years forever forever and this is the way
[40:47.360 --> 40:52.400]  it is I said if you take out Iran or if you take out Iraq either one you're
[40:52.400 --> 40:57.320]  gonna destabilize the Middle East well we took out Iraq and by the way Iraq has
[40:57.320 --> 41:00.960]  the second largest oil reserves in the world people don't even know that so we
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.920]  gave like incredible we took out a wreck I said you're gonna destabilize well and
[41:04.920 --> 41:08.280]  I said and you'll know this and you know this and I appreciate what you just
[41:08.280 --> 41:14.400]  said then Iran is gonna come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq and they
[41:14.400 --> 41:17.760]  just taking it over right now as we speak they're taking it over Iran is
[41:17.760 --> 41:21.560]  running a rack and very soon will be virtually gonna be totally running a
[41:21.560 --> 41:24.920]  rack especially after all of you know the deal we just made which is the worst
[41:24.920 --> 41:30.000]  so I said keep the oil and I said if you're gonna leave you shouldn't have
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.840]  gone in but they shouldn't have they should have left soldiers behind like
[41:32.840 --> 41:36.720]  20,000 or certain number of soldiers but if you're gonna leave take the oil and
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.600]  I've said it then they left they didn't take the oil so ISIS got the oil Iran is
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.320]  getting the oil everybody's getting everything but us so we lost thousands of
[41:45.320 --> 41:49.320]  soldiers we spent two trillion dollars in Iraq we have wounded warriors who I
[41:49.320 --> 41:52.920]  love all over the place and what do we get out of it else we had nothing we had
[41:52.920 --> 41:56.000]  nothing no the French and the Germans are getting the oil the Iranians are
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.920]  getting the oil and you know who the number one customer for the oil is
[41:58.920 --> 42:04.120]  guess what China right smart is China they have smartest on every level
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.560]  militarily they are smartest on trade like we're losing we have a 450 billion
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.040]  dollar trade deficit with let me ask you this you're a top business guy you know
[42:13.040 --> 42:20.000]  on your own from nothing how did China get 97% of rare earth in minerals in
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  the world how is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.760]  earth minerals when it's what goes in the smart phones the computers
[42:25.760 --> 42:29.800]  trillions is made a year how did we just give them the global market in that
[42:29.800 --> 42:33.960]  that's crazy well what a lot of people don't know Afghanistan now Afghanistan's
[42:33.960 --> 42:37.200]  a place we can go in because you know you have Pakistan and you have nuclear
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.800]  weapons a lot of things going on there but we go into Afghanistan we're
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.920]  fighting you're tremendous mountains and ridges we're fighting on one side and
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.560]  you know who's got their excavators on the other side China looking out all the
[42:49.560 --> 42:53.640]  minerals you know Afghanistan nobody knew this Afghanistan is rich with
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.320]  minerals not oil but minerals everything everything and China is taking out all
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.400]  the minerals and here we are fighting we have trillions where but like a
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.040]  trillion dollars in Afghanistan and we get nothing out of it and we're gonna
[43:05.040 --> 43:08.440]  end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.920]  that we get nothing China is taking out the minerals they're the they're the
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.560]  buyers the big buyers at very very low prices of as you know of the oil in
[43:17.560 --> 43:22.160]  Iraq and probably in Syria but China is a big buyer of the oil but one thing
[43:22.160 --> 43:25.440]  with the oil it's it's over because you've covered it for three years I've
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.320]  been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting strong and they're no JV as the
[43:29.320 --> 43:33.600]  president said and they're certainly not contained but I said hit the oil and
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.040]  hit them hard and they left at me and they would put generals on television
[43:38.040 --> 43:41.680]  saying no that strategy wouldn't work well after Paris they started hitting the
[43:41.680 --> 43:45.840]  oil and it does work the problem is we've given them a two-year edge there
[43:45.840 --> 43:49.560]  billions of dollars should start it in the oil for one month that ISIS is
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.320]  already rolling over so Putin is following your your strategy you know
[43:53.320 --> 43:57.520]  that I'm going to two years ago Alex that's the only problem Donald Trump
[43:57.520 --> 44:01.280]  joins us live can you speak to as president what your relationship would
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.360]  be with foreign leaders and and and what you know about Vladimir Putin because
[44:05.360 --> 44:08.560]  all I know is why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.040]  anything to us right well number one and just to finish on the other way I say
[44:13.040 --> 44:15.480]  hit the up but we should keep you up in other words we should keep we'll get
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.120]  Exxon Mobil they'll go in we'll get other of our oil companies we'll get some
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.440]  of the great oil companies we bid it out we should keep you up you know in the
[44:22.440 --> 44:25.800]  old days to the victor belong to spoils right we don't have that we go in we
[44:25.800 --> 44:30.080]  fight a war and we leave we get nothing except we get death and we get deficit
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.720]  that's all we get I think I get along great with people I mean I will
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.280]  probably get along well with him and if I don't somebody else will and who knows
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.120]  you know he's a difficult cookie he's tough and he's smart I was on hit the
[44:41.120 --> 44:46.040]  show 60 minutes with him recently not together I mean we they did him and they
[44:46.040 --> 44:49.520]  profiled me at the same show which was there we were stablemates right but I
[44:49.520 --> 44:53.720]  think I'd get along very well with him I think it's too fine look here's the thing
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.320]  we lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries China
[44:57.320 --> 45:01.280]  is killing us everybody's killing us China is just beating us to a pulp and
[45:01.280 --> 45:06.240]  trade Japan Mexico is killing us and yet we don't get along with anybody with me
[45:06.240 --> 45:09.320]  they're not gonna get so rich believe me they're not gonna get so rich at all
[45:09.320 --> 45:12.800]  we're gonna take back our jobs we're gonna take back our manufacture we take
[45:12.800 --> 45:18.000]  back our base but they'll like us more than they do now sort of amazing well
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.680]  Donald Trump let me say this my audience I'd say 90% supports you okay and you
[45:23.680 --> 45:28.920]  definitely have have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems Hillary
[45:28.920 --> 45:32.080]  and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslims celebrated on
[45:32.080 --> 45:37.600]  9-11 but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia
[45:37.600 --> 45:41.640]  in the air on the ground they have video that all none of it happened she
[45:41.640 --> 45:45.440]  admits she lied if you did that you'd be done but you wouldn't do something like
[45:45.440 --> 45:49.280]  that you don't steal glory from our veterans but they demonize you for made
[45:49.280 --> 45:53.720]  up scandals every day trying to see what'll stick and he got Hillary involved
[45:53.720 --> 45:57.680]  in Benghazi you've got him involved in everything and people love you for tough
[45:57.680 --> 46:01.600]  talk is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama I mean what do
[46:01.600 --> 46:06.480]  we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton well you
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.640]  remember this the best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year
[46:10.640 --> 46:13.960]  left okay because you know by the time you do the hearings and everything I
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.360]  don't make him a martyr in a way you'll make him a martyr but I don't even say
[46:18.360 --> 46:21.560]  that you know one of the things I'm the most disappointed in Republicans
[46:21.560 --> 46:23.960]  because they go to Washington they're gonna do all this stuff they're gonna
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.960]  impeach Obama they're gonna end Obamacare which has to be ended it's a
[46:27.960 --> 46:30.360]  desire I don't know if you've seen the premiums they're going up it's killing
[46:30.360 --> 46:36.320]  everything by 55% it's it's it you know it's gonna implode anyway in 17 the
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.080]  2017 Obamacare blows up it's over I mean it's over and everybody knows it and
[46:41.080 --> 46:45.000]  they're doing big stories even the ones that were for it are saying oh this is
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.240]  it working well the premiums are a disaster and if you look at anything
[46:49.240 --> 46:52.560]  having to do with Obamacare right now it's over but the problem with the
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.800]  Republicans is they'll try and fix it they'll try instead of get rid of it and
[46:57.800 --> 47:01.040]  we can come up with a phenomenal plan that's much better for the people the
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.560]  people are getting killed with that so there's so many things to do Alex we
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.800]  will do such a good job there's so many fronts a number will win on trade we're
[47:10.800 --> 47:13.600]  gonna strengthen our military we're gonna take care of our vets we're gonna
[47:13.600 --> 47:17.040]  get rid of Obamacare literally there's so many things there's so many things that
[47:17.040 --> 47:20.760]  can be done but we have to use our good people you know everybody running
[47:20.760 --> 47:24.520]  against me in terms of even the Republican side and Hillary certainly
[47:24.520 --> 47:27.720]  they're all controlled by their donors and their special interests and the
[47:27.720 --> 47:31.480]  lobbyists I'm putting up my own money I'm funding my own campaign nobody's
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.800]  going to control me I'm gonna do what's right for you and for the American
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.640]  people listen I get it I mean you are a true maverick I understand you know you
[47:40.640 --> 47:43.760]  made tens of billions of dollars you've hired tens of thousands of people I
[47:43.760 --> 47:46.840]  mean I would imagine that as you've gotten older correct me if I'm wrong
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.440]  because I know you talked about wanting to serve America decades ago really all
[47:50.440 --> 47:53.000]  it comes down to is wanting to have a free country for your children and
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.720]  grandchildren and that's where I want to come to this point next because I know
[47:56.720 --> 48:00.320]  you're smart sir and I know that you also though you don't dumb your message
[48:00.320 --> 48:04.320]  down but you keep it at a mid level so the general public and the establishment
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.440]  as well can get it but let's get down to brass tacks I routinely talk to the top
[48:10.440 --> 48:16.600]  generals special forces Pentagon currently out of the Pentagon CIA as I know
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.040]  you do and we'll just leave it at that there are a lot of people in this
[48:20.040 --> 48:23.440]  government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country they really
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.160]  know that we've reached the crossroads where the country is done as a third
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.960]  world nation within a few more years forget Donald Trump in four years if
[48:29.960 --> 48:32.920]  this happens we're done I mean we're talking about resurrecting the dead here
[48:32.920 --> 48:36.640]  we could turn it around right now as you've said properly you're dead on sir
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.600]  you're right we could turn it around all the actuaries all the numbers show it
[48:39.600 --> 48:42.800]  but it's got to happen the next few years or we're done right and there are
[48:42.800 --> 48:46.400]  globalists that want to have a world government a system run by select
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.520]  crony capitalist using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent and
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.840]  I've talked to not just high-level folks that have been in government that are on
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.040]  your team but separately high-level people in government currently that say
[48:58.040 --> 49:01.840]  there's an internal war going on and that you're a manifestation of that I
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.320]  want to get anything inside baseball with you but I already know the inside
[49:05.320 --> 49:10.360]  baseball I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.320]  understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic
[49:14.320 --> 49:17.560]  it's George Washington level and you understand that office so I want to tell
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.560]  you right now can you speak about the war for the soul of this country that's
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.600]  happening right now and really tell people what's happening and commit to
[49:24.600 --> 49:29.040]  people that you won't Ross Perot under death threats and step down when you're
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.560]  in the lead two months from the election okay so let me just say Alex as you know
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.760]  I'm leading in every Paul nationally in every Paul state I'm leading an Iowa
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.920]  New Hampshire South Carolina the SEC Texas I'm leading in Texas which I love
[49:43.920 --> 49:47.480]  I love Texas you know we were there Mark Cuban called up he said do you want to
[49:47.480 --> 49:51.040]  use the arena user we filled it up in three or four days 20,000 people in
[49:51.040 --> 49:57.280]  Mobile Alabama we had 35,000 people we had 20,000 in Oklahoma I'm so into this
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.480]  and I'm not into you know I could do other things that I would enjoy doing to
[50:01.480 --> 50:04.760]  be honest with you're doing a dangerous mission we understand that it's not an
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.680]  easy thing but the key is make America great again we can make America great
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.040]  again but if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what's
[50:12.040 --> 50:16.800]  gone on in the past and you know what's going just we're being eaten away it's
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.600]  just eat it's eating away at our country and we can make in my opinion we can make
[50:22.600 --> 50:26.880]  America greater than ever before but we have to get going it has to happen we
[50:26.880 --> 50:31.280]  have to get going and you know when you look at the vision I said Iraq you
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.680]  agreed with me on a wreck I said hit the oil I said a lot of things that turned
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.040]  out to be true a hundred percent true and I'm giving credit I'm given credit by
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.080]  some people some people refuse to acknowledge it you know they refuse to
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.960]  say no you've been you've been you've been absolutely on target so when I'm
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.400]  asking is though to the crossroads we're at right now though because you've
[50:49.400 --> 50:53.120]  talked about it are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country's done or
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.040]  whether we go to the next level well I think this I think that it sadly I think
[50:57.040 --> 51:00.000]  that if we don't get it right this time I think this is going to be the most
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.120]  important election our country's ever had I mean you'd have to say George
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.840]  Washington was right there you know the couple of pretty important elections
[51:05.840 --> 51:09.320]  right but this is certainly in the last in the modern era this is the most
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.120]  important election election our country's ever had if we don't get it right if we
[51:14.120 --> 51:19.680]  put another one of these people in like Hillary I mean she she's so corrupt she
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.120]  is so corrupt and she shouldn't even be allowed to run and frankly her greatest
[51:24.120 --> 51:29.600]  legacy she was a horrible Secretary of State if she's if she runs I think her
[51:29.600 --> 51:33.040]  greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal that's what I think
[51:33.040 --> 51:37.280]  it'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal
[51:37.280 --> 51:41.360]  because General Petraeus and many others I mean their lives have been destroyed
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.480]  for doing 5% of what she did that's right shouldn't be allowed to run but you
[51:45.480 --> 51:48.800]  know the recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has been beating her
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.520]  head-to-head which is very interesting and very good and beating her soundly
[51:52.520 --> 51:58.320]  head-to-head but we have to get it right our country can be absolutely we can
[51:58.320 --> 52:02.120]  turn it around but I would agree with you if we don't get it right this time I'm
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.280]  not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the
[52:06.280 --> 52:09.840]  stupidity of these leaders I'm not sure you're gonna be able to turn it around
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.800]  anymore I think it could be Donald Trump the man in the arena his new book
[52:14.800 --> 52:17.520]  we're gonna talk about the moment is exposing the fact this country being
[52:17.520 --> 52:22.840]  sabotaged by design specifically I don't want to bring up detractors and it's a
[52:22.840 --> 52:27.240]  question I had early on that I did more research and I understand that you really
[52:27.240 --> 52:29.960]  do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren live but let's
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.360]  expand on this there are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with
[52:35.360 --> 52:40.720]  Bill Clinton and so you you know you've you had to do business in New York so you
[52:40.720 --> 52:43.960]  said nice things about Hillary I get keeping your enemies closer when you're
[52:43.960 --> 52:46.960]  not you know in politics I get it I understand I think that's what you did
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.280]  but but tell us specifically and I don't think this now I've seen it I know
[52:51.280 --> 52:53.800]  you're for real you wouldn't be saying the things you're doing they're scared
[52:53.800 --> 52:57.400]  of you the whole system's coming on against you but promise us that you're
[52:57.400 --> 53:02.600]  not gonna drop out at the key moment keeping all the other Republicans out
[53:02.600 --> 53:07.400]  of you and then Hillary races to the head or or Jeb Bush does because as you
[53:07.400 --> 53:11.000]  know folks are claiming you're a Clinton operative you know I've never heard that
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.280]  I've I've heard it actually a few months ago but I've hit her harder than
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.960]  anybody times 10 if you look at you have just here I was a businessman yet I've
[53:18.960 --> 53:22.000]  only been a politician for five months I hate to use the term because you know
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.760]  it's all but I've just been doing this for a very short period of time I was
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.480]  establishment you know I was like a guy like you would say Trump is total
[53:30.480 --> 53:34.960]  establishment and I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans but over
[53:34.960 --> 53:37.440]  the years I've given to Democrats I've given to Republic I've given to
[53:37.440 --> 53:41.560]  everybody because I had an obligation I was a businessman one of the magazines
[53:41.560 --> 53:44.360]  recently called me a world-class businessman the truth is I did I built
[53:44.360 --> 53:49.760]  an unbelievable company a tremendous assets tremendous not only that iconic
[53:49.760 --> 53:53.720]  assets very little debt tremendous cash flow it's a great company and by the way
[53:53.720 --> 53:56.840]  people now see how good when I did the filing everyone said oh I'll never file
[53:56.840 --> 54:01.840]  I never file it's almost a hundred pages long and it's an unbelievable company so
[54:01.840 --> 54:05.600]  I built it which by the way the reason I say that that's the kind of thinking our
[54:05.600 --> 54:09.680]  country needs but I got along great with Clinton I got along great with Harry
[54:09.680 --> 54:14.480]  Reid I get along great with everybody because when I needed them I didn't want
[54:14.480 --> 54:17.440]  to have argument I didn't want to have somebody say well Clinton doesn't want
[54:17.440 --> 54:20.560]  that you're not a loser you don't get in mindless fights you move forward with
[54:20.560 --> 54:24.280]  your agenda but now you see America in trouble and you're hanging that's all
[54:24.280 --> 54:28.120]  sideline now Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump he wants to work for
[54:28.120 --> 54:31.720]  America yeah as a businessman you could have even functioned if you don't get
[54:31.720 --> 54:36.680]  along I know example in New York City is 95% Democrat I mean if I didn't get
[54:36.680 --> 54:39.760]  along with the Democrats I wouldn't have one I'll tell you I mean you did want
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.320]  the vice president you know a position it's come out decades ago behind the
[54:43.320 --> 54:47.080]  scenes I mean I know you're a Republican what about libertarianism what's your
[54:47.080 --> 54:50.440]  view of libertarianism and then I want to ask you who's your favorite president
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.600]  and who do you think your running mate might be folks think it's Ted Cruz well
[54:54.600 --> 54:57.520]  I think that libertarianism sort of interesting there are certain things
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.400]  that I really like about it but you know keeping government out as much as
[55:01.400 --> 55:04.640]  possible we need government for protection we have to protect when you
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.400]  look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to destroy us and you know the
[55:08.400 --> 55:12.440]  problem we have today Alex is the weaponry if this were 100 years ago I'd
[55:12.440 --> 55:14.960]  say forget about him let him keep fighting they've been fighting all their
[55:14.960 --> 55:18.960]  lives let him keep fighting each other who cares but the weaponry is so
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.760]  powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now protect so that's a big
[55:23.760 --> 55:27.720]  part of government so there's a certain common sense to certain elements and I
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.680]  do very well with the libertarians frankly you know because they sort of get
[55:30.680 --> 55:34.960]  it and they they get me but we need bigger strength that I think the
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.640]  libertarians really want and we need it and we have to have it we have to have
[55:39.640 --> 55:42.400]  it if we don't have it we're not gonna have a country if we don't have borders
[55:42.400 --> 55:45.960]  we're not gonna have a country as far as running mate it's too soon to say I
[55:45.960 --> 55:49.200]  actually respect a couple of people that are on the stage some of them have
[55:49.200 --> 55:52.680]  absolutely no respect for there I mean I think they're not very good at all at
[55:52.680 --> 55:56.920]  what they do you look at what's going on but I have respect for a number of
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.240]  people that are on the stage with me I have respect for a lot of people that
[56:00.240 --> 56:04.640]  are throughout this country you know political people I'll pick somebody I
[56:04.640 --> 56:08.320]  think that can really be a great vice president ultimately has to be a great
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.680]  president because that's you know 90% of that function is you know if something
[56:12.680 --> 56:15.600]  bad happens they got to be a good president you have to view it from that
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.240]  standpoint and my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be
[56:19.240 --> 56:23.840]  Ronald Reagan I've always liked him and by the way he was a Democrat a lot of
[56:23.840 --> 56:27.960]  people don't know he was some of a liberal Democrat Alex as you know and he
[56:27.960 --> 56:31.320]  became a somewhat conservative I wouldn't say the most conservative but if
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.800]  somewhat conservative but he wanted to make America great and he really did he
[56:35.800 --> 56:39.720]  wanted to make he had actually let's make America great that was his and mine
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.780]  is make America great again so there's a little bit of a difference but my son
[56:43.780 --> 56:47.120]  my son you know finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours and I
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.520]  liked you love Americana your peer Americana but I'm still you know was
[56:50.520 --> 56:53.600]  research but but my 13 year old son's really smart as a lot of research he
[56:53.600 --> 56:57.200]  watches all the debates he just really loves you he is on cloud nine that you're
[56:57.200 --> 57:02.000]  here Rex Jones and it was his question you know which president was your
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.840]  favorite but all time all time who's your favorite well all time I'd say
[57:06.840 --> 57:11.480]  Ronald Reagan shorter term I would say well you know you look at Lincoln you
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.080]  look at Washington you have to go with they were there the classics right Alex
[57:15.080 --> 57:18.080]  you know you're thinking terms of the great classics you have to go with the
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.920]  Lincoln's and the Washington's I agree man George Washington was badass yeah
[57:22.920 --> 57:26.720]  that's what they say I mean that's what they said he said they say he never told
[57:26.720 --> 57:30.560]  a lie let's hope that's true okay but George Washington was pretty good but
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.880]  we had to look we had some great presidents and we had some good
[57:32.880 --> 57:37.680]  presidents on the other side to an all fairness but we will hopefully be right
[57:37.680 --> 57:41.480]  at the top of that list we're gonna make the country so strong and we're gonna
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.680]  make it financially secure we can owe 21 trillion dollars because it's gonna be
[57:45.680 --> 57:49.120]  that's my final question what type of an elite wants a clowered and piven
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.400]  bankrupt the country so socialists can run in and we all get handouts what type
[57:53.400 --> 57:56.260]  of an elite is that I mean you've been around these people are they mentally
[57:56.260 --> 57:59.840]  ill Donald Trump well we have to make our country rich again you know the other
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.600]  day I said to a woman to her she came up to mr. Trump at a big rally where we
[58:04.600 --> 58:08.720]  had 14,000 people and at the end she just sees me and I'm you're signing
[58:08.720 --> 58:12.800]  autographs and stuff and she said mr. Trump I'm voting for you 100% but are
[58:12.800 --> 58:16.720]  you this whole concept of making it rich it sounds so Chris I said you know what
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.280]  it might sound Chris but if we don't make our nation rich again if we don't
[58:20.280 --> 58:23.760]  take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us and if we
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.880]  don't take back our money and if we don't you know balance up our budget at
[58:27.880 --> 58:32.040]  least get it damn close and soon we're not gonna have a nation anymore a third
[58:32.040 --> 58:35.400]  world country Donald Trump you know I know you've got to go 60 second break I
