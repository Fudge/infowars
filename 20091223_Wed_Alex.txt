[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  We are back at the Alex Jones show Alex out on the assignment in Dallas.
[00:14.640 --> 00:20.800]  I'm Jason Burma is sitting in and we are now joined by Catherine Austin fix.
[00:20.800 --> 00:22.800]  Oh, no, we don't have her on yet.
[00:22.800 --> 00:27.120]  She'll be on in just a moment.
[00:27.120 --> 00:33.640]  She is the founder and managing member of Solari Investment Advisories LLC.
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.200]  She is a former assistant secretary of housing for the federal housing commissioner under
[00:38.200 --> 00:40.520]  the first Bush administration.
[00:40.520 --> 00:44.480]  She is the president of the Hamilton Securities Group Investment Bank and Financial Software
[00:44.480 --> 00:48.120]  Developer and a Wall Street insider.
[00:48.120 --> 00:55.200]  So we are going to get her take on the devaluing dollar on gold hitting a record high on what's
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.520]  really going on in Dubai.
[00:59.520 --> 01:03.360]  And how this is going to affect us not only in the United States but globally.
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.360]  How are you Catherine?
[01:04.360 --> 01:06.920]  Hi, I'm fine.
[01:06.920 --> 01:08.960]  So let's just get right into it.
[01:08.960 --> 01:11.680]  We're seeing record numbers for gold today.
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.800]  The dollar continues to decline and we're talking bailouts in Dubai.
[01:16.800 --> 01:20.480]  What does this all mean for us here at home?
[01:20.480 --> 01:26.480]  Well, what it means is our expenses are going to rise and our income is going to fall.
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.080]  It's that simple.
[01:29.080 --> 01:35.480]  And we're going through a structural change economically as a society.
[01:35.480 --> 01:44.520]  We have for the last 15 to 20 years moved abroad many of the high-paying manufacturing
[01:44.520 --> 01:51.760]  and other jobs and done it in a way that significantly weakened the union and anything
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.920]  that would protect the value of labor.
[01:53.920 --> 01:59.360]  So we're watching a fundamental shift between the value of labor and the value of capital
[01:59.360 --> 02:06.520]  worldwide and it's an integral part of the way that globalization is being achieved.
[02:06.520 --> 02:16.080]  And so we're just at the round with Dubai is sort of the latest sort of crisis de jure
[02:16.080 --> 02:22.840]  related to what happens when you print lots and lots of financial paper, whether it's
[02:22.840 --> 02:30.440]  currency or bonds or debt securities, but you don't build up an equivalent amount of
[02:30.440 --> 02:32.240]  real wealth in the real economy.
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.560]  So we're watching a back and forth between all the paper that we've printed and the
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.920]  bubbles that we've engineered globally and the real economy and the precious metals is
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.760]  really just the real economy saying, hey, wait a minute, we don't want your paper.
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.080]  We're worth a lot more in terms of your paper.
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.760]  And the challenge for many of us is where many of us are just holding the paper.
[02:56.760 --> 03:02.680]  We just discussed briefly how this country has essentially been gutted from making anything.
[03:02.680 --> 03:07.360]  We don't really have an industry that creates and exports anything.
[03:07.360 --> 03:12.760]  In fact, I think our leading export at this point is garbage ideas and promises that really
[03:12.760 --> 03:13.760]  aren't there.
[03:13.760 --> 03:14.840]  I mean, how did this happen?
[03:14.840 --> 03:21.120]  How did we allow ourselves to stop manufacturing any physical materials whatsoever?
[03:21.120 --> 03:31.120]  Well, in the 1990s, we implemented the GATT Uruguay Round and created in 1995 the WTO,
[03:31.120 --> 03:35.680]  the World Trade Organization, which radically changed the rules.
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.880]  It's like any game, when you blow a whistle and change all the rules, the whole game changes.
[03:42.880 --> 03:48.880]  And what the World Trade Organization and the GATT Round said is, we are now free to
[03:48.880 --> 03:58.800]  move capital in and out of any place and basically shift jobs locally, globally, in a way where
[03:58.800 --> 04:04.040]  we can play labor off against each other around the world.
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.200]  And that's happening at the same time when you're instituting lots of new, powerful technology
[04:09.200 --> 04:13.600]  because a lot of this is made possible by telecommunications and satellite technology
[04:13.600 --> 04:16.760]  and digital technology.
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.720]  You're instituting it where it's possible to radically reduce the number of people you
[04:21.720 --> 04:24.600]  need to do manufacturing.
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.800]  So literally, we're seeing new plans come up around the world where everything is done
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.880]  by robotics and computers and you need very few people or once you needed 2,000 people
[04:33.880 --> 04:36.600]  to do everything you need to.
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.960]  So part of this is simply who gets the blessings of new technology and what we're saying is
[04:41.960 --> 04:47.200]  that we're going to take all those blessings and productivity and centralize it into the
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.320]  wealth of the few and pull it out of the well-being of the many.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.320]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[04:53.320 --> 04:59.600]  We'll be back after this with Katherine Austin-Bitts.
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.560]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.480]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[05:06.480 --> 05:07.840]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.840]  It's very real.
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.280]  It's real because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to
[05:12.280 --> 05:13.280]  you.
[05:13.280 --> 05:16.240]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Acola Blue, you'll know what's
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.240]  in your cup.
[05:17.240 --> 05:19.320]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[05:59.320 --> 06:03.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[06:03.720 --> 06:08.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[06:08.320 --> 06:12.640]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[06:12.640 --> 06:13.920]  allows you to have.
[06:13.920 --> 06:14.920]  It's true.
[06:14.920 --> 06:19.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[06:19.640 --> 06:23.960]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[06:23.960 --> 06:27.960]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[06:27.960 --> 06:31.480]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[06:31.480 --> 06:35.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[06:35.160 --> 06:39.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[06:39.920 --> 06:43.720]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[06:43.720 --> 06:45.080]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[06:45.080 --> 06:49.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[06:49.320 --> 06:50.880]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[06:50.880 --> 07:00.960]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[07:00.960 --> 07:01.960]  Hi, folks.
[07:01.960 --> 07:04.920]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:04.920 --> 07:09.760]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.760]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.400]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[07:18.400 --> 07:23.640]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[07:23.640 --> 07:29.920]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[07:29.920 --> 07:34.240]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[07:34.240 --> 07:39.560]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:39.560 --> 07:44.840]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[07:44.840 --> 07:51.120]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[07:51.120 --> 07:52.120]  Lungs Generator.
[07:52.120 --> 07:59.120]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:59.120 --> 08:05.120]  Hey.
[08:05.120 --> 08:09.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:09.880 --> 08:10.880]  You want answers?
[08:10.880 --> 08:13.040]  Well, so does he.
[08:13.040 --> 08:17.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:22.240 --> 08:24.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[08:24.480 --> 08:28.320]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's on assignment in Dallas.
[08:28.320 --> 08:33.720]  We're with Catherine Austin-Fitz, and you were talking about really the restructuring
[08:33.720 --> 08:37.800]  of the global economy and the economy here at home.
[08:37.800 --> 08:44.560]  How do you feel the SDR or Special Drawing Rights Unit that the IMF is now really issuing
[08:44.560 --> 08:46.440]  fervently fits into all that?
[08:46.440 --> 08:50.400]  Is this the global currency that they plan to replace the dollar with?
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.680]  Because there's all this talk that the dollar can no longer be the world reserve currency,
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.320]  and it would seem that although this hasn't taken a physical form yet, that may be the
[08:58.320 --> 08:59.320]  next step.
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.080]  Well, there are a couple things happening at once, Jason.
[09:02.080 --> 09:09.320]  The first is, there is tremendous tension between the financial, really speculative economy
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.680]  and the real economy, and if you look at the countries and the organizations trying to
[09:13.680 --> 09:20.800]  implement trade around the world, it's very painful to be trying to move bananas from
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.880]  here to there when the currency or securities you're operating with to manage a real business
[09:27.880 --> 09:32.840]  have become really a tool of financial speculation and economic warfare.
[09:32.840 --> 09:39.720]  We see tremendous demands by countries that are focused on real export and real trade,
[09:39.720 --> 09:45.440]  trying to find a way to transact and manage reserves in a way that's good for their real
[09:45.440 --> 09:51.160]  economy and get away from the financial speculation.
[09:51.160 --> 09:58.080]  So there's a demand for a global currency that's outside the global speculation system.
[09:58.080 --> 09:59.160]  That's one.
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.760]  Number two, there's no doubt there's a desire also to get off the dollar because the dollar
[10:03.760 --> 10:06.520]  is in a long-term decline.
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.800]  What the dollar has become is, in one sense, is a form of global taxation through the balance
[10:11.800 --> 10:12.800]  sheets.
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.600]  So countries around the world buy dollars.
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.440]  They go down in value, and literally, it's a taxation system.
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.120]  So there's a real desire for something, one, that's global, that's two, that's outside
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.360]  of the speculation, and three is not going down in value.
[10:29.360 --> 10:35.840]  And that's part of what you're seeing with the FDRs and the movement to a global currency.
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.320]  But the other thing, what we're seeing is we're just seeing a desire for people to have
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.520]  something that's not going down, which is part of what's pushing the price of gold and
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.320]  silver and the precious metals up a lot in the last couple months.
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.480]  So what does the United States look like once the dollar is dumped as the world reserve
[10:52.480 --> 10:53.480]  currency?
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.320]  Is this literally the death of the dollar, and we would need some kind of other currency
[10:57.320 --> 10:58.520]  in the United States?
[10:58.520 --> 11:01.280]  Would this trigger even a deeper depression?
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.320]  And I know that Obama's talking about a double-dip recession, which to me is just a semantical
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.600]  word game to say, hey, things aren't going to get any better.
[11:09.600 --> 11:12.240]  They dare not use the term depression.
[11:12.240 --> 11:17.580]  But if the dollar is taken away as the global reserve currency, does it survive?
[11:17.580 --> 11:19.080]  And what happens here in the United States?
[11:19.080 --> 11:22.640]  Well, I don't think we're going through a depression or recession.
[11:22.640 --> 11:27.120]  I think we're going through, I call it a financial coup d'etat.
[11:27.120 --> 11:34.960]  So I think what you're watching is a fundamental re-engineering of how the world is governed
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.880]  and its intentional and its planned.
[11:37.880 --> 11:41.400]  Now, it happens in organic ways.
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.600]  It's not as though it's perfectly scripted, but we're going through a fundamental change
[11:47.600 --> 11:59.240]  and the decision to basically reduce the middle class to a much lower income with much less
[11:59.240 --> 12:05.040]  political power lifestyle was an intentional decision made in the 90s.
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.240]  And essentially what has happened is you have one or two generations in the United States
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.040]  that built up huge wealth over their lifetime.
[12:14.040 --> 12:19.040]  And what we saw was that wealth transferred out of the economy and abroad during the 90s
[12:19.040 --> 12:21.040]  sort of hidden behind the bubble.
[12:21.040 --> 12:22.440]  But that's an intentional thing.
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.440]  And so when we talk about this in terms of depression and recession, we're talking about
[12:26.440 --> 12:27.680]  business cycles.
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.840]  And that's not really the traditional, we're not watching a traditional business cycle.
[12:32.840 --> 12:38.640]  We're watching a fundamental re-engineering of and centralization of economic and political
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.640]  control.
[12:39.640 --> 12:42.920]  And it's very much global and very planned out.
[12:42.920 --> 12:44.360]  Let me give you an example.
[12:44.360 --> 12:52.920]  I was in London in 2002 to give a paper on, it's called The Myth of the Rule of Law, about
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.280]  sort of how the process of privatization was working here in the United States and how
[12:58.280 --> 13:04.160]  things were basically criminal enterprises being used to centralize all sorts of ownership
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.040]  and control in real estate into a relatively small group of people.
[13:09.040 --> 13:14.440]  And I gave the paper, and following me there was a former reporter from the Wall Street
[13:14.440 --> 13:21.160]  Journal giving a paper about the sort of economic warfare in Russia during the 90s and then
[13:21.160 --> 13:25.480]  followed by a wonderful reporter in London who gave one on Eastern Europe.
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.680]  And we were all in a state of shock because we realized it was the same companies, the
[13:29.680 --> 13:37.280]  same banks, same hedge funds, same defense contractors operating as syndicates in all
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.280]  three places.
[13:38.280 --> 13:43.600]  We just didn't, we hadn't seen the game because we thought it was just North America or Russia
[13:43.600 --> 13:49.280]  or Eastern Europe and what we didn't see was there was a global process going on of buying
[13:49.280 --> 13:56.120]  up and controlling all sorts of land in real estate and enterprises and was very much part
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.760]  of a process of economic warfare that was going on globally.
[13:59.760 --> 14:05.400]  Well, when these elitists talk about redistribution of wealth, what they really mean is that their
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.040]  goal is to take the United States and take us from our first world nation status and
[14:10.040 --> 14:16.080]  delve us into this second world nation status as they consolidate power, as they gain more
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.640]  power and I see this system being implemented with this cap and trade scam and now being
[14:21.640 --> 14:24.120]  exposed in climate gain.
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.400]  I mean, that's why they created these carbon markets and carbon prices.
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.600]  I mean that the EU openly trades European Union.
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.400]  This is about globalization and I think that this is the next step in this redistribution
[14:37.400 --> 14:39.400]  of how the global economy works, yes?
[14:39.400 --> 14:47.840]  Well, here's, let's look at the challenge, you know, whether it's what I'll just call
[14:47.840 --> 14:50.480]  a metaphor for the people running the economy globally.
[14:50.480 --> 14:58.480]  So whether you're Mr. Global or whether you're Jason and Catherine and the people listening
[14:58.480 --> 14:59.480]  to this call.
[14:59.480 --> 15:11.160]  The question is, how do we go from being a world of where resources are very much used
[15:11.160 --> 15:18.440]  by the few and not by the many and a world where we're having incredible sort of damage
[15:18.440 --> 15:23.960]  from growth in population to the environment on the planet, how do we go to a world where
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.760]  we're living in alignment with each other and with the environment?
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.040]  So how do we go from an unhealthy model to a much more healthy model?
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.480]  And here's the challenge.
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.120]  The question is, how do you incentivize people to do what's good for the environment and
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.560]  do what's much more equitable in terms of sharing of resources?
[15:45.560 --> 15:48.480]  And they're positive systems you can use to do that.
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.560]  Jason, the salaried model says, okay, why don't we finance communities with equity
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.160]  and then people can make money and get financial wealth from reducing consumption?
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.720]  This is the notion that we need consumption to grow to get the stock market to go up as
[16:05.720 --> 16:06.720]  absurd.
[16:06.720 --> 16:07.720]  That's the corporate model.
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.080]  But in fact, if you finance places with equity, there's enormous financial incentives for
[16:12.080 --> 16:19.720]  all of us to dramatically reduce our consumption in a way that aligns us and our finances with
[16:19.720 --> 16:20.720]  the environment.
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.480]  Cap-and-trade is a very different kind of system, it's a taxation system.
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.880]  And it says, you know, you can't trust people to do the right things, so rather than incentivize
[16:31.880 --> 16:36.320]  them with positive, what we're going to do is we're just going to make it very painful
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.960]  and expensive for them to not lower their footprint, but we're going to do it in a way
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.360]  that one, gives us central control and two, where we can gain the system.
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.600]  So I've always said, if you think, you know, that the cap-and-trade would make derivatives
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.760]  look like it was something that Mother Teresa came up with, because what you're seeing
[16:54.760 --> 17:01.880]  in cap-and-trade is the worst polluters in the planet being given a get-out-of-jail-free
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.120]  card in exchange for making it much more expensive for the least polluting people.
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.840]  So for example, Democracy Now just had a great description about a month ago of General
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.760]  Motors purchasing of carbon credits in Brazil, and basically, you know, General Motors is
[17:18.760 --> 17:25.800]  free to pollute because the folks in Brazil can no longer hunt or do all sorts of things
[17:25.800 --> 17:29.000]  with land that they've been using for generations.
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.040]  So you literally have a system that allows the most polluting to continue to pollute and
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.240]  get a get-out-of-jail-free card by making life miserable for the people who have the
[17:40.240 --> 17:41.240]  lowest footprint.
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.560]  And exactly, even though they're going to buy these carbon credits, those fees, those
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.240]  costs will then be implemented on the lower class by what they cost.
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.760]  They'll just increase their price, and in fact, now you're seeing around gas stations
[17:54.760 --> 18:00.520]  that if cap-and-trade is passed, yes, gas will go up 75 cents or a dollar.
[18:00.520 --> 18:04.880]  And then the left cover is, oh, you must work for the oil industry.
[18:04.880 --> 18:06.680]  That's why you're against cap-and-trade.
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.040]  That's why you're against the carbon tax.
[18:09.040 --> 18:13.600]  Yet these headlines I have next to me at a Bloomberg shell calls for global expansion
[18:13.600 --> 18:15.840]  of cap-and-trade CO2 programs.
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.400]  And then we have an Exxon executive calling for the same things.
[18:19.400 --> 18:23.200]  These are the people that are actually behind this carbon tax system.
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.240]  Well, let's talk about what we need.
[18:26.240 --> 18:32.240]  The first thing that we need, whether it's if you're the American people or you're in
[18:32.240 --> 18:36.840]  Latin America or any continent around the world, what we all need is transparency about
[18:36.840 --> 18:37.840]  what's going on.
[18:37.840 --> 18:43.920]  What Climate Gate shows is that the quote-unquote science around the need to have any kind of
[18:43.920 --> 18:46.840]  climate system is bogus.
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.440]  And it's very hard for most people to believe that the concept of global warming could get
[18:53.440 --> 19:00.120]  this far and we have this kind of bogus science going on.
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.520]  And so the first thing that's needed, Jason, is transparency about where is climate change
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.560]  coming from, why, and what are the things that we can do, what does the human race control
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.400]  that we can change that can improve our circumstances for whatever reason.
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.040]  And I think that I'm someone who spends a huge amount of time trying to understand what's
[19:21.040 --> 19:22.520]  happening and why.
[19:22.520 --> 19:30.760]  And I still feel absolutely no confidence that I know why or can explain why climate
[19:30.760 --> 19:37.240]  change is happening because I think there's so much disinformation and it's a perfect
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.440]  example of how disinformation is used to bring about bad policy and control on what
[19:42.440 --> 19:47.920]  we need is a real honest conversation about what's going to happen and what can we do.
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.360]  Well the bottom line is if the data said what they said it showed, they wouldn't have destroyed
[19:52.360 --> 19:56.600]  it and they would have allowed it to be peer reviewed unless, except for, you know, they
[19:56.600 --> 20:00.560]  did and they hadn't fallen to the dark abyss since the Alice Jones show back.
[20:00.560 --> 20:02.440]  This is an emergency alert.
[20:02.440 --> 20:04.680]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[20:04.680 --> 20:08.520]  They die from system wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[20:08.520 --> 20:13.480]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyper stimulation.
[20:13.480 --> 20:17.800]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body adding to your death
[20:17.800 --> 20:18.800]  risk.
[20:18.800 --> 20:23.400]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations and drug toxicity.
[20:23.400 --> 20:28.280]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives,
[20:28.280 --> 20:29.560]  maybe even your own.

[20:36.200 --> 20:38.080]  and vaccine cleanse.
[20:38.080 --> 20:39.920]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[20:39.920 --> 20:45.440]  Use zeolife and oxy-silver hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[20:45.440 --> 20:48.240]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.

[21:01.880 --> 21:02.880]  Spy on me?
[21:02.880 --> 21:03.880]  Yeah.
[21:03.880 --> 21:06.680]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and store
[21:06.680 --> 21:08.040]  them in a giant database?
[21:08.040 --> 21:09.840]  You should use start page instead.
[21:09.840 --> 21:10.840]  Start page?
[21:10.840 --> 21:11.840]  Yeah.
[21:11.840 --> 21:12.840]  Startpage.com.
[21:12.840 --> 21:13.840]  The new name for Xquik.
[21:13.840 --> 21:14.840]  The world's most private search engine.
[21:14.840 --> 21:18.680]  They don't record your searches or your IP address and the search results are great.
[21:18.680 --> 21:21.720]  Plus, start page is third party certified and it's totally free.
[21:21.720 --> 21:24.240]  I don't want big brother watching what I do on the internet.
[21:24.240 --> 21:26.040]  I'm adding start page to my browser.
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.040]  Right.
[21:27.040 --> 21:29.760]  Start page.com and start searching with privacy.
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.680]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.600]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.240]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one week start page challenge.
[21:39.240 --> 21:43.680]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo or Bing, go to startpage.com
[21:43.680 --> 21:44.680]  instead.
[21:44.680 --> 21:47.800]  Try seven days of start page and break the big brother habit.
[21:47.800 --> 21:49.600]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[21:49.600 --> 21:53.960]  Try startpage.com for seven days and start protecting your privacy.
[21:53.960 --> 21:59.440]  Let's start page.com.
[21:59.440 --> 22:03.640]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[22:03.640 --> 22:06.040]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[22:06.040 --> 22:11.200]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[22:11.200 --> 22:14.200]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[22:14.200 --> 22:18.520]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[22:18.520 --> 22:22.440]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[22:22.440 --> 22:26.200]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[22:26.200 --> 22:27.440]  from Jekyll Island.
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.600]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[22:31.600 --> 22:32.600]  power.
[22:32.600 --> 22:36.560]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[22:36.560 --> 22:38.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[24:14.800 --> 24:19.120]  She's called the current economic situation a financial coup d'etat.
[24:19.120 --> 24:20.120]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[24:20.120 --> 24:23.960]  I'm Jason Vermus sitting in.
[24:23.960 --> 24:31.040]  I want to move on to what's going on in Copenhagen in just I think it's six or seven days it
[24:31.040 --> 24:37.560]  begins this Copenhagen Treaty where one of the quote unquote three pillars is global
[24:37.560 --> 24:43.200]  government and the term taxation and tax appears over a dozen times.
[24:43.200 --> 24:47.440]  They're trying to get this cap and trade scheme global.
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.600]  I mean all the way around so that we sign on to a treaty and of course the United States
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.840]  is the quote unquote worst polluter so we're going to be hit the hardest.
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.680]  What do you see coming out of this climate treaty, this meeting?
[24:59.680 --> 25:06.320]  I don't know what's going to come out of Copenhagen because I think there's been a real effort
[25:06.320 --> 25:10.440]  going on behind the scenes to make sure that the United States doesn't commit or commits
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.320]  as little as possible and we don't know how it's going to play out.
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.200]  The question behind all of this is really goes back to are we going to have a democracy
[25:21.200 --> 25:27.720]  or are we going to have the part of a system where invisible forces control top down through
[25:27.720 --> 25:33.760]  these unbelievably complex systems a lot of which are being engineered by using the
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.920]  environmental issues and the environmental sort of community.
[25:38.920 --> 25:46.320]  I think in many respects they're unknowing about it but I don't know what's going to
[25:46.320 --> 25:50.880]  come out Jason I think we just have to wait to see but it's part of a long term trend
[25:50.880 --> 25:58.280]  to try and engineer top down control in a way that literally takes any kind of accountability
[25:58.280 --> 26:02.880]  out of the hands of the people who live in a place so if you live in a county in the
[26:02.880 --> 26:08.560]  United States and the United States breaks down to just about 3100 counties who's in
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.280]  control in that county is it the World Trade Organization is it rule set in a place like
[26:14.280 --> 26:21.360]  Copenhagen is it the federal government or is it your local sheriff and town council
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.920]  and that's where the rubber is going to meet the road if you're a farmer do you own and
[26:25.920 --> 26:32.480]  control the water on your property or does somebody at the World Trade Organization determine
[26:32.480 --> 26:34.960]  what happens with it.
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.120]  So where do you see all this going in the United States what are we going to look like
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.240]  in 6 months in a year is the dollar going to continue to decline is gold going to continue
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.480]  to go up and then how can people really hedge their bets and protect themselves from this
[26:49.480 --> 26:55.360]  really economic takeover to the tune of an admitted over $27 trillion in bailouts.
[26:55.360 --> 27:02.400]  Well the first thing you want to do is you know we I'm not a profit so there are many
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.080]  different things that can happen there are many different scenarios that can play out
[27:06.080 --> 27:10.480]  but the one thing we do know is that there's certain long term trends and what you want
[27:10.480 --> 27:15.680]  to do is make sure you align yourself with a long term trend so the first long term trend
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.120]  is we're having a shift of resources out of financial assets and multicultural bubble
[27:21.120 --> 27:28.320]  economics and into real things and what that means is we need to the average person the
[27:28.320 --> 27:33.280]  average household needs to demonetize so for example I once had a friend who was constantly
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.840]  complaining about how the yields in her stock market portfolio were falling and her water
[27:37.840 --> 27:41.720]  bill was going up and I said well you know this is really easy why don't you just sell
[27:41.720 --> 27:49.320]  some stock and build a well and so that's a perfect example where we put our money into
[27:49.320 --> 27:53.040]  corporate securities and then we get a yield on our corporate securities and then we go
[27:53.040 --> 27:58.280]  into the market and buy from those same corporations the goods and services that we need so we've
[27:58.280 --> 28:05.520]  been intermediated and demonetization is really about saying okay where can I start investing
[28:05.520 --> 28:11.960]  my time in my resources so that I permanently lower my overhead because it makes sense to
[28:11.960 --> 28:16.640]  you know to go back to the way my grandparents or great-grandparents did it the economics
[28:16.640 --> 28:22.040]  are changing because we're in a bull market for tangibles so for example the more I can
[28:22.040 --> 28:29.840]  reduce my dependency in terms of my energy my food you know on unreliable players you
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.560]  want to get unreliable players out of your life so so I you know one of the questions
[28:35.560 --> 28:43.000]  I always ask people is who's your farmer who's your bank or where's your money with general
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.720]  with with with genetically modified food there's a reason we all want to start getting to know
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.680]  our farmers again and finding ways of you know maybe investing in farmland that help
[28:54.680 --> 29:01.400]  make sure you have a you know a wonderful supply of food you know so demonetization
[29:01.400 --> 29:07.840]  about about about that the second thing is where where are you putting your money and
[29:07.840 --> 29:15.840]  how does that relate to to making sure you're advantaged I always give the example of three
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.240]  women I was sitting with a group of three women who are very close friends and I got
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.760]  them talking about how their money worked and what we discovered is that one had her
[29:24.760 --> 29:29.200]  money in a local bank that was sending their money into their correspondent bank in New
[29:29.200 --> 29:35.320]  York there's a large New York bank and they were getting about 4% at the time on their
[29:35.320 --> 29:39.960]  money and when when we come back I'll finish the story sounds good we're with Catherine
[29:39.960 --> 29:45.040]  Austin bits it's the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Burmese sitting in go check out all of our
[29:45.040 --> 29:51.480]  films all of our programs over at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv we're on the march the
[29:51.480 --> 30:02.440]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen

[33:54.960 --> 34:00.120]  we we left off with you Catherine talking about how you should really know your farmer
[34:00.120 --> 34:05.080]  and then you were getting into how you should really know your banker yes absolutely these
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.040]  three women were sitting around all good friends one had her money in a local bank that was
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.440]  shipping its money to the correspondent large new york bank she was getting about 4% on
[34:15.440 --> 34:24.440]  her money at the time yields were much higher the second woman had her 401k IRA it's both
[34:24.440 --> 34:30.840]  401k and IRA and she had her money in the in the stock of the same new york bank and
[34:30.840 --> 34:34.680]  their third friend and remember I'm getting them talking about their money it turns out
[34:34.680 --> 34:40.040]  that their friend was borrowing on her credit card she started a business using her credit
[34:40.040 --> 34:45.320]  card right after that it was a credit card of the same new york bank the bank checked
[34:45.320 --> 34:53.000]  the rate up to 23% the first two women are making about 5% and providing their capital
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.600]  their life savings to this bank and one of their best friends is borrowing it back at
[34:57.600 --> 35:02.440]  23% now what's wrong with that picture why did we why do we need a bank thousands of
[35:02.440 --> 35:08.040]  miles away over a thousand miles away to get in between three friends in a way that's raking
[35:08.040 --> 35:14.440]  off huge and hideous profits well that's an opportunity and in fact there was one website
[35:14.440 --> 35:20.480]  that got started prosper.com which was allowing or set up to help people loan directly to
[35:20.480 --> 35:27.320]  each other and of course you know the boys shut it down so so another question is where
[35:27.320 --> 35:33.200]  is the opportunity to not be intermediated by the big institutions and find ways of
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.040]  making more money and keeping the cash flow in either our networks or our neighborhood
[35:38.040 --> 35:46.320]  um let's say we did everything Jason we could we you know we demonetized we bought our generator
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.800]  we started loaning toward you know let's say we did everything we could do just ourselves
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.600]  and our networks then the question comes down to okay now how do we start taking political
[35:56.600 --> 36:03.560]  action and in addition to who's your farmer and who's your banker a very important question
[36:03.560 --> 36:09.920]  in the 2010 election is going to be who's your sheriff because in fact if you look at
[36:09.920 --> 36:17.160]  the legal construct upon which the republic was founded the most powerful person in your
[36:17.160 --> 36:21.520]  county is not the president of the united states and it's not even your governor it's
[36:21.520 --> 36:27.800]  the sheriff and and literally the federal government cannot do anything outside or against
[36:27.800 --> 36:33.920]  the constitution if your sheriff says no you may not they they're the ultimate word within
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.640]  that jurisdiction and um we're going to have richard mac i don't know if you've ever had
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.040]  richard mac on the on the info wars but we're going to have richard mac who's a retired
[36:44.040 --> 36:48.520]  sheriff in arizona has written a lot about this question and in fact took the federal
[36:48.520 --> 36:53.000]  government to court went all the way to the supreme court and won he's going to be on
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.680]  the salaried report in january and so so i'm i just cringe when i see people spend money
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.960]  and time on the presidential elections when they're completely ignoring who is their sheriff
[37:05.960 --> 37:10.000]  and their political representation in their own local area you know in their town well
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.920]  i always tell people that they need to start locally and if they truly do want to change
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.320]  the system perhaps it's time for them to run for city council or state senator or even
[37:18.320 --> 37:23.400]  a congressional spot but of course the sheriff is a very very powerful position and an electable
[37:23.400 --> 37:27.480]  one so if you don't like what's going on in your county it's time for you to run for
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.480]  sheriff well but the other thing is you know the sheriff can do an awful lot if people
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.120]  will support them and that and a lot of the politics comes down to the fed throws a lot
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.720]  of money the more dependent we get on federal money and the more the feds control the cash
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.440]  flow locally the more everybody won't support their sheriff and standing up and that's why
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.520]  it's got to be battled out in the cash flow the next place you need to go after who's
[37:49.520 --> 37:54.560]  your sheriff is to look at okay let's look at where the where the governmental money
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.160]  is going we're paying taxes and that tax money is going someplace is that money circulating
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.240]  into the businesses that create employment and opportunities for us that we are neighbors
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.120]  own and i i just want to use an example of what's been happening because if you look
[38:10.120 --> 38:15.960]  if you dig in and you look at the federal state and local governmental flows all resources
[38:15.960 --> 38:20.760]  not just contracts or expenditures within a place what you discover is there's enormous
[38:20.760 --> 38:27.680]  opportunity to lower the burden to taxpayers in a way that creates much more income locally
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.160]  um for us and let me give you a perfect example i live in tennessee we have about twenty percent
[38:33.160 --> 38:38.840]  of the population now on food stamps huge part of the of the federal flow through in the
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.480]  tennessee state budget um it's over a billion dollars now so twenty percent of the people
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.600]  on food stamps in a state where we have fabulous farmland beautiful farmland that's just sitting
[38:50.600 --> 38:57.080]  not doing anything um it turns out jason that we are outsourcing the data servicing and
[38:57.080 --> 39:03.720]  customer support work on the food stamp contract in tennessee it's true in florida other states
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.240]  too are you ready for this jp morgan chase in india oh how lovely now we have we have
[39:09.240 --> 39:15.960]  counting is in tennessee where we have twenty five percent unemployment so so the federal
[39:15.960 --> 39:23.640]  and state governments are paying people to not work and and paying for their food stamps
[39:23.640 --> 39:30.240]  when they are also paying jp morgan chase to do jobs that these people could do well that's
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.040]  why those arguments never stand up that oh they don't want to take these jobs no you're
[39:34.040 --> 39:38.760]  not offering them to people you're moving them overseas and making it impossible for
[39:38.760 --> 39:45.040]  them to do this work well in fact data servicing jobs are wonderful jobs for many people if
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.680]  you are someone who has responsibilities for caring for children or for elderly parents
[39:50.680 --> 39:56.080]  or both data servicing jobs can be beamed in you know you can you can beam them out
[39:56.080 --> 40:01.280]  to lots of different sites locally um and they can be done in flexible hours so you
[40:01.280 --> 40:07.120]  can get very high productivity uh with flexible hours in in sites that are closer to home
[40:07.120 --> 40:12.920]  even residential so in fact it doesn't make any sense to beam those jobs to india because
[40:12.920 --> 40:19.600]  there is a way to do them here which is enormously wonderful for a workforce that literally cannot
[40:19.600 --> 40:26.560]  get in a car and commute an hour into nashville or noxville or you know tampa or olando because
[40:26.560 --> 40:33.120]  they have to take care of of and it's certainly much more economic for society to have them
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.480]  care for their family members than to try and institutionalize that so if you if you look
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.680]  at the fundamental economics you'll see again and again and i saw this i was asserted as
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.160]  the assistant secretary of housing and i would often see communities where we were spending
[40:48.160 --> 40:56.160]  $250,000 per unit to construct public housing when 50,000 would buy and rehab a single family
[40:56.160 --> 41:02.440]  home so we were we were paying five times per unit of what we needed to and in fact in
[41:02.440 --> 41:07.600]  the clinton administration i took that example uh it was in fact it was new orleans where
[41:07.600 --> 41:14.120]  this situation the fact pattern was just outrageous um i had first seen it in chicago i took it
[41:14.120 --> 41:18.480]  to the assistant of the person who ran that program at hut and i said look if we just
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.200]  reengineered the money we could get five homes for the price of one the person turned bright
[41:23.200 --> 41:28.120]  red and looked at me and said but how could we generate fees for a friend so when there's
[41:28.120 --> 41:33.120]  a bubble going on jason everybody's happy to generate fees for their our friends you
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.600]  know when when you turn to people and say your children can't have health care because
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.880]  there's not enough money it's time to look at 50 years of accumulated fees for our friends
[41:43.880 --> 41:50.600]  and say you know maybe we need to re-engineer how things work because we've had we've had
[41:50.600 --> 41:56.160]  decades of computers and new technology and yet the overhead costs of fundamental government
[41:56.160 --> 42:05.400]  projects have skyrocketed exponentially and that's because we are subsidizing a huge infrastructure
[42:05.400 --> 42:10.080]  the the biggest piece of which is these big corporations because you give a big corporation
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.480]  a government contract and you drive their stock up so there's real you know capital
[42:15.480 --> 42:21.000]  gains on stock market real estate is the primary source of political contributions and and
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  it starts though in your own county thing okay let me get control of my local representatives
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.600]  whether it's my sheriff or town council or state representative make sure we have excellent
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.960]  people in office but then let's look at the money and let's look at where we're paying
[42:36.960 --> 42:43.360]  five times but you know of what is needed and where we cannot re-engineer the money
[42:43.360 --> 42:49.480]  to to get a much better result in terms of expenses down an income up for the people
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.440]  here in a way that reduces the low to taxpayer and I tell you those those opportunities are
[42:54.440 --> 42:59.560]  absolutely there we're going to open up the phone lines for Catherine Austin Fitz in
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.760]  just a moment but first I want to get your take on gold being at a record high today
[43:03.760 --> 43:09.760]  where is the roof on this thing are we going to see it go up above 1300 1400 maybe even
[43:09.760 --> 43:15.360]  hit 1500 where do you see gold and precious metals going if you if you go back and you
[43:15.360 --> 43:24.760]  look at the at the high in 1980 before the current high and you say okay you know gold
[43:24.760 --> 43:33.960]  traded at 800 even above but you know the close with 800 so so gold traded at 819 80
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.480]  if we were going to say okay how much was that in inflation in just the dollars because
[43:38.480 --> 43:44.880]  we've had enormous inflation from 1980 until now so it's over 30 years of inflation but
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.680]  in current dollars what was that 800 depending on who calculates it and what series they
[43:51.680 --> 43:57.240]  use do they use a government series or for example John Williams shadow stats has redone
[43:57.240 --> 44:04.320]  the government numbers so do we use the you know more reliable numbers like John's for
[44:04.320 --> 44:12.120]  the for the CPI in the inflation what would 800 dollars be in current dollars you get
[44:12.120 --> 44:19.160]  you get estimates of anywhere from 2500 to 7500 and so what we're looking at today with
[44:19.160 --> 44:24.920]  the price of approximately 1200 dollars is something that is less than 50% of where the
[44:24.920 --> 44:31.600]  high was in 1980 so on an inflation adjusted basis Jason we're nowhere near the high that's
[44:31.600 --> 44:39.440]  number one number two the challenge we have with precious metals is that it's a very tiny
[44:39.440 --> 44:45.440]  market relative to the global stock or bond markets and I mean the global bond market
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.760]  is huge and then you add derivative so if a tiny bit of money decides it wants to shift
[44:50.760 --> 44:57.560]  into precious metals you're talking about enormous pressure to drive the price up now
[44:57.560 --> 45:03.880]  we've seen over the last 15 years real intervention by the central banks and government treasuries
[45:03.880 --> 45:09.880]  to drive and manage the price down as really a way to protect the bond market and sort
[45:09.880 --> 45:16.480]  of the inflated values of global currencies particularly the dollar more and more investors
[45:16.480 --> 45:21.520]  are beginning to understand that game one of the one of the things that has always threatened
[45:21.520 --> 45:28.400]  the market with the overhang of gold that the IMF has said that it was willing to sell
[45:28.400 --> 45:34.720]  the IMF is beginning instead of just threatening sales they have approved sales but that overhang
[45:34.720 --> 45:40.720]  is going very quickly into central banks which are snapping it up and if you say to yourself
[45:40.720 --> 45:46.600]  look if central banks and institutional investors and retail investors are going to start to
[45:46.600 --> 45:52.800]  move into this very very thin market it doesn't take much incremental change in percentage
[45:52.800 --> 45:58.400]  of market share to drive the price through the roof so the long term fundamentals on
[45:58.400 --> 46:08.160]  precious metals are very very strong number one and number two it is very important to
[46:08.160 --> 46:14.640]  remember that this is an extremely political market and a very you know there's an economic
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.720]  court going on in the middle of this market so we're looking at prices that are extremely
[46:19.720 --> 46:26.800]  volatile and it's very important to recognize yes we have a long-term bull market my guess
[46:26.800 --> 46:33.040]  is that there is a great distance to go this is only just begun but you have to be very
[46:33.040 --> 46:37.480]  careful because in the short term we're going to get wild swings and it's important for
[46:37.480 --> 46:43.000]  a retail investor to not do anything in this market where they could get they could caught
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.120]  get caught by that you know by those swings so before anybody sort of tiptoes into these
[46:48.120 --> 46:52.920]  waters just make sure you understand what what you've got going and be prepared to stick
[46:52.920 --> 46:58.440]  in it for the long haul now when does it end one of the things that could end all of this
[46:58.440 --> 47:05.600]  is is when a new global currency it goes into effect and it's really working and that will
[47:05.600 --> 47:14.680]  diminish the need for for using precious metals is sort of a global currency this reflects
[47:14.680 --> 47:20.440]  not only that need but the need that the distrust that everybody has in government so we're
[47:20.440 --> 47:26.600]  really watching a deterioration in the quality of sovereign government credits worldwide so
[47:26.600 --> 47:30.800]  I think this goes on for a long time you just want to be really careful because we're talking
[47:30.800 --> 47:36.240]  about something that will be will price in very volatile ways against your local currency
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.240]  all right let's go to the phone lines let's go to Betty in Texas Betty what's on your
[47:41.240 --> 47:47.040]  mind Catherine thank you so much for allowing me to speak to you I'm so thrilled with everything
[47:47.040 --> 47:55.920]  that you say however I would like to add in something about the Copenhagen Treaty one
[47:55.920 --> 48:01.680]  Obama still hasn't produced his birth certificate and he's being sued over that by Phil Berg
[48:01.680 --> 48:08.880]  I believe and two he cannot set as the head of the Security Council of the United Nations
[48:08.880 --> 48:15.960]  while he's being president of the United States and so have you heard anything about whether
[48:15.960 --> 48:23.800]  or not Phil Berg has filed an injunction to keep Obama from going and signing the Copenhagen
[48:23.800 --> 48:32.640]  Treaty and what do you think about it I don't know I don't know I know I'm just an ignorant
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.440]  of the status of law suit occasionally you know I'll like anybody I'll read things on
[48:36.440 --> 48:41.600]  the internet but I really am not current and I don't think that there's anything actually
[48:41.600 --> 48:45.640]  going on in regards to the Copenhagen Treaty due to that I thank you for the call Betty
[48:45.640 --> 48:51.760]  let's go to Chris in New Mexico Chris you're on the line thanks Jason hi Catherine hi
[48:51.760 --> 49:00.120]  Jason no that was Jason I'm Chris that's okay Chris what do you got for us Catherine
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.480]  nice to hear you and in the daytime instead of the middle of the night would you spend
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.160]  a few minutes talking about one of the alternative currencies you know I think that's the only
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.880]  way that we're going to get out of this mess something like along the lines of Ithaca
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.280]  ours or you know some of the others that have been established and I know you know a little
[49:18.280 --> 49:25.600]  bit about that so maybe can you address that sure I I think there are a number of ways
[49:25.600 --> 49:31.000]  that we can start to transact both locally and in our networks any important thing to
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.280]  understand is it needs to be built in a very granular way which gives energy to the people
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.960]  in the short short term within a community one of the challenges of community currencies
[49:42.960 --> 49:49.600]  is that if you organize them as a sort of new legal structure and make them complicated
[49:49.600 --> 49:55.400]  they can be very expensive and time-consuming and I'm a believer in the just do it method
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.280]  and I would look at several things one is the idea of doing of using your gold the silver
[50:00.280 --> 50:06.360]  coins is as just a medium of exchange if you go to our website at salieri.com Franklin
[50:06.360 --> 50:12.560]  Sanders as the money changer and I have created a little application which we're about to
[50:12.560 --> 50:18.360]  redevelop and roll out a new one in 2010 called the gold and silver payment calculator and
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.720]  allows you to translate back and forth between dollars you know let's say you want to pay
[50:23.720 --> 50:28.840]  somebody a hundred dollars you can use the calculator to very quickly calculate in silver
[50:28.840 --> 50:35.400]  and gold coins what it would take to pay that amount so the first thing they're going to
[50:35.400 --> 50:40.200]  suggest three things but the first is just start using your gold and silver coins to
[50:40.200 --> 50:44.840]  transact just do it let's let's talk about those other two things on the other side it's
[50:44.840 --> 50:50.200]  the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Burmese sitting in info wars dot com prison plan dot tv and

[54:12.280 --> 54:16.600]  Dallas I'm Jason Bermas sitting in if you missed any of the program remember following
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.680]  the broadcast the podcast is available at info wars dot com three great guests a Jim
[54:21.680 --> 54:27.200]  O'Neill Gary Lachman Catherine Austin Fitz and of course Alex Jones joined us for the
[54:27.200 --> 54:32.480]  better part of an hour Catherine you were just talking about what currencies you could
[54:32.480 --> 54:37.600]  get into you said you know use your silver and gold coins as currencies but you had
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.520]  two other points you wanted to make sure and and this is the you know how do we start currencies
[54:42.520 --> 54:47.840]  by the just do it method the second is there's a wonderful association called erda it's the
[54:47.840 --> 54:55.000]  international association related to barter networks in your community it is likely that
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.080]  you already have a barter network set up that could use some support and there is a great
[55:01.080 --> 55:06.920]  deal that can be done through barter networks both locally and their network globally so
[55:06.920 --> 55:14.520]  you know you can end up getting your your tour package to Scotland for for the holidays
[55:14.520 --> 55:20.000]  through your local barter network so so check out the erda website and find the local barter
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.600]  network or networks in your place and start to see if there aren't ways you can use it
[55:24.600 --> 55:31.760]  a lot of times you'll find businesses report as much as a 10% increase in sales that come
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.760]  about by their use of barter so there's a lot of opportunities but we need to start just
[55:37.760 --> 55:43.560]  build from the infrastructure that's there finally there's there's a real opportunity
[55:43.560 --> 55:53.880]  as Chris said to to explore exchanging or trading or using hours just using hours among
[55:53.880 --> 55:59.240]  neighbors and friends and businesses but then going to a more formal system of trading our
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.720]  time and trading hours that makes an awful lot of extents sense to explore it starts
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.440]  with really talking to other people in your community whether it's your neighbor or other
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.160]  small businesses about how you can help each other save time or lower your expenses so
[56:15.160 --> 56:20.840]  it really starts with socializing and communication and just exploring the ideas if you can start
[56:20.840 --> 56:26.560]  to have more reciprocal relationships and connections then you can move to a system of
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.840]  really trading hours and there's lots of information on the website now I will I will
[56:31.840 --> 56:36.880]  say one of the most interesting statistics Jason is during the Great Depression there
[56:36.880 --> 56:43.840]  were over 3200 local currencies in America you think there'll be a revival in this 3100
[56:43.840 --> 56:49.040]  counties so so this is something that we're going to we're going to go we're going to
[56:49.040 --> 56:55.880]  return and be doing this again and so it absolutely makes sense to spend time to start with what
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.840]  you know whether it's your gold and silver coins partner networks in your community
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.720]  just getting to know more people in your neighborhood and seeing where you can't trade time you
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.520]  know just where I live in a very rural community so we're always offering to help each other
[57:09.520 --> 57:15.000]  I'm going into town what can I pick up for you alright final caller Noel in Illinois
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.240]  you're on the air yes hi Jason fable enemies was unbelievable and I have a quick question
[57:20.240 --> 57:26.120]  in terms of the climate gate scandal if any of you guys talked about there's a newsletter
[57:26.120 --> 57:33.320]  from earth government March 27 2003 which talks about how we needed a earth government
[57:33.320 --> 57:38.200]  terms of terms of like a one world government to help you know I have seen that document
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.480]  Noel I have seen that document I have not discussed it on the program but that's purely
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.760]  oversight the only thing about that document is it's not an actual email it was something
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.360]  that was being emailed to other people as kind of like this precursor I guess to the
[57:50.360 --> 57:54.560]  global government they were going to try to get passed in the Copenhagen Treaty very pro
[57:54.560 --> 57:59.600]  one world government very pro new world order but after all that is where this all seems
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.560]  to be headed as they are trying to promote a global currency Catherine Austin Fitz's
[58:03.560 --> 58:09.680]  website is salari.com that's S-O-L-A-R-I if you missed any of the program we got the podcast

[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:43.600]  Obama detailing the global government banking slash carbon tax takeover this film couldn't

[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:20.160]  check that out going to Alan wad of cousin matrix.com first off I haven't talked to you
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:23.240]  since we got you a copy of it when the guys came to interview you a few months ago in
[1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:29.960]  Canada what's your take on fall of the republic Alan it's having a great impact it's all over
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:37.960]  the planet now and I get emails from so many people saying they've seen it and it's hitting
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  them between the eyes some of them it's a darn good thing because with no time to lose
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:48.320]  here and catching up I've got to be shocked into reality and I think it helps to do that
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:52.720]  what do you think of the film yourself I mean I want your honest review oh it's well done
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:59.680]  it's well done I mean the camera guys I think they were here doing the take they knew their
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:05.040]  staff as well I think this was well on and I don't know who did the editing and so on
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:10.200]  but they tell me a good job of patching all the different pieces together to make it flow
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.600]  and actually the topics flowing so that people who didn't know too much could get an understanding
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:21.440]  and take them right through it in a condensed form and that's what we have to do today because
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:29.200]  we cannot give a complete lifetime education to people in a fast move except by condensing
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:33.520]  it for them and giving them important parts and really stressing how it's done and where
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:38.560]  it is going if it don't participate in their own future yeah yeah I mean we're showing
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.640]  people here's the globalist agenda here's their own documents here their own statements
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:47.340]  do you want this for yourself and your future do you want to be a slave who was eventually
[1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:53.320]  euthanized the decision is up to you one of the few criticisms I've gotten for follow
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:03:00.280]  the republic is well I already knew a lot of this or this has a lot of basic senate
[1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:06.280]  yes that's the whole point of the Obama deception fall the republic is to be slickly done well
[1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:11.960]  produced highest level graphics and it has a lot of new information as well but yes it
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:17.640]  gives people the basics because we're trying to reach people who have no idea of what's
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:24.160]  going on and plus when you get people together who know with people who don't know rather
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:30.120]  than just go over stuff through books or weekly meetings if you've all shared the same video
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:34.720]  you can then discuss it yourself and chip and it's a good way to catch up quickly to
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:39.040]  speak as to what's happening you could have something in common and something you've all
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:44.280]  got there seen or read in common and that's how it's done today we don't have time to
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:49.120]  give a history for the last hundred odd years we don't have time so you have to condense
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:54.560]  it to put an important part so that the dinners can understand and bring up to speak so they
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.800]  can then converse with you with the knowledge that you're sharing and then once they have
[1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:04.160]  a basic blueprint of just part of the system it's too complex to give somebody the full
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:08.120]  view I mean I'm still learning every day it's so big and complex and they've had so many
[1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:13.080]  specials working for so long on different parts of this matrix system but once people
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:19.200]  have a basic snapshot a basic crash course and brain surgery then they can start picking
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:27.240]  up the other rabbit trails and larger gestalts for themselves as their palate develops that's
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:32.640]  correct you understand the break up against organization organizations be working steadily
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:39.320]  for well over a hundred years with non-governmental organizations who are trained in a school type
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:46.280]  format gradually updated with their vision of the future and to either organize their
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:52.160]  funded some of them are full-time employees in fact to get salaries from the big foundations
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:57.360]  and pension funds that's what we're up against massive organization we have to do it with
[1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:02.760]  what we have and this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:07.720]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:12.840]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:17.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:22.880]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.240]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:05.360]  to Alan want Alan want enough with Christmas and fall the republic we have total mind control
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:10.240]  being established in the country we have all over the United States Europe the western
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:16.520]  world children on record writing reports on their parents we confirmed that the heard
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:23.200]  now is power authority in Texas central Texas is making the kids fill out dossiers on their
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:28.280]  parents through the public schools or they get a zero on their grade I have a report
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:33.960]  here of where a boy drew an image of Jesus and it was kicked out of school and is having
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:39.320]  a psychological assessment done in fact show prison planet dot TV viewers an image of this
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:45.760]  I mean we really are living in a secret police style tyranny the ran corporation is already
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:53.600]  announcing that all your local police departments are openly federalized regular army garrisons
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:13:00.320]  will be stationed as domestic police as a rapid reaction force to take over local police
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:06.600]  departments that's in this ran corporation report so much is going on go over that Alan
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:12.800]  want and then your take on what's happening at Copenhagen you know is their program really
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:22.280]  in deep trouble well we find that the U.S. is the last country to be basically completely
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:28.640]  socialized the socialist system it's already completely through Europe especially Britain
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:34.320]  is an incredible country right now where the back in the 80s in fact they federalized
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:41.120]  at least they put a chief police association in charge of all of the police across Britain
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:46.920]  and supposedly they were going to use martial law back in the 80s Britain had to be sacrificed
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:52.000]  for first nuclear strikes in order for the U.S. to survive so it's never got out of that
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.080]  mode a bit easier for the federalized government to take over and this is a socialist system
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:04.280]  I tell people so often don't get confused with fascism communism socialism it's all
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:12.000]  the same thing you see and that's what's being used today a long time ago I was decided
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:16.760]  by the big powers and economists and those who ruled the banking system of the world
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.520]  along with the politicians and the Fabian society that they'd have to bring in a socialist
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:29.920]  system and train the public train them gradually to allow the experts at top simply handle all
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.120]  the big problems we were taught to play at the bottom that's been very successful since
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.000]  mainly from the 60s onwards and so we're out of the loop most of our quite content that's
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:45.640]  right they made it a moral a moral right like it's cool that men and women don't care and
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:51.440]  aren't involved it's uncool to be involved it's fun to be an idiot that's correct and
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:57.480]  well we're all being idiots and playing and it's through credit cards and everyone and
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.440]  they gave us a youth culture a perpetual youth culture for anyone over a certain age
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:09.400]  is just non-existent they did not want older wiser people coming into the game and teaching
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:14.120]  people what was really going on by the knowledge and history etc that's been very very successful
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:18.400]  you don't revere your elders they're just people to be exterminated and now time and
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:23.240]  news we have articles about let's just murder all the old people it's so liberal that's
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:28.480]  correct and that that is going coming down the site of Holland with euthanasia Britain
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:34.040]  has just passed laws on it to the U.S. I think that their first main one like this year in
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:39.600]  fact earlier this year openly and so that's the agenda this is all written again going
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:45.400]  back to the days of HG Wells and the utopians the Fabians and also population control was
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:51.160]  a ramp up abortion and sterilization on the one end which is coming down by the way as
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:57.040]  part of the Copenhagen treaty then the ramp up the other side too Obama's all made him
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:00.800]  into the communist statements and that's what it is folks you're under that system right
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:04.800]  now if you don't know it look at all the people who are in his staff right now they're all
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:09.200]  that some of many of them are card-carring communists and they're true believers in
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:15.320]  the world Fabian system of socialism but just like the media told us communism didn't
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:21.640]  exist for 1991 they tell us no new world order to exist even as they announced it even as
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:27.360]  I was reading two weeks ago in a mercantile report that the number one shirts are hammer
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:32.080]  and sickle shirts if that's correct and a lot of the U.S. that theaters are wearing
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:38.960]  I think it's all cool and trendy and I remember too that back in the 50s remember the re-commission
[1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:44.840]  authorized by the U.S. Congress and the Senate the investigations into the tax-free foundations
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:50.520]  the big Rockefellas Ford Carnegie all the other ones there who are funding what appeared
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:57.640]  to be to them all the far-left communist groups and Senator Norman Dodd and he's up on YouTube
[1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:04.160]  it's talking about this it was a sonnish when he was told by the CEO of the Ford Foundation
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:09.640]  that their third job of the foundation was to fund NGOs and so on so changed the society
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:14.640]  and culture within the Western world and especially America that it eventually blended seamlessly
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:20.800]  with that of the Soviet system that has happened that has happened and they're going out the
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:26.760]  next step because in Marxian economics they must have everything centralized under world
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:31.760]  government that's what the United Nations was established to become with the IMF there
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:33.880]  at the top the World Bank and all the rest of it.
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:39.640]  Alan to interrupt from your study how does Russia tie in because Russia is paying people
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:44.600]  to have kids now because they've lost 45 million people thanks to the global agenda.
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  They're talking about the New World Order on their television I mean is Russia going
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:54.040]  rogue from the New World Order or bidding for a better position in the New World Order?
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:59.400]  A better position but however too you understand too when the Bolshevik revolution took over
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:07.000]  Russia the Bolsheviks were comprised of non-Russians primarily who moved into the Soviet Union
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:11.880]  and they ran the entire Soviet Union through the Soviet era.
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:16.120]  It was mainly people from Brooklyn came over and ran it and they got kicked out and then
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:17.960]  now they're the neocons, yeah.
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:22.680]  And that's correct as well and after the war came down and prior to it many of them moved
[1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:30.120]  out many of them went to Israel others moved into a lot of moved into California, Toronto
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:35.480]  and other places to continue the agenda of the merger over here.
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:41.200]  Now Gorbachev himself who remember was the president of the Soviet Union who was taken
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:48.160]  around the world on a world tour by Margaret Thatcher by her arm arm and arm and she introduced
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:53.280]  them to the world as a new type of communist so they'd already chosen him to lead the Soviet
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:57.200]  Union as a visit brought down the walls and we're going to go back to Lenin.
[1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:03.560]  Lenin said the dictatorship would last about 70 or 80 years and it was to merge into the
[1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:09.160]  West where the new system would emerge not quite capitalist not quite communist as the
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:17.240]  socialist Fabian system worldwide run by experts, eugenicists, all the guys on top, a planned
[1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:24.160]  society, a planned population and that's what's happening right now as we live we're watching
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:31.440]  the people appointed on Obama's system we know who they all are they've got tremendous
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:36.640]  histories and involvement in this communist technique and that the Fabian society holds
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:42.240]  up and by the way this is not this is not Joseph McCarthy up here this isn't Alex Jones
[1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:49.400]  or Alan Watt Alan because I read all the same books he's reading books written by Gorbachev
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:57.120]  written by HG Wells written by Leon Trotsky written by Joseph Stalin by Vladimir Lenin

[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:23.040]  by the way fox news is playing the 10 mega stories of 2009 one of them is how the japanese
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:30.640]  government wants to put lithium an anti-psychotic in the water supply let me give you a news flash
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:38.960]  most u.s. municipal supplies already have lithium added you can go over the toxicology reports for
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:48.320]  your city's water you'll find it's not leaching in they're adding it you know the national media
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:53.360]  calls me all the time allen white when they say you're crazy you're saying they're putting
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:58.000]  cancer viruses and vaccines you say they're drugging the water and then i start emailing
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.960]  a mainstream articles and they shut up real fast they always think they've gotten me then i'll be
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:07.680]  talking to some yuppie producer and i'll see don't you care about your kids and they'll start
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.080]  really really realizing for their petty power position of lying that that they're really
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:19.520]  assaulting their own children but they still just giggle and go on with it uh briefly from
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:27.360]  your research cancer viruses and vaccines and uh calmative toxins in the water a very very old
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:33.440]  techniques um they started off with fluoride of course in the early days they knew about the stuff
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.720]  and they're at the beginning of the 1900s and what it did with people it made them more pliable
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:44.880]  and more easily managed but it was japan too where they first noticed that a particular village
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:50.960]  in japan many years ago uh were much more plastered than the average villager and they realized
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:56.160]  they didn't test the water there was natural lithium in it so that's where the idea sprung
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:01.040]  from if we add this to other people's supplies they'll make them more docile and easily manage
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:05.920]  they won't care much what's happening the big world or what's kind of coming down in the future
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:10.000]  and that's why they're adding it across the world they couldn't understand and go back to julien
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:18.560]  hoxley julien hoxley the brother of of aldoo hoxley his grandfather was uh sir thomas hoxley the best
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:23.760]  friend of charles darwin and darwinism is a big part of this whole socialist agenda it gave them
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:28.560]  ammunition for their purpose and for their planning for the future based on superior types
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:37.360]  and fewer types and so on and um so julien hoxley talked about the coming system of control
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:44.640]  but it would definitely use pharmacology and and um the jewish ethnosis techniques of persuasion
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.920]  on on uh television and and so on that's what they would use for the public it's been very
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.440]  successful already never mind all the stuff that's naturally prescribed by the positions
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:00.640]  in the tranquilizing business um they also put it into the water and you've got to go into the
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:05.920]  right things too of another hardline communist by the way who worked for am i five like most of them
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:15.840]  did and um that was after kessler as declassified he was an agent for them and um he worked with
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:21.760]  united nations during the sixties on projects to find ways of lobotomizing the human brain
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:29.040]  chemically or through viral or bacterial means they discussed the means of directing bio warfare
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:34.640]  techniques right to the brain itself by injections he said we can do it through the food we could
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:39.920]  do it through the water supply the only problem was how to actually introduce it and of course the
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:45.280]  public weren't to know and the un had different teams all working on the same project millions of
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:52.400]  dollars went to the investigations russia went the straightforward way of of mandatory lobotomizing
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:57.680]  people physically uh you know the criminal element those who spoke out with uh wrong think
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:03.760]  or had inflexibility of opinion that was a psychiatric disorder uh they would lobotomize them
[1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:08.160]  but they found that they could do it by inoculations where they would carry something
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:12.960]  right to the brain fever develops in the baby and there's there's there's there's short a few
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:18.800]  uh sands off the dollar from then on uh that's all being done i think don't expect which is good
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:25.760]  i mean you then get a partially lobotomized biological robot that you can then program
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:32.160]  because programming doesn't work if it isn't started early and if the person has an advanced
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.800]  intellect that will then later in life discover the programming it'll then be hard to get rid of
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:44.000]  all of it but then stronger willed people who are also intelligent can uh counterman the programming
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.600]  but for a lot of people who are already just going to be average intelligence
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:52.400]  they're now borderline retarded and that's why you can't reach out to them and officially the
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:29:00.080]  united nations uh has at lord the official average IQ by about four or five point that's right
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:05.680]  yeah pretty soon geniuses will be able to tie their shoelaces that's correct that's correct yeah
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:11.280]  yeah and and they giggle and laugh about this and their argument is hey look the public doesn't
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:17.040]  care we're brain damaging them they deserve to be brain damaged further and now we have the mass
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:23.680]  campaigns now with the fake flu pandemics and so on to terrify the public and to compliance
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:30.160]  to get the latest uh upgraded by a warfare technique to lobotomize them and uh it is so
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:36.640]  part of the team this but they can't ask for volunteers alan watch stay there i want to get
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:43.280]  into the flu your take on that then copenhagen uh and then some phone calls and we'll play that
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:51.920]  clip from fox news about drugging your water it's the newest coolest thing we're on the march the

[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:15.760]  are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:21.360]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas
[1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:26.480]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:30.960]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:36.640]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:15.840]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line
[1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:21.440]  of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:28.240]  system with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles
[1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:33.360]  instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:39.680]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator

[1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:24.160]  yeah here's box news and i've seen msnbc the clips on youtube
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:30.720]  where they propose putting prozac in the water and uh the federal government's also proposing
[1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:36.320]  putting statins in the water they're now teaching kids that five-year-olds need anti-cholesterol
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:42.320]  drugs which completely eat your liver it's just doesn't even help you with cholesterol it's all
[1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:49.840]  lies now over 150 chemicals on average are put in us drinking water same thing in canada the u k
[1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:58.320]  some have over 300 and it's lithium everything of course lithium is a heavy metal very toxic
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:05.520]  it's the same thing with fluoride sodium fluoride but when you hear fluoride that's a catchall term
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:13.280]  under federal regulations for over 300 chemicals they're allowed to put in and they mercury every
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:19.360]  they are killing you okay that's why people look so bad even if they exercise and try to eat healthy
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.480]  there's i mean these are sickos okay they openly write textbooks how they want to kill us we're
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:28.720]  going to talk down we want about that in a moment uh real expert on this stuff and a big part of
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:35.680]  fall the republic but but here's here's fox television with only two weeks left of 2009 we're
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:40.640]  taking a look back at some of the most interesting health care discoveries of the past year joining
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:46.160]  us is fox nine medical expert dr r kell georgia to talk about it good morning good morning a first
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:52.080]  deal has been adding a fluoride to its public water supply for decades and of course to prevent
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:59.360]  tooth decay or researchers from japan are suggesting that we add lithium so why is that well they're
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.920]  actually not suggesting it but they're certainly looking into it lithium is a medication that in
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:09.120]  prescription doses treats mood disorders and people with bipolar disorder or manic depressive
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:15.600]  illness and what these researchers found in japan is that it's uh lithium is present in trace
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:20.160]  amounts in the normal water supply in some communities and in those communities they have
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:25.520]  a lower suicide rate and so they're really investigating whether trace amounts of lithium
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:31.920]  can just change the mood enough to really in a in a positive way without having the bad effects
[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:36.560]  of lithium to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide rate very interesting concept you
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:42.160]  know it's the same reason why we put iodine and salt fluoride and water um there's there's many
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:48.480]  different examples of when we put trace amounts of chemicals in the normal supply of food or water
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.480]  to help people's health right although not this is the first where they're actually
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:58.000]  affecting people's moods and you know the brain so that uh i'm sure we have a lot of red flags for
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.920]  people all right moving on so what they do is they pitch it to you as a great thing it's already
[1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:08.320]  being done lithium's already put in your water okay let me get everybody the news flash you can
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:14.000]  pull up an epa report for any major city and sure they could say small towns have natural trace
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.400]  amounts some towns have natural trace amounts of mercury or arsenic or cyanide does it mean you
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:24.960]  want to go drink it alan watt this is they're really getting us ready for this because they
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:30.000]  know we're exposing that they're already putting in the water so they're going yeah we're kim trailing
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.480]  you john p holdren this year admitted it and yeah we're putting stuff in your water what's wrong
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:41.520]  with that we have to go back again quite some time to realize that this is uh nothing new about the
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:50.480]  idea uh the big boys had global meetings back in the 30s even 40s 50s always looking towards this
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:56.880]  future world society they were going to bring it to be and um they talked to say but ways of doing
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:02.080]  it and pharma was to be a big part of it it's no doubt about that they all thought about using pharma
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:08.480]  and you find with big new brisinski who pretty well says he's got his own man and as the president
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:14.960]  now because he trains him um in his book between two ages that he published back in the 1970s he
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:19.760]  talked about mind control he talked about the technotronic era but he talked about other
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:26.560]  methods too where the public would be basically made docile he said it can be done electronically
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:32.160]  by using standing waves across the whole continent it needs to be which means it was already tested
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:39.040]  out back in the 70s that looks what works but he also mentioned other methods as well and then i saw
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:46.080]  baltimore sun article about eight years ago where it said oh darpa in major cities is testing calming
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:52.800]  waves that's right to make everyone happy what's wrong with calming waves alan what what why are
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:58.080]  you and i different why don't we love the government putting a toxic heavy metal in the water to brain
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:04.960]  damages why don't we like mind control towers why don't we like police and black uniforms and
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:10.320]  secret arrest and torture what's wrong with us alan what i think there's something wrong with
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:16.320]  the uptake in our brains for these particular chemicals perhaps we leave somewhere else which
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:21.600]  actually does happen in some people's physiologies as the same with inoculations they found with
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:26.800]  the standard childhood inoculations the doctors are all trained to tell the mother don't worry
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:31.920]  to go home with a fever as based in the head well when you have an inflammation in the head
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:37.920]  even inflammation in the brain inflammation calls causes brain cells to die off so this is
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:44.080]  all supposedly normal and it don't worry we just brain damage your child and lower their IQ by three
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:48.800]  points and after 50 shots they're going to be retarded don't worry i've got power i wear a white
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:55.200]  lab coat oh i love my mistress so go ahead and then some people that there's also a few individuals
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:01.280]  where because these particular bio warfare chemicals will attach themselves to to uptake
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:06.080]  um i mean you ask it to go to the brain because you have different physiology sometimes it's
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:10.640]  really somewhere else into the intestine into other parts of the body they'll end up with
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:16.320]  various allergies it's a very complex movie serenity based on the on the team well i mean you may
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:21.760]  have seen it but for those that don't know they they go to this planet where everybody's died to
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:27.040]  find out and they discover the government was putting basically prozac into the air but they
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.080]  found that one percent of people it makes them psycho killers so that's the establishment kind
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:37.040]  of saying what we're doing is having some unintended consequences go ahead yes and it's the same when
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:42.400]  they inject you with various things not not everyone comes down with the fever that often
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:47.600]  those children will come down with asthma or internal problems for the rest of their life they
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:54.320]  admit that all crone's cases have the measles and other vaccine antibodies uh because oh the
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:40:00.560]  autoimmune attack didn't eat your brain it ate your guts oh yeah and so you often find people
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.680]  who have these these problems are a bit brighter they're more aware of what's going on because
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:11.440]  the brain was unaffected now they're going for everyone now with with pharma uh the calmatives
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:17.760]  as they call them openly and remember after 9 11 i think it was rumsfeld he was on television
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:24.000]  in the u.s it was broadcast on canadian tv and he was asked by a reporter what are you going to do
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.760]  if another major crisis breaks out it says people contingency plans it says we've aerosolized um
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:36.400]  valium and prozac it said we can spray over entire cities or whole areas and i thought well perfect
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.600]  because if the valium kicks in quick you see uh where's the prozac takes about a week to build up
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:47.520]  in the system and then takes over so they've already had these things discussed and ready to go for
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  who knows in many decades and now they've been spraying us so john p holter can come out and
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.320]  say yes we're spraying you yeah he can tell the associated press there can be video of it and
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:00.560]  people just go they're not spraying me well the white house science are just said they are no
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:07.360]  they're not yep no they're not there was a tv show in new york yesterday uh and the news hour
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:13.520]  just came out and and advise people who have children with asthma to move out of the east side
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:19.360]  for overnight if possible because of heavy metallic spring that's all we've said in this little clip
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:26.720]  oh no justification no follow-up or no wise that's all we've said well alan what's wrong with having
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:32.320]  aluminum dioxide sprayed on you i mean they're only helping you that's right and then the barrier
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:37.440]  mobile help build up and if it cancer early so you're not a burden on the coming health care system
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:44.320]  these are really loving people they're they're just so loving oh you know you have to go into
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:49.760]  the the characters behind all of this and who is that the copernican meeting for instance
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:54.400]  and the big eugenics that says they're the big utopian says they're uh dennis meadows is there
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.240]  he was one of the big boys of the club of rome in fact talk about that the head of the chinese
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:03.840]  delegation said we own your debt this is for those monday associated press and others uh and and
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:09.920]  we're going we want global government one child policies uh for americans and and our government
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:15.120]  suddenly announced yeah we're looking at this so i mean they're just go ahead alan and don't forget
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:21.040]  that they look at the panel appointed in the u.s a congress that there's there's um john holdren
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:27.840]  there who wrote the book eco science back in the 70s with another mean line communist and uh and they
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:34.640]  are communists by the way hardline communists and um they holding himself said uh he wants compulsory
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:42.560]  sterilization of the public he said we can't do the same way in america as we do in india with
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.720]  because people in america are better educated that might catch on so they'll have to do it
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:53.200]  surreptitiously covertly and particularly sterilize the people by other means and they discussed uh
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:58.320]  what the ideal population should be now these characters are all on board and you have your
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:03.600]  holdrens and every government of the western world right now that's not by chance they're all on
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:10.400]  board right now appointed and the whole agenda is now set to roll forth at an incredible pace
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:20.480]  remember two in communists uh families contaminate the unit uh families contaminate the children
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:26.080]  occurring to them so that better and Russell you agreed with this uh by passing on outmoded
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:32.480]  family values yeah you've got to have a state purely programming and now everywhere they under
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:38.720]  the environment police that most of the kid's curriculum is dossiers on mommy and daddy on
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:45.760]  record yes and uh they also said in the communist manifesto the family was an enemy because the
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:51.520]  state must be able to talk to you directly with no relatives around to stand up with you and because
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:56.400]  we've had a couple generations raised in europe and the u.s and canada on this yeah parents are in
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:02.960]  the news locally and going i'm glad my child is my boss and writes reports on me yeah and that was
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:07.920]  all part of the push for single moms by the way that people don't realize that they don't give a
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:14.080]  darn about mothers and women's rights they use them all for a different purpose to to to uh
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:20.320]  divide families and get them down until it's just you the unit like always 84 for that camera i can
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:24.960]  pull you off and say yeah you smith and there's nobody around to help you that's what government
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:30.720]  nature will say that we will never win until we can talk directly to each citizen with and there's
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:36.720]  no other citizens will stand up beside them that that's already here but you have to understand
[1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:43.600]  too another plank of the manifesto was the was the distribution of wealth and they could not bring
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:48.960]  it through under the skies because everyone knew really not so long ago what communism was but now
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:55.280]  it's for the earth you pay al gore and the and the polar bears live yes they brought it back under
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:45:01.600]  different guys much more clever and wrapped some scientific jargon and a lot of fakery over it and
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:06.880]  a lot of hype and terror and fear if you don't comply and they're bringing it out they they took
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:12.480]  back steam and they promised new technologies to free everyone well they really set up a scientific
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:16.880]  dictatorship that doesn't allow new technologies develop that's actually in the treaty actually
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:22.240]  the communists that was their favorite thing 80 years ago alan yes i'm gonna understand it never
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:27.520]  died it never died as the east commission showed it was to blend with the west by the time it would
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:34.000]  blend the west would already be degraded culturally and we have been degraded by thanks to hollywood
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:40.800]  and and television and again through the academia system because lens said too we must have an
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:45.920]  international academic authority and that was set up eventually the united nations so everything
[1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:52.160]  standardized to the point where the average person tuning in who's a new listener just thinks we're
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:56.480]  gibbering and jabbering i see people on youtube everywhere they watch these videos they go what
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.200]  are they talking about yeah and it's like we're weird because we know the names of government
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:06.400]  groups that's that's that's that's bad that's right and the bus being trained like brzezinski
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:11.840]  said that unless it's on mainstream media that they will not believe it at the same token if
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:16.480]  something is on mainstream media which is totally fictitious they will believe it
[1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:23.200]  like the fake flu pandemic but i was i was contacted recently by um a group under ted
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:30.320]  turner's group massive network system asking me if i come on and talk about global warming
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:35.680]  before the kopenhagen thing came up and the two producers of a man and a woman talked to me for
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:41.600]  quite some time and i caught on right away that they wanted someone who didn't know their facts
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:47.280]  they wanted someone who would just be anti this or anti that and i was dishing out names
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:53.360]  speeches comments made by the big boys themselves on creating the fake global warming crisis like
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:58.720]  the club of rom and the two founders that mentioned them i mentioned their book i said they came up
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:05.440]  with the idea and admitted in their book and i mentioned the fact after fact after fact for an
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:09.840]  hour then and i knew by the end of the hour these folks would not have me on because they did not
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:16.720]  want someone on who could present the fact they wanted somebody on to say i like global warming
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:22.880]  means i'll be able to surf more you would have been on tv that's right they wanted someone
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:29.120]  who would just go up there and be emotional and angry and so on but have no fact to back anything
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:35.600]  up that would discredit all the rest of them who had the fact they were never heard but the system
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:40.960]  is so discredited that even if that was the case i mean that's why the globalists are running out of
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:46.320]  steam their scientific dictatorship look at this wemberley school teaches students to be detectives
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.280]  and it says they come home and investigate their parents this is outside austin but this is done
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:57.920]  in austin too they come home and inspect their parents and write up detectives reports on on
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:06.560]  their parents carbon footprint this is going on nationwide oh the freedom yes and now in britain
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:13.040]  they're going after uh people who live in rural communities remember agenda 21 at the united nations
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:18.000]  they're all at all times together where the rule of folk be up to be crushed into the
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:24.560]  already overcrowded cities as this generation is to die off that's the key to it over the next 30
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:31.360]  40 years and if they're going after people's stove in britain if you heat by a particular oil
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:36.560]  type stove it heats the house and it eats uh and they're shutting off everybody's industry
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:41.920]  and this is all in their own statements to destroy your independence let's talk to john and main
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:47.280]  and then andy and david the next segment john you're on the air go ahead well hey alex how you do
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:55.360]  go ahead sir um yeah so i've been listening to you for about two weeks now and uh a lot of
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:49:00.160]  the stuff you've been saying has really been matching up with my experience after working on
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:08.000]  a wall street for about 10 years um i worked for a deutsche bank private bank and i was just involved
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.760]  basically in an enormous money laundering operation uh did you know it was a lot of the very same
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:20.720]  people who are calling for higher taxes have all their money in these offshore accounts
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:28.160]  uh with layer upon layer of legal protection so that people will never buy their money and it's
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:33.920]  all selectively enforced they only burn the little people who are offshore and steal their money for
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:41.440]  themselves yes uh it's private banks private bankers that now run the government and run the irs
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:47.600]  any more comments john no well the only other thing i wanted to say is that i was you know
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:54.880]  i was working down in the miami office and these banks are involved in huge drug uh money
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:50:01.280]  laundering operations as well that's all you should write a report about it but i mean
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:06.800]  uh they now admit on british television that our government grows the opium but says oh it's a good
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:12.000]  thing i mean there really is a coming out on the open now isn't there i think it was just
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:17.280]  yesterday uh there's an article in the canadian newspaper and in the u.s newspaper uh which
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:22.960]  they did after a survey investigation uh that uh the banks that were kept afloat during the
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:29.280]  supposed the next upland crisis obviously yeah the un said drug money kept us afloat drug money
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.120]  is good yeah that's right that's the came out there drug money did it and of course there
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  be no investigation as to as to who's responsible because they all know who's responsible but if
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:43.600]  you're caught with a matchbox of it you're going to a slave prison you're correct in fact someone
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:48.720]  in the state for me the other day and said they could not believe it they're 65 and they were asked

[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:35.040]  richest not the richest banking family on the planet he also belonged to the mosad later on
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:43.360]  and he um he sold out all of the plans of britain including the a bomb to the russians he gave it
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:49.840]  to them basically and he his personal belief and this is what's so important was his personal belief
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:56.800]  was that the right sort of people would eventually rule the world and these were the most intelligent
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:02.720]  once again on the darwin in principle would come down through two centuries accumulating getting to
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:08.320]  the top holding on to wealth for instance well they had the right to rule but he believed that money
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:15.920]  and he was a truthful character of banker he said money is only a a system of of controlling people
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:22.720]  and getting power for those in the top everyone works as carl mox said that my labor labor is the
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:29.040]  only real producer there is that's right the banks the banks don't need more tax money no it's a system
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:34.560]  of control control and he believes that money can be anything it already proven that after the
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:39.840]  britain woods agreement when he brought in fraction on this there of course speaking of that they are
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:44.960]  now announcing the arabs are fully going off the dollar it is the end of the dollar that's correct
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:50.560]  and they knew this back remember when you signed the the gas treaty the public were kept out of it
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:55.840]  that it was never explained to them by any media what the the general agreement on creating tariffs
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:01.680]  was it never told them that yes we would be the taxpayer would be funding for their own factories
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:06.960]  stick to uproot and go to china it ever said well the taxpayers will pay these corporations
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:12.560]  for 10 years and by the way you're not just saying that of the 50 billion gm bailout yeah more than
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:17.920]  half of it went to pay to move the factories to brazil china and eastern europe we literally
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:24.560]  yeah hey yeah and and the public were utterly ignorant even when suddenly everything started
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.520]  being made in china made in china it didn't be because they did most of the public are never
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:35.520]  conscious they love it they love paying to lose their job they love swat teams they love open borders
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:40.480]  they love their kids coming home and ordering them around they love drinking fluoride they love they
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:46.480]  love it they do and they love to play and either that's a problem and that's that is a big problem
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:52.080]  they are the the the middle people who will do nothing they'll go whichever way the winner goes
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:56.960]  that's how that's right that's why they do it they think the globalists are winning
[1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:00.640]  and so even now that it's proven we're going into a tyrannical world government they're going
[1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:07.040]  i like it i love my kids i'll be okay because i keep my head down that's that's their attitude
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.240]  yeah well it's like the guy in 1984 is bragging on his kid being a spy and when his kid denounces
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:16.640]  him he says i don't know what little guy denounced me i'm sure he was right i'm so proud of him

[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:14.240]  we'll be covering that coming up in the next hour we're also going to get into the fact that
[2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:20.880]  ron paul said here last friday that he believes the obama takeover of health care to make even
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:27.200]  more americans dependent on the government a quarter million dollar fines five years in prison if
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:35.040]  you don't get insurance he believes as it stands it will pass but by one vote so we better put pressure
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:41.200]  on lieberman and let him know that if he doesn't vote against this somehow the whole nation is
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:48.560]  going to target him to not be reelected but of the next 30 minutes we are joined by chuck norris
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:54.960]  he really doesn't need any introduction though i will give him one here today he's a martial arts
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:59.280]  expert probably the most famous martial arts person in the world joined the air force after
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:03.840]  high school during a service he went to south korea where he began his training in martial arts
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:09.360]  and time sudo he returned to los angeles in 62 and opened a karate school catering to such
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:14.560]  celebrities as steve mcqueen who later encouraged norris into his acting career and then it goes
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:21.920]  on to his top tv show on cbs walkard uh texas ranger bestselling author uh he's done so much for
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:27.440]  uh kids who've been in trouble teaching him discipline we're gonna he's the bestselling
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:32.640]  author and he's also fighting the tyranny so uh chuck norris good to have you back with us i

[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:53.840]  care has been most fired up right now because uh you know they're just going in the wrong
[2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:58.320]  direction and after we come back from the commercial i can kind of give you an idea of how well i
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:03.920]  think we should work on the health care issue absolutely so you're more concerned about health

[2:08:57.520 --> 2:09:02.880]  involved with the kickstart program and the different websites they can visit well kickstartkids.org
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:08.400]  is our organization where we teach the martial arts in the middle of inner city middle schools
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:14.880]  i started this 17 years ago alex and uh and currently we have 6500 kids in our program
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:21.040]  we have graduated over 60 000 kids over the last 17 years and most of these kids going on to college
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.200]  and becoming successful in their own right and they would tell you if they would ever talk to you
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:31.120]  that the kickstart program is what saved them from going to prison possibly being killed because uh
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:36.800]  it got them out of gangs see the thing is to be in our program you no longer have to you cannot
[2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:42.880]  be in gangs and uh you know most the kids uh uh are uh you know in fact we have a school in
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:49.520]  pflugerville right near you awesome you know where pflugerville is right there absolutely and uh
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:54.960]  anyway pflugerville called us and said uh we see how successful your program is and we would like
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:01.520]  to implement it as a community program in pflugerville so uh they the community got together
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:08.240]  opened up two schools in pflugerville paying for it themselves and it was so successful the first
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:12.720]  year that they opened up the uh three more schools so we have a total of five all five middle
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:16.480]  schools in pflugerville and that's kind of what we're where we're heading with our program is
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:22.240]  getting a community involved and and like i say we have kids i had one uh young mech uh his spanish
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:28.400]  boy got a full scholarship the mit you know a lot of our kids have graduated from high school
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:33.360]  about like victorians because once they start believing in themselves alex in the bend of the
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:37.520]  world's limit for them i think do anything they want to do and it's been proven with our program
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:43.120]  uh you know the marsh park is a great tool it turned my life around alex i was an insecure non-athletic
[2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:47.760]  kid when i got involved in the marsh larks when i went to korea and it just turned my whole life
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:52.640]  around it raised my self-esteem and it's still that discipline and respect that i was lacking at
[2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:58.400]  that time and so i know it does work and and like i say that's my goal and that's my wife gene and my
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:05.200]  wife passion is to uh implement uh kickstart all over the country one day well it's beautiful what
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:12.000]  you're doing and also uh you've got the official chuck norris fact book a new edition uh out on
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:18.560]  that a perfect stocking stuff available all over better bookstores everywhere and at amazon.com
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:24.400]  and and also uh i know a lot of the books and products you sell you end up giving a lot of
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:28.720]  the proceeds also to kickstart well i like proceeds from my anything i do outside my
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:33.280]  entertainment world go straight to our kickstart foundation you know funny about this back thing
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:39.600]  that started about four years ago some i started getting these uh uh backs on the um i'm email you
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:44.560]  know a few of them and i'm reading them they go hey i said these are funny you know but uh but

[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:58.400]  love the last one the black belt patriotism now now chuck moving quick here uh specifically
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:04.000]  government run health care they want us to be dependent medicare medicaid cuts 41 billion out
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.920]  of medicare alone but they're going to put more people in medicare uh and uh it looks like it's
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:15.120]  going to pass ron paul was on this friday he said unfortunately looks like looks like it's probably
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.720]  going to pass well let it pass and then believe me everyone that put their mark on that uh on
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:25.840]  that health care bill we've got to get them out of office next year you know that's going to be
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:30.560]  that's going to be my campaign you know i you know i write weekly articles for world aid daily
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:34.400]  and i'm going to be cameraing these guys i'm going to be going after age and every one of them
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:39.520]  that passed this health care bill just think about this alex you know let's let's fix what is
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:46.720]  broken okay 20 of the health care bill they'll have broken believe the 80 alone you know 80 of
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:52.480]  the people are happy with their health care you know i'm happy with mine so let's work on the 20
[2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:58.320]  percent that isn't working you know rather than tearing it down it reminds me like if you have
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:03.200]  a you know you have a flat on your car right but you but you decide to change all the tires
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:08.000]  and maybe put in a new motor whether you need it or not see i believe that's what the government's
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.720]  thinking here well worse than that they're going to take the motor out and fire machine gun bullets
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.840]  into it because it has a flat exactly you know and the thing is you know it's not going to work
[2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:22.720]  it's not going to work and there's going to be a lot of hurting people because of this and that's
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:28.000]  where my heart goes out my heart goes out to the people that uh you know that that that are going
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.640]  to be suffering from this we're also as you were saying to meet her in the break we're also bankrupt
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:38.480]  and it is in there to give the illegals health care i mean we can't take 20 30 million people
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:43.600]  and give them free health care i mean we're going bankrupt now absolutely you know and the thing is
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:50.320]  i think the biggest mistake government made is using all this stimulus money to uh show up a
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:56.560]  i g benny may fray max banks cars all this stuff here they should be using all that stimulus money
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:02.640]  to shore up small business so they you know so they can begin hiring back their employees you
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:07.840]  know our country as well survives on 80 percent of small business yes you know 80 percent of our
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:13.120]  company and so why in the world aren't isn't government you know of course obama's talking
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:18.240]  about it now a year later well i've got to help small business why didn't he start that you know
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:24.160]  months and months ago if he had well let me throw this out at you chuck norris sorry to interrupt
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:30.000]  we just have limited time well if ron paul runs for president in the next year and a half are are
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:35.120]  you going to support him are you thinking about supporting him uh i i love ron paul but i have
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:40.880]  to be honest with you i would like to have a younger uh president you know when you get in
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:46.880]  your 70s you know and i'm pushing 70 you know it's a it's a tough grind i would rather find someone
[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:53.280]  uh like ron paul who uh can relate our country and i'm really i feel a mike huckabee fan i really
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:58.320]  still believe that mike huckabee is the man to uh lead our country and then actually and that's
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:03.120]  kind of the general consensus of the people in america and i would love to have ron paul you
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:09.040]  know in a very prominent position in washington but but not what kind of position like treasury
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:13.760]  secretary yeah something like that something because he's not a span you know uh here's
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:20.640]  a one my favorite uh fact also is america's not a democracy it's a chuck tatership and
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:27.440]  and now if that were true alex i would go to washington i would line up every member of congress
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:33.600]  and i'd have uh i'd have ron paul who i think is the more most honest uh politician in congress
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:40.880]  i'd say ron point out the honest and the dishonest uh politician and we'd go down the aisle ron
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:47.760]  say he's honest he's honest uh this one's dishonest i'd walk up to that person that say you're fired
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:53.680]  and if you didn't move immediately i choke him unconscious and dragging chuck norris is our
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:59.680]  guest chuck shifting out of health care obviously i agree with you it's very unpopular in the polls
[2:18:59.680 --> 2:19:05.040]  it's unconstitutional the federal government's not supposed to be involved in health care uh and we
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:10.880]  need to have recalls of these people and we need to repeal it if they do pass it oh yeah absolutely
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:17.840]  that's you know the thing is it's going to be a a very uh trying three more years with the obama
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:23.040]  administration i can you know this is just a the tip of the iceberg with the health care this is
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:29.120]  just the beginning if they pass this then they're good it's going to embolden them to pass a lot
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:34.800]  of other very devastating bills such as cap and trade and a lot of the other things that's going to
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:43.360]  really negatively affect our country chuck norris since you brought that up uh i have the headline
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:49.280]  here epa threatens command and control economy to push climate change agenda and that was in
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:53.840]  associated press another headline was obama threatens command and control he's saying if the
[2:19:53.840 --> 2:19:58.960]  senate doesn't ratify copenhagen which openly establishes global government according to

[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:16.080]  that the industrial civilizations collapse isn't it our responsibility to bring that about he said
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:23.040]  that in 92 at the UN he said carbon taxes are to destroy the economy they want to bankrupt the
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:27.520]  economy and make us dependent on them and that's everything you're fighting against Chuck and
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:32.160]  that's what's so exciting that's what they want to do here they want to bankrupt our economy here
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:37.200]  in the United States and then come up with a universal coin a universal money international
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:43.840]  money and and take away the the dollar we have here in America and and everyone used the international
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:48.560]  currency and I you know and I see that just like North Korea you know North Korea just simple that
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:53.360]  it does you're changing the currency there well that's what's going to happen universally if we
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:59.440]  don't do something about it Chuck and the closing let me ask you this I've had a lot of national
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:03.840]  media here the last week and I play them clips of the head of the EU head of the UN calling for
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:09.520]  global government Al Gore I give them the treaty the Copenhagen treaty that states global government
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:15.440]  a 2% tax on everything which they're now promoting Pelosi and others are a you know all these other
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:22.160]  taxes and they they tell me it doesn't exist that's a mind game isn't it where they just it's all a
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:26.640]  mind game Alex it's all a mind game you know they said well we want to help the poor country
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:31.840]  we have poor people in our own country you know a lot of our kids are inner city kids
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.800]  you know that they they they won't have a Christmas this year because they have no money
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:44.080]  and the thing is why are we helping the poor in our own country and helping them be able to enjoy
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:49.280]  the luxuries of what we have in this country this is what irritates the economy is all the money
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:54.480]  we send overseas trying to help them out and they don't even appreciate it let's give it to the
[2:28:54.480 --> 2:29:00.560]  people in our own country I agree Chuck Norris but Alex but but Chuck it's worse the eugenicists the
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.520]  White House science are they say the carbon taxes are about starving the third world these carbon
[2:29:05.520 --> 2:29:11.520]  cuts in the treaty will will just kill millions of starvation a year conservatively yeah yeah
[2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:18.080]  well you know I just said I believe charity begins at home and and I you know and I just
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:24.640]  well I just hope the people see what is going on and uh and just not sit home and say well
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:29.040]  whatever happens what it will happen uh it's you know it's not it's not the way it should be you
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:35.040]  know and uh I'm I'm very concerned about it you know uh you know it's the most like uh if you do
[2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:41.680]  it I'll do it no you do it first and then I'll do it you know it's like nobody everybody want
[2:29:41.680 --> 2:29:46.560]  no one will step up unless there's someone else does but I really believe I really believe that
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:53.120]  we the uh United States have to start leading as this by example we're on the march the empires on

[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:07.280]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:12.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:17.520]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:22.640]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:28.080]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:33.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:37.920]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[2:30:37.920 --> 2:30:42.400]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:41.280]  of lives and it's so important all the great things Chuck Chuck Norris is doing okay Chuck finishing
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:47.520]  up with that point you got cut off Obama you talk about him wanting a dictatorship clearly
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:52.640]  they are setting one up clearly he's setting up a domestic police force he's called for
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:59.440]  or you talk about revolution how do we get the people to stand up and say no so it doesn't get
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:05.440]  to that point well the thing is right now leadership in our country is very scarce you know I think
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:13.440]  two leaders that I look up to is Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee you know and Mike Huckabee has a
[2:34:13.440 --> 2:34:19.520]  voice now and on Fox and and it's really showing because the polls are saying that he is by far
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:26.320]  the leading candidate for the republican ticket in 2012 I really think and you know being with
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:32.240]  my Mike Huckabee for five months campaigning for him I saw him as a man of integrity and honesty
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:38.640]  and really a very intelligent man and he uh you know he went on that tour he never had a teleprompter
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:44.960]  he never had no he never had anything he talked right from his heart Alex and that was very impressive
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:49.280]  I saw the media confronting him with that made up thing about that nut that the parole board
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:54.560]  said let out and he was just so slick talking yeah the thing is I mean if he explained that was
[2:34:54.560 --> 2:35:01.280]  10 years ago uh the kid was 16 years old and all he committed was burglary you know he didn't he
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:05.760]  didn't assault anyone he didn't kill anyone it was strictly a burglary well it does show the
[2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:10.160]  media is scared of Huckabee that's why they're scared of him they're scared of him and you know
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:15.120]  but the guy did fall between the cracks because those judges in Washington let him out after
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:21.040]  he'd committed those heinous crimes and that was where the the failure was within Washington
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:24.240]  well Chuck we're going to let you go because I know you've got a newspaper interview coming up
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:29.040]  but on the subject of Huckabee he has been coming out now and talking about the new world order
[2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:34.080]  he said it's a bad thing and I think it's becoming more acceptable now to tell the truth about the
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:39.680]  UN and the globalist in George Soros thanks to you and others speaking out but I have no doubt
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:43.840]  that we're going to defeat the new world order uh have a Chuck Norris on our side well we're
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:48.320]  going to survive three more years to Alex and then we're going to have my Huckabee as president
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:53.760]  and uh and Ron Paul as Secretary of the Treasury and that way we'll keep things honest in our country
[2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:59.040]  thank you so much Chuck Norris for joining us we'll talk to you next year okay buddy bye bye
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:05.200]  god bless okay there goes Chuck Norris take care sir well that was a fun interview with Chuck Norris
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:14.320]  uh what about a Huckabee Ron Paul ticket look a Huckabee's not perfect but compared to compared
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:22.240]  to George Bush and uh Barack Obama my gosh anything's good it's oh my gosh you know I'm just glad that
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:30.880]  Chuck Norris is uh is going around speaking out against the new world order he's going on national
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:37.360]  tv and when Sean Hannity said oh well Ron Paul's a cook Ron Paul's a nut he said well good I'm a
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:43.760]  nut too I like him you know he didn't betray him he didn't uh wasn't a doubting Thomas he didn't
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:50.080]  throw Ron Paul into the bus and uh Chuck Norris has come a long way waking up with the new world
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:57.440]  order just like Jesse Ventura has come a long way you know talking to Chuck Norris he talked about
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:37:04.480]  how over 10 years ago he heard my show and liked it in Texas and Chuck knows a lot more than he's
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:09.040]  letting on I'll tell you that so he's certainly coming along not just in his knowledge but what
[2:37:09.040 --> 2:37:19.600]  he's willing to talk about but he certainly does like Mike Huckabee so that was an interesting
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:24.080]  interview with him you know I was about to ask him about Glenn Beck who he goes on a show and is
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:34.240]  friendly with Glenn Beck calling for a value added tax Glenn Beck calling for a value added tax
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:38.880]  that's exactly what the Copenhagen global government treaty that will be paid directly
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:46.240]  to the IMF and World Bank we now have the treaty it's on record associated press London Guardian
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:53.360]  that IMF World Bank will run the treaty and so developing countries boycott UN climate talks
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:59.280]  because the UN is to lose its power the UN never had the power was always a front for banks it was
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:03.040]  a debating society to get all the third world countries together so they could be bought off
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:14.480]  and paid off guys will you pull up again the uh clip of Bill O'Reilly uh slash Glenn Beck
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:23.600]  Friday night this is Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck talking about how they want national sales
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:28.960]  taxes and value added taxes how over a decade I've told you because I read the official government
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:35.440]  plans it's a council on fine relations publications you're going to have a national sales tax that
[2:38:35.440 --> 2:38:41.920]  is graduated so it's fair some will be exempt but there's going to be fraud with people buying
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:46.480]  black market so you're going to have to thumb print and swipe a card to buy and sell that will
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.760]  also be your carbon tax credit I've told you that for more than a decade because I'm reading
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:39:00.640]  directly from the the CFR and ran corporation and others plans I haven't forgotten more than I know
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.840]  you know forgotten more than most people know it's that I've I read this ran corporation plan
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:10.400]  about federalizing all police and putting federal death squads on the streets
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:16.240]  and 10 years from now it will just be knowledge that I have and I'll have to reach back into my
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:22.400]  memory to even remember where I got it but they write about what's already been covertly set up here
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:30.640]  but the issue here is people ask why I don't like Glenn Beck because the establishment is keeping
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:36.480]  their friends close their enemies closer at key points Beck attacks Ron Paul at key points he says
[2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:43.040]  Ron Paul at key points he says there are no FEMA camps at key points he says the Mayak homeland
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:47.200]  security reports saying veterans and gun owners are terrorist might be reasonable at key points
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:55.440]  he gets your confidence and then he sabotages and when I saw Nancy Pelosi last week
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:03.040]  many see VAT option as cure for runaway deficits giving a close shot of this please
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:08.400]  this is the Gainesville Sun and you can look up all these other Republicans and Democrats
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:15.280]  saying oh yes the way to get us out of this deficit is more taxes no the average federal
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:20.480]  employees money's gone up the government tripled under Bush has more than tripled in the first
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:26.560]  year under Obama that's they want to destroy the economy as Chuck Norris just said I have
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:32.000]  their own documents I just read to you what Maury Strong said but here's Nancy Pelosi calling for
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.920]  it now in this seven-minute clip I don't have time to play the whole thing you can go watch it
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:41.440]  at info wars.com if you want and the article Curt Nemo wrote Beck O'Reilly called for more taxation
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:49.040]  they start talking about oh the liberals don't like you oh I'm proposing taxes oh I wonder why
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:54.640]  the liberals had you on ABC and it's all about the celebrity of Beck and how much these two ego
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:41:04.400]  maniacs on TV together and I just can't understand how they completely sell their souls out for
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:09.920]  money and power there's nothing wrong with money and power if you got it through Duke telling the
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:15.920]  truth doing the right thing and not being an evil person but it's not what you're supposed to worship
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:22.080]  and do anything for I mean Glenn Beck and O'Reilly with the words they use and the terms they use
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:27.920]  and about tightening our belts and discipline. Discipline is giving the government more taxes
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:34.080]  officially setting up a federal and value-added tax over everything federal inspectors in more
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:42.720]  of your lives two more IRS's and then I said last week I said watch you're gonna watch value-added
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:49.920]  and sales taxes proposed during a financial crisis in the next year and because I read it in the
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:56.880]  treaty which you read in a UN treaty is what happens Jack even if the Senate doesn't ratify it
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:02.480]  by fiat they will pass all the tax laws to get in line with it all the laws piecemeal
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:07.440]  to get like an erector set or Legos they will put it all together in pieces
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:16.240]  and what is in the treaty a value-added tax of 2% what did Lord Monk did tell you last week
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:22.880]  what did I read out of the treaty here on air here it is here's the treaty
[2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:32.480]  what does it have a 2% flat tax on our on all air travel a 30% tax on all coal a 2% value-added
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:38.800]  right off the top of the GDP it's all in the framework convention on climate change which
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:46.320]  is a convention like the continental convention like like like like like the constitution this is
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:50.960]  their global government total takeover they've built the platform they've got the rocket fueled
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:56.000]  they're launching the rocket they're launching the new world order right now the greatest time
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:43:01.520]  to ever be alive folks because these people are eugenicists they want to cut your resources off
[2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:05.680]  so they can socially engineer you and take your kids Chuck Norris has finally gotten it
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:10.000]  completely understands it's about taking your kids it's about the state ending the family
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:15.760]  folks the Illuminati during the French Revolution this is on record tried to go to a 10 day
[2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:22.240]  work week 10 days out of the week well what was like nine months out of the year they tried to
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:29.040]  abolish the family it failed China tried that these people are the same group ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:36.880]  it's real you better wake up they mean business you expect me to talk no mr bond I expect you to

[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:55.120]  to be a movie star everybody feels inadequate because they never became movie stars Madison
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:44:01.120]  Avenue first makes you feel weak and insecure that they can sell you with what will supposedly
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:06.560]  fulfill you when the truth is I've been in big movies with big movie stars the truth is I've
[2:44:06.560 --> 2:44:10.800]  hung out with people you wouldn't believe the truth is I've seen things you wouldn't believe
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:16.640]  the truth is because I took action against the new world order and most people are too timid to do
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:22.000]  it it's taken me to very high mountains I've been taken up to the mountain and offered great power
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:28.960]  by the system but because I was offered the great power I realized it was crap it meant nothing it
[2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:35.040]  means nothing money means something if your car isn't running and you can't feed your family
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:39.760]  it's very important up to that point once you're comfortable let me tell everybody out there
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:45.280]  the yuppies who think they need more more more that they'd be fulfilled if they had the newest
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:51.040]  iPod or if they had the newest car it means nothing what matters is that you're an honorable person
[2:44:51.040 --> 2:44:55.520]  and that you help other people and that you understand you're part of the species and part
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:45:02.560]  of a continuum and that there's evil that has to be faced that's what will fulfill you you're not
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:08.640]  fulfilled because you aren't tuned into reality your subconscious mind is hundreds of times more
[2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:15.840]  powerful than your conscious mind your subconscious mind knows everything that's going on everyone
[2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:22.080]  is a genius but they can't focus it through their conscious lens hundreds of times stronger
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:25.920]  you don't have access to that you haven't trained yourself to have access
[2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:31.360]  to discernment to understanding and so your subconscious mind is telling you I'm not happy
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:36.000]  I don't like this you may be in a five million dollar mansion you may have the hottest 25 year
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.960]  old trophy wife prancing in on her high hills shoes you're not happy you know why you're not happy
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:46.320]  why isn't tiger woods happy why aren't all these sports people and movie stars not happy
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:51.520]  because they're not truly serving humanity now the globalists know how to create counterfeits
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:56.640]  of serving for the carbon tax let's help the third world with all the well-meaning hippies
[2:45:56.640 --> 2:46:02.000]  when it's actually meant to kill the third world of course you hide killing the third world starving
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:08.720]  them out under siege by saying your that that that that's warfare the opposite of what it really is
[2:46:08.720 --> 2:46:14.240]  you're killing them you say you're saving them to get all the well-meaning people to serve them
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:22.480]  and that's the true essence of evil is getting good to serve you get sophisticated get serious
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:31.680]  I've said enough I'm ranting just listen I don't hate Glenn Beck when I assess him he looks like
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:40.160]  a completely mentally ill person he looks completely screwed up his eyes he looks completely weak
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:47.040]  completely powerless very effeminate but not that effeminate is bad no woman it's that male
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:47:00.640]  effeminate effeminate behavior he just wreaks disingenuousness and my god how can people not
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:10.880]  see this man as a complete fraud not just by his his his his reeking evil I mean he is like a horrible
[2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:19.440]  goblin that sits on the the the left knee of satan I mean he just comes off my god how can
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:26.800]  people not I mean send them a bill O'Reilly I mean just an absolutely evil swollen up worldly
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.160]  person how having discernment it's like radar beams I can just look right through them and I
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:40.080]  don't know how other people can't see this and yes I see how weak and bad I am don't worry
[2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:46.480]  but we're all weak and bad we're also all incredibly strong and wondrous it's that I can see
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:54.240]  in me what's bad and I'm ashamed of it these guys their greatest possession is their worldliness
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:48:01.600]  and here he is in a false they know the mind likes to have a choice so they give you a choice
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:06.080]  sales tax or value added then they talk about liberals persecuting them after so people sit
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:11.440]  there conservative feeling like they're part of a club with with O'Reilly and Beck I mean it's
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:16.960]  and they're like egomaniacs sparring with each other over oh you're stealing my stuff when it's
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:22.560]  on record that Beck takes what we do and then tries to mimic it only to fool the public that's
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:32.240]  waking up I mean it's just horrible here is Glenn Beck calling for taxes and so with us and Bill

[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:53.760]  before we get fascinating with me about me we'll get to that the moment and it's a travesty of a
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:59.520]  mockery of a sham as well it shows how much trouble right I mean this is a bit of a serious
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:03.360]  question last night I know you watch factor every night yes so you can steal material oh my god
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.920]  and I said that economically we can bring the country back but you have to do some discipline
[2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:15.360]  you have to free spending yep you have to have a national sales tax oh yeah pause what did you
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:23.200]  think about oh yeah they're gonna freeze spending and cows jump over the moon bush tripled in Obama
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:28.480]  more than quadrupled in the first eight months eight months in he spent more money than all
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:33.840]  presidents before him back to George Washington folks they've decided to bring the country down
[2:49:33.840 --> 2:49:40.880]  to rape it dry do you get that all that's going to be left to SWAT teams as a rear guard action
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:48.080]  do you understand that listen back it up a little people say I edited it here's he's asked oh I want
[2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:56.160]  a national sales tax and then and then Beck says oh oh no I want a value added tax we and I mean

[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:59.520]  are attacking them see let me tell you how you're conservative you raise taxes absolutely
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:04.080]  that's incredibly conservative glenn yeah we shouldn't cut the government that's doubling
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:10.880]  or more every year yeah no let's just raise taxes well of course they are that's their job
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:18.320]  is to be absurd glenn beck is meant to come off disingenuous and slimy to everyone out there to
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:24.080]  demonize the patriot movement again with patriots like glenn beck who needs malatang
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:28.560]  when libertarians like glenn beck who needs joseph stalin
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:33.840]  let's go ahead and go back to beck and o'reilly just two of the slimmiest
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:38.960]  fake pundits out there together here they are factor every night yes so you can steal material
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:45.520]  oh my god um and i said that economically we can bring the country back but you have to do
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:51.440]  some discipline you have to free spending yep you have to have a national sales tax oh what did
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:57.440]  you think about that um i actually i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:02.720]  i believe it should be a vat tax two percent vat value added no more no more than two percent
[2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:08.000]  what's the difference between a sales tax and a value a value add tax goes through or value added
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:13.280]  tax goes through absolutely everything so it hits two percent on every piece you make a car somebody's
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:19.440]  making the radio two percent somebody's making the so it hits the corporations it is all the way
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:23.120]  along the line would you remember there's an extraordinary amount of money we'll always pass
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:27.760]  it on to the folks which is why i like to sales tax better well hang on just a second but if you
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:33.760]  have a two percent vat um you can um pay things down awfully darn quickly that's what i want is a
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:40.960]  what i want is this is the part of the nose i want a two percent uh vat it goes directly to the
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:51.040]  deficit no more than ten years constant directly to the deficit just like two percent vat the
[2:56:51.040 --> 2:57:02.400]  copenhagen treaty calls for that goes directly to the deficit in fact here's the prisonplanet.com
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:10.800]  article from last friday before that was broadcast now eu wants global taxation
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:20.800]  global transaction tax to fund more bailouts what's in the treaty a global
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:30.320]  two percent tax a value added tax on the entire gdp you just watch
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:39.120]  that pass and that happened you just watched glenn beck openly in front of you propose what's in
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:44.800]  the treaty just magically just exactly what they're calling for you would never expect it and now you
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:51.520]  will fight for it because glenn beck the one you trust the one that'll talk about the new world

[3:07:01.200 --> 3:07:07.360]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[3:07:07.360 --> 3:07:12.480]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:18.640]  americans at home i have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:24.960]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:30.960]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent
[3:07:30.960 --> 3:07:35.840]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:40.560]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:46.320]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen
[3:07:46.960 --> 3:07:53.760]  a fall of the republic get your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're
[3:07:53.760 --> 3:08:01.760]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv from his central texas
[3:08:01.760 --> 3:08:08.320]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:15.760]  and the gcn radio network presser for a warner over a year ago wrote the book red hot lies
[3:08:15.760 --> 3:08:22.160]  how global warming alarmists use threats fraud and deception to keep you misinformed see this
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:28.640]  isn't new fraud the climate game it just confirms that it's conscious i mean here's an example
[3:08:28.640 --> 3:08:34.720]  they'll show you the last 50 years of warming and have the hockey stick only showing a small part
[3:08:34.720 --> 3:08:40.160]  of it to make it look like it's going up but when you pull back you find out it's hardly a rise
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:45.520]  compared to what's happened in previous centuries and they know this and and they know polar bears
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:50.000]  can swim and they lie about that because they look cute and cuddly and they could scare kids
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  saying that penguins can't swim and they've been caught a lot of other frauds so we have the expert
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:00.720]  who's been to six of these globalist global government global taxation meetings
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:06.400]  and he's christopher horner red hot lies how global warming alarmists use threats fraud
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:12.400]  and deception to keep you misinformed regnery 2008 uh and uh he also wrote the politically
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:17.680]  incorrect guide to global warming 2007 new york times bestseller so this is the kind of guy we
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:23.760]  like somebody who was devastatingly accurate even before the latest information came out
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.840]  so we're going to talk about the constitutional crisis we're going to talk about obama saying
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:34.400]  i don't care uh i'm going to ram this even if congress doesn't go with this treaty i'm going
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:43.360]  to have the epa order it i mean as if he's hitler joe stalin uh we now have the internal treaty
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:47.680]  that says the third world actually has to make double the cuts which will actually destroy their
[3:09:47.680 --> 3:09:52.560]  economy they suckered the third world into getting behind it believing they were going to get some
[3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:56.720]  goodies now they find out it's really about the imf and world bank further looting them so we'll
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:01.600]  get his take on that as well christopher horner let's talk about what's currently happening and
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:07.760]  where you see this process going and uh then let's talk about the fraud of these individuals
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:14.640]  well on the international stage alex it's going uh as expected they have kicked any treaty or
[3:10:14.640 --> 3:10:20.160]  something that might be a treaty into next year and copenhagen will result in an historic agreement
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:24.960]  to meet again in mexico city next year which is how these have all turned out year after year which
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:30.560]  is why i've stopped going and uh this actually was supposed to be a treaty producing conference
[3:10:30.560 --> 3:10:35.440]  but months ago we realized it was not going to be so where it leaves us is we'll get a promise of
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:39.920]  billions we don't know how much the demand is over a hundred billion dollars a year just from us
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:43.920]  and the offer on the table is something under 10 billion a year from us which is 10 to many they're
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:51.840]  even talking about three to upgrade the infrastructures of countries to better compete with us as we
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:56.960]  fund that upgrade through forcing our energy users to buy ration coupons or what they're calling
[3:10:56.960 --> 3:11:03.440]  allowances to use fossil fuels hydrocarbon energy here for the shackling our economy but it's
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:07.600]  proceeding the wrong direction but at least it's going slowly let me tell you what mexico city is
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:12.160]  now the copenhagen discussion that we had all this build up for is now being kicked into next
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:17.760]  december november in mexico city november 8th is when it begins imagine the build up for this
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:23.360]  conference next year when our elections are on november 2nd next year which means every senate
[3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:28.480]  race has to have both candidates answer the question will you vote to ratify kioto 2 every
[3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:33.360]  single race has to confront that question every single house race must have both candidates
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:38.640]  confront the question would you vote up or down tell epa they can't do this on their own so we've
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:43.840]  got the international track it's being delayed we've got the domestic cap and trade that's being
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:49.120]  delayed that's good the more sunshine that gets on this stuff and disinfects it the more people
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:53.200]  see it the more outbreaks they get well chris let's not just glaze over the bombshell because i
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:57.680]  should have at you are one of the leading experts not just on the fraud of man-made global warming
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:01.920]  or change as they call it when we've had climate change for four billion years you're one of the
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:08.240]  leading experts on the politics of this as well so so i mean you've been fighting this for decades
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:17.360]  specifically you just said that that that copenhagen is derailed yeah what i'm saying is you're going
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.320]  to see a lot of press releases you do every december um it's going to be a historic agreement to
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:26.640]  meet again next year that's what every year has produced every conference and as i said i went
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:30.320]  to a bunch of them they became very tiresome they have my picture up on the wall as a climate
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:34.080]  criminal get the hippies following me around with cameras and everything else stealing my trash it
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:38.560]  really isn't worth going for them to emerge at the last hour with tears in their eyes waving
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:43.120]  around a piece of paper declaring green peace in our time and it's just a piece of paper admitting
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:48.000]  that they will do nothing more than agree to agree next year now that's a big deal because it makes
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:54.640]  it 2010 the year of Kyoto to yes 2010 the year of capitrate there's no reason except republicans
[3:12:54.640 --> 3:12:59.680]  are very skittish about these issues for which is you know their fault not that's not my burden
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:04.720]  uh that this should not be a campaign issue for everybody and that includes those republicans
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.000]  who voted for this eight of them two of them seeking higher office by the way uh as well as
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:16.880]  yeah let's list them let's list who's we got graham doing it we have out of office uh the the globalist
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:22.400]  newt ganrich who are the republicans supporting this treason well there was this guy mike castlin
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:26.800]  delaware who's now running for the senate seat then we've gotten you can see a great
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:31.120]  town hall meeting where he gets his head handed to him by bunch of delawarians who do not blue
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:34.880]  hands i guess what you call them i don't know what their name is uh who did not care for this i mean
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:38.800]  it was a wonderful moment to look in his eye he's had the easiest job in the world until they started
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:43.520]  paying attention and he voted for one too many tax increases this being the biggest tax increase
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:48.960]  capitrate in american history then you've got this guy mark kerr who's running for the senate to
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:54.480]  replace uh this roland burris barack obama's old seat uh he's republican from the north shore who
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:59.040]  said well i voted in favor of capitrate because it it satisfies the narrow parochial interests of
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:05.040]  my wealthy district but i would vote to represent the whole state of illinois well i can't respect
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:10.080]  that kind of dance that's just insulting and you know i don't know why that's any better than a
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:14.320]  liberal who's going to vote that way anyway so is he apparently uh there were six other republicans
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:19.760]  there's a guy lennard lance in new jersey who put on his website excuse me some people put
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:25.680]  up on their website his constituent mail in which he boasts oh hey hey don't worry this is actually
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:30.720]  a wealth transfer from most of the rest of the country to the coastal elite he said it moves
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:36.640]  money from ohio and then in pennsylvania and missouri out to new jersey in california it does
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.000]  yeah so we've got people who frankly you know i won't miss them and well they're pirates but there's
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.560]  also uh some other people in the republican leadership supporting it well lindsay graham is
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:51.360]  the only well okay here's our problem in the republican senate lindsay graham is according to
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:56.080]  people in south carolina vying to be the secretary of defense because robert case is on his way out
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:15:00.480]  and to do so he's ingratiating stuff with the obama administration by pushing cap and trade
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:06.160]  as a bit of a proxy for john mccain who even this time is not supporting it i say yet but at least
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:11.520]  he's not supporting it so graham's working with uh john carrey and joe leverman to find uh
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:17.280]  try partisanship on this but graham brings no one with him and he's considering himself
[3:15:17.280 --> 3:15:22.080]  not even running for reelection as i understand it could be wrong the guy i'm more upset about
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:27.200]  is jud greg has done nothing publicly but quietly from senate sources i understand he is making
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:32.160]  noises about wanting bipartisanship uber alice it's really it's more important that we find
[3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:36.320]  bipartisanship than what really is in the bill you know we're seeing that the country is plunging
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:42.480]  into a double-dip recession into possible depression and we've got a globalist world
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:48.720]  government agreement according to ban kai moon and herman von rum poohy the head of the e u
[3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:56.000]  it openly gives two percent taxes on gdp taxes to foreign banks imf world bank to run it a global
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:02.880]  u n authority over air travel this will annihilate our economy and we've got senators who are for it
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:08.080]  because it's a new tax yeah we've got people who really they've been there too long jud greg
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:12.640]  retiring and he's generally a decent as far as these things go member of the senate but um
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:18.160]  he thinks that bipartisanship before he leaves is very important i just agree this is the biggest
[3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:22.320]  tax increase in american history the president said that the purpose of it was to cause your
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:27.920]  energy prices to quote necessarily skyrocket but not a side effect they're working on it's the point
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:33.280]  he's admitted this he said what about morris strong's quote in 1992 about it's our job to
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:39.040]  destroy the industrial society morris strong you know he that was his fantasy of a novel character
[3:16:39.040 --> 3:16:43.120]  but that's actually how he feels i've testified next to him in the senate foreign relations committee
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:47.360]  and you never know that i mean he's this very unassuming looking man who holds these terrible
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:52.640]  anti-population anti-growth anti-development views that are pervasive among the people pushing
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:57.760]  this energy rationing isn't this really all about eugenics at the bottom line a bunch of control
[3:16:57.760 --> 3:17:02.320]  freaks want to be able to decide literally what you eat and what you do and how many kids you have
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:09.600]  all about no but i will say this the population zealots the pro-state the pro-tax the anti-growth
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:13.840]  the anti-development anti-property rights the persistent communists the fallen communists
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:18.000]  they're all on this so i can't say it's all about that the global governance type love it
[3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:22.480]  they're all there's a bunch of rent takers g e duke energy excellent they're all looking
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:27.200]  to pick your pockets in the name of no no i understand there's a giant ship of pirates but
[3:17:27.200 --> 3:17:32.880]  at its core for my research the rationale of the big elite supporting it is we got to cut
[3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:37.920]  off people's energy i mean look at the communist chinese last week saying we'll sign on to this
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:45.360]  if you have a global one-child policy right in fact trying to even i think it was a year no
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:49.920]  two years ago at Bangkok at one of these negotiations said that they wanted to sell us
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:53.760]  carbon offsets i have this in red hot lives by the way no one else has covered this except
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:58.480]  one public source where i found it the chinese proposed getting carbon offsets recognized under
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:04.080]  Kyoto to sell Europe and us derived from their coercive family planning policies what they said
[3:18:04.080 --> 3:18:09.760]  Alex was our emissions are now at x and they would be at you know 1.9 x if we didn't have our
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:14.640]  policies in place therefore these are emission reduction they're not their emissions avoided by
[3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:22.400]  rather cruel totalitarian policies but they wanted carbon offsets and the un this this group
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:27.760]  that run Kyoto the UNFCCC and the european stuff that was a wonderful idea because that's really
[3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:32.160]  what a lot of people are in this for encouragement of course there's no doubt but there's not a
[3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:36.480]  universal motivator remember enron got this thing going i know this because i worked for enron at
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:41.120]  the time in 97 they told me it was my number one priority to get a global warming treaty
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:45.120]  internationally exempt indian china because they were building coal-fired power plants there oh is
[3:18:45.120 --> 3:18:49.360]  that how you woke up christopher that's how i got into this yes i was innocently practicing law and
[3:18:49.360 --> 3:18:54.000]  and they told me that i was director of federal government relations for enron for about three
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:57.680]  weeks and they told me to do this and i told them to do something else tonight we parted ways
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:03.520]  but uh yeah that was my eye opening experience i wasn't aware that these things actually went
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:07.840]  on believe it or not well you're an amazing guest i'm really impressed i mean when we get back i want
[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:13.920]  to talk about red hot lies and how you pegged them as how how the alarm issues threats fraud and
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:18.640]  deception to keep you misinformed i mean you knew a year and a half ago when you were writing this
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:23.760]  has been out for a year that this is a group who knowingly are engaged in fraud so let's look at
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:29.040]  the scientists themselves then you talk about g e and big banks and big corporations wanting it to
[3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:34.640]  pick pockets you talk about the un wanting it you talk about the uh no growthers the eugenicists
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:39.600]  wanting it but but who are these scientists that i mean uh last week we got a un document
[3:19:40.640 --> 3:19:45.920]  from years ago where they were directing the scientist to to unify the fraud along collectivism
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:50.720]  um amazing to have christopher horner uh on with us i didn't read through his whole bio
[3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:56.240]  it's uh quite uh amazing and uh we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break we'll

[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:32.800]  head meeting with the rockefellers and an inside baseball al gore story then i want to get into
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:38.880]  the premeditated fraud of these people and and and what their agenda really is christopher continue
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:43.760]  oh well i was discussing somebody who remained nameless who used to be with an oil company who's
[3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:48.080]  now pushing the global warming agenda a very nice guy debated him on several occasions but
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:51.920]  very wrong on the issues and i don't understand where he's coming from but
[3:24:52.640 --> 3:24:55.760]  anyway he told me he met with one of the deep pockets for this and you mentioned them
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:25:03.040]  funding the alarmist activities and that they said you know gore's killing us and we gotta get
[3:25:03.040 --> 3:25:07.360]  around him and i told him how do you get around the guy who's bragging he got 300 million dollars
[3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:12.000]  from someone to rebrand global warming into climate crisis and this guy said to me back
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:15.520]  oh don't worry william riley's group has a billion the rockefellers have at least 500
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:19.440]  million or something like that uh it's not course money he's just he's the guy to get
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:24.000]  some of the attention and he's killing the movement i said well you know my heart bleeds for you
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:32.240]  that's too bad couldn't happen to a to a nicer bunch of folks he really does radiate a type of
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:37.520]  demonic knelliness i don't know how to describe it but everyone i know just cringes when they
[3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:45.040]  seem on television just the arrogant uh almost a lizard-like look on his face it's not he really
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:53.040]  here's the thing um he scripted tries to navigate the waters of dishonesty by with word choice and
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:25:58.160]  things like this uh he's clearly read the uk high court opinion which threw out every claim and then
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:04.000]  when he's unscripted on the rare rare moment he's challenged he will just tell whoppers he did on
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:07.840]  ms mbc the other day you know like when he's unscripted he says things like yours course
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:14.720]  millions of degrees and so on but um he just uh i think he's uh he's a wonderful face for
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:19.760]  their movement i can't think of i really thought he was the gift keeps on giving keep him out there
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:24.240]  whoever gave him 300 million dollars and i don't know if you saw the 60 minutes piece but he's
[3:26:24.240 --> 3:26:28.400]  there and steve croft actually asked him when gore was bragging about this 300 million dollars he
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:31.440]  got and remember how of course says where you get your money dictate your motivations in your
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:36.240]  opinion and if you got a bunch of money from anybody you sold out so i just want to know
[3:26:36.240 --> 3:26:41.600]  since he's set the rules so steve croft on 60 minutes actually asked him where'd you get it
[3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:48.640]  and gore freezes and he freezes and croft just waits for an answer and his wife takes alzarm into
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:55.520]  the aisle handle this steve we donated our uh Nobel prize money and matched it and croft accepted
[3:26:55.520 --> 3:27:01.440]  that moved on without realizing that left him 298.6 million dollars short of 300 million
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:07.280]  and gore told us who sees this as such a profitable investment to give you that kind of money we know
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:13.600]  it's soros and we know it uh the guy's a client of perkins his investment captain his venture
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:18.000]  capital partners who think their money and these white elephants that's right he'll give the chicken
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:25.280]  feed 500 thousand dollar prize or a million bucks from a book but he's keeping the blood and gore
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:30.720]  consortium he's going to make the money he's keeping his stock in occidental petroleum he's
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:37.840]  he's keeping all the profits from the system he's setting up that he and people like the president
[3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:44.960]  roc obama own stakes in i mean it's just a unbelievable fraud well the thing is he gets
[3:27:44.960 --> 3:27:49.120]  the way by saying uh you know i didn't know you were against capitalism and to believe that i'm
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:54.720]  doing this for money you don't know me but it's true he could be a a true believer except like
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:27:59.680]  i say occasionally he speaks in such careful language that he knows what he says is is untrue
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.640]  well why does he have a 20 room mansion if he really believes carbon dioxide is a nerve gas
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:10.240]  that is used to you know kill enemy troops i mean if he really believes what plants breathe
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.200]  is like the most deadly vx nerve gas on earth why does he have a building emitting so much nerve
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:21.040]  gas that's actually not just positive to my mind there are people like him who who may not i mean
[3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:26.000]  either i understand either alec he doesn't believe a word he says which is possible or he believes
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:29.600]  there are different rules for different people and he's special and i get the feeling he's one of
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:34.640]  those but he's got four of these joints okay and he lives the way that he cannot he cannot possibly
[3:28:34.640 --> 3:28:39.760]  believe that buying a carbon offset credit from planting trees which is an accounting gimmick
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:45.840]  giving you 80 years of life if the tree lives that long uh and never dies by the way and releases
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:49.600]  the CO2 back in the atmosphere in one year he doesn't he can't possibly believe these phony
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:55.200]  schemes offset his contribution so i'm torn it seems to be difficult to believe that this is
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:29:02.160]  anything more than sort of uh baby boomer narcissism and new age mysticism he can't well we have what
[3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:07.840]  about ted ternary has five kids more houses than anybody else in america i read in people magazine
[3:29:07.840 --> 3:29:13.920]  literally something like 50 something houses 20 something jets yachts everywhere but he says i should
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:19.520]  only be able to have one child these guys know their frauds they just cold bloodedly won our
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:26.240]  resources and they know we're well meaning and may be con and say okay i guess rape me take everything
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:31.360]  i got if it's for the earth ted ternary's right that's right you little slave now give me everything

[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:06.800]  okay christopher continuing one segment left with you i definitely want to have you back up soon
[3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:12.400]  very impressive discussions you also talk about the harassment you've gone through with greenpeace
[3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:17.600]  and other eugenicists but before we go there let's go over their lies their scientific fraud the
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:24.080]  premeditated fact these aren't tree-hugging idiots who are just making mistakes they know what they're
[3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:29.440]  doing you know i thought this climate gate well is that you can tell by the effort being expended
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:34.480]  to diminish its importance this is more than a thousand emails but it's not just the email they
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:38.960]  have computer code annotations to the code and documents the pointy heads are still going through
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:43.360]  to figure out what's in there they were not hackers stolen as far as we can tell they were
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:47.760]  leaked by an apparel whistleblower they were not personal emails all of these things i mean you're
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:51.920]  telling you to distract you aren't true because this is devastating what it does is it affirms
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:57.680]  in the principles own words what i wrote in this stupid science tricks chapter of red hot lies i
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:01.520]  named these guys by name and i described what they were doing there are more and there are more
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:06.160]  people involved here it's a fairly broad movement but this is at the upper echelon of the highest
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:11.520]  compensated levels of climate science on which we spend billions every year by the way so you
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:16.480]  know it's settled science right and uh they're admitting what they've been doing they've been
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:21.200]  grafting not just apples nor just together but in showing uh in reconstructing temperatures and
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:25.840]  waving it around and publishing it in the referee literature they're grafting apples and stethoscopes
[3:35:25.840 --> 3:35:31.040]  they're taking tree rings and they're saying this is a proxy for climate it's a pretty good proxy
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:35.440]  for precipitation but they're using it as a thermometer okay and then they put on thermometer
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:39.760]  measurements because the tree rings show a cooling well the thermometer measurements which as i show
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:45.280]  in red hot lies are increasingly taken over barbeque grills in hot and spoken tucky uh phoenix
[3:35:45.280 --> 3:35:50.480]  sky harbour airport runway when a two sound parking lot when he used to be out in the field i mean
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:57.120]  they're playing games with uh with the data as well out of nasa which is why we've got a notice
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:02.640]  of intent to sue them by the way and they're grafting a onto b in order to present the picture
[3:36:02.640 --> 3:36:07.520]  that they admit in their emails they need to be true they want to be true has to be true some of
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:12.320]  them say we know it's true even though we can't see it and these are science these are the lead
[3:36:12.320 --> 3:36:18.880]  this was an ipcc un intergovernmental panel on climate change lead author this guy named kevin
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:23.840]  trendworth said in two of the emails it's a travesty that he can't find the global warming
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:29.200]  that he knows is there because his heart tells him so his computer models tell him so but our
[3:36:29.200 --> 3:36:32.880]  lie and eyes don't tell him so and that's a travesty he says we need to go out and get better
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:38.320]  measurements we have caught them for example this summer our national oceanic and atmospheric
[3:36:38.320 --> 3:36:45.040]  administration which presently is in copenhagen right now with a big reception room with moving
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:51.040]  visuals i read about melting glaciers and so on you're paying for this this summer in order to
[3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:56.560]  make its claims of temperatures going up up up just slowly backed out of their calculations
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:02.080]  they dropped the satellite measures measurements of the ocean temperatures why well the oceans are
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:06.400]  cooling the computer models also the oceans are warming the oceans cover two-thirds of the earth's
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:12.480]  surface if you include ocean cooling they've got a problem so what did they do they said we know it's
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:17.280]  warming so there must be a bias that the satellite temperatures must be wrong there's something wrong
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:21.120]  with our observations who you're going to believe my computer model or your lie and eyes and so on
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:25.520]  and so on and so on and i detail these tricks and red hot lies the principles have now detailed
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:30.240]  them in their own words and these emails computer codes and so on talking about tricks to hide the
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:36.480]  decline in temperature putting in a all capital that says insert very artificial decline here
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:40.640]  all sorts of other claims in which they're admitting they know exactly what they're doing
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:45.920]  they use the words fudge and so on fudge factors for their data to get the desired results and now
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:52.960]  the control corporate media is teaching us hide the decline fudge that doesn't mean what you think
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:59.280]  anymore that means save the polar bears right the most embarrassing exercise was when the
[3:37:59.280 --> 3:38:04.000]  media spent about eight days telling us the trick was really a scientific colloquialism and it means
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  different things to people yes and i said that's great what about the word hide or the decline but
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  they didn't focus on that they said well trick doesn't mean trick uh the reasonable meanings and the
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:17.920]  plain meanings aren't reasonable only the unreasonable extrapolations are what they really meant
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:21.840]  and they're saying it was in the heat and you've also got statements like this is just horrible
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:27.120]  we can't account for the decline in temperatures how do we hide it i mean it's so clear and then
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:32.560]  they're persecuting other scientists and working with government colluding oh after i explained it
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:36.880]  to the government they're not going to release it now they know what type of people these are
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:42.000]  and and one of the heads of the un propaganda got questioned by a filmmaker for uh friday in
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:48.720]  copenhagen it's up on info wars dot com we'll play the video later folks and it's a press conference
[3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:53.920]  he gets up to ask the question and the guy says oh i don't talk about things that come from people
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:59.440]  that are this immoral now this comes from immoral people and these are private emails and he has
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:04.400]  armed armed guard come in and start grabbing them and dragging them out i mean these people are
[3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:10.000]  authoritarian very authoritarian let me tell you something uh i've got a chapter read i lied to talk
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:15.520]  at quote these people all over the place openly wistful about oh if we only have an enlightened
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:21.680]  totalitarian system like china we could get this agenda in place and that argument is now out in
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:25.440]  the open i believe it's tom freedman at the new york times has been recently making it
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:31.040]  oh if only we had that system we need to suspend certain liberties just just certain liberties and
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:35.760]  just for a little while because democracy they say is getting in the way and people who
[3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:39.440]  are we have we have been unable to convince them to do what's in their own self-interest
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:44.000]  we're going to have to make it happen somehow and i quote them throughout that chapter they really
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:48.960]  are getting unabashed about this because no one's calling them on it instead as you pointed out
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:55.280]  the media are covering for them i mean thrown in full out advocates participants in the global
[3:39:55.280 --> 3:40:00.240]  warming industry they've always been sensationalist but this goes far beyond that i detail that in
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:05.280]  in fact the opening chapter so what none of what's come out recently are revelations they're all
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:11.360]  affirmations by the way there was not one personal email that we can find so far yet they assign that
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:17.280]  to everything they say this it all shows science as it should be and yet it's just it's terrible
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:24.720]  that these things got out and so on but the good news is christopher horner the public isn't buying
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:30.160]  the associated press and seeing in telling us nothing to see here move along i mean do you
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:37.120]  agree that this is devastating because all the fraud and all the expos days were building
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:42.720]  and through the grassroots the people were learning and people were seeing fortune 500 get behind it
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:49.040]  and and and really a backlash was already there and then now you're going to tax what plants breathe
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:54.800]  and and al gore making all this money i mean is this not devastating them i i truly believe it
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:40:59.040]  isn't again their reaction tells quite a lot and they the length to which the media are going to
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:05.760]  stop their agenda from taking water is instructive now uh what are we going to see well the president
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:11.760]  is talking about uh he's in fact the guardian has reported this i wrote a an article in the march
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:16.560]  issue of what's called engage which is the federal society's publication detailing how
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:22.960]  what's called a congressional executive agreement which we have plenty of for example nafta is a
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:28.800]  treaty that we decided was the treaty and therefore you waive the constitution's article two section
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:33.920]  two requirement of two-thirds ratification two-thirds ratification will never happen for this so what
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:38.720]  the president according to the guardian now the old red herself the guardian has reported that the
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:43.680]  administration is briefing european diplomat as i've also written to prepare them for the prospect
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:49.600]  that we must have we need to write this in a way that it's got to be plausibly declared not a treaty
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:55.360]  because then they can say all it takes is 50 plus one in both houses and no amendment up or down no
[3:41:55.360 --> 3:41:59.680]  filibuster vote under what they call fast track now there's precedent for this in the trade context
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:06.080]  but not enough in a global energy rationing selective punitive wealth transfer scheme so and then on
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:11.760]  top of it he's saying if you don't ratify it i'm still going to implement it yeah that we've got
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:16.080]  the epa flying now that doesn't satisfy the wealth transfer but and it doesn't bind us
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:20.240]  internationally however it will you still can't possibly get to bury that in these enormous
[3:42:20.240 --> 3:42:27.600]  spending bills now late lately more dead on our fun my kids and theirs and uh epa is threatening
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:32.160]  to do this here's what i just so you know nobody wants to take ownership of this hot potato
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:36.640]  they were furious the bush wouldn't start this rulemaking after we lost that supreme court case
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:41.600]  that he kicked it into this administration now recently epa declared co2 is a is a
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:46.160]  dangerous human health environment to which i first say try living without it but now they're
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:49.680]  going to say well well issue this finding and it's being published tomorrow in the federal
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:56.160]  register and then they're going to try something unlawful which is to say do sort of a half arse
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:01.040]  maneuver with it so that the green groups then march into court and they and the courts get
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:05.760]  it assigned responsibility for this in other words they won't go all the way in implementing it
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:11.200]  but they know that the green groups under the clean air act can make them so it's not really
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:16.000]  plausible deniability but that's their route alex they don't want they sure sure i mean it's criminal
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:22.240]  it's by stealth it's it's creeping like a spider creeping up your bed at night to bite you uh
[3:43:23.040 --> 3:43:27.360]  look at swardson agar he couldn't get the legislature to put a tax on tv's or banned big
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:32.960]  ones so he just did it under the california energy agency uh look at what's happening in
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:39.200]  washington state where employers tax you now off how you drive and they have to collect the money
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:44.720]  i mean they're already implementing this everywhere we know under unesco their brainwashing kids in
[3:43:44.720 --> 3:43:52.320]  public school i mean this is a criminal cult of of of pirates how do we ever extricate ourselves
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:57.680]  from them how do we ever remove them hopefully some type of criminal charges uh against these
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:44:03.120]  different scientists engage in fraud i mean is there anything we can do to this to this this
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:08.880]  this gang of of boobies well cei competitive enterprise institute that i'm associated with
[3:44:08.880 --> 3:44:13.440]  has petitioned dpa to reopen their record on the basis of the scandal that's been exposed or i
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:18.320]  say affirmed there are people looking into what are called t tam issues where you since they sue
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:22.560]  on behalf of the king and recover the king's treasure because again there's an apparent
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:27.680]  there's an intent to the fraud on the face of these emails and in the annotated computer code
[3:44:28.320 --> 3:44:34.080]  people are looking at rico actions against these individuals because fraud could trigger that and
[3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:40.960]  so on so whether i know that i don't know there there are attempts to whitewash at the various
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:46.160]  universities involved right now i've got a uh notice of intent to sue nasa by the end of the
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:50.080]  year it'll be january before i get around to it if they don't cough up their equivalent of this
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:54.080]  data in these emails because i've been denied for more than two years and i finally had enough
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:58.480]  when this thing broke and so we're going to have to use the courts just like they do now if we get
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:03.520]  involved in this treaty it has a provision that has a three-year cooling off period for getting out
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:09.840]  which is three years to generate all sorts of you saw what they did the u.s under bush uh three
[3:45:09.840 --> 3:45:14.720]  years of generating intense diplomatic and political pressure against america to stay in
[3:45:14.720 --> 3:45:19.440]  an energetic energy resting and wealth transfer scheme so you can't get into this mess now let me
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:23.840]  tell you something there's a three-legged stool they're pushing it's the kiosk team which on its
[3:45:23.840 --> 3:45:28.400]  face was not binding but our courts might just implement it but with the law of the c treaty
[3:45:28.400 --> 3:45:34.880]  which has a tribunal which we will have to implement uh their rulings here um and we are
[3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:39.840]  supposedly going to ratify an obama's first term in office in fact next year and then the
[3:45:39.840 --> 3:45:44.640]  international criminal court which we're told we're going to resign the roam statue the treaty
[3:45:44.640 --> 3:45:49.520]  creating the international criminal court well you get those three as he planned and you've got a real
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:55.840]  real i mean a serious problem you've got a very difficult problem to manage as a matter of law
[3:45:55.840 --> 3:46:00.720]  because our courts are increasingly radicalized as you know but increasingly international
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:05.600]  and the swing vote on this issue quite clearly is just as kennedy and he's on record saying we need
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:10.800]  to find out what those nice europeans think our constitution says before we uh implemented ourselves
[3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.360]  so we've got a problem you don't get involved in the treaties but america is being swallowed by
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:21.760]  an unelected private offshore corporate government the new world order well let's just say there are
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:26.240]  people who have us in their sight and they see us coming let me tell you something you think obama
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:30.320]  politically can afford to walk away from copenhagen without some piece of paper in hand even though
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:34.000]  it's going to be a transfer of wealth from here to there politically knowing how politics works
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:39.040]  and his base in the media no so indian china and the rest of the world see him coming they know when
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:43.040]  he goes over there on friday he has to give them whatever they want because he cannot leave empty
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:48.960]  handed from copenhagen in an embarrassment twice in one year in his first year in office so they see
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:55.440]  him coming we have an we have an amateur but an amateur with all the wrong instincts and a very
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:47:02.880]  dangerous agenda and therefore uh let me just say this um we we're going to be as active as we possibly
[3:47:02.880 --> 3:47:08.000]  can be through the courts here through cpi with whatever our resources will allow and i'm hoping
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:12.800]  some private entities will stand up for once and stop trying to cut a deal and fight back and that's
[3:47:12.800 --> 3:47:16.960]  another big point you made all these big corporations if they're not behind the swindling
[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:21.920]  they've said okay i'll join you just don't don't rape me and that's what the epa said last week as
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:27.680]  you know they said look all you big corporations get in line or we're going to selectively enforce
[3:47:27.680 --> 3:47:32.800]  i mean they're literally like a mobster beaten up the little grocery store owner when are we going
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:38.800]  to grow a backbone to these parasites and say no it's even worse than window insurance what they
[3:47:38.800 --> 3:47:42.640]  were saying was tapping the cage and saying you better uh pay me to protect you from my lunatic
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:46.480]  friend here be ashamed that this thing got out of the cage but the problem is they also said
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:51.280]  it that day later we plan on doing both no matter what you passed in congress we plan on trying to
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:54.640]  do what we can't do under the clean air anyway let me tell you about a provision in these two
[3:47:54.640 --> 3:47:59.680]  capitrade bills real quickly they're 500 pages different size okay they're not the same bill
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:03.680]  but they have one provision that was identically drafted and buried in both in the senate bill
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:09.360]  it's called section 707 and what it says is every law every law in the united states code
[3:48:09.920 --> 3:48:16.080]  shall not may shall be implemented by the president as a co2 suppression law a carbon dioxide
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:20.320]  suppression global warming law it's a carbon dictatorship that's the department of agriculture
[3:48:20.320 --> 3:48:24.400]  and interior permitting that's the tax code that's the dangerous species that did everything
[3:48:24.400 --> 3:48:28.800]  there's no certainty for sale and these suckers in business who keep saying well i just need
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:33.200]  certainty i need to buy peace i'm gonna super peace good luck buddy you are selling us all out
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:38.080]  thinking you're getting yourself a deal and you are not yeah there's no making a deal with these
[3:48:38.080 --> 3:48:44.000]  vampires i mean this is a greedy i mean folks i'm not trying to demonize them i've studied them
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:49.120]  these are really hellish horrible control freaks i mean at the end of the day they
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:53.360]  aren't going to stop are they don't look at the provisions they're putting in these bills
[3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:57.520]  they want full and total control in the name of global warming by Alex we're saving the planet
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:00.160]  what about the children you wouldn't want to be at the night you wouldn't want to kill children
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:04.720]  would you i mean they practice their routine the problem is certainty is not for sale and i've
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:09.840]  got all these businesses i've had at least two CEOs say to me well christ i just need certainty
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:14.480]  and they don't get it read the bill i know it's 1300 pages long with somebody has to
[3:49:14.480 --> 3:49:18.880]  read the bill certainty is not for sale you cannot sue for peace with these people the day
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:24.400]  goes into effect you know what they want more and i want let me leave you with this did you know
[3:49:24.400 --> 3:49:29.600]  that nothing ever proposed cap and trade legislation Kyoto would according to anybody under any
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:35.600]  scenario or set of assumptions detectively impact the climate so the it is not reasonable
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:40.400]  to conclude it's about the climate it's only reasonable to conclude it's about what it would
[3:49:40.400 --> 3:49:45.200]  do and you know what it would do but it's not about what it would do that's just not logical
[3:49:46.720 --> 3:49:51.440]  unbelievable we've got to have you back up just to break down the legislation quickly in the last
[3:49:51.440 --> 3:49:56.480]  minute we've got do you think that they're going to be able to ram through the cap and trade i mean
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:50:00.960]  not the treaty but the cap and trade bill that's passed the house they're trying to shake people
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:04.560]  down as you described with dpa i don't think folks are buying it i think there's a chance we'll get a
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:09.040]  one line dpa uh clean air act is written shall not be implemented this way but the dems will
[3:50:09.040 --> 3:50:14.960]  fight that tooth and nail so the long answer is uh is to add that to no but it will not be without a
[3:50:14.960 --> 3:50:19.280]  struggle in the spring they're going to try to slip it in because you don't pass the biggest tax
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:24.800]  increase in american history late in an even number meaning election year and they just don't
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:30.240]  they just don't care how unpopular they are there is that sense of urgency that they're rushing
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:35.440]  everything through if we can hold them another two years will their global carbon dictatorship
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:39.840]  be derailed permanently i think so because you can't tell people the sky constantly is falling
[3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:44.560]  when the beach is in the sky or just where we left them amazing he's the author of red hot lies
