[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:33.120]  Texas Alex Jones Hank Williams Jr. as you know has been pulled after 20 plus years
[00:33.120 --> 00:39.200]  from the intro song for Monday Night Football and I normally wouldn't cover
[00:39.200 --> 00:43.040]  a story like this but we will later in the hour because I want to actually play
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.000]  what he said and the reason he's getting pulled is not really comparing Obama to
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.040]  Hitler he was saying that basically both painter and Obama are our enemies and I
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.200]  happened to know from a little bird that told me that the Williams family is
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.640]  pretty awake actually we were contacted a couple years ago by his Hank Williams
[01:05.640 --> 01:09.120]  the third who I'd like to get on the show was talking about coming on but said
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.080]  oh I don't like to get political but I think they have gotten political so why
[01:13.080 --> 01:17.880]  not go all the way I hope that Hank Williams Jr. comes out and defends
[01:17.880 --> 01:22.160]  himself instead of letting them basically have him come back and grovel to
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.600]  Obama but something tells me that's not going to happen but this is all part of
[01:26.600 --> 01:31.760]  this reign of terror and political correctness so coming up a little bit
[01:31.760 --> 01:34.480]  later in the hour we're going to play that clip and actually analyze what was
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.440]  said but look it's time the boycott the NFL it's used as a distraction it's
[01:40.440 --> 01:43.840]  become the American pastime instead of the free market Bill of Rights and
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.680]  Constitution it's become an opiate a gladiatorial diversion from the real
[01:48.680 --> 01:52.960]  world and it's now become a beta testing ground for homeland security to
[01:52.960 --> 01:59.080]  grandstand in every major football game and reminds you that you can only trust
[01:59.080 --> 02:02.440]  the government and big sis and that they're going to grab everyone's
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.840]  genitals and your wife and daughters breast and your your son's genitals and
[02:06.840 --> 02:10.480]  your genitals this is the type of stuff goes on there and it's going to expand
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.800]  out as homeland security has said in press releases to every shopping mall
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.360]  checkpoints on highways you name it checkpoints like the one I drove through
[02:20.360 --> 02:28.440]  Sunday and we showed that video last night up on info wars nightly news and
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.560]  that video is posted at prisonplanet.tv right now and is still
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.160]  restreaming after the show's over there's at seven and when it's over it
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.160]  just keeps restreaming and also archived there at prisonplanet.tv or
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.280]  infowarsnews.com both those URLs will take you right there to it and a lot
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.560]  of the nightly news we also end up posting to YouTube because we couldn't
[02:49.560 --> 02:54.120]  afford the bandwidth ourselves and we do have those tidbits posted up at
[02:54.120 --> 03:00.240]  infowars.com it's got the headline internal checkpoints exposed they've
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.040]  got hundreds of these a hundred miles into the country under federal
[03:04.040 --> 03:09.560]  regulations and I was making the joke with some of the folks that are here in
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.480]  the office because I've seen it myself they don't want to mess with illegal
[03:12.480 --> 03:16.680]  aliens so you got brown skin brown hair generally that's what the guys were
[03:16.680 --> 03:19.920]  telling me in the back they just wave you through but if you're black or white
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.080]  they go ahead and pull you out send the drug dogs in they're looking for drugs
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.000]  they don't want to find illegals and the joke by one of the crews Hispanic was
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.840]  you drive through it they wave you through if you're Hispanic and then you
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.240]  get up to the rest stop or the gas station passed it and it's like 20
[03:37.240 --> 03:45.240]  illegals piling out of a van it's just hilarious so but it's oh look wow he
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.360]  just jaren just ran this in Hank Williams Jr. son my dad should not talk
[03:49.360 --> 03:51.920]  politics

[03:59.080 --> 04:03.400]  show I mean hell I guess you were thinking about coming on and talking
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.200]  politics but probably better of it the answer is all of us need to come out and
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.480]  speak all of us need to be able to say whatever we want and not have it to
[04:11.480 --> 04:14.440]  where you say something that the establishment doesn't like you get
[04:14.440 --> 04:18.520]  fired pretty soon you're not gonna be able to say what color tennis shoes you

[04:23.560 --> 04:28.440]  necks now because some gang members wear crosses around their neck well whoop
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.360]  do you do I've been in a restaurant before when I was in college with my

[08:34.640 --> 08:39.800]  joining us to look at the protest against Wall Street they're funded by the
[08:39.800 --> 08:44.120]  Federal Reserve they want to blame the free market they want to blame all
[08:44.120 --> 08:49.400]  private business they want to blame the 30,000 I looked at the number it's over
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.760]  30,000 companies traded on different stock markets based in Wall Street they
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.360]  want to just generally blame private property for this when it's government
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.680]  it's government that has been lobbied and infiltrated with a revolving door
[09:07.680 --> 09:14.640]  with the elite of Wall Street the private inner coterie of six big megabanks
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.400]  and the private fortune 100 that they own and dominate they write the laws in
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.480]  this country and worldwide through globalism to ban their competition to
[09:25.480 --> 09:29.760]  take the property of whoever they want and to set up a global corporate
[09:29.760 --> 09:35.720]  structure just last week the New York Times came out and basically whitewashed
[09:35.720 --> 09:42.040]  a UN slash World Bank program in different African countries where they
[09:42.040 --> 09:46.920]  go into indigenous populations who've lived on the land for millennium and
[09:46.920 --> 09:53.680]  burned down their their their huts lined them up and shoot them and the New
[09:53.680 --> 09:58.680]  York Times said well you know maybe it's a little harsh but it is what we have to
[09:58.680 --> 10:02.760]  do to stop climate change they were going into the areas to run the people
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.760]  off the land because it has to be left off limits so that they can plant trees
[10:06.760 --> 10:16.600]  to offset human carbon dioxide that is back in the news today Honduran farmers
[10:16.600 --> 10:22.560]  slaughtered in name of global warming UN accredited companies violently sees
[10:22.560 --> 10:28.440]  land to allow biofuels as part of carbon trading scheme 23 farmers and
[10:28.440 --> 10:33.920]  Honduras were slaughtered in a coal blood by hired mercenaries as they tried
[10:33.920 --> 10:37.880]  to protect their land from being seized by a corporation who wanted to use the
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.440]  land to produce biofuels as part of the United Nations accredited UN carbon
[10:42.440 --> 10:48.400]  trading scheme this is at info wars dot com you should get this and send it to
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.560]  all the Al Gore acolytes and the supporters of the UN protests erupted
[10:54.560 --> 10:58.120]  in July when six international human rights advocacy groups presented a
[10:58.120 --> 11:03.240]  report to the EP detailing what they called murders and forced evictions of
[11:03.240 --> 11:10.200]  peasants in El Bajo in the Valley of Northern Honduras reports the New
[11:10.200 --> 11:16.040]  American magazine the International Federation of Human Rights report
[11:16.040 --> 11:21.480]  accuses UN sanctioned palm oil mills of stealing farmland from Honduran natives
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.720]  and killing or wounding them as they attempted to defend their property as
[11:24.720 --> 11:28.760]  as the companies acting with the government impunity regularly target
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.960]  members of local land rights movement who end up murdered in feigned car
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.480]  accidents or hunted down and shot by private security guards and it just goes
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.600]  on and on I remember back in 99 an issue of that I showed on my local TV show and
[11:44.600 --> 11:54.560]  on radio of national geographic and by the way I tried to dig through this in
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.880]  in storage because all my years of storage is back during the warehouse and
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.240]  I couldn't find it I know listeners those like last week I said on air I
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.080]  can't find the Rick Perry clip of him speaking to a Hispanic group talking in
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.760]  in Southern California like hello good to see you I am Rick Perry our whole crew
[12:12.760 --> 12:17.080]  couldn't find it you found it within seconds and sent it to Rob do his email
[12:17.080 --> 12:25.920]  it's the same thing anything like that I remember an article in 99 I think April
[12:25.920 --> 12:35.040]  issue or was it April 2000 of New Yorker magazine had a pro to beers world
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.000]  diamond monopoly article about how they use you in troops and NATO troops to go
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.560]  in and slaughter anybody that tries to mine their own diamonds even on their
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.120]  own land and how cute it was and how great it was and how powerful they are
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.040]  I'd like somebody to find that mail it to me I guess I could you'll get a back
[12:50.040 --> 12:52.880]  issue from New Yorker magazine the point is you probably got a rector on your
[12:52.880 --> 13:00.440]  shelf that was I think was 99 maybe even 98 issue of national geographic it said
[13:00.440 --> 13:08.080]  UN biosphere and I want to say it was like Burma and it it showed in it UN
[13:08.080 --> 13:14.240]  peacekeepers paid by the World Bank to guard the forest and it said they shoot
[13:14.240 --> 13:20.320]  and kill villagers people who live there and it was a it was a pro killing
[13:20.320 --> 13:25.920]  article it said you know they they if locals try to cut wood and sell it or
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.520]  if they try to have a firewood there they're shot even though it's their land
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.440]  actually they've been driven off of it I mean again there's just all this data
[13:34.440 --> 13:39.000]  I mean just last week we had articles about Uganda and other countries in
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.680]  Africa where World Bank companies are publicly there and they go into the
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.280]  governments of Uganda and others and say all right give us all these tens of
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.560]  thousands acres or we're not gonna you know give you more loans or we're gonna
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.440]  charge you higher interest on your existing loans and they say okay
[13:57.440 --> 14:04.760]  infrastructure is yours land is yours and they send them in and here's an
[14:04.760 --> 14:10.160]  article right here and I've told this story a lot and and and of all the great
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.600]  journalist out there that listen to the show all the great journalist out there
[14:14.600 --> 14:19.440]  that tune in you ought to go dig it up because I know it's true I know I saw
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.160]  it in the mid 80s right up I guess until 1990 when I was back in high school I
[14:25.160 --> 14:28.800]  would go with my parents to Mexico on vacation a couple times a year and they
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.880]  would rent a car and drive all over southern Mexico and southeastern Mexico
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.040]  and they were in the hotels when we would stop at them brochures concierge
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.080]  will be promoting it get land you can't really use it but you're paying for it
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.880]  it's a UN biosphere and then my dad began to investigate it because he's like
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.120]  wow Mexico's never allowed land sales to foreigners we might buy some land down
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.400]  here but he said oh no it's politically dirty they force people off their land
[14:56.400 --> 15:02.120]  up to Mexico City so we sit here and wonder why there's 35 million people in
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.840]  Mexico City when it was just 10 million 20 something years ago we wonder why
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.480]  there's Makila Dorei slave factories all over our border we wonder why we're
[15:10.480 --> 15:16.760]  overflowed with illegal aliens well they're they're farmers I mean I mean you
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.160]  see these people they I mean they just look like somebody from Texas you know
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.200]  there you got the cowboy hats their jeans their boots they'll skin a buck
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.480]  they'll run a trot line they can basically do anything fix anything these
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.440]  are little farmers who lived all over Mexico just like little farmers in
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.000]  America being driven off their land little little families with little
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.320]  pieces of land now with the animal ID premises ID it's all coming here under
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.280]  the UN biosphere and they would go at gunpoint that's why they had all the
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.760]  uprisings all over Mexico but then the IMF and World Bank came in the Ford
[15:48.760 --> 15:57.760]  Foundation came in even before all this happened and it already pre-programmed
[15:57.760 --> 16:01.920]  the public there that you rebel against the big banks and the Mexican government
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.560]  by becoming a communist and then that's controlled opposition and so you can
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.960]  never actually organize and defeat the the globalist so I'm already digressing
[16:11.960 --> 16:18.320]  here it's just this is being done all over the world and Paul's been doing a
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.840]  great job but we need to we need a chronicle like a big article and you'll
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.760]  cut it off though because there's too many examples maybe 20 examples of the
[16:26.760 --> 16:34.240]  UN forcing people off their land and killing them Diego Garcia Queen of
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.600]  England wanted to turn it into a US British base so they just basically
[16:38.600 --> 16:44.160]  killed a bunch of people and drove off what was it 5,000 Burma pops up where
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.080]  they killed what was it over 10,000 natives the UN actually wind them up
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.680]  shot them in women children I mean I could just go on for hours here out the
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.960]  top my head UN sanctioned mass murder operations they just had the ivory
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.160]  coast situation six months ago where was admitted the UN went in funded rebels
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.240]  the rebels killed thousands of people burned down whole cities blew up the
[17:05.240 --> 17:09.920]  Capitol building and the UN took over and I'll assure you the ivory coast is
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.440]  not going to ship unauthorized gold or diamonds out again they're like you
[17:14.440 --> 17:16.880]  think you're going to build up your industry and you think you're going to
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.080]  allow people to have jobs there's too much gold there's too many diamonds we
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.440]  want to keep the price up by the way I get emails going you know gold is dirty
[17:27.440 --> 17:33.280]  well everything's dirty absolutely of course it's dirty anything precious is
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.880]  going to have corruption around it that's why you legalize it and that takes
[17:38.880 --> 17:46.880]  the corruption out just like the drug war if they allowed those mines in
[17:46.880 --> 17:50.560]  Africa that aren't globalist control to produce gold it would it would drive
[17:50.560 --> 17:56.800]  down the price a little bit great I'm all for that now now gold though is it
[17:56.800 --> 18:02.520]  is not really artificially scarce it's being depleted out same thing with
[18:02.520 --> 18:08.360]  silver silver really I mean there's just incredible demand for that compared to
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.400]  what they discovered silver is the real sleeper all of the experts that look at
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.280]  a degree whether it takes a year or 20 years it's the bigger sleeper now
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.680]  diamonds are semi precious in fact you've got semi precious precious and then
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.160]  the ultra precious stones and diamonds aren't even at the top of semi precious
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.000]  they're there they're there two-thirds the way up but they're not the top third
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.320]  they're a little more valuable than agates the problem is they're
[18:34.320 --> 18:39.920]  geographically isolated so they're geographically rare but once you get
[18:39.920 --> 18:42.780]  there there's just diamonds laying around on the ground in the different
[18:42.780 --> 18:46.560]  deposits and so they've got hit squads all over the world that hunt people down
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.080]  and the Oppenheimers the De Beers outfit they don't even try to hide this fact
[18:52.080 --> 18:58.040]  but see I'm already digressing I start talking for 30 seconds about the
[18:58.040 --> 19:02.520]  Occupy Wall Street group that the establishments trying to infiltrate
[19:02.520 --> 19:06.440]  and turn into a pro austerity group calling for higher taxes on the middle
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.240]  class which will then be paid to Warren Buffett George Soros and others that are
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.880]  tax exempted offshore it's very simple equation but I thought I would just
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.440]  digress into the fact that the new modern eugenics what you could call for
[19:19.440 --> 19:22.760]  lack of a better word because really Nazis come out of eugenics so it's not
[19:22.760 --> 19:27.160]  fair to even call them Nazis is that's just a certain national socialist her
[19:27.160 --> 19:34.240]  mutation of this this is the eugenicist global racist extermination arm and it
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.000]  runs around saying I'm liberal I'm liberal so most people just say well
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.560]  slit my throat then well not me I mean I understand that just because an army
[19:43.560 --> 19:47.000]  tank is broadcasting I'm liberal I'm trendy I mean if you put a Ross to
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  firing and hairstyle on the top of an army tank running over you would it be
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  okay maybe a tank with rainbow paint on it and it's like oh run over me you have

[34:13.720 --> 34:18.880]  AM and FM affiliates across the country if you're a new listener including on
[34:18.880 --> 34:24.880]  stations in Canada this is just a broadcast dedicated to freedom dedicated
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.520]  to telling it like it is dedicated to facing the real issues that actually
[34:29.520 --> 34:35.840]  affect our society there is a global corporate consortium a cartel a combine
[34:35.840 --> 34:42.520]  of the fortune 100 run by six global megabanks and their subsidiaries that
[34:42.520 --> 34:47.600]  openly are establishing a world corporate dictatorship where they write
[34:47.600 --> 34:55.640]  the laws and are exempt from their own laws they call it the new world order and
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.720]  we are here attempting to wake the planet up to it instead of just generally
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.000]  protesting Wall Street with all the diverse companies and firms that have
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.040]  actually made this country great predominantly we're focusing in on the
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.880]  Federal Reserve private shareholders we're focusing in on the people that
[35:15.880 --> 35:21.200]  Kennedy tried to take out of power in 1963 with an executive order to begin
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.080]  abolishing the Federal Reserve and to issue US government notes dollars we have
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.600]  Federal Reserve dollars they blew his head off we are attempting to rally the
[35:31.600 --> 35:37.160]  planet against Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo city group
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.200]  and others that are the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve who
[35:41.200 --> 35:45.160]  have stolen 27 plus trillion of US taxpayer money more than 25 trillion of
[35:45.160 --> 35:48.960]  other nation's money where they hold the entire world economy hostage and say
[35:48.960 --> 35:54.160]  pay us direct taxes to the bankers they call those bailouts or we will implode
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.360]  the world economy but you notice as you give into them and as the governments
[35:58.360 --> 36:05.960]  that are positioned and and commanded by their alumni in that revolving door
[36:05.960 --> 36:09.760]  out of the central banks into government regulatory positions and the
[36:09.760 --> 36:15.120]  presidents and prime ministers they finance into power their traders that
[36:15.120 --> 36:20.320]  they positioned in government are setting up homeland security grids police
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.440]  state grids in every country they dominate they're setting up secret police
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.040]  paramilitary groups to dominate and take our property our land our taxes I mean I
[36:30.040 --> 36:34.360]  just read to you earlier another article it's in the new American it's at
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.000]  info wars calm Paul Watson breaks it down and ties it into the Ugandan mass
[36:39.000 --> 36:47.040]  murders by World Bank UN forces last week I'm tempted to go to Honduras but
[36:47.040 --> 36:50.840]  that they don't care they would just kill me but that would get attention on
[36:50.840 --> 36:56.040]  this I mean some of us yeah I mean you've got to stand up against these UN
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.600]  forces and they just go in and just line people up men women children blow their
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.600]  heads off they don't even bother burying them now and they say it's for the earth
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.360]  we're you know I come in peace and then they blast you there as long as you say
[37:10.360 --> 37:16.840]  it's living you know loving UN liberalism then it's all fine and we're
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.280]  all going under this system and the UN was created by the big mega banks created
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.640]  by the Pentagon created by the Department of Defense in 1945 here in the
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.640]  United States not because America's bad but because America got hijacked by this
[37:30.640 --> 37:39.720]  group the toll-free number to join us is 800 to 5 at 9 92 31 I'd love to hear
[37:39.720 --> 37:43.000]  from you but I was thinking this morning about the difference between one
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.200]  dimensional thinking two-dimensional thinking three-dimensional thinking four
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.520]  dimensional thinking and five-dimensional thinking we can only really engage in
[37:55.520 --> 37:58.760]  five-dimensional thinking when we're asleep I don't want to get into all the
[37:58.760 --> 38:06.320]  complex permutations of that system but the brain is powerful most people
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.800]  naturally engage in two-dimensional thinking but as you get older you learn
[38:10.800 --> 38:17.160]  the third dimension a poor sweet little mentally retarded mentally handicapped
[38:17.160 --> 38:30.400]  a child who's five years old generally thinks that a drawing of a bird is a bird
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.620]  but a five-year-old who is as a normal brain development average brain
[38:37.620 --> 38:40.880]  development would know if you told him hey the birds tweeting the birds gonna
[38:40.880 --> 38:45.360]  bite you joking with them they would say that's not real a two-year-old a three
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.720]  year old would say that but not a mentally retarded child they most of
[38:48.720 --> 38:57.280]  will not be able to tell and the public has been put into a trance to keep you
[38:57.280 --> 39:09.000]  in really two-dimensional thinking to where basically if if the government
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.440]  shows you the image of a charging rhinoceros on TV a lot of people are in
[39:14.440 --> 39:19.080]  suspended disbelief and basically allow their subconscious mind and even their
[39:19.080 --> 39:25.680]  conscious mind to see the charging nine rhinoceros as if it's real and humans
[39:25.680 --> 39:28.760]  could artificially put themselves into really a two-dimensional mode of
[39:28.760 --> 39:33.480]  thinking I'm trying to get people to live in the third dimension that's where
[39:33.480 --> 39:42.920]  we live we're able to calculate out to the fourth even fifth dimension some
[39:42.920 --> 39:47.520]  quantum physicists even higher if you really get your mind around this and
[39:47.520 --> 39:56.040]  these ideas and systems but here's a simple example of third-dimensional
[39:56.040 --> 40:02.240]  thinking and then I'll get to some news in your calls versus two-dimensional
[40:02.240 --> 40:08.280]  thinking Webster Tarpley was on in full wars nightly knows last night we had a
[40:08.280 --> 40:15.920]  good back-and-forth discussion and he of course has said the euro was set up by
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.680]  the mega banks to consolidate Europe and that's what they admit that's a fact
[40:20.680 --> 40:28.120]  and it's an undemocratic dictatorship of this private bureaucracy that is
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.600]  positioned by the big mega banks that's now setting up a pure dictatorship of
[40:33.600 --> 40:39.600]  the banking cartel where the EU has the member country signed over all of their
[40:39.600 --> 40:44.960]  national sovereignty had agreed to circumvent even the will of their people
[40:44.960 --> 40:49.440]  to that authority so even if the Germans or the French or anybody else
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.760]  votes to get out they're saying you can't now you were actually occupied
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.800]  through the euro which is the political power by the financial power that sits
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.680]  above it and that now is publicly promoted on Bloomberg CNBC Wall Street
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.160]  Journal they say tyranny is what will save your pension funds in Europe in the
[41:08.160 --> 41:12.440]  US getting rid of the Constitution is what will save it you see it news week
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.760]  and time and so they're they're dispensing now with even the talk of you
[41:18.760 --> 41:22.600]  know this is to prop up people's welfare and the social safety net they're
[41:22.600 --> 41:27.360]  going right to tell in the middle class go along with the tyranny and you'll
[41:27.360 --> 41:31.040]  still get your pension funds in your 401k in your stocks of course you won't
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.680]  they're setting that up to then steal all that from you as well but a coward
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.920]  when a bully faces them will think well if I get down and let you spit on me and
[41:40.920 --> 41:48.120]  let you squat on me then maybe it'll be okay no it's not going to be okay by
[41:48.120 --> 41:54.680]  increment we have basically been rolled in to servitude now let me just briefly
[41:54.680 --> 42:01.640]  give you two-dimensional versus third-dimensional about 7 a.m. this
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.560]  morning I go to info wars comm curtain emos already posted last night's info
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.320]  wars nightly news the present planet on TV viewers watch live and saw archived in
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.800]  higher quality it's already posted our YouTube channel and I go and I see some
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.880]  of the comments and I see a commenter on there saying look at Tarpley and Jones
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.520]  contradicting themselves they're saying that you know the euro is bad but that
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.160]  the globalist want to destroy the euro now and that we've got to keep the euro
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.600]  together
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.960]  you know which is it is the euro bad or is the euro good they don't understand it
[42:41.960 --> 42:49.360]  doesn't matter who builds a fortress just because the Romans build a fortress on
[42:49.360 --> 42:54.160]  the southern coast of Spain and then the Moors come across if the Roman Empire
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.240]  falls and they take half of Spain and they take that fortress and then later
[42:59.240 --> 43:08.280]  the Christians drive the Muslims out the Moors out and take over that fortress
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.760]  it's a fortress like a gun or a car it doesn't have a brain it doesn't breathe
[43:13.760 --> 43:20.180]  it doesn't think it's it's neutral it's like a hill and enemies coming you try
[43:20.180 --> 43:23.440]  to get your force on top the hill because it's better defended and your
[43:23.440 --> 43:32.120]  enemies got a cop uphill against you again and again this is so simple this
[43:32.120 --> 43:38.320]  is so incredibly simple but it's also hard for people to be able to grasp two
[43:38.320 --> 43:45.040]  dimensional versus three-dimensional and that's why well it's another example
[43:45.040 --> 43:52.560]  here in a moment of one-dimensional versus two-dimensional but they just popped
[43:52.560 --> 44:04.000]  in my head by by analyzing the public so the globalist on record fifty three
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.560]  years ago fifty four years ago now through the Treaty of Rome established
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.000]  the European Union through a trade deal they tell the slaves that they've done
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.480]  it publicly in 2000 but when they had the 50th anniversary in 2007 they
[44:17.480 --> 44:21.640]  celebrated in all the EU member states 50 years of the European Union and the
[44:21.640 --> 44:25.480]  Bilderberg group members came out and made statements the BBC hey we covertly
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.040]  set this up isn't it great we're doing this in North America as well and Asia
[44:29.040 --> 44:36.440]  and Africa they don't conquer you now within military that rolls over you know
[44:36.440 --> 44:41.680]  the hill on you they conquer you by getting by getting their people into
[44:41.680 --> 44:47.040]  your government paid off to sign you over to a quote trade deal that isn't
[44:47.040 --> 44:50.520]  really a trade deal it's the end of your sovereignty and they get you to sign
[44:50.520 --> 44:54.920]  on to all of these debts that you don't owe and all these derivatives then they
[44:54.920 --> 44:58.760]  hold your country hostage because your finance minister lies to you and says
[44:58.760 --> 45:04.000]  that you owe it when you don't even owe you know less than 10% of it the rest is
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.200]  all derivatives garbage it's impossible to pay off by the way you know they
[45:07.200 --> 45:13.400]  spring the trap when it's impossible to pay off it's all fiat and I mean this is
[45:13.400 --> 45:16.360]  so important and I'm getting academic here but I want people to really get
[45:16.360 --> 45:21.640]  their mind around this show the euro was set up to get countries to give up
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.640]  their sovereignty without knowing it to get them tied into debts they don't owe
[45:25.640 --> 45:31.160]  and now the bankers are ready to fully implode the euro itself and set up a new
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.440]  system above it where the countries totally waive all their rights and the
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.800]  euro waves its collective right into this financial dictatorship and even the
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.880]  Daily Mail and Reuters and others call it a financial dictatorship that guys
[45:46.880 --> 45:52.600]  pull that up a Europe going under financial dictatorship or or or new
[45:52.600 --> 45:59.320]  new new EU system forthright you'll see the the London Guardian I mean even
[45:59.320 --> 46:05.520]  having to admit that totally dictatorial and so what Tarpley saying is they set
[46:05.520 --> 46:11.880]  the euro up as a scaffolding to build this tyranny around it now they want to
[46:11.880 --> 46:20.200]  implode that old system to fully consolidate it with a wrecking ball and
[46:20.200 --> 46:26.560]  basically scoop it up into a total tyranny so Tarpley saying now the wolf
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.560]  pack of the banks want to fully destroy that government system because it still
[46:31.560 --> 46:36.560]  is tied to the and and its authority is tied to the national sovereignty of the
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.880]  unit pieces not states get together to be stronger that was what it was
[46:41.880 --> 46:46.160]  originally you know the the selling point now they're now the globals are
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.440]  trying to implode it to go to the next system so Tarpley saying use the euro to
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.640]  stand against the bankers and don't let them destroy it to bring it into the
[46:55.640 --> 46:59.480]  next level because he understands they're not planning to destroy the euro
[46:59.480 --> 47:02.920]  and oh it's a setback for the New World Order as some have said when in
[47:02.920 --> 47:08.080]  reality this was their plan to wreck the North American Union once they're done
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.960]  with it the European Union the Asian Union and say the system didn't didn't
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.440]  work and bring it in to this bank of the world I mean that was the plan since
[47:16.440 --> 47:21.040]  1975 with the trilateral Commission I've been on air more than 16 years telling
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.240]  you this day was coming they'd set up three unions bankrupt those then offer
[47:25.240 --> 47:28.520]  the solution to this private corporate world government you pay your VAT and
[47:28.520 --> 47:32.960]  sales taxes to I didn't know it'd be a carbon tax 16 years ago but a little bit
[47:32.960 --> 47:38.320]  after that they announced that as well so Tarpley says don't let him implode the
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.880]  euro that's their plan there's the bonds of those countries they're still
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.480]  solvent they want to fully destroy it now because they're done with that phase
[47:46.480 --> 47:53.960]  and they don't want them to ever be able to get financially stable again and
[47:53.960 --> 47:57.920]  people say well then which is it is the euro good or is it bad no at this key
[47:57.920 --> 48:03.200]  phase where the globalist are ready now to implode it you need to occupy it and
[48:03.200 --> 48:10.880]  use its mechanisms to block them fully from imploding the sovereignty of the
[48:10.880 --> 48:18.080]  countries because the new system they're going to is completely dictatorial so see
[48:18.080 --> 48:24.240]  that's three-dimensional thinking versus two-dimensional thinking and I don't
[48:24.240 --> 48:27.720]  even know a hundred percent even agree with Tarpley on that but but I see his
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.640]  point that that's what the globalist want that's their strategy that's where
[48:31.640 --> 48:35.440]  this is going and they hold everybody hostage saying the euro will collapse
[48:35.440 --> 48:40.000]  unless you sign on to this new authority which actually creates a new
[48:40.000 --> 48:47.840]  superhero run by private banks but in that plan they want to fully bankrupt the
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.760]  old euro and no matter how many times you bail out Greece or bail out Portugal
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.200]  or Spain or or any of these countries you're not really bailing out those
[48:56.200 --> 49:00.800]  countries see that's a two-dimensional versus three-dimensional people that go
[49:00.800 --> 49:06.520]  off one and two dimensions mentally you tell them oh the bankers want to save
[49:06.520 --> 49:09.720]  our country and so you just believe what the news says instead of actually
[49:09.720 --> 49:15.360]  analyzing what it really is just because something says it's apple pie in a box
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.240]  doesn't mean it's apple pie you could have a bunch of screwdrivers in an
[49:19.240 --> 49:22.800]  apple pie box you could have a bunch of spiders in there you could have a bunch
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.000]  of horsemen are in there you could have diamonds in there packaging doesn't
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.360]  necessarily mean what's actually in there that's three-dimensional thinking
[49:30.360 --> 49:40.960]  and then I see comments on their like why isn't Alex Jones covering fast and
[49:40.960 --> 49:45.120]  furious I saw that on one of the videos and I probably go and tell programs I
[49:45.120 --> 49:48.440]  saw it posted on all the videos even though we've been talking about fast
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.560]  and furious for six years intensely for three telling you they're shipping guns
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.360]  all over the US not just Mexico and allowing Sena Loa and others to ship
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.040]  cocaine in and now everything Celica steel and others told us here on air five
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.240]  six years ago has been confirmed and it's in the news but see with a one
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.360]  dimensional thinker or even two dimension you could say when they go to my
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.760]  site and they don't see the front page talking about fast and furious today I'm
[50:14.760 --> 50:20.160]  not covering fast and furious and so from a childlike way that's a way to
[50:20.160 --> 50:24.080]  kind of feel good about somebody with a radio show with a TV show is to say hey
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.000]  this guy isn't doing a good job I the YouTube viewer I have a very high moral
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.040]  standard I have great value you know look at the NASCAR champion he made a
[50:35.040 --> 50:40.720]  wrong turn and crashed I can backseat drive and say they're bad and say that
[50:40.720 --> 50:49.240]  person is a terrible driver see it's all how people look at the world I try to
[50:49.240 --> 50:53.320]  look at it like a prism through all the different fractals and angles I were
[50:53.320 --> 50:57.280]  hitting the news full hour of calls coming up we'll get into Hank Williams

[54:20.000 --> 54:26.520]  gonna get into Putin Vladimir Putin is calling for a Eurasian Union see this
[54:26.520 --> 54:30.800]  is the 21st century form of tyranny they don't have the Russians pour in and
[54:30.800 --> 54:34.840]  just take over your country or finance a rebellion and the Russians pour in to
[54:34.840 --> 54:39.960]  help the uprising in Romania or Czechoslovakia which you know they've
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.760]  broken into the Czech Republic and other areas today that's what the UN's doing
[54:45.760 --> 54:50.560]  they have rebels they fund start killing everybody then NATO comes in that's
[54:50.560 --> 54:55.600]  kind of the West adopting Soviet models no they just come in and pay off your
[54:55.600 --> 55:00.400]  politicians promise them deals and have your politicians sign you into a deal
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.140]  to go back under the new Soviet Union but you don't call it the Soviet Union you
[55:05.140 --> 55:18.800]  call it the Eurasian Union and see the arguments they have in places like Russia
[55:18.800 --> 55:23.720]  to do this I'm not defending it is well NATO's coming in and taking over all
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.840]  their old satellites so they've got to do this so that's this mindset of expand
[55:28.840 --> 55:33.960]  or die take over more areas dominate everybody or you're gonna get dominated
[55:33.960 --> 55:40.160]  the people of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and Central Asia need to
[55:40.160 --> 55:45.240]  demand their own sovereignty see sovereignty is a firewall against global
[55:45.240 --> 55:50.480]  government and big empires states inside our country are a firewall against
[55:50.480 --> 55:53.120]  tyranny because if one state gets corrupt you can go to the other
[55:53.120 --> 55:58.120]  everybody will just leave that corrupt state it creates real diversity but if
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.080]  you have one big central federal government well it goes bad it's all
[56:02.080 --> 56:08.560]  over national sovereignty and sub sovereignty within states is a natural
[56:08.560 --> 56:12.480]  firewall against tyranny start thinking in a three-dimensional or even four
[56:12.480 --> 56:18.680]  dimensional way I mean all of you out there promoting open borders the
[56:18.680 --> 56:24.520]  globalist the big mainstream TV who you know doesn't have your best interest in
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.260]  heart is telling you have the borders wide open and never pointing out the
[56:29.260 --> 56:33.840]  hypocrisy that American citizens get treated like garbage in Mexico and you
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.080]  don't go there and ask for welfare you don't go there and say I'm an American
[56:37.080 --> 56:43.320]  my wife's about to have a baby pay for everything they would laugh at you it's
[56:43.320 --> 56:48.240]  part of making sure Mexico never becomes free if we had made 30 million people
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.240]  stay down there there had been a real revolution in Mexico probably would be
[56:51.240 --> 56:55.400]  better off today but instead America can be used as a political steam valve see
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.640]  that's three or four-dimensional thinking that's wargaming things out that's
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.720]  that's seeing it in a more complex view not just oh well people are bashing
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.440]  Obama and I'm a Democrat so you know Obama must be good or people are bashing
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.160]  Republicans who are Democrats and I'm a Republican so again just because
[57:14.160 --> 57:16.320]  Democrats attacked somebody doesn't mean they're good if you're a
[57:16.320 --> 57:22.160]  conservative or just because people attack Obama who are quote
[57:22.160 --> 57:28.880]  conservative doesn't mean Obama's good that's part of the theater that's part
[57:28.880 --> 57:35.400]  of the garbage that's part of keeping you partisan now when do you know
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.560]  somebody's good when the whole system tries to ignore them and when they're
[57:39.560 --> 57:43.760]  forced to cover them they attack them and you've seen MSNBC and Fox attack
[57:43.760 --> 57:47.840]  Ron Paul you've seen him get the least amount of speaking time in all the
[57:47.840 --> 57:54.040]  events you've seen Ron Paul shafted over and over again and demonized and lied
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.120]  about there is your illustration right there but you don't just trust him
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.160]  because of that you go and look at his voting record you go and look at the
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.240]  fact that he's never compromised when it comes to the Constitution and then you
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.440]  understand he's going after the real enemy the Federal Reserve and I want to
[58:10.440 --> 58:13.720]  tell you if you're angry about the New World Order taking over our society you
[58:13.720 --> 58:19.720]  don't have any excuse I am calling for people nationwide this Friday Saturday
[58:19.720 --> 58:24.200]  and Sunday pick a date to pick one of the 12 Federal Reserve banks in the
[58:24.200 --> 58:30.160]  country or one of its substations and to go to it the head Federal Reserve
[58:30.160 --> 58:35.120]  Bank for region 11 of 12 regions is Dallas Texas I'm gonna be there this
[58:35.120 --> 58:45.280]  Friday 6 p.m. the address is on info wars.com this is GCN the Genesis
[58:45.280 --> 58:52.640]  communications radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[58:52.640 --> 58:56.520]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[58:56.520 --> 59:00.200]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[59:00.200 --> 59:04.200]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[59:04.200 --> 59:08.600]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[59:08.600 --> 59:13.040]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[59:13.040 --> 59:17.800]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.800 --> 59:21.600]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.600 --> 59:25.200]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.200 --> 59:29.560]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.560 --> 59:32.800]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered
[59:32.800 --> 59:36.400]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:36.400 --> 59:41.200]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[59:51.600 --> 01:00:06.080]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.400]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:21.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:40.280]  yeah well you guys launched the phone call system for me whatever reason it's
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.440]  not up here for me to be able to actually even tell who the calls are I
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:51.520]  will go to your phone calls here in a moment we are now into the second hour
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.680]  of this world by broadcast I normally wouldn't get into a diversion like this
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.000]  but it's not a diversion because it's very informative about political
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.960]  correctness and the chilling and free speech in this country ESPN has pulled
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:11.600]  Hank Williams Jr. who I'm a big fan of even bigger fan of his dad from the
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.400]  Monday Night Football opening that's been there for 20 years are you ready for
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.840]  some football so we're gonna be breaking that down and actually playing the
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:29.320]  clip and analyzing it from what I get from the clip he was basically basically
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:36.080]  going after Boehner and Obama and saying they're all part of the problem I
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.960]  think that's why they went after him he was comparing you know that it's two
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.440]  opposites it's like Hitler and Netanyahu from his perspective that's polar
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.720]  opposites playing golf together that Boehner and Obama play golf and he's
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.160]  saying Obama's the enemy yeah I'd love to be able to talk to somebody like Hank
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.200]  Williams Jr. I know Hank Williams the third is a few years ago contacted us and
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.040]  said he likes to show then I tried to get him on and he's like well I better not
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.680]  get political I thought about it I'm not going to now and I see comments here by
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.760]  him says Hank Williams Jr. son my dad should not talk politics and he went
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.240]  on to say the only musician who's who's smart enough basically this is is
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.400]  Jello B. Offer by the way Jello B. Offer contacted us he's been on before a few
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.680]  years ago and said he liked to come on and for some reason never happened and
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.720]  these guys contact you and then you try to get them on and there's bureaucracy and
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.600]  I just don't have time for it but I do want to get Jello B. Offer on we've
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:39.360]  played his martial law rant before that things pretty good about checkpoints in
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.160]  the US so I've interviewed him a few times on radio and in person so I want to
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.160]  get him back on let's get Hank Williams the third on he's a talented guy like his
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:57.000]  country music more than his punk rock stuff I don't it looks just like his the
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.400]  third looks just like Hank Williams the first look at that man that is if you
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.520]  know what Hank Williams senior look like that looks just like him
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.240]  think Williams the third looks just like granddaddy in fact let's come back in

[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.440]  hillbilly dance it looks like a cross between a hillbilly dance and a hula
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.800]  hula dance I don't know side issue I'll get to that after I take a bunch of
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.560]  phone calls and this whole Russia Putin says he wants to build Eurasian Union the

[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.680]  on over
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.800]  that's Hank Williams coming up after I take a bunch of phone calls
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.840]  his son fired off money night football for comparing Obama to Hitler but
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.800]  really he just compared him to polar opposites of the Republican Party which
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.880]  isn't really true you know that's the thing continuing wars continuing
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.680]  torture continuing banker bailouts continuing running scams this is
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.960]  pretty much the same I mean Rick Perry supported Hillary care a lot of
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:24.880]  Republicans have supported carbon taxes Mitt Romney Newt Gennrich but all I
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.280]  hear about is how great and conservative they are so I don't agree with Hank
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:36.400]  Williams Jr. that Obama is a polar opposite from Boehner but it doesn't
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.320]  matter it's his right to say it and I guess it's money night football's right
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:45.240]  to firing but and ESPN that runs that but ESPN I mean this is like a
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.400]  American icon and they're using it for government propaganda and TSA brain
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.200]  washing and TSA indoctrination and big sis at all the big games telling us
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.520]  trust no one but her while she ships the guns to Mexico and the cocaine in by
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.480]  the way that video is up on info wars.com and I wanted to briefly mention
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.920]  that it's titled exposing internal checkpoints nightly news report Sunday
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:19.080]  driving back from South Padre in the US 99.3 miles from the border because
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.560]  they're allowed under federal regulations policy not law they claim that
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.600]  they're allowed to set up internal checkpoints and search every car with a
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.800]  drug dog they open the door stick the dog in and my kids saw the checkpoint as we
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.000]  sat there in traffic for five minutes and they did not want to me to have a
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.960]  confrontation with them as they've seen before at another checkpoint another
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.000]  type of checkpoint and they were saying they were scared and stuff and so I
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.720]  didn't really get in their face I just said oh sure I don't mind if you search
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.440]  and violate my fourth amendment then open the door and said you're violating
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.920]  my fourth amendment so I was being flimpy with the guy I was actually going to
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:04.200]  tell him I do not allow you to and be backed off at that point but I was trying
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:11.520]  to take the middle road there so that my children would not be horrified but at
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.200]  the same time I've got to stand up against corruption or they have no
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.640]  future and we pretty much unedited put the video up there the only part we
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.040]  fade down as the age of my children when he asked that and it's so asinine you
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.920]  know oh we just want to know if you're American citizens ladies and gentlemen
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.520]  they were sticking a drug dog having people open their car doors and sticking
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.960]  the drug dog in there to look for drugs and I told the guy I said I don't deal
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.400]  drugs like the U.S. government and I see commenters on here a lot of them are
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.680]  like great job Alex that's how you do it but others are
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.280]  couldn't have said it better myself hmm I suspect something Alex caved in what
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:58.440]  the bleep Alex caved in what I got in their face and said you're not bringing
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.040]  your drug dog on here and they didn't I mean I could have gone crazier with them
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.960]  but I tried to control myself I they told me not to videotape them and I said
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.880]  I'm going to videotape them have you seen what's happened to pastor Anderson
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.640]  and others where they slammed his head in the concrete repeatedly for
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:17.000]  videotaping him I was with my three children two of them little girls and I
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.400]  think I did a moderate job it's a little different when you got little kids with
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.320]  you but I love it people who weren't in the arena they get to be the big men and
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.760]  call me a coward he's just mind about search and I go oh no I don't mind if
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.600]  you violate my fourth amendment you're my wife going why are you gonna let him
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.040]  I'm like no as I go over the door open it for him and and you know talk to him
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.280]  because it's a bus an old bus so it only has one door and I said no I'm making
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.960]  the point he's violating my fourth amendment and I said oh you're gonna
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:56.080]  violate my fourth amendment and he backed off and I've dealt with a lot of
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.200]  military cop types if you sit there and 100% get in their face it doesn't work
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.960]  and if you grovel it doesn't work you've got to be mainly sarcastic with them but
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.640]  in a controlled way like oh yeah you really care about me you know the
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.880]  government deals the drugs and the guy smiles because they know that they all
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.360]  know it's all over the Texas papers Houston Chronicle El Paso times you
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.880]  name it that the US government shipping in the majority of the narcotics and
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.240]  being caught doing it and that's what's so outrageous that I talked to Hispanic
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.120]  friends of mine Hispanic folks that work in this office and they were all go
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.960]  yeah when you're Hispanic they just wave you on through because there there's so
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.120]  many illegals pouring across a hundred miles up on that major highway they've
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.560]  got them on all the major highways it's ridiculous you never hear about them
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.760]  grabbing illegals at these and so if you're Hispanic they think well you
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.040]  might be illegal because that's about 80% of the illegals they just let you on
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:53.560]  through and I have been told of your Arab or Asian lookout that sometimes they
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.560]  will drag you off eat them you're a citizen and don't have the proof of it
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:05.600]  it's all about drugs as evidence by our video here's another one ha ha ha that's
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.680]  the way to handle it Alex you caved in and answered their questions why because
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.760]  under federal regulations that's an internal port checkpoint and I did not
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.520]  want my children to all drug off to freak them out and so when he said okay
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.600]  I'm not gonna come on he backed off at that could tell with the board patrol
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.280]  guy went all right just tell me how many are in here I could tell that was a
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.480]  little compromise and I said that okay there's there's three children my wife
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.800]  in the driver and okay he said all right shut the door so I guess I'm the bad
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:47.080]  man and I'm the bad man too this week I'm gonna be up in Dallas 6 p.m. Federal

[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.960]  they're tracking US citizens everywhere that are criticizing them as an
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.560]  intimidation tactic in cyberspace they're marking everybody down making a list
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.720]  who supports them and who doesn't they've hired tens of thousands of lobbyists to
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.640]  hit counties and cities and rotary clubs and high schools and colleges they're
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.760]  sitting in Federal Reserve representatives like Herman Cain to tell
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.640]  you how great they are they know they're in trouble they've miscalculated it's
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.000]  us or them they're not given his quarter and as a man who loves my family as a
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.480]  man who loves liberty I must face them down will we defeat them this weekend

[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:58.040]  wants it the most is going to win it you have no excuses when they take over the
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.160]  opposition and raise your taxes and shut down more factories if you don't go out
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.840]  and identify the real enemy if you let George Soros the Democratic Party play
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.640]  the part of the opposition when they are Wall Street the corrupt elements of it
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.240]  and misdirected into austerity and new taxes to pay them government welfare and
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.240]  and banker bailouts you get what you deserve Neil Bortz is not going to tell

[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.280]  talk to Matt in Nebraska Matt thank you for holding thank you Alex how are you
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.560]  doing good sir welcome but hey I'm just a few things Omaha has a federal reserve
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.640]  branch and I would like to have had Nebraskans go out there and protest to
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.760]  help you with that in the Fed exactly there are campaign for Liberty groups
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.760]  everywhere there are libertarians and people that are aware of other world
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.840]  really works not dumb down Republicans or dumb down Democrats and it's time to
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.400]  reach out to those dumbed out groups I would send emails to all the liberal
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.280]  groups conservative groups everybody and just invite everyone say hey there's a
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.320]  demonstration against the Federal Reserve they're the real insiders that
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:17.560]  got all the bailout money they're the problem be there this you know Saturday
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.720]  afternoon pick a time be there and even if five people show up it will draw
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.400]  attention the local news media will come and we will start identifying the real
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.040]  issue but in many areas there's going to be hundreds of people and we need to
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.320]  continue the next weekend to demonstrate against them but I'm telling you I'm
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:41.240]  calling for the Dallas Fed if people believe in this to occupy it I don't
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.760]  mean even their private Federal Reserve property because even though they're
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.280]  criminals and even though they masquerade as a federal agency we don't
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.960]  want to you know disrespect property rights but there's a big sidewalk around
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.160]  it big park area around the Dallas Fed it's perfect it's time to occupy it
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.680]  occupy it and get thousands of people the Dallas Fed in fact the more I think
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.640]  about it that's the place for everybody to converge we'll do the
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.720]  substops as well but everybody needs to be there this Friday six o'clock Dallas
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:20.040]  Oklahoma Arkansas Kansas Missouri Mississippi Louisiana New Mexico
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.720]  wherever you are Colorado come to that Dallas event for two hours then I'm
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.480]  gonna get in the bus and drive to the next town to get at the media attention
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.360]  I'll be doing special transmissions at prisonplanet.tv it'll also be on the
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.520]  audio streams off and on from the road the entire weekend I do it the whole
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.480]  time but I've got to have IT people here to run it they got to have some time
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.360]  off I'll be all over the place I cannot stress how important is that then
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.200]  people stay there and if you get a few thousand people there and then folks
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.360]  agree to kind of rotate in and out it will get so much attention more people
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.280]  will show up and it'll go on for weeks occupy the Dallas Federal Reserve I'll
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.640]  guarantee you phones are ringing at the Pentagon phones are ringing at the
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.320]  White House right now this is scaring them Matt we need your help and then
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.440]  yes campaign for Liberty I haven't called them but if you're a campaign from
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:15.640]  Liberty contributor you should let them know what your thoughts are and I would
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.080]  imagine that's campaign for Liberty and Ron Paul has said we need to be
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.160]  protesting the Fed he said it on CNN and MSNBC and Fox in the last three days
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.800]  he's thinking the same way I am we have got to go after the real people and
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.680]  protest them not capitalism and private property rights as if that's what's
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.080]  making America fall apart insider corruption teamed up with government is
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.160]  what's allowing this so Dallas occupy the Fed I want to see thousands out there
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.560]  this is so exciting I need everybody's help sorry go ahead Matt
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.720]  hey another thing on people that think their first amendment not being taken
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:58.120]  away this may national headlines the Fremont Nebraska ACLU is getting
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.440]  involved they banned a sixth grader girl from wearing a rosary to school yes
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.060]  and now not just in that school but in others I mentioned it earlier there's
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:12.280]  saying the cross itself is not allowed because of separation of church and
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.760]  state but then they're gonna let any other religious group have their
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.840]  symbols it's just Christianity being targeted and that's your individual
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.400]  person it's part of your religion and now they're saying that I've seen the
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.520]  school handout they had it online this morning it's any necklace with a cross
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:32.560]  or beads on it well I mean so so now if gang members wear red baseball caps you
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.000]  can't wear those in public or now if gang members wear Reebok tennis shoes you
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.240]  or gang members drive black Mercedes you you can't drive black Mercedes this is
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:47.600]  all about making us all guilty and then can I make a comment about Bill Riley I
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.000]  know you talked about this for about five years that on star about traction
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.560]  and they they're taking a court after you even cancel the program yes it's
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:02.120]  funny how Bill Riley takes two minutes of fame and say he's the one who pulled
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.480]  the plug on on star and it was actually people like you and the other groups that
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.120]  support you and then everything else well we have more listeners and viewers
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.600]  than Bill O'Reilly conservatively ten million people watch us a week alone on
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.240]  YouTube that's one platform upwards of three million a day now on AM and FM
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.920]  serious XM and global shortwave and that's conservative three million a day
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:31.080]  over one million views on info wars and prison planet combined today you know top
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.160]  drudge links he's a legend in his own mind but I'm glad that Bill O'Reilly
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.360]  would actually do something good for a change instead of promoting value-added
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.920]  taxes and sales taxes and austerity and calling that conservative so I mean good
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.680]  letting take credit for exposing on-scarred good letting I don't care as
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.520]  long as they're not doing it we'll be right back we're on the March the

[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.840]  meaning meaning is it a trick question and I saw him start running around I
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.560]  went oh no I don't mind if you violate my fourth amendment things are casting
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.600]  she's like what are you doing I'm like I'm being sarcastic then I went and said
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:40.960]  oh you're valid before the amendment continues here I live in the UK and the
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.120]  cops here will back right off you start talking about your rights I personally
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.880]  think her approach was rather appropriate since if you started shouting at
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:51.600]  them getting in their face they would taze you and arrest you in front of
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.160]  your family they are not the real enemy anyways it's the illegitimate Bank of
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:59.040]  England the Federal Reserve not a few fluoride had ex-military police thugs
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.080]  out to hurt people and my experience is a lot of the military guys actually know
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.480]  what's going on I mean 75% of all military donations last election now
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.560]  76% this election are to Ron Paul so that really illustrates they more and
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.800]  more they know what's going on and my issue was their cover is the US citizen
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:23.840]  thing their cover is the US citizen issue they're really looking for drugs of
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.840]  cowboys that aren't paying their cut that's what government calls people that
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.480]  don't launder it through US banks they call them cowboys okay let's go back to
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:37.680]  your calls again thank you for holding let's go ahead here and talk to Alex in
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:46.440]  Washington Alex welcome Axel yeah hi Alex I like your show the did you see
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.280]  the front page drug report where six bucks is talking about you don't need
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.960]  five dollars to them and they're gonna send it to a fund where they loan it to
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:02.160]  small businesses no I didn't see the drugs report be specific well I mean I
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.360]  did see it but I didn't see the article you're talking about what specifically
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.800]  are they saying well the article was saying that the Starbucks is what
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:15.560]  they're gonna roll out his campaign November 1st to have but donate or ask
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.800]  people to donate five dollars to their foundation their foundation is then
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.160]  gonna take it and they're gonna loan it to or give it to financial institutions
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.080]  that way they can loan it small businesses the question that I have the
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.520]  comes up immediately on this as well so if it's a loan so who gets the five bucks
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.760]  when it gets paid back look it is look the the mega this is all just part of
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.840]  total disinformation but people are going to pile in to do this because yuppies
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.000]  believe in the system they believe in trendiness they like to call a small
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.960]  coffee at all they like to call a medium a grande they they like it and so it
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.200]  creates the illusion that big banks don't have money to loan small small
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.560]  companies big banks are more flush with liquid cash they've been sitting on the
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.040]  tens of trillions of bailout money and I haven't seen that report you guys print
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.600]  that Starbucks to take donations to give the banks to loan back I mean this
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.960]  sounds like classic globalist activity and then yeah then loan it back at
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:23.320]  interest when the banks are already getting at lower than 0% government
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.760]  taxpayer money I mean the banks are already getting our taxpayer money and
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.520]  then refusing to loan it out and now they're saying give money and then and
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.280]  then Starbucks this big globalist Illuminati company yeah there it is
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.880]  Starbucks to begin collecting donations to stimulate US job growth and sure
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.760]  enough it says well print that for me sure of it says give $5 to them or
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:55.320]  more and that it will create a bank to then loan it out oh I tell you that is
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.760]  just incredible jaren says he's printing it now but it was actually in my
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  economy stack I must have missed it earlier but sir what's your take on
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.800]  this well it first to me in the day you know if there's if people are concerned
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.040]  about about getting business getting businesses more money you know be be far
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.920]  more patient just walk into your local small business and give them five bucks
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:18.560]  it'd be much better to go buy their products it'd be much better to call to
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.520]  cut their taxes exactly that's the right it'd be far better off doing
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.200]  something like that than they would be donated it to to Starbucks to go to a
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.960]  foundation that's gonna just gonna give it to you know give it away in the form
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.240]  of a loan which just seems to reject it now but instead instead what they're
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:42.480]  doing is is the idea is oh a big mega corporation like slave bucks putting all
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.240]  these local businesses out a business engaging all this manipulation putting
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.120]  all this Illuminati symbolism all over everything they're gonna collect your
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.640]  money and then they'll have a bank loan it back to you when again the banks are
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:59.880]  refusing to loan to small businesses even when they have good credit and if
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:06.720]  they do it's at high interest rates this is asinine this is completely asinine and
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.880]  ridiculous and I cannot believe that this is actually happening
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.120]  you get something else but another thing on the on the Occupy the Federal Reserve
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:19.760]  the if there's not one area I was thinking about this what if everybody
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.360]  did what Herman Cain suggested on Friday is to call the Federal Reserve and
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.480]  asking a question there was this suggestion no no no you're being
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:32.680]  sarcastic now of course because they you know if you go on their property they
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.120]  have security guards come out and try to threaten you they try to say no cameras
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.360]  and then they'll try to put their hands on their guns and I'm going up there
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.280]  Friday and last time I was there they you know they were kissing our rump
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.520]  because they didn't want to get any attention on themselves in the media
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.160]  when you're by yourself though they'll try to intimidate you so it's gonna be a
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.640]  piece of cake with all of us there in solidarity but you're right we should
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.560]  start flooding all the Federal Reserve banks with daily phone calls letting
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.840]  them know that we're aware that they are the hijackers of the government that
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.320]  they are the enemy
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.600]  well I asked more than anyone asked me to define what a dollar is I mean Bernanke won't even define what a dollar is
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.720]  a dollar is apparently what dollar will buy well are you talking about a 1910
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.400]  dollar or is he talking about a dollar in 2011 it's the same issue I had with
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.960]  with with a Roseanne Barr when she said we'll put a salary cap on everybody
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.960]  a hundred million dollars oh what's a dollar I mean we even need to find that
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.520]  to define our terms yet so it is a hundred million dollars in 1910 that
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.840]  valuation or is a hundred million dollars valued today not only that I mean
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  you know it seems ridiculous to put a cap on on a CEO when they can have an
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:42.520]  expense account with a billion dollars a year and have a salary of a dollar a year
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:48.440]  I mean it just seems kind of like a you know kind of a fake
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.360]  look the big mega banks and the Warren Buffets and the Bill Gates is running
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.800]  around they've put their hundreds of billions in tax-free foundations where
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:04.000]  only the profit quote goes to the UN or to the sterilization program and so that
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.760]  then that makes their entire operation tax-free then they have profit through
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.400]  the subsidiaries it's all a giant money laundering operation that's hidden in
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.840]  plain view just like the Sherman any trust act if you actually study it
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.360]  created the illusion of competition but then of the 12 big oil companies the
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.560]  Rockefeller still owned 10 of them were actually able to jack up prices and so
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:28.400]  that's all they're doing they got Warren Buffett prancing around a guy that
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:34.160]  pays zero taxes saying who helped pass the loopholes where he is exempt saying
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.760]  it's not fair I don't pay any taxes past the Obama tax increase plan that hits
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.440]  the middle class I appreciate your call by the way now reading this this is a
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.560]  UN development fund type deal the Seattle based coffee chain is collaborating
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.480]  with Opportunity Finance Network a nonprofit that works directly with
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.520]  200 community development at financial institutions who provide loans to small
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.720]  businesses and the community groups now I'm going from memory here but I believe
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.280]  this is a group connected into the Soros group of foundations and that they give
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:12.920]  it to like sustainable groups and art groups it's another way they finance
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.320]  organizations that kind of put out globalist propaganda and so you'll have
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.760]  all these well-meaning Starbucks yuppies that are as dumb as the day is long I
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.200]  drink Starbucks sometimes folks and I can't sleep for two days or something
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.680]  in it I mean I can make any other coffee there's something going on with
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.360]  Starbucks coffee everybody knows that somebody needs to get that and have a
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.480]  high-tech lab analyze it let me call Paul Watson because he's the man for this
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:41.360]  job let's see if he let's see if he answers his phone here maybe I should
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:45.560]  dial him on air and get him on here a lot of times in the morning I'll have a
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.000]  brainstorm for about 20 minutes with Paul and I'm texting some points and he
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.400]  goes and does the research off my memory and his own research then we put out
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:44:01.600]  these great articles that he deploys hey Watson hey Watson hey have you seen
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.240]  this Starbucks at to begin collecting donations to stimulate US job growth CBS
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:15.440]  news report okay that's perfect timing I'm calling you live on air right now
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.280]  you're not on I called you on my globalist satellite tracker cancer unit
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.080]  which by the way they're now putting on the phones coming out in California that
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.560]  it can cause cancer they always tell you once it's ubiquitous once it's part of
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.720]  daily life once you're trained to drink for the poison waterhole the point is
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.680]  here I need you to check this fast as soon as you're done eating dinner I need
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.640]  yeah Paul six hours ahead viewers and listeners I need you to go check out
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.080]  this opportunity finance network non-profit that works with nearly 200
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.200]  community development financial institutions to provide loans to small
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.240]  businesses community groups I know Starbucks funds gun grabbers and UN
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.720]  stuff Paul and for students their buildings will eliminate symbolism I
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.440]  want you to go look into this because I believe this is tied into Soros grips
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.280]  and others we can get a big article out on this and I'm sure drudge within what
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:06.800]  probably like to supplement that with this article if not it doesn't matter our
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:12.560]  readers will see it so this is a very worthy article are you game for that or
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.680]  I don't need to give this to Nemo
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:21.360]  okay you understand look into the group and again this is where the stimulus
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.000]  only goes to select groups and they use the general public to do it you can also
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  point out the admissions that the last three years since the bailouts trillions
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.440]  have been sat on by the banks they've actually used it to not have to loan
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.480]  people for their normal profit centers and to shut down retail customer banking
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.080]  and to lay off hundreds of thousands of big bank employees so you to point out
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.560]  this is asinine that the banks are sitting on math tons of cash taxpayer
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:48.760]  money also you could point out Paul if they just cut small business taxes that
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:55.560]  would be a stimulus okay not that the mothership goddess of Starbucks with the
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.960]  two serpents up there lovingly giving us poison you know their their garbage
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.120]  almost said poison there's no poison it's good for you ladies and gentlemen

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.920]  out loud on the radio said if you ever wanted to torture me blah blah blah and
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:54.920]  I felt bad that you were telling your enemies your weakness well I think I was
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.240]  being sarcastic and they've ever wanted to torture me you put me in a room with
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.640]  Al Gore's voice and I was just being honest I mean the Globals are gonna do

[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:12.480]  to just commit and give it to God and I was saying I can't go to these family
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.640]  courts anymore back when I used to fight the CPS I still fight them on air
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.840]  because when the families cry and the cops and it's always the same weird type
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.000]  demonic judges get off on the pain and the crying and violate people's rights
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.680]  when they're when they're sucking that energy their actual psychic vampires it
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:35.960]  it tortures me and you know it's in between feelings of wanting to
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.880]  physically do something to them and and then having to crawl back to my car and
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.240]  cry in my car because watching the vampires eyes all lit up sucking up
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.920]  the pain I just I mean even thinking about it makes me want to throw up or
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.280]  turn the table over I heard that I got one other question for you we home
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.560]  school I have four children now we're homeschooling I have two that are grown
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.240]  up but I was wondering if you'd ever consider making a history series for
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.520]  homeschooling based on your point of view even though we homeschool it's hard
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.480]  to teach that is my wife's idea who homeschools a whole curriculum a whole
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.520]  nine yards and it would be a great idea the problem is she's been home
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.480]  schooling my children and doing a bunch of stuff to ever come up with a
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.800]  curricula she's also a great artist and that is my wife's idea and if I get
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.040]  enough support in here and get the TV system fully launched I do plan to
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.960]  actually try to put out some children's books that would obviously be a
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:36.440]  supplement to to what's happening there's a lot of great stuff out there
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:41.120]  yep man I just encourage people to get involved and hand out DVDs we just moved
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:47.200]  up here and I got on the medical marijuana which the long story for
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.600]  disability and stuff but anyway we got to talk in and I just started handing out
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.920]  DVDs there and I probably dropped off 20 the other day and they're just gonna
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:00.080]  hand them out to their customers and keep it going well one good way to wake
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.160]  up the millions of people that are on medical marijuana cancer survivors
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.080]  arthritis people Crohn's disease it really is a incredible drug
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:14.040]  absolute and that's why the big farm is trying to patent it and everything and
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.240]  they have come out with their own versions but it doesn't work as well as the
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.240]  natural plan I mean George Washington grew it and I've seen the copy of the
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.040]  letter in the National Archives you can look at these online where he talks
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.880]  about the Illuminati and things you can also look up his doctor prescriptions
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.600]  from to the apothecary where they told him to you know smoke this certain type
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:39.480]  of certain type of hemp that has the HTC THC whatever it is in it and you
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:46.800]  know for his two things but today George Washington would go to jail for smoking
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:50.400]  marijuana he was a member of al-Qaeda we'll be back with the Hank Williams

[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.120]  calls right now that I must blitz through a bunch of the news on the other
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.800]  side of this quick break I want to get into Hank Williams Jr. son Hank Williams
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.080]  the third who's contacted us so he's a listener it was like two years ago I got
[02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:44.680]  to dig his number out I guess he wanted to talk to me and then a producer talk
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.720]  to him and he's like well I just want you know I listen to show but I don't want
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.640]  to get political I don't know what that means the whole world is political and
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:55.240]  how was your dad not supposed to say he's mad at the whole government he's
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:59.600]  mad at Republicans and Democrats and then he didn't really call Obama Hitler
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.160]  he's saying it's like two polar opposites meeting and that's how he should
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.840]  extricate himself from this if that's what he meant by it that's what I believe
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:13.400]  because Obama is not like Hitler Obama is a puppet Hitler was not a puppet he
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  was positioned he was allowed to get into power the British intel liked it
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.960]  because they thought he was unstable but he was not a puppet and but I guess you
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:26.520]  could compare Obama's handlers to Nazis because they are for population
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:31.080]  reduction we got to dig through the emails and find that and I know somebody
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:34.320]  out there knows him maybe call shooter Jennings I bet he's got his number and
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.220]  try to get Hank Williams Jr. on to really flesh things out instead of telling
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:44.080]  TMZ which is a subsidiary basically a Fox television what he thinks about all
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.880]  of this I'm gonna be breaking that down coming up a little bit later because it
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:50.840]  deals with the whole First Amendment and chilling effects let's go ahead and
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.720]  talk to Tim in Wisconsin Tim thanks for holding welcome
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.080]  oh hey Alex I used to have to like an idea and stuff like that for you know Bank
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.080]  of America and TSA and then for NFL for boycotting all of them if you get a
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:08.360]  boycott list up on the website and stuff over the top 200 companies and then
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.360]  just maybe to make a video of you know like people like returning like so many
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.960]  to video or you did of just returning items you know NFL merchandise to Walmart
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.800]  or other corporations and because I'm sure those are taking notes that they're
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.040]  losing money I mean the message should be that we're not buying I'm gonna call
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.440]  right now in defense of the First Amendment and to stop this new red
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:30.320]  scare against people that are mad at the government Hank Williams Jr. clearly
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:33.040]  and we just played the clip said I don't like any of the Republicans or the
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.400]  Democrats and it and it and basically said and said it should be polar
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.520]  opposites for Republicans and Democrats to be meeting and they took that out of
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:45.360]  context even if he said Hitler so what and fired him from that job they say
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:48.880]  well that's free market the NFL gets government money government subsidies
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.000]  they got Janet Napolitano politicizing it it's now politicized they already
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.160]  politicized it so they can't go after Hank Williams Jr. for what he did and I
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.080]  want to get a hold of Hank Williams the third and see if he's been taken on a
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.480]  context too by TMC because you know he's here saying his dad doesn't have you
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:12.160]  know basically shouldn't speak because he's just a musician you know I know
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.720]  auto mechanics that are know a lot more than your average lawyer I mean I know
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:19.400]  military veterans that do it is it mean they shouldn't be able to speak
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.000]  musicians have a right to their views I'm friends with Jimmy Vaughn he's a
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  really smart guy and a musician Dave Mustaine's a musician super smart I
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.880]  happen to know Bob Dylan's very political and knows what's going on
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.520]  listen to his lyrics I mean I mean the bono is running around supporting
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.360]  carbon taxes and stuff he's bad news but it's still his right these are
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.640]  successful musicians and business people but everybody's got a right this idea
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.120]  that if you're a musician or that guy's a radio host who cares what he has to say
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:52.760]  well you know what I care what I have to say and in the and my idea should
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:59.600]  stand and fall on my ideas not on if I'm a ditch digger or if I'm a lawyer or if
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.000]  I'm a pastor or if I'm a school teacher or I'm black or I'm white or I'm old or
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.080]  I'm young and I agree send all the NFL crud back listen I don't toot our horn
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.680]  we had victories the Green Bay Packers came out in the newspaper last week and
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.120]  said we're not going to do the gropings because it's unpopular we've had a
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:21.320]  backlash we need to get all the NFL franchises to say they're not going to
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:27.600]  be part of this and we need to get the NFL to rehire Hank Williams Jr. what do
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.840]  you say to that? um yeah definitely because he was on for so many years and
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.480]  the stuff I know my girlfriend listen to Hank Williams a lot too and I listen to
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.520]  Country Boy can survive and stuff you know the time we back in the day my
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.840]  trains ain't when I was cruising around by the way Harman cue that up we come
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:44.120]  back we got to play some Hank Williams Jr. since he's now boycotted but I
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.800]  wonder if Hank Williams Jr. supported the Dixie Chicks when they came out
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.000]  against the war we ought to look that up but you know what even if he was wrong
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.560]  about that and I don't remember we should still support his free speech and I
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:02.880]  supported the Dixie Chicks then we'll be right back a very wealthy US citizen is

[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:43.800]  by the way I've got this article here out of TMZ Hank Williams Jr son my dad
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:50.040]  should not talk politics and Weldon who plays country music all over the country
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:54.120]  works here in my office he was telling me goes no he was saying you don't want
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.840]  to call shooter Jennings to get his number because I know we've had it
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.640]  before he said those two do not like each other we need to get more of that
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:07.800]  shooter Jennings music he made for us and we've got in that he authorized us to
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:11.840]  use in police state for me to play that as bumper music it's so good that summer
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:15.680]  raid we'll play some of that at the bottom of the hour really predicting a
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.320]  year ago what now is unfolding around the world this summer that's now gone into
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:27.880]  the fall I don't normally cover pop stories it's just Hank Williams Jr says
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.600]  he doesn't like Republicans or Democrats and his mad at them all and says that
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:35.520]  Republicans and Democrats meeting is like polar opposites Netanyahu and
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:42.160]  Hitler in his view that's polar opposites and then he gets kicked off the NFL
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.600]  there's gonna be a big backlash against the NFL because the NFL is an
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.640]  institution it's quasi-government now it's used for propaganda they got homeland
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.280]  security prancing around all the events groping people
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:59.960]  scaremongering running ads and I disagree with Hank Williams the third says he
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.840]  quote doesn't think his father should have opened his mouth about Obama yesterday
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:10.440]  telling TMZ most musicians are not worthy of political discussion I think
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.640]  everybody's worthy when we start trying to be political and be informed we could
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:17.560]  make that important again and not just be a bunch of people that barely pay
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:24.080]  attention to what's happening TMZ spokesman spoke with Hank Williams the
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:28.560]  third a punk rock meets country singer who tells us the only person out there
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:34.600]  worthy of mixing political views with music is Jell-O Biafra
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:40.840]  Jell-O Biafra is the original lead singer of the legendary punk rock band
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:44.920]  dead Kennedys who is now a big shot political figure in the Green Party as
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  TMZ previously reported Hank's dad's famous are you ready for some football
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:54.520]  jam was yanked for my foot ball last night after Hank Williams the second
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:59.840]  one on Fox is a proclaim that president Obama and Joe Biden are the enemy when
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:03.480]  he was asked Hank was the third about his political views he told us I'm a
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:10.240]  musician not a politician well I think we know your views since you've contacted
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:17.360]  us but I don't know what for what for look even if you supported that evil war
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:20.920]  and the lies about WMD is you shouldn't have called the boycott the Dixie
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:26.160]  chicks and take their music off the radio that was wrong the people that
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:29.640]  death-threaded Willie Nelson his family because he was gonna put on event with
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:38.080]  me and Jesse Ventura here in Austin that was wrong that's not how you win a
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.640]  political fight but that's what the establishment's gonna do and even if you
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.480]  disagree with Hank Williams Jr. you should support his right to say that
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:54.920]  this idea where you because pretty soon you start firing comedians for jokes
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:59.760]  which is now happening the aphelac guy you start getting rid of everybody pretty
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:04.600]  soon you start self-censoring and there can be no communication that's why so
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.320]  many companies and individuals are totally milk toast and it sends the
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.200]  message don't be involved don't say what you think or you'll lose your job we
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.080]  need to say what we think why the fellow reserve announcing in the news and

[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:47.680]  and they forced on the block of road the cops don't know why they were ordered
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:52.080]  to do that I know why because they want to have the left hijacked us just like
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:55.400]  the controlled right tried to hijack the Tea Party they haven't completely
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:01.080]  succeeded it's a fight going on about real issues Ron Paul is our main attack

[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:04.720]  stuff now out of the Occupy Wall Street group because now the people there
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:08.160]  are hearing what we're saying hey don't let George Soros take you over don't let

[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:52.760]  Occupy Wall Streeters out there that I want to remind everybody that the
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:58.160]  founding fathers they never marched on Main Street they weren't against Main
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:03.880]  Street and businesses they were against the Federal Reserve Bank or the
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:10.920]  Central Banks at that time I mean that's the whole point is you know it's the
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:15.960]  George Soros is and it's just basically the Federal Reserve is the same same
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:21.280]  central banking system same policy as I'm sure that they use back then that
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:26.420]  they're doing to us now and it just pisses me off that this Occupy Wall
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:29.760]  Street I'm glad to hear that that more people are waking up to it but they

[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:21.400]  your mind okay I'm going back to John and Oregon hearing a moments that can
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:25.160]  finish up his ideas for a list of demands but I want to show prison planet
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:30.240]  dot TV viewers these articles you can go to info wars.com and read all of these
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:34.040]  and go to drudge report.com he's got them all on the left hand side linked in
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:39.280]  red here's the big news it came out this morning email show top Justice
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:46.200]  Department officials knew of ATF gun program memos from 2010 shows some in
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.080]  senior positions were aware of tactics used in surveillance operation in which
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:54.440]  firearms were allowed into Mexico in a failed effort to catch drug cartel leaders
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:25:01.920]  here's my problem with this this was not a failed effort okay I've the real
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.560]  documents are in federal court in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune and the
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:10.160]  El Paso times and now the Houston Chronicle have all reported not in
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:12.560]  their headline but buried in the articles you can go read the court
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:16.080]  filings that the US government has admitted that Sena Loa for five and a
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:21.160]  half years was told since 2005 that they were allowed that's why the
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.960]  Republicans don't want to go there to ship cocaine into the US by the ATF FBI
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:32.720]  and DEA ton upon ton a month through Texas New Mexico and other areas one of
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:37.180]  the biggest drug cartels on the border and that they were given guns to knock
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:41.000]  out their competition 2,000 of them in one shipment this is not just companies
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.880]  allowed to sell them and told to that's part of it so there's a reason you don't
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:50.400]  see the congressman investigating this getting into this that's why they went
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:54.120]  after Bill Clinton for sex they don't want to go after him for Chinese generals
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:58.200]  and payoffs because they were involved Ken Starr was involved with companies
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:05.280]  with the Communist Chinese so I've been covering this for almost six years with
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.720]  Celica still and others who were former DEA telling you exactly what was about
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:14.160]  to happen Mexico the new war between the cartels and now I've got a lot of
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.640]  people sending me emails going to cover this more we broke it we covered it we
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:24.640]  went through it okay we've been on it since the beginning I first brought
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.160]  Celica still when he wasn't even known in Texas on air going back like eight
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.960]  years ago I sold out his book powder burns where he didn't have any more
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:37.120]  left I brought him to be in Kevin Booth film that aired on Showtime American
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.920]  Drug War okay I've been covering this for eight years six years ago Celi found
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:45.040]  out about this he's now they set him up ATF did put him in prison selling a few
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:50.200]  shotguns the point is is that this this goes to the Republicans as well and
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:57.280]  that's why they don't want to bring down Obama with this is because he can then
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:01.200]  bring up the fact that it's an Iran contra operation shipping guns into
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:05.520]  Honduras Nicaragua El Salvador Colombia that's all come out in federal court now
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:14.160]  into Chicago into Tampa into all over into Indiana into Indianapolis this is
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:20.040]  all come out now in the court filings show oh LA Times Pulitzer prize a CBS
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.600]  news oh my gosh they actually sold in the guns they're not telling you the
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.080]  other part of the cases it's drugs back in their arming drug cartels that
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.320]  laundered their money through Wacovia Wells Fargo and other fellow reserve
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:36.880]  banks this is an Iran contra just like the head of the New York Stock Exchange
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:40.920]  Richard Grasso in 1999 when he was the head was in Reuters a photo went and
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.440]  met with the head of the FARC and under U.S. law he's allowed to invest drug
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:48.320]  money internationally in U.S. banks and he said you will invest with us or we
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.200]  will invade they didn't do it so they sent us forces in and they only spray
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.760]  with GPS the coca-crops they don't control the cocaine now here's the big
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:03.200]  news it's up at info wars.com right now it's up at Drudge report House
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:08.760]  Republicans request special counsel to probe holder on fast and furious a
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:14.280]  special prosecutor and to make sure that nobody goes to jail it's just
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:18.400]  politically embarrassing and the drug dealing continues this goes back to Bush
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.000]  as well you want to kill the ATF politically once and for all you got
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.240]  admit the full scope you got to go after Obama you got to go for the
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:29.640]  Republicans all of them that's why the first thing Obama did was say he wouldn't
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:32.960]  investigate Bush when he got in first thing Bush did when he got him to say
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:35.760]  he wouldn't investigate Clinton first thing Clinton said he would do was he
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:42.240]  wouldn't investigate George Bush Sr. this is how the corruption works okay I
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:45.600]  want to go to this caller for the last minute of this segment so we can comment
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:49.360]  but exclusive House Republicans are calling for a special counsel to
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.800]  determine whether Attorney General Holder perjured himself during his
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:55.200]  testimony the House Judiciary Committee on Operation Fast and Furious they have
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.000]  emails they have him giving speeches two years ago about the operation in
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.040]  plain view he's been caught of course he perjured himself arrest him now he's the
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:09.120]  head criminal at that level let's go back to John and Oregon John what was
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:12.760]  your other list of demands when we occupy the Federal Reserve this weekend
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:16.360]  yeah well first like I said we're gonna audit the Fed we want them audit it

[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:32.200]  took from us but we don't just want it in their their C-node we want them in
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:36.920]  golden silver in a golden silver standard and by the way that would pay off
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:40.720]  all mortgages in America and give each American a giant cash dividend I'm not
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:45.720]  saying we should do that but we this is not our debt great points great points

[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:09.560]  preparing the police state crank it up I'm gonna show folks some news headlines
[02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:11.920]  here
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:25.040]  House Republicans request special counsel to probe holder on fast and furious
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:29.720]  but Bush was involved the documents admits in a low was given guns for five
[02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:33.600]  and a half years and we're allowed to ship in drugs to wage war against the
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.000]  other drug cartels who were shipping in too much and driving down the price of
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.200]  a loving white powder
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:45.920]  Papa Fed making money with the Federal Reserve off the cocaine heroin in
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:48.640]  marijuana
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:57.960]  meanwhile the UN is in Honduras mainstream news mass murdering villagers
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:13.040]  to get their property no I guess the police state isn't slowing down
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:17.160]  meanwhile tonight on the nightly news I even played at the very end of this
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:26.400]  radio show we've watched now the entire Hank Williams interview and he said
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:32.360]  Hank Williams Jr. said 89% of America people want to abolish Congress I hate
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:37.440]  both parties Wall Street they're a bunch of crooks on and on and on and they
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:45.160]  took that Hitler comment and said that and his statement that Boner and Obama
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:50.080]  and all of them are the enemy and they said oh he's calling Obama Hitler using
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:58.120]  that political correctness well that's some wild stuff right there at the end
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:02.160]  I think that's from the cremation of care scream I think it's what it sounded
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:13.920]  like but just to finish up what I was saying they are going after free speech
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:18.320]  so tonight the real reason the rest of the story of why Hank Williams Jr. was
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:23.120]  fired from 20 years of introduced and money night football which by the way
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:27.560]  that will hurt their ratings people love that they love little rituals and they
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:30.560]  love to have the good old boy you know officiate over things and the
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:36.080]  overalls so people are gonna get angry about that but the issue is this is this
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:38.840]  new political correctness where you can't criticize your corrupt government
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:42.840]  they they know the one message they won't put up with is it's a general
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.880]  indictment if it's on Obama or the Republicans that's fine you indict them
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:50.440]  all though and call them out that they work for the New World Order it's over
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:54.640]  so now I've really got to get a hold of Hank Williams Jr. I doubt he'll talk now
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.920]  though he'll probably be slapped down but who knows he might ignore it and you
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:03.120]  know I'm proud of him saying that the whole government's criminal and you know
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.480]  what I think I know that they reportedly are estranged but I think Hank Williams
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:12.880]  the third ought to support his father's free speech but maybe TMZ took it out of
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.440]  out of context and again this will affect us all just like the Dixie Chicks
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:21.320]  being slapped down their comments by the way I know folks have talked to them they
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:25.360]  know about 9-11 being an inside job but when I talked to the Dixie Chicks they
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:27.920]  said we've already had too much political problems we're staying out of it
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.760]  we're not gonna go public for 9-11 truth I know they live right here in Austin
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:35.600]  I know they listen to the show well you ought to go public you shouldn't let the
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:39.000]  people that slapped you down win and we shouldn't let them do this to Hank
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:46.160]  Williams Jr. You shouldn't be punished for your political views. All right I'm

[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:29.160]  in the country as I don't know close to 300,000 members last time I checked and
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:33.920]  he's the president of the American Small Business League he points out that the
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.520]  federal government violates federal law and he's gone over that and then later
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:44.920]  I'm gonna get the calls with like Maggie 1340 AM KOMI listener and XM listeners
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.200]  and others that are patiently sitting there we're gonna get to you as well
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:49.920]  I have to go into overdrive shortwave listeners we're gonna get to all of you
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:53.280]  but Lloyd Chapman has pointed out this is a big deal just like the government
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:57.600]  shipping drugs in guns out to kill their competition the government's a bunch of
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:00.080]  criminal mafia if you don't admit it they'll just keep expanding their
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.280]  criminal operation upwards of what he said 90 plus percent of small business
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:08.600]  contracts under law are supposed to go to small businesses with with you all
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.360]  this federal purchasing but instead it goes to offshore corporations and
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:18.640]  Fortune 100 and now our researchers have discovered Lloyd Chapman has
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:22.920]  discovered that they have a secret black list of American small businesses and so
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:26.440]  we hear all this talk of small businesses but we see insider Democrats
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:32.520]  giving you know 500 million million dollar free cash of taxpayers but none of
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.000]  it goes to Bill Jack squat it is a total handover fist looting and I wanted to
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.360]  get you on in the perspective of the Occupy Wall Street we got a bunch of
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:46.880]  kids funded by George Soros and Obama saying tax the middle class and shut
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.880]  down capitalism that's exactly what the big monopoly men want Lloyd absolutely
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:58.200]  people need to realize that our government runs on contributions from
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.880]  Fortune 500 firms and the K Street lobbyists run on contributions fortune
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:08.120]  500 firms our Congress our government our president they do not pass
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.200]  legislation to benefit the people they pass legislation to benefit the people
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.440]  that fund their campaigns like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan I love to see those
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.040]  kids protesting Wall Street hope they stay in there for a year there needs to
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:25.200]  be a million people on Wall Street I agree with you but they're the main
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:28.840]  demands that at least the media gives attention to the dominant horror media
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.840]  is increased taxes on the rich but the Warren Buffett plan goes up the middle
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:37.320]  class not the exempt offshore corporations and they're calling for
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:42.240]  Michael Moore is and others are dressing up like now say tongue you know
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:46.880]  running around saying off with their heads this is being Democratic Party run
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:52.120]  they're trying to co-op the opposition yeah you know it's it's it's funny
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.600]  something occurred to me every day I'm sure this occurred to you like five
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:02.360]  years ago but the very Fortune 500 firms that control our government also are the
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:08.080]  ones that run what percentage of the ads on national television 95% yeah so it's
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:12.440]  hard to get the truth on on on national television because those are the same
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:17.480]  guys you know that are making all the major contributions but people wouldn't
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:22.080]  believe how corrupt the government is people just wouldn't believe it and the
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:25.960]  things they're doing to the public are just you know my biggest problem is when
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:30.280]  I've talked to a journalist and I tell them I'll just read a report from an
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:35.360]  inspector general and they can't believe it they can't believe it so I'll
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:39.040]  actually just read a report for the inspector general and I'll be labeled a
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:42.160]  conspiracy not an alunitaker just reading what an inspector
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:49.020]  general said oh yeah the CIA and spectral general in 1997 found the CIA was
[02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:54.040]  running most the narcotics into the country through licensed cartels and if
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:57.320]  I talk about that today and even play the clips I'm a conspiracy theorist
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:03.920]  oh yeah showing the CIA admitting it yeah yeah I you know the government spends
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:06.840]  a lot of time and money trying to convince people I'm a conspiracy nut
[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:10.460]  in fact it's a truth Alex I've had six national television parents has
[02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:19.040]  canceled in the last 60 days and I've called my staff to call these the last
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:23.800]  one was the Lou dog show and I said call them up and ask them how did the
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.720]  government know I was supposed to be on your show so when you had a phone call
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:30.960]  from some government PR guys that open water in your show he's a conspiracy
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:34.600]  nut he's a lunatic how do they know I was gonna be on your show did you call
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:40.800]  them up and tell them I didn't how do they know and but yeah they do not want
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:43.440]  people like you and me you know tell them what's going on you mentioned Eric
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:48.320]  Holder by the way so anybody that's ever heard my name knows that for 20 years
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:53.000]  I've been winning lawsuits against the government and exposing hundreds of
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:59.040]  billions in fraud and abuse right Eric Holder is my number one enemy so if I
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:03.480]  if I'm trying to get information on billions in fraud I'm up against that
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:09.600]  guy and the Justice Department and they've done everything they can to
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:15.040]  withhold information that proves that companies like Finn Mechanica in Rome
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:21.120]  with 75,000 employees and 30 billion and assets are getting a quarter of a
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:25.120]  billion a year in federal small business contracts Eric Holder will stand in the
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:29.160]  door and not let you get that information well Eric Holder has been
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.040]  caught perjuring himself in public speeches he slipped up and admitted their
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:36.120]  fashion furious thing then he said he'd never heard of it now it's been
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:39.600]  confirmed in Congress it went all the way into the White House and but but
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.680]  again the Republicans can't really go after it because the gun running was
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:48.720]  going on under Bush too that's the big dirty secret if you read the Sena Loa
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:53.040]  drug documents in federal court they were authorized five and a half years ago
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.240]  to do this this predates Obama he expanded it and then also used it to
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:04.200]  demonize the Second Amendment so he went further but but this this this is
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:08.760]  systemic rotten corruption for those that don't understand explain to them
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:13.160]  the federal law that that if you're gonna have all this government contracts
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:17.400]  then it's got to go to small businesses but that's not what they do now so
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:22.200]  think about this people it's been shown by the Census Bureau and groups like the
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:28.560]  Kauffman Foundation that small businesses create between 90 and 100% of all net
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:35.880]  new jobs 100% federal law for about 55 years has said that a minimum of 23% of
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:38.520]  all government contracts should go to small businesses well that makes perfect
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:44.760]  sense particularly now since they create 100% of the jobs and there's been 15
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.040]  federal investigations not Lloyd Chapman the conspiracy net lunatic the SBA
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:53.680]  inspector general said this in 2005 quote one of the largest challenges
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:58.200]  facing the small business administration and the entire federal government
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:02.320]  today is that large businesses are getting federal small business contract
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:07.520]  awards and that's been named the same for five for six consecutive years the
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:10.680]  SBA inspector general has named that as the number one challenge so here we are
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:16.440]  the whole nation's going bankrupt we're trying to create jobs small businesses
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:20.960]  create 100% of the jobs and over 95% of all federal spending goes to fortune
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:25.240]  500 firms which conversely let's figure this out if small businesses are
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:28.680]  creating a hundred percent of net new jobs how many jobs are fortune 500
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.800]  corporations creating the truth is fortune 500 firms have been created one
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:39.320]  job in 30 years one net new job and yet 90 to 95 percent of our tax dollars go
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:42.600]  to those corporations even Dennis Kucinich said this this to be one of the
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.680]  occupy Wall Street groups that just like in China or India you know their
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:51.360]  government contracts have to be domestic they don't they don't deindustrialize
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:55.760]  they're trying to industrialize and even Dennis Kucinich came out a month ago
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.000]  and said the head of the president's economic council the former head of
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:03.360]  general electric is only creating jobs in India and China they're moving with
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:07.520]  the bailout money the factories the x-ray systems everything out of the
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.520]  nation it is the policy to deindustrialize this country to bring us to
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.560]  our knees that is what globalism is absolutely you know we're shocking to
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:20.400]  me I don't know this for fact somebody told me that the president of general
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:25.040]  electric that the company who shipping more jobs overseas in the company sat
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:28.600]  next to Michelle Obama when the president gave his job speech no he did
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:33.400]  no no no he comes out in lectures about American jobs while they're they're
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:37.840]  shutting down hundreds of power plants because if general electric doesn't own
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:41.920]  it or or if they even if you switch over to their service company that will
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.280]  upkeep your power plant and all of its scrubbers then you get the magic wand
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:51.000]  it's literally the mafia it's hire my cousin Luigi general electric hero
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:57.040]  you're shut down I mean they're that naked I mean these are hard core crooks
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:01.240]  absolutely here's something I want people to know
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.800]  President Obama gave his job speech on Thursday the first African American
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:12.240]  president history listen to this folks but Friday afternoon around 4 o'clock in
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:18.120]  DC the Obama administration very quietly and got zero press on it released a
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:24.520]  policy to abolish the oldest and most successful federal program to direct
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:28.120]  infrastructure spending minority on companies the 5% contract to go for
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:32.360]  minorities so one of the first black president and the first African American
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.720]  attorney general they were abolishing the oldest and most successful program to
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.400]  create jobs in minority communities coast-to-coast it was completely and
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:46.440]  totally unreported on nobody knows it wasn't picked up anywhere in the media
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:51.400]  I've had my guys on the phone for three weeks telling people about it and gosh
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.160]  another bill popped up you have they Sarah McCaskill popped up with bill
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.320]  every day that could potentially put around 500,000 small businesses and
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.080]  bankruptcy to work with the federal government it's it's it's shocking again
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:09.400]  it's so it's so different than what people think it is that it's just hard to
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:12.560]  believe people say well that can't be true that that just can't be true it's
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:19.720]  true well look the globalist went in in the 70s and they publicly told China let's
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.080]  select corporations use your slave labor we're going to move here and so these
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.760]  very same multinational corporations get laws passed and regulations to shut
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.280]  down regular commerce so they can move everything to China and India and Mexico
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:38.440]  and they've done it and they're not going to stop and because they want us
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:41.160]  poor I mean there's so many globalist documents we've read on air where they
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:45.400]  say they want you so poor you're busy just trying to get enough money to buy
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:50.120]  food so that you're not uppity they know people that are middle-class become
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:53.960]  politically active and they're getting rid of their ending America as we know
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:59.240]  it they're ending the American dream absolutely I want people to remember three
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.400]  things that Thomas Jefferson said he said every generation needs a new
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.360]  revolution he said all tyranny needs to get to gain a footholds for people of
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.720]  good conscience remain silent and my favorite phrase that should get the FBI
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:19.320]  knocking on my door he said that the Tree of Liberty needs to be watered from
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:25.120]  time to time with a bloat of patriots and tyrants is my kind of guy now now
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.960]  you've got hundreds of thousands of small businesses as members are they
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:33.480]  starting to get more and more angry you know what they're angry but they're
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.720]  afraid I'll have to tell you that the small businesses are afraid they're
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.560]  just afraid they're afraid you know the government is just they're terrified of
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:45.800]  government and that is why they fail government is gang raping us for their
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:51.800]  banker masters because we've been over and it's time to stop acting like it
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:56.960]  it's only encouraging folks your cowardice is what is encouraging all
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:02.200]  this it's what is allowing this it's what's bringing it there are limitless

[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:20.560]  junior really said he said the whole congress is criminal
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:24.400]  89 percent of american people you know when i'm all fired
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:29.120]  it's actually it's actually 91 percent now they only have a nine percent
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:31.760]  approval rating that's all coming up this evening that's something
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:34.960]  special for you on the nightly news seven o'clock
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:38.080]  i'm gonna do five minutes of overdrive here to take at least some of the calls
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:42.560]  that have been holding uh the longest here uh but just finishing up
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:48.000]  with the point that you were making in closing Lloyd Chapman of asbl.com
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:53.520]  that's the american small business league folks i i see citizens just shake
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:56.640]  in fear like i had the border patrol a hundred miles into the u.s.
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:59.360]  come over to say turn my camera off and i said no to him
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:03.120]  everybody's amazed i would just say no it's my first amendment and then i said
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.600]  no you're not gonna you know i'm gonna violate my fourth amendment come on the
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:10.800]  bus and then they backed off you know the point is is that is that we've
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:14.320]  gotten to this point where we have let criminals take over
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:18.080]  because we think of government as our master not as our servant and what did
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.320]  thomas jefferson say to keep quoting him when the government fears the people
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:25.840]  there is liberty when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:30.480]  and i think that's uh a good place to leave it uh final comment on that subject
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:33.360]  Lloyd Chapman you're an american hero buddy
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:39.200]  you're the new thomas jefferson i love your show you're you're one of
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:42.640]  a few people that's that's telling the truth i wish that you were on national
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:45.360]  television 24 hours a day seven days a week
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:48.960]  people need to hear what you've got to say well i'm not a i mean as you know my
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:51.440]  friend i'm not a hero you're not a hero we're just trying to survive here and
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:54.320]  doing the best we can ring on the alarm bell but
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:58.240]  but you know we are there's the prestige of being on national tv
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.080]  but we reached over 10 million a week just on youtube alone now
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:07.440]  and so there's that illusion that that you know we're the alternative media
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:11.920]  we are really the new media well let's just say this
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:17.200]  people need to quit being afraid quit being afraid these bozos work for you
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.960]  quit being afraid do something do something

[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.120]  hi alex jones it's great to talk to you a neighbor told me about your show and
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:28.960]  ever since i've been listening to you and the reason i'm calling
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:32.720]  is i saw you on the history channel the other night
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:36.720]  um and uh you were kayaking with the
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:40.160]  a small group of people who were attempting to
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:44.080]  enter the bohemian grove yes and the reason i was
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:51.520]  calling as i was curious as to um why um you know perhaps it wasn't done
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:55.040]  in in the dark or why the people that went up
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:58.560]  onto the property weren't wearing some kind of camouflage it just seemed like
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:02.480]  they were well it's a 2700 acre deal and everybody
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:07.440]  always tries to go in uh at night or through the front and
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.960]  there's mountains around it so there's one entrance that i told them about and
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:14.560]  then it's raining and the kayaks are tumping over with the cameras
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:17.760]  and we had to go from a launch point two miles away
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:21.040]  and then they didn't legally once they got arrested want to show all the
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:24.240]  footage but i told people when i spoke at
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.520]  Santa Cruz that it happened a day before i've been at the bohemian grove i had to
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:31.440]  jump off you know this the embankment into the water get to the
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:34.560]  you had to get in a kayak i had to hide on the side of the road there were cops
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:37.120]  everywhere i mean i had to literally rambo it out of

[02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:07.600]  jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:11.040]  all right maggie listening to us in central california and beautiful
[03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:15.280]  santa cruz was uh asking why we didn't sneak in at night
[03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:20.240]  look it's always easy to say you know you could have
[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:25.680]  done this could have done that um they got motion sensors they got night vision
[03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:30.000]  uh oh that was the thing the kayak company
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.640]  wouldn't let us get on the kayaks the kayak company they rented a tour in the
[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:38.400]  offseason while it was raining they wouldn't let us do it unless we wore
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:40.800]  quote raincoats because it was too cold we get
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:45.040]  hypothermia the raincoats did not work the water went through them
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.400]  they were bright colors and a lot of times you just deal with this ninnying
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:51.840]  bureaucracy and so that's the reason we were wearing bright colors but it
[03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:56.480]  didn't matter um because what happened was
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:00:59.920]  they were at a local theater shooting interviews with myself and others
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:04.800]  there was a lawyer there talking about how he did drum circles with george
[03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:07.760]  herbert walker bush i'd already confirmed through others and
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:11.920]  he was actually a guy even though he's a lawyer who volunteered to be a
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.520]  servant at the camp and he said oh i had to call it in on you right now i know
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:18.320]  you're going to the grove i heard him talking i said oh no we're not he
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:21.840]  said yeah yeah he goes i won't and i knew full well i told him i said that
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:25.280]  guy blew the whistle on us and i said they're
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:28.320]  going to be waiting they're like no they're not and i was like okay pal
[03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:31.680]  that was that decoded show so does that they already knew we were coming
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:34.800]  but so what you walk right into the trap to illustrate what's going on there
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.000]  uh i'm certainly wasn't going to get caught by him i got away
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.960]  and does that answer your question maggie well i just thought what was
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:44.800]  strange was after they were arrested and then released they seem to
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:48.960]  they seem to be um the people that were arrested and then released
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:52.800]  seem to then have an about face they were saying oh well doesn't seem to be
[03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:56.480]  like yeah they seem to be like us pilots shot down by the north koreans who
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:01:59.440]  suddenly sell you know say they love kim jong-il
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:02.720]  like if the condition of their release was that they would say that nothing
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:07.360]  was going on at bohemian grove yeah no they did uh
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:10.960]  basically pooped their pants over that whole deal i don't want to get into
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:14.640]  you you work with somebody on a project and they were even afraid to show my
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:18.720]  footage uh so they did artist renderings of it
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:22.320]  uh just just ridiculous i don't want to get into bashing melzer
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:26.160]  he's obviously whitewashing stuff whatever the fact that they have to cover
[03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:29.200]  it means we're winning i appreciate your call great points
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:34.800]  uh let's talk to elie or elah in wisconsin thanks for holding
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:40.800]  hello hi welcome okay i'm having like the worst problem of my entire life i'm
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:43.440]  sorry i'm trying not to be dramatic and i'm trying not to cry in front of my
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:49.440]  son so get me a second to hide um cps tried to take my kid today
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:53.600]  because he has a scar on his face he has this issue where he's like hyper so he
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:55.920]  jumps all over the place whatever it's not a big deal
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:59.920]  but the day that you know he just happened to hit like the pan that was in my
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:02.880]  hand and had water in it and it was hot and it got into space so he's got a
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:06.800]  scar this is like three weeks ago today i get a freaking phone call from cps
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:11.760]  saying to me that they're gonna take my child and you know just for questioning
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:15.040]  or whatever and just to take him out of custody for me and i'm like why
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:18.560]  because of the scar and it's part of protocol and i said no it's not part of
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:21.760]  protocol first off you're supposed to ask him
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:25.360]  put me in the present i'm sorry i'm trying to breathe

[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:29.360]  the sounds of anguish and pain and frustration
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:33.840]  is like pure torture but if you go to a vampire event
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:36.800]  with the i've been a lot of these family courts when i used to really fight this
[03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:40.880]  here locally back when i was just on local radio and on access tv
[03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:44.400]  and the special they have special cops assigned to it special cps special
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:48.960]  judges here it's like little fat nely weirdos and
[03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:53.680]  little potbelly pedophile types and always pretty much female judges with
[03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:58.480]  butch haircuts who usually have a whole string of kids they've taken from people
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:03.520]  uh themselves again i don't i'm gonna say this
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:06.320]  it's i don't even dislike gay people or hate them
[03:09:06.320 --> 03:09:10.080]  it's that i've been to these events and a lot of times it's the specialized
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:13.920]  homosexuals who are then collecting everybody's kids and and that run this
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:18.320]  and i so then it's like they're persecuting us and i'm tired of it
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:22.960]  i mean i've seen it here in austin uh where you'll see you know the you know
[03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:26.880]  law enforcement people with their wife uh you know they're both women and then
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:30.480]  they got a string of little kids they took and uh i don't i don't i'm just
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:33.600]  going to be honest about this because the kids come first okay
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.600]  and of all the you know that homosexual lobby attacks me i don't care
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.880]  just go right ahead uh and and it's other groups the big
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:44.960]  orphanage groups and dinecore is the biggest contractor nationwide running
[03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:49.120]  the child grabbing um now if you and i'm trying to
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:51.840]  freak this lady out i don't know the danger out there
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:57.680]  groups that fight cps i personally you know have had my kids jump around jump
[03:09:57.680 --> 03:10:03.600]  into things we all know they do um thank god my my son this weekend
[03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:06.880]  did it uh into something that broke and it didn't hurt him he jumped into a
[03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:09.360]  lamp and it broke and was glass all around and
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:12.800]  but but but see i know i know wealthy people whose daughter falls off a
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:17.280]  jungle gym and breaks their hand one case broke uh was a boy's thumb
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:20.880]  cps comes and tries to take him or says well just go to parenting classes and
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:24.000]  pay us money and get like get on get into probation with them
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:27.760]  so the vampires can have entry and kind of run a database of your kids and see
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:30.320]  you know some Saudi Arabian or something once your kid i'm not not
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.760]  kidding these are criminals and and they're some of them were abused
[03:10:35.760 --> 03:10:39.440]  so they think everybody's an abuser and they're going to punish parents
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:42.720]  they're they're they're training in school in in college i've shown the
[03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:48.320]  textbook says the family is evil uh needs to be gotten rid of others uh
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:52.160]  some of them are actually well-meaning but that's why cps has about a 56% you
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:56.400]  pull this up pull up more than 50 turn over in cps
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:00.240]  workers because the good people get in thinking they're going to help kids and
[03:11:00.240 --> 03:11:03.520]  like they had cps workers in new york go public about how they grab kids for
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:06.960]  medical experiments so the point is you can't have an
[03:11:06.960 --> 03:11:11.040]  evil government protect kids in these family courts because they're eugenics
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:13.600]  courts they're not real courts if somebody's beating their kid with a
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:16.800]  baseball bat that's assault the deadly weapon the cops are involved the
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:20.080]  neighbors see it the cops come you go to jail
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.280]  but see now it's moved into a thing of you know you're sitting there in the
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:26.400]  stove your kid jumps into you a little bit of thing it's always a little bit
[03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:29.680]  of a whatever and then they come and try to take your kid but i've seen far worse
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:34.000]  stuff you need to know when you go to the to the doctor
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:38.720]  when you go they're spying on you and if you type in groups that fight cps
[03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:41.440]  there's a lot of great tidbits i'm gonna go to her in a minute i'm kind of
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:45.200]  procrastinating because of the sound of her crying really there's not
[03:11:45.200 --> 03:11:48.400]  i start feeling like crying getting upset also i started having things
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:50.800]  flashed through my mind with these cps people
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:53.600]  that isn't good
[03:11:54.720 --> 03:11:58.080]  so i'm just not gonna you know women and children in distress gets me
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:01.520]  really going the wrong you know i just can't handle anymore
[03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:05.040]  we're gonna take country back though i take it back
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:09.200]  let's handle it that way now we can do a lot more good getting the word out
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:12.400]  right now okay i'm gonna get these people don't
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:15.920]  worry now continuing here you can get family rights dot us how to fight the
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:19.520]  cps just type in how to fight the cps or groups that
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:21.920]  fight the cps we get a lot of good groups out there
[03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:24.800]  like family rights there's some homeschool defense league people have
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:28.800]  had on and have the best info here's california homeschool.net
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:32.480]  they'll usually have it for your state you're up in wisconsin a very wicked
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:37.520]  nellie command base uh up there uh now i'm gonna go to you man i'm gonna go to
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:40.640]  you ellie you've got the floor don't cry
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:44.000]  just try not to tell us about your case where you are
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.880]  there's there's groups that fight this mainly victims out there
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:50.560]  there's lawyers that fight it they're gonna hear you and you can give out an
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:55.440]  email or something for folks uh now now now tell us what happened go ahead
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:13:01.760]  okay um so i'm sorry and so basically what happened was
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:06.160]  as i as soon as she says that i said to i was like so help me if you take my child
[03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:09.600]  so start the whole story start hold on then listen you don't want to talk to
[03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:12.640]  the vampires before you get a lawyer you don't get one of the local lawyers
[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:14.880]  they'll just suck money out of you and hand the kid over
[03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:18.320]  you're gonna have to settle down if they're gonna win the wolves want to get
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:21.760]  you off in a corner and have their way and even if you were quoted an abuser
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:25.600]  which you're probably not they're five times more likely to hurt your kids
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:29.920]  so the law of averages just get rid of the department of education department
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:33.520]  health and human services that has bounties in the the health departments
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:37.040]  they're all criminal groups set up a hundred years ago for eugenics
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:42.720]  start the whole story go ahead okay so like i said like my son he got like a
[03:13:42.720 --> 03:13:46.640]  scar on his face from like obviously a water burn or whatever
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:50.960]  and you know i remember my son coming back to me after you know
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:54.160]  school that day the day after he had that happen he tells me that the nurse is
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:56.320]  asking him a bunch of questions and i'm like well what did you tell him he was
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:13:58.560]  like well i told her i just didn't want to talk about it and i'm like josh you
[03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:04.160]  need to not do that you need to you need to tell them if something happened
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:07.840]  even if it wasn't um on purpose mommy didn't hurt you on purpose you still
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:10.640]  have to let them know and he's like okay
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:13.280]  and then am i supposed to ask you all right so the government training camp's
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:15.440]  got a quota the teachers send them to the
[03:14:15.440 --> 03:14:19.280]  Soviet nurse the injector lady the vaccine pusher
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:23.120]  the redland pusher uh and that's what they do in the schools now i mean i was
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:26.080]  like a school student aid as a senior because i had finished my
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:31.440]  finished my courses uh and uh she called me in and first kind of asked me
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:34.640]  if i wanted to date her when i got out of high school his middle age blonde and
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:37.040]  then she asked if i like riddling she said it's like speed it's a really great
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:40.480]  drug and i said no i run six miles a day lady you mean look at me
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:43.040]  and back then i looked like four or something i don't like what i look like
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:47.600]  today and uh uh so i mean certainly so so the so the
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:53.040]  school pusher was there uh and uh how old's your son
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:57.920]  he's only six yeah that's not good the younger when they're older you can have
[03:14:57.920 --> 03:15:00.480]  parents running chainsaws on them and they don't care
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:03.040]  it's the young ones but he's still not really little so
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:06.080]  that's a good thing there they'll probably just want to get some classes and
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:09.760]  suck some money out of you he's not blonde hair blue-eyed is he
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:14.320]  oh god no like he's well that's their favorites yeah they got they got
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:17.760]  they got pervs they like i'm not trying to scare you you seem to know that they
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:21.520]  there is a market now now now ma'am start over there so
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:26.720]  so so what happened then so the nely creature is a female or a male uh the
[03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:30.560]  cps person called you and it's it's a female the way
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:34.160]  she was talking to me over the phone it was really you know kind of aggressive
[03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:36.880]  or whatever she was she was wanting to freak you out well she was wanting to
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:40.960]  get some psychic blood so the vampire called what happened
[03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:45.280]  so um i like i mean i told her you know she did any
[03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:48.240]  things like take him out of that school she was gonna regret it i was gonna
[03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:52.000]  you know sue her or something so i drove up to the school as fast as i could
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:55.040]  to get him out of the classroom and i did and i freaked out the teacher and i
[03:15:55.040 --> 03:15:58.960]  tried not to get emotional but i don't know so i freaked out well i understand
[03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:01.360]  they've broken down the economy and you probably don't know if you have much
[03:16:01.360 --> 03:16:03.280]  money i don't know if you're a single mother
[03:16:03.280 --> 03:16:06.640]  but uh they like to have it where you're isolated and got to put them in a camp
[03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:09.920]  it's the government training camp your child would be better with no education
[03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:13.120]  than go into a government death camp now where they drink the fluoride and
[03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:16.080]  everything else they have the drills so you freak the teacher out she came in
[03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:19.120]  crying it's normal when you know a predatory group is coming for you
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:23.360]  this show is here to reinstill normal instincts and people but the so so so
[03:16:23.360 --> 03:16:27.680]  that's how the teacher please continue i said to our was like i'm not going to

[03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:20.640]  and he says to me and he's like why the police and the cps lady are here and i'm
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:23.760]  telling him what happened because in between by the way she called me the
[03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:26.880]  b word because um i you know you should record let

[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:42.240]  oh because i live there and my address is still live um is still at my dad's
[03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:45.600]  that's good you see that's why when you call to get a pizza they mark down with
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:48.560]  your name and credit card where you're really at they use that as their real
[03:18:48.560 --> 03:18:51.440]  database of where you're at so you hadn't ordered a pizza
[03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:55.200]  lately so they obviously didn't have your show show are they coming to get you
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:59.120]  right now this is what he says to me he was like well
[03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:03.360]  they need to um my dad tells me he was like well they want to find out how to
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:06.320]  meet with you because you're you know he was like
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:10.080]  because whatever happened they're trying to figure out about you know
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:14.960]  the skirt his face and whatever he was like whatever happened at the school
[03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:18.480]  when you say scars he just got a red wealth on his face
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:22.800]  huh he got a red wealth on his face no no he just has like a
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:26.480]  it looks like a like it literally you can tell you it was like a burn from
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:31.600]  water but what does it look like is it a scab what is it just colored
[03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:35.200]  yeah it's a little red spot it's like a red spot it's a red spot
[03:19:35.200 --> 03:19:38.640]  it was a red spot now it's healed up yeah well let's just stop right there
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:44.400]  um again we had a neighbors over um
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:49.040]  a few months ago and they invited a friend over and my son's got a birthmark
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:51.920]  and it's in liberals so-called liberals are the worst
[03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:55.360]  my son's got a birthmark on the side of his head and
[03:19:55.360 --> 03:19:58.320]  they always walk over and ignore the parent because again they'll also
[03:19:58.320 --> 03:20:03.280]  criticize you for having kids and uh it was a UT professor
[03:20:03.280 --> 03:20:09.040]  and she said oh what happened to your face and he said it's my birthmark and
[03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:12.240]  then she kept she goes is it really and she was kind of looking at me and I
[03:20:12.240 --> 03:20:15.680]  went yeah it's a birthmark and she's like oh it's their

[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:28.240]  again it's all about hatred of america hatred of families hatred of decency
[03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:33.360]  their rotten filth and uh again it's all about your
[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:38.240]  bad and it's this servile and they love it they have the hippies you know
[03:20:38.240 --> 03:20:42.400]  of internities little nazis and they love their bisphenol and their breast cancer

[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:31.440]  stove accidents you know that's why we don't even let them in the kitchen and
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:34.800]  keep the stuff on the back burners okay so he bumped into it no big deal
[03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:38.240]  i would i would get ahold of a family lawyer
[03:21:38.240 --> 03:21:41.840]  and i would just call the police themselves and say you're not you know
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:44.960]  i know they were coming to grab my kid and it's a normal response i know you
[03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:47.680]  have quotas and say i've contacted national radio the
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:51.920]  ellen shone show i would take photos of it
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:58.320]  and i would call a family a family lawyer you know you know like
[03:21:58.320 --> 03:22:03.520]  uh and i would check reviews of it so are they coming to your house right now
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:06.880]  well this is what that's what my what i was trying to say like my dad gave me
[03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:10.000]  the phone number to one of the police officers because my dad is kind of
[03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:13.520]  weird in this way he says to me he was like well he's a brother so
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:17.200]  as in he's black so you know you don't have to worry about you know
[03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:20.560]  you know anything happening over the phone so just call him so he doesn't
[03:22:20.560 --> 03:22:22.800]  send the warrant out on you and i'm thinking the back of my mind doesn't
[03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:26.320]  matter if he's black or white he's still going to screw me over he's
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:28.960]  working for another you know he's working
[03:22:28.960 --> 03:22:34.000]  for the lower hand it's like so so so your dad is is is black
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:38.320]  yeah i'm i'm black and my dad's black i mean like my child's biracial
[03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:42.320]  no i understand they really like to get black kids yeah no no black black
[03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:45.920]  black government enforcers feed on blacks it's it's like it's their
[03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:49.040]  cop black cops kill blacks for no reason all the time it's like a
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:51.840]  like they've proved they you know that they're in the system by doing that
[03:22:51.840 --> 03:22:55.040]  now this might be a nice guy too there's some black cops that understand
[03:22:55.040 --> 03:22:58.000]  there's some cops period to understand what's going on and seen been around
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:02.640]  these cps schools enough well i think you should settle down
[03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:05.680]  obviously you're right to come and get your son i think the fact that you
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:08.640]  rebuked the teacher but i understand getting emotional
[03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:12.320]  makes them want to prove something i would i don't think it hurts to call
[03:23:12.320 --> 03:23:15.520]  the cop and say listen i just know they were coming to get my
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:19.600]  son it was no big deal he didn't even scar him i wouldn't call it a scar
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:22.640]  you know it's a red welp because he bumped into you
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:26.960]  and uh say i don't want to meet with you guys someplace where you grab my son
[03:23:26.960 --> 03:23:30.400]  uh you know say i need to get a hold of representation
[03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:33.840]  and then i'll be happy to meet with you guys once i have a lawyer and just let
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:37.440]  him know that's fine and then i would i would go check into a hotel for a
[03:23:37.440 --> 03:23:39.440]  couple days just you don't have to worry about the
[03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:42.560]  stress worry about any of it tell them your son's out because of
[03:23:42.560 --> 03:23:45.680]  emotional distress of them trying to grab them and say you're just getting
[03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:48.800]  your lawyer and i would spend a lot of time reading on the websites and
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:50.960]  reading you know the different ways to handle them
[03:23:50.960 --> 03:23:54.480]  because i and then and then make a decision on what you're going uh to do
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:23:58.640]  yourself but i would type into the search engine
[03:23:58.640 --> 03:24:02.080]  here you know basically uh how to fight the cps
[03:24:02.080 --> 03:24:04.800]  and i would go and look at different ideas and see what you would do
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:08.640]  i personally just would have been cold with them
[03:24:08.640 --> 03:24:12.960]  i understand getting emotional and said oh it's no big deal yeah he bumped into
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:16.320]  me and then when the snake called i'd say well it's
[03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:21.600]  a little bit of red welp i mean uh you know um
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:25.680]  and then say okay well uh i need to get a lawyer then and
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:28.800]  you know i need to get you know some advice on that and great
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:31.280]  uh and and then say i'm like well i'll put him back at school but i don't want
[03:24:31.280 --> 03:24:35.200]  you grabbing him to get some verbal thing that now they'll lie and just it's
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:38.720]  not good it's better than groveling because there's
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:42.400]  so many people that'll grovel they can steal the kids and get cash bonuses
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:45.760]  they'll move on so it's really bad to grovel
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:49.360]  it's secondarily bad to really get hysterical because they'll feed off that
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:54.320]  too and and get upset it's best to be very cold with them
[03:24:54.320 --> 03:24:59.440]  okay and just be like listen to me that's the way to talk to him
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:02.480]  okay and say i know you got quotas i know you're you know a criminal
[03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:05.840]  organization it's good to let him know hey i know you're a crook
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:09.040]  and and and uh you know they're telling them you're gonna sue them that's
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:12.160]  always a nice thing because see they don't want to go after
[03:25:12.160 --> 03:25:16.400]  a water buffalo lions will only go after water buffalo they're starving
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:20.160]  the water buffalo will kill them sometimes they're powerful
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:24.720]  they want to go after a little ding ding or a little uh gazelle
[03:25:24.720 --> 03:25:29.120]  uh they want to go after something a little and juicy
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:32.880]  and so uh i would go ahead and call the cop
[03:25:32.880 --> 03:25:35.840]  and i mean does your dad not know where you live
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:39.120]  oh no my dad knows where i live he's just not gonna tell them he's not that
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:42.400]  type of person well that's good well listen listen listen listen i'm not
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:45.040]  gonna give you advice i would a pull out a dodge
[03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:47.920]  i would be call that cop and i'd call the cps lady and say
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:51.280]  look you may be a nice person i just heard about the horror stories with you
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:53.760]  guys i want to work this out you called me a
[03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:57.040]  bitch you're sorry for that even if she's not say you're sorry for that
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:00.720]  i'm sorry for getting upset let's work this out because
[03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:05.520]  she may not be a ghoul probably is but still even if they're a ghoul
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:09.200]  they'll tend to back off okay because you got your hackles up they want to move on
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:12.880]  to easier easier quarry they don't want to rob a house
[03:26:12.880 --> 03:26:16.640]  has got the lights on they know they know you got the lights on now
[03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:21.360]  okay and you just let them know uh that uh that um
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:25.360]  uh you know uh if they send you a sign thing that
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:29.760]  you can take them to a third party uh you know doctor i'll oh yeah that's what
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:33.840]  my dad would tell me to do go to a local physician yourself and say i wanted to
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:36.880]  get this checked out uh because my son a few days ago
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:39.680]  spilled water on it and the school was asking about it
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:44.480]  and and and uh i would like to uh you know you know uh
[03:26:44.480 --> 03:26:47.920]  you know get your take on it and then you can quote that doctor or whatever and
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:52.240]  then if you feel calm say well cps was calm the school wanted to have him
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:56.720]  examined will will you give me a report on just that calm get that done
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:00.160]  and and and then regardless you've got that and then you can go so i would go
[03:27:00.160 --> 03:27:02.640]  to a doctor a so you have a physician that's examining
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:06.640]  and say a physician is examining there's no problem that's always a nice little
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:10.000]  jiblet because they can claim that you know the child's an imminent danger
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:14.880]  and and and get a confiscation order and then i would contact the police officer
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:18.960]  and i and so anytime to get a lawyer and then and then you can meet maybe at the
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:23.520]  law firm or something how does that sound that sounds more realistic than what
[03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:27.280]  i was going to do yeah well i mean that's what i've
[03:27:27.280 --> 03:27:31.840]  done with my i mean uh hit gem class one of my uh secretaries one of my customer
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:36.080]  service people her daughter i saw it had a little bit of a little bit
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:41.200]  uh bruise been around for years really sweet little girl really nice you know
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:44.640]  mom and dad you know come to the company parties and stuff
[03:27:44.640 --> 03:27:48.400]  and they got a big quotas down in the county south austin
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:52.800]  i just were here in south austin so they live in haze county and they tried to
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:57.200]  they tried it cps couldn't get there that day but then they were calling saying
[03:27:57.200 --> 03:28:00.480]  meet us meet us and i told her drive by and sure enough they had the cops hide
[03:28:00.480 --> 03:28:03.680]  and they were gonna try to grab her so we went public on air made a big deal out
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:10.400]  of it made the newspaper and then we ended up i ended up having
[03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:14.880]  them meet at my lawyer's law firm i think i think i paid for it i don't
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:18.720]  remember the point is uh yeah i think i did a couple thousand
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:22.080]  the was a bunch of stuff going on and then they met at the lawyer
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:25.680]  and the lawyer said go get the doctor note and all this and i'm talking about
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:28.960]  a little bitty bruise i mean my kids have bruises on their knees you name it
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:33.040]  they're running around the woods this is illegal now in america now once they
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:36.480]  get your kid and hand them over best case scenario to a mill
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:39.360]  where they just warehouse them feed them two or three hot dogs a day and
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:43.840]  collect money and you know you usually they're drug heads i clean carpets for
[03:28:43.840 --> 03:28:48.000]  a summer that's why i'm like potheds send me emails going don't say it's potheds
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:51.600]  okay well i'd go to houses and there'd be like 10 kids in them
[03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:55.360]  living on dirty mattresses eating eating fast food they were lucky that looked
[03:28:55.360 --> 03:28:59.040]  to shovel and skinny there'd be some waddling pothead wandering around
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:03.920]  who was the foster parent with wafting marijuana smoke and because of that
[03:29:03.920 --> 03:29:07.440]  kids can drown in pools they don't get in trouble
[03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:10.640]  because it's the state and they're protecting themselves
[03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:14.640]  that's a best case scenario but you know the good news is even if they tried to
[03:29:14.640 --> 03:29:17.920]  say you were bad you can probably get the child put with your parents
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:20.960]  but some parents are lazy and don't want to take the kids
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:27.760]  you're going to be all right okay so uh you do what you think is best and and
