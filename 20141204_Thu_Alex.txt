[00:32.880 --> 00:37.560]  grand jury non indictments but the reactions of people we've got a story
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.800]  up on info wars right now left has gone insane saying that white Christmas is
[00:43.800 --> 00:49.720]  now racist they had actually had people tweet that out angry about the ceremony
[00:49.720 --> 00:53.520]  at Rockefeller Center where they lighted the Christmas tree and played white
[00:53.520 --> 00:56.840]  Christmas saying that that was racist that's a story up by Paul Joseph Watson
[00:56.840 --> 01:00.280]  and he's gonna be joining us in the second hour we're gonna talk about that
[01:00.280 --> 01:03.640]  we're also going to talk about another one of his stories up there cops
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.560]  celebrate the Garner decision also on Twitter it's amazing to see what what
[01:09.560 --> 01:13.120]  people really think it's it's kind of like looking at Twitter it's kind of
[01:13.120 --> 01:16.840]  like doing a man on the street you can really see what people think so you got
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.640]  some cops talking about it let's said let's celebrate let's kick some thug
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.480]  butt it's a euphemism that's not exactly what he said but that's another
[01:26.480 --> 01:29.360]  article from Paul so he's gonna be joining us in the second hour he's gonna
[01:29.360 --> 01:34.160]  be with us the second and third hour also joining us in the second hour is
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.520]  gonna be Lionel the talk show host he's based out of New York so interested to
[01:38.520 --> 01:42.440]  see what he's seen there as an eyewitness and of course he's a former
[01:42.440 --> 01:46.600]  prosecutor and defense attorney I want to also talk about what's going on with
[01:46.600 --> 01:51.360]  these grand jury indictments or non indictments that's something that I
[01:51.360 --> 01:56.160]  don't think really has been covered enough how the system is corrupt and
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.120]  working not to investigate itself I mean when you got the government
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.640]  investigating itself doing it in secret do you really think you're gonna get
[02:04.640 --> 02:10.080]  anything other than non indictments they've been training police and we see
[02:10.080 --> 02:15.000]  these several these recent incidents it's been rookie cops who have done the
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.440]  shooting they're along with a veteran cop but it's a rookie who comes out
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.720]  shooting the rookie with his gun drawn who shoots somebody without warning
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.200]  shoot somebody who's not armed we see this over and over again we've seen
[02:25.200 --> 02:30.480]  that in New Mexico they're actually training what in the state police
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.920]  academy we had a veteran instructor angry about the fact that they were
[02:34.920 --> 02:39.560]  teaching what he said was a shoot first curriculum this veteran police
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.240]  instructor at the police the state police academy called them out on it and
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.080]  basically they wouldn't do it he resigned or North he resigned where they fired
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.600]  him but basically he wouldn't do it the rules are changing they're changing the
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.120]  way they're teaching the cops and of course we've been covering the
[02:56.120 --> 02:59.200]  militarization of the police we see the equipment that they're giving them now
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.040]  of course Obama has come out with some prescriptions for correcting this and
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.840]  there you see that picture that was up in New Mexico and of course they got that
[03:07.840 --> 03:14.480]  on film and of course we got the filming of of mr. Garner who was just killed
[03:14.480 --> 03:19.000]  but you know the solution is going to be get more cameras no that's not the
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.080]  solution it's just going to that's not changing anything if you don't change
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.760]  how you're instructing them essentially the rules of engagement because they're
[03:27.760 --> 03:32.360]  being told they're working in a military environment if you don't change that
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.680]  mindset that they're out there if they don't that there's people who want to
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.240]  kill them and if they don't shoot first they're not going to come home to their
[03:40.240 --> 03:43.840]  families if you don't stop that if you don't stop the military mindset it
[03:43.840 --> 03:47.400]  isn't going to do any good to have the cameras out there but he's also come up
[03:47.400 --> 03:52.160]  with some other solutions we're going to take a look at the former police
[03:52.160 --> 03:55.600]  commissioner or maybe he still is a police commissioner in Philadelphia I
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.480]  think he is but anyway he's going to put him in charge of his task force on 21st
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.600]  century policing can you imagine what that task force is going to look like
[04:05.600 --> 04:11.120]  we're going to look at the background of this police chief it's not anybody that
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.920]  I would put in charge of it he has had a lot of problems a lot of problems in
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.880]  his department we're gonna look at that and of course Eric Holder is talking
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.640]  about it as simply being a racial issue he's promising now to end racial
[04:25.640 --> 04:31.240]  profiling once and for all see if they can turn it into that then we don't
[04:31.240 --> 04:34.880]  address the real problems that are here and of course we're going to talk about
[04:34.880 --> 04:39.440]  the manufactured racism of the left and we're going to talk about some good
[04:39.440 --> 04:44.320]  cops in Illinois of all places we're known for its corruption but some good
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.600]  cops I think they're outside of Chicago standing up to the corrupt police
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.440]  department they're demanding arrest quotas and we've seen that happen before
[04:52.440 --> 04:56.680]  with a whistleblower in New York stay with us we'll be right back

[08:31.320 --> 08:36.040]  strange news day today we've got an article up on info wars calm the left
[08:36.040 --> 08:41.160]  has gone insane saying white Christmas is now racist that was a tweet from
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.760]  somebody angry about the ceremony yesterday in New York at Rockefeller
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.880]  Center of course in the wake of the non indictment of the officer who murdered
[08:52.880 --> 08:58.640]  Eric Garner and I say murdered it is definitely a homicide I'm not the one
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.040]  saying that by myself of course that was the coroner said that but the grand
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.480]  jury did not return an indictment so we're gonna look at that we're gonna
[09:05.480 --> 09:10.600]  look at people's reaction we're going to look at real racism manufactured
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.720]  racism not just from people on Twitter talking about how white privilege is on
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.560]  display here but we're also going to talk about the manufactured racism of
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.840]  Eric Holder and Obama and we're also going to talk about Obama's proposed
[09:26.840 --> 09:33.080]  solutions his non solutions of getting more cameras hey they recorded what
[09:33.080 --> 09:36.680]  happened there that didn't do any good they recorded what happened when the
[09:36.680 --> 09:41.000]  homeless man was shot in the hills outside of Albuquerque they recorded the
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.400]  homeless man being shot by eight police officers shooting 49 shots at him from
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.880]  a distance he was unarmed we've seen these recordings we've seen them ad nauseam
[09:50.880 --> 09:56.080]  we've seen the video that went viral over a million views this is what happens
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.240]  when you call the cops we've got that linked up on info wars from a couple of
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.120]  days ago we've seen it it just makes us angry because they're not doing anything
[10:05.120 --> 10:08.640]  about it but of course that's what's the police are being trained for in the
[10:08.640 --> 10:11.920]  police academies but we're also going to talk about some good cops we're going
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.680]  to talk about some honest cops in Illinois like I said of all places you
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.520]  wouldn't really expect that suing their police department because they've been
[10:20.520 --> 10:25.520]  given arrest quotas told to arrest people even without probable cause we've
[10:25.520 --> 10:30.280]  seen that happen in New York in the case of Adrian Schoolcraft he recorded the
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.680]  police there for a long time he wore a mic because he knew that was what was
[10:34.680 --> 10:41.280]  happening there a great whistleblower he was told on occasions to go out and
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.760]  arrest people on Halloween he said they they told them to go out and just pick
[10:45.760 --> 10:50.040]  up the first three to five people that they get bring them back we'll work out
[10:50.040 --> 10:52.560]  the charges later don't stick around and do the paperwork and then go out and
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.960]  get another three to five he's got recordings of them saying that you want
[10:56.960 --> 11:00.040]  to talk about recordings he's got recordings of them saying that what are
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.000]  they doing about it well when they found out that he was recording these arrest
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.520]  quotas these illegal actions that he would they were giving oh and there's
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.240]  another thing I'm going to tell you to Adrian Schoolcraft pointed out that they
[11:13.240 --> 11:20.680]  were covering up serious crime meanwhile going after people really hard on small
[11:20.680 --> 11:25.560]  minor variations things like we just saw with the Eric Garner case you know
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.240]  when you got bankers who steal billions of dollars from people and they get
[11:31.240 --> 11:35.560]  interest-free loans yet you got one guy with a penny crime selling some loose
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.320]  cigarettes and he gets killed on the streets see that's what was has been
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.320]  going on for a very long time in the city of New York that's what Adrian
[11:44.320 --> 11:47.960]  Schoolcraft was primarily showing he was showing that when people would report a
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.000]  rape or car theft they didn't want those serious crime statistics to show up
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.960]  they wanted to show that crime was going down you know Giuliani bragged about
[11:56.960 --> 12:00.280]  that you know he's getting serious crime down well the way they did it was they
[12:00.280 --> 12:03.720]  would show up and they would say your car really wasn't stolen don't you remember
[12:03.720 --> 12:09.920]  that you had a cousin who you loaned it to because if you file this as a car
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.320]  theft you're going to be tied up you can lose a lot of work you got a lot of
[12:13.320 --> 12:16.560]  paperwork to do they would tell that to rape victims they would say you're going
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.040]  to have to go to court you're gonna have to relive all this stuff your
[12:20.040 --> 12:24.120]  reputation is going to be publicly roined you don't really want to say
[12:24.120 --> 12:27.160]  this is a rape do you don't you want to change your story and not report this as
[12:27.160 --> 12:32.080]  a rape but then when it came to petty violations you got too much hair on the
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.120]  floor of your barbershop they would hit those people with a couple hundred
[12:36.120 --> 12:40.600]  dollar fines that's the city of New York that's Giuliani's New York that's
[12:40.600 --> 12:44.280]  Bloomberg's New York that's Blasio's New York that's been New York for a long
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.880]  time that's what's really behind that's a big part of what's behind this but of
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.720]  course there are police brutality issues there's excessive use of force
[12:52.720 --> 12:55.840]  issues they need to be rained down we've got another story from Paul Joseph
[12:55.840 --> 13:00.080]  Watson cops celebrate on Twitter the Garner decision let's say let's kick
[13:00.080 --> 13:03.560]  some thug I'll say but because I can't say what they actually said down there
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.920]  in the air that's what we see them celebrating on Twitter just as we see
[13:08.920 --> 13:12.600]  some other tweets saying white Christmas is now racist this is the kind of
[13:12.600 --> 13:18.120]  insanity that is coming out of this the kind of the way that people are
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.200]  accusing upsides and we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson those two
[13:22.200 --> 13:27.120]  stories are both his as I said in the first segment when you look at Twitter
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.560]  it's kind of like doing a man on the street survey you can see some amazing
[13:31.560 --> 13:35.400]  things and both of those stories that Paul has up there are about Twitter he's
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.360]  going to be joining us in the second hour and of course we want to get your
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.040]  comments as well and I don't want to ignore what's going on with the legal
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.360]  system with the grand jury this is not a trial let's understand this a grand jury
[13:49.360 --> 13:57.920]  hearing is not a trial it has a jury but it has only the prosecutor and as
[13:57.920 --> 14:01.840]  Judge Napolitano said if you don't get an indictment it's because you don't
[14:01.840 --> 14:05.520]  want an indictment many people have been saying this of course there's the
[14:05.520 --> 14:08.680]  expression that everybody uses when they start talking about grand juries they
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.000]  say you can indict a ham sandwich with a grand jury it's a very low standard of
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.520]  proof to take it to a trial and of course it's only being controlled by the
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.480]  prosecutor so if the prosecutor controls what the jury sees and it's
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.560]  not an adversarial situation that's the key thing another key thing is that it
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.400]  is not public they're using these grand juries as a beard for not taking these
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.840]  things to trial for not talking about what's going on there they don't want
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.120]  people to see that so they do this secretly as there was an article that
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.320]  was from Breitbart and I gotta say it was on the most sycophantic articles
[14:50.320 --> 14:56.600]  I've ever seen for the system it's by Ben Shapiro one thing though that he has
[14:56.600 --> 15:00.280]  in here that's correct he says the charges first of all is vital to note
[15:00.280 --> 15:03.200]  that nobody knows exactly what the charges filed with a grand jury were
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.280]  against the police officer according to ABC News the charges could have included
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.760]  second-degree manslaughter criminally negligent homicide felony assault
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.560]  reckless endangerment yeah you know what we don't even know what they were
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.440]  coming at for charges that's the point whenever I've contacted district
[15:19.440 --> 15:22.520]  attorneys to try to get information on cases I've been told by district
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.960]  attorneys this is a grand jury situation those records are sealed we're not going
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.840]  to put them out what the guy did in Ferguson the prosecutor in Ferguson
[15:30.840 --> 15:36.480]  dead is very very unusual to make that public and of course he did it as a
[15:36.480 --> 15:40.280]  document dump thousands of pages and people are starting to go through that
[15:40.280 --> 15:44.400]  and there's a crowd sourcing investigation to see what happened and we
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.480]  in retrospect look at that and we find some very amazing things that have come
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.040]  out things like the fact that the police show up and they don't bother to record
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.040]  any of his initial statements the officer who was supposed to be doing
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.840]  that said yeah yeah my recorder was out of batteries I didn't have a pen that
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.560]  wrote and you know I just can't remember because there was just so many
[16:04.560 --> 16:07.920]  important things going on wasn't important to take the statement of the
[16:07.920 --> 16:10.960]  police officer and of course they talk about how whenever they show up on a
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.520]  crime their assumption is that a police officer has been attacked and is the
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.400]  victim that's their assumption when they go to a grand jury that is still the
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.080]  same assumption that the police officer is the one who's innocent that's why you
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.040]  don't see indictments let me tell you grand jury is the last year they took
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.800]  statistics in 2010 they had 162,000 grand jury cases you know how many did
[16:32.800 --> 16:39.680]  not turn and then return an indictment 11 11 that means when you go before a
[16:39.680 --> 16:45.520]  grand jury you got about a 99.9999% chance of getting indicted if they take
[16:45.520 --> 16:49.400]  you before a grand jury because they control the prosecutor controls the
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.160]  entire process if they don't indict you it's because they don't want to indict
[16:53.160 --> 16:57.400]  you when you look at the Darren Wilson thing any defense attorney that isn't
[16:57.400 --> 17:01.160]  absolutely convinced that the police are on his side is not going to let his
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.920]  client testify at all at a grand jury situation he can't even be present the
[17:05.920 --> 17:09.560]  defense attorney can't even be present he can't object to anything that the
[17:09.560 --> 17:14.600]  prosecutor is saying to his client and everything is going to be on the record
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.480]  you talk about waving your Miranda rights yet Darren Wilson was allowed to
[17:19.480 --> 17:23.920]  go into this grand jury and talk for over four hours because he wasn't the one on
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.320]  trial it was Michael Brown who was the one on trial and that's the way they
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.600]  look at this so we're going to talk a little bit about that about people's
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.840]  reactions to it we're also going to have Joe Biggs joining us in the next
[17:33.840 --> 17:36.080]  segment he's going to join us in the segment before the bottom of the hour
[17:36.080 --> 17:41.360]  because one of the stories that's come up is a story about Michael Hastings as
[17:41.360 --> 17:47.120]  resurfaced again we see some emails within the FBI that have been released
[17:47.120 --> 17:51.320]  because of a FOIA request and we see that they're talking about how they can put
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.960]  down these conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.440]  and of course that's how Joe Biggs essentially got hooked up with info
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.280]  wars initially and as part of that investigation because he didn't want to
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.040]  take the mainstream media's lies on that he was very angry about what had
[18:10.040 --> 18:13.320]  happened he didn't believe it we didn't believe it we interviewed him he made
[18:13.320 --> 18:19.400]  some public comments on some other shows and you know Joe wants to get to the
[18:19.400 --> 18:22.880]  bottom of things he wants to get to the truth and he isn't going to take some
[18:22.880 --> 18:28.760]  improbable impossible explanations for stuff and neither are we that's why Joe
[18:28.760 --> 18:33.360]  is here that's why we're here so he's going to talk to us for the five-minute
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.960]  segment before the bottom of the break we're going to take your calls we're
[18:37.960 --> 18:40.760]  going to get your opinion I want to know what you think about these
[18:40.760 --> 18:45.240]  situations in New York and in Ferguson and of course we've got a lot of other
[18:45.240 --> 18:49.000]  stories that are coming out before we get to the serious news though there's a
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.440]  story that was on Drudge a couple of stories one about the hundred missing
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.480]  brains in Texas we have at the University of Texas they had a hundred
[18:59.480 --> 19:03.320]  brains go missing and we've done man on the streets there and I was just
[19:03.320 --> 19:06.840]  surprised that it was only a hundred brains that are missing because I've
[19:06.840 --> 19:10.120]  gone down there to do man on the streets it seems like there's a lot of missing
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.200]  brains but these are brains that were actually stored in bottles and they've
[19:14.200 --> 19:20.200]  now found they believe that they were destroyed about a decade ago interesting
[19:20.200 --> 19:27.120]  another article that was on Drudge mice implanted with human brain cells become
[19:27.120 --> 19:32.680]  smarter it's just like I this would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous they're
[19:32.680 --> 19:37.000]  creating chimeras they're putting human cells in the mice of brains and no this
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.680]  isn't pinky and the brain you know you thinking what I'm thinking if you're
[19:41.680 --> 19:47.200]  thinking that this is a way to unleash really dangerous chimeras of this kind
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.120]  of genetic experiments that's what I'm thinking I would be right back we're
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.480]  taking your calls and Joe Biggs is going to join us to talk about Michael

[24:20.480 --> 24:24.920]  I'm David Knight your host today and with me in studio is Joe Biggs our
[24:24.920 --> 24:28.960]  reporter who joined us really got in touch with us because of the Michael
[24:28.960 --> 24:33.320]  Hastings investigation we were looking at this now we've got a story saying that
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.880]  the emails that were released as part of a forward request showed the FBI was
[24:37.880 --> 24:43.160]  working to debunk quote conspiracy theories now of course the entire the
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.600]  term conspiracy theory is something that was created by the FBI to shut down
[24:47.600 --> 24:52.600]  investigations and questions about the official story about the JFK assassination
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.440]  and we had some real questions about this Michael Hastings death from the
[24:57.440 --> 25:01.920]  get-go as we were just talking about I immediately knew when I looked at this
[25:01.920 --> 25:07.720]  and saw the pictures of the engine down the road at a right angle to where the
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.920]  tree the car had crashed into the tree I knew that that didn't happen from it
[25:12.920 --> 25:17.040]  crashing in the tree when you crash a car into a tree the engine is not going
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.200]  to be ejected 150 feet or 200 feet or whatever down the road it's going to be
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.440]  captured into the car and you could also see that the fire was contained to the
[25:25.440 --> 25:31.280]  front of the car it did not involve the rear of the the car and I did a lot of
[25:31.280 --> 25:35.400]  research about car accidents after that specifically because of that because it's
[25:35.400 --> 25:39.400]  it's something of a urban legend that Hollywood has we drive a car off a
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.800]  cliff and it immediately explodes that doesn't happen unless it's a rear end
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.120]  collision and the gas tank is ruptured and that gas tank the rear end of that
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.120]  car was still even then though I mean I've actually shot a car you know being
[25:52.120 --> 25:58.720]  in combat and shot gas things before and watch them explode it blows up and the
[25:58.720 --> 26:02.920]  fire isn't even that bad it takes hours to get to the point where yes what
[26:02.920 --> 26:06.520]  happened in the Hastings crash now you gotta think there he's traveling down
[26:06.520 --> 26:09.880]  you know his direction of path so there's a few things that happen he's
[26:09.880 --> 26:13.040]  traveling and you see a flash of light then you see the lights and the vehicle
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.620]  go out mm-hmm so that's where there's an explosion yes you see the flash so at
[26:18.620 --> 26:21.960]  that point that's where the engines ejected exactly and that's what came
[26:21.960 --> 26:24.840]  out eventually we saw that but I'm saying on the very first night when you
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.200]  see that engine down there's like something is wrong exactly and we knew
[26:28.200 --> 26:32.120]  that he had made a lot of enemies in Afghanistan when you were talking to him
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.640]  and with McChrystal who is you know the guy in the general in charge there so
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.920]  we knew he had a lot of powerful air force one as well when he was doing
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.760]  the panic 2012 book about the Obama campaign so he had a lot of enemies in
[26:48.760 --> 26:53.320]  high places and this happens and then we learned that he was at WikiLeaks said
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.720]  that he was being investigated and so it just one thing after the others you
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.560]  start to look at it it all starts to unravel the physical evidence then the
[27:01.560 --> 27:05.560]  video that surfaces then the emails that surface but talk about we were just
[27:05.560 --> 27:10.680]  before we came back on it just before well we had the break you were talking
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.640]  about the unusual aspects of this FOIA request and investigation so when you
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.840]  when you submit a FOIA request there's a few things that happen for this one they
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.600]  were the original FOIA FOIA requests were based off of the media chatter hey
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.040]  you know because of the email that I had released and all that was he being
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.720]  investigated by the FBI and maybe that's the reason why he was leaving at such
[27:34.720 --> 27:37.640]  high speeds in the middle of the night or early morning however you want to look
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.160]  at it and when you submit a FOIA request like that they're supposed to come back
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.360]  with a confirm or deny as to whether or not they're investigating that individual
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.640]  well this didn't happen in this case for some reason they flat out said no they
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.000]  were not looking into Michael Hastings so that in itself is very unusual that's
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.760]  something that doesn't happen it's like I said it's a confirm or deny so like I
[28:00.760 --> 28:04.480]  said they flat out said no we're not but then a year later they came out and
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.360]  said well actually we were looking at Michael Hastings for what they called
[28:09.360 --> 28:15.480]  controversial reporting in his Rolling Stone article about the Bo Bergdahl the
[28:15.480 --> 28:20.440]  last American prisoner of war so you know it just goes to show you that they
[28:20.440 --> 28:23.920]  were so quick to say no we have nothing to do with this and now they're trying
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.480]  to scramble around apparently and debunk these conspiracy theories well it's
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.600]  them in a flat out lie we always look at this we're not conspiracy theorists we
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.400]  are skeptics who investigate the official story or any story that people
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.600]  have and we ought to come to these things with a healthy dose of skepticism
[28:42.600 --> 28:45.240]  that's really the only kind of objectivity that you can really have if
[28:45.240 --> 28:48.440]  you're investigating a murderer as a police detective you don't want to come
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.920]  in and say well I was told by his wife that such-and-such happens I'm not
[28:53.920 --> 28:58.240]  going to investigate her she's above investigation yeah so I mean we look at
[28:58.240 --> 29:00.880]  this we immediately see there's something wrong with it then we see things start
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.600]  to to surface the fact that WikiLeaks says that he had contacted them we hear
[29:06.600 --> 29:10.880]  testimony that he was concerned that he was being followed he is looking under
[29:10.880 --> 29:16.400]  his car for bombs his landlady said we see a lot of things like this start to
[29:16.400 --> 29:19.600]  surface fact that he sent out communications to people that he
[29:19.600 --> 29:22.880]  worked with and said I'm going to be gone for quite some time I mean it was
[29:22.880 --> 29:27.840]  really really I mean I had a deep gut feeling that something was up you know
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.200]  and they come out and they're like DMT DMT this is what it is drug results show
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.440]  that there's DMT in the system yeah okay look I you know you're that has
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.960]  nothing to do with an engine shooting out of the absolutely absolutely it was
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.600]  phony thank you so much Joe we're gonna be right back with your calls 800 259

[33:39.840 --> 33:43.560]  gonna be joined in the next hour paul joseph watson he's been looking at
[33:43.560 --> 33:48.520]  reactions to the eric garner non indictment that didn't happen the police
[33:48.520 --> 33:53.280]  officer was not indicted for the death of eric garner the man who is choked to
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.080]  death or who they caused to have a heart attack because he was selling
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.360]  single cigarettes on the sidewalk something that new york city is very
[34:03.360 --> 34:08.600]  serious about getting their taxes and of course harassing petty crime that they
[34:08.600 --> 34:12.880]  can get revenue out of letting the serious crime go that was a story of
[34:12.880 --> 34:18.840]  adrian schoolcraft a new york city cop and i talked about what he did recording
[34:18.840 --> 34:22.000]  the police for a couple years let me tell you what they did when they found
[34:22.000 --> 34:29.600]  out about it as we see so often it's not the person who exposes when illegal
[34:29.600 --> 34:33.560]  activity is exposed by a whistleblower they don't arrest the people who were
[34:33.560 --> 34:37.240]  conducting the illegal activities we see over and over again though they arrest
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.120]  the whistleblower in this case they came to his apartment i think it was a
[34:42.120 --> 34:46.840]  second in command at the new york city police department they told him they
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.280]  were very concerned that he seemed suicidal and for his own protection they
[34:52.280 --> 34:58.040]  were going to put him in an insane asylum and he recorded this he was wired in
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.400]  his own apartment recording that and they of course knew that he had been
[35:02.400 --> 35:04.880]  recording him so they found that recording what they didn't find was a
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.840]  recorder that he'd put on the shelf he had actually a second one his father
[35:08.840 --> 35:14.320]  was a retired cop and when he went missing because they took him and put
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.800]  him into an insane asylum he was there for several days before his father the
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.080]  retired cop was able to find him he began a large lawsuit in the city of
[35:23.080 --> 35:30.400]  new york and he was a key witness in the stop and frisk cases and hearings that
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.240]  were going on with the new york city police department would just stop people
[35:34.240 --> 35:39.520]  on the street and frisked them for no apparent reason for no probable cause now
[35:39.520 --> 35:43.840]  we're going to look at some good cops they've had some besides adrian school
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.200]  craft we've had several cops actually file suit in illinois we're gonna talk
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.560]  about that story saying that their police department was essentially telling
[35:52.560 --> 35:56.360]  them to do the same thing that the new york city police department was just go
[35:56.360 --> 36:01.880]  out and arrest people for to get your your quotas up and they said we don't
[36:01.880 --> 36:05.600]  want to arrest people without probable cause so we're going to talk about that
[36:05.600 --> 36:09.920]  I also want to get your reactions to things and of course we're gonna have
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.840]  as I said Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the next hour before I go to your

[37:41.760 --> 37:45.680]  but first I want to just hit some of the high points some of the headlines of
[37:45.680 --> 37:48.480]  some of the other articles we're going to talk about later on in the show we
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.400]  have Texas has filed is as part of a 17 state lawsuit challenging Obama's
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.720]  unconstitutional amnesty executive action and of course our governor elect is
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.840]  the current attorney general Greg Abbott he has sued the federal government over
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.640]  a lot of illegal activity and it's been a target-rich environment actually under
[38:08.640 --> 38:14.400]  the Obama administration he's leading that lawsuit and Texas is so it'll be
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.320]  interesting to see what happens with that also Obama he got caught a couple of
[38:19.320 --> 38:22.760]  days ago saying as who's getting heckled he was trying to pull it back you
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.280]  obviously got flustered and he said to the demonstrators who are heckling him
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.800]  because he hadn't done enough for illegal aliens he goes hey I changed the
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.760]  law for y'all I changed the law for you get that I changed the law it said 22
[38:37.760 --> 38:40.920]  times hey we don't live in a dictatorship by we got a constitution I
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.240]  just can't arbitrarily change the law that's not how the country works but
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.920]  then when he's under pressure with some hecklers he said hey I changed the law
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.080]  for you now he's trying to walk that back he says well you know he was just
[38:52.080 --> 38:57.480]  speaking colloquially when he admitted to violating the Constitution acting as
[38:57.480 --> 39:02.120]  a dictator this is something that has been building under Republicans as well
[39:02.120 --> 39:06.720]  as Democrats and I say Republicans are even more guilty about it because they
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.400]  keep telling us that they're going to do something about it and their opposition
[39:10.400 --> 39:13.680]  lasted all of five minutes after the election as they're pointing out
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.800]  yesterday they didn't do anything about it yet the only thing they did when they
[39:18.800 --> 39:22.120]  came back after the election before they left again for Thanksgiving holidays
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.600]  was to pass the Keystone Pipeline for the ninth time and I've probably said that
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.080]  on air nine times I'll keep saying it because they know the Keystone Pipeline
[39:31.080 --> 39:34.460]  legislation they passed was never going to go past this in it and of course the
[39:34.460 --> 39:38.800]  president would have vetoed it and yet they tell us they can't do an
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.680]  impeachment for all the criminal illegal activities of the Obama
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.120]  administration all they need is one of them all they need is using the IRS
[39:48.120 --> 39:53.200]  against political enemies doing it at a scale and a scope that Richard Nixon
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.280]  never even conceived of from what we can see in the impeachment articles there
[39:57.280 --> 40:00.680]  he wasn't accused that I'm sure he probably could have conceived of it he
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.920]  had some pretty dark thoughts I'm sure but he never did anything the scope and
[40:05.920 --> 40:10.560]  the scale of what Obama has done and of course he has people all the way down
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.440]  the government covering that up with the Justice Department talked about
[40:15.440 --> 40:21.000]  whistleblowers not getting going to jail when the criminals don't we had a
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.440]  great interview last night I'm not sure when it's going to air is either gonna
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.120]  air tomorrow or Saturday or Monday because if it airs tomorrow it's gonna
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.880]  go on YouTube on Saturday that's really a bad time to release an important
[40:32.880 --> 40:37.240]  interview like this but I talked to a fellow who was on the ground floor with
[40:37.240 --> 40:43.000]  the savings and loan investigations of Greg Morse he did investigations about
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.600]  the banking scandal found the largest tax evasion case in history and this is
[40:47.600 --> 40:54.360]  not tax avoidance this is tax evasion criminal tax evasion now he also found
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.880]  of course the largest securities exchange securities fraud situation he's
[40:58.880 --> 41:03.520]  reported both of those to the IRS to the SEC doesn't apparently appear to be any
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.080]  interest from them not surprisingly and of course the Justice Department doesn't
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.280]  think they have any jurisdiction in that it's interesting because the biggest
[41:12.280 --> 41:20.400]  IRS whistleblower who got eventually a 104 million dollar whistleblower fee for
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.320]  exposing tax evasion from the IRS before he got that he spent two or three
[41:25.320 --> 41:31.880]  years in jail he reported tax evasion using the Swiss Bank UBS and the Swiss
[41:31.880 --> 41:38.080]  banking system in general it caused a massive change in tax issues and it
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.360]  caused them to get a lot of revenue but before they treated him as a whistleblower
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.560]  the Department of Justice Eric Holder's Department of Justice sent him to jail
[41:47.560 --> 41:52.320]  yeah he exposed criminal activity and only the whistleblower goes to jail
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.520]  none of the bankers ever went to jail even after they completed the
[41:56.520 --> 42:00.920]  investigation found these guys guilty none of the rich and powerful none of the
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.400]  criminal bankers did it now this interview is interesting because this
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.560]  interview actually is not just a historical expose of wrongdoing it
[42:08.560 --> 42:14.800]  shows what is actually still going on how they are using this money into
[42:14.800 --> 42:18.840]  channeling it into black operations that are going to be funding taking down
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.960]  other governments funding terrorism funding drugs that sort of thing it's
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.880]  really like the Iran Contra scandal except instead of being funded by
[42:27.880 --> 42:33.040]  illegal weapons sales to Iran instead of being funded by crack cocaine their
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.760]  black operations are being funded by stealing your mortgage and the thing I
[42:37.760 --> 42:42.200]  like about the interview is that he gives you something to do for free that I
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.280]  think could have a big impact on this so that interview look for that interview
[42:47.280 --> 42:50.040]  it's going to be coming up in the next couple of days now I want to go to your
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.120]  calls but as I said I wanted to cover just briefly some of the other headlines
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.440]  that are here besides the amnesty issue we've also got a story we're going to
[42:57.440 --> 43:00.480]  talk about later about the CPS confiscating children after a family
[43:00.480 --> 43:06.200]  chooses home birth we also have an anti fluoride campaign going on in Dallas I
[43:06.200 --> 43:11.360]  like the slogan get the f out of Dallas this is something we interviewed again
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.760]  on the nightly news that Leanne McAdoo talked to the person who was doing an
[43:14.760 --> 43:18.840]  indiegogo campaign to fund the advertising to educate people about
[43:18.840 --> 43:24.720]  fluoride and listen if fluoride is medication that is safe and effective
[43:24.720 --> 43:30.640]  then why would you put it in the water supply if you don't control the dosage
[43:30.640 --> 43:35.120]  of something that is safe and effective in a controlled dosage if you don't have
[43:35.120 --> 43:38.480]  any control over the dosage if you're dumping it in the water supply you don't
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.800]  have any control over the dosage that people are getting a baby is going to
[43:41.800 --> 43:46.680]  get the same dosage that a fully grown man will get you see the problem there
[43:46.680 --> 43:50.880]  if it's safe and effective to start with once you dump it into the water
[43:50.880 --> 43:55.320]  supply it is no longer safe and effective and they point out of course
[43:55.320 --> 43:59.440]  that it is not safe and effective as they point out in the ad campaign they
[43:59.440 --> 44:03.840]  say why do people have to wear hazmat suits when they handle fluoride it's so
[44:03.840 --> 44:08.800]  corrosive it eats through concrete we showed that we went to the Austin power
[44:08.800 --> 44:14.520]  the Austin water supply we actually took some people at I wasn't with them in
[44:14.520 --> 44:18.280]  fours of the time they took video of the corrosion on the pipes they took video
[44:18.280 --> 44:23.840]  the fact that it was a class for toxin out of four classes they say if you're
[44:23.840 --> 44:26.840]  warned to call poison control when you swallow your toothpaste why is it still
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.160]  added to the water that we drink that we cook with that we shower with and why
[44:31.160 --> 44:35.680]  are we spending in Dallas alone a million dollars to do this and we've had
[44:35.680 --> 44:39.520]  study after study from Harvard and other places showing that it lowers IQ that
[44:39.520 --> 44:43.720]  it increases the risk of cancer yet we're spending millions of dollars to get
[44:43.720 --> 44:49.800]  rid of corporate toxic waste that's how we're used by the big corporations they
[44:49.800 --> 44:54.440]  would have to pay a lot of money to get rid of this toxic waste or they can
[44:54.440 --> 45:00.040]  sell it to us for a lot of money and have us drink it that's what they're doing
[45:00.040 --> 45:05.720]  we also have some reactions from Giuliani and from Rand Paul but I want to
[45:05.720 --> 45:08.680]  get your reactions right now we've got some callers that are on the line let's
[45:08.680 --> 45:17.280]  go to Kyle in Utah Kyle hello Kyle hello Dave how are you doing doing good
[45:17.280 --> 45:22.600]  I'll get right to the point I'm actually calling about a different article I think
[45:22.600 --> 45:28.840]  was linked on drudge about the Utah public transfer of public land act mm-hmm
[45:28.840 --> 45:35.600]  and and the rep ivory said that the deadline I guess the deadlines coming
[45:35.600 --> 45:40.560]  up is December 31st and that they're going to move forward and use all the
[45:40.560 --> 45:48.040]  resources at our disposal quote what is your take on this I think it's the
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.440]  first I know that Arizona passed a similar act is this the first time this
[45:52.440 --> 45:58.920]  is going to be attempted and and what do you think these these resources they're
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.240]  clearly they're clearly moving the ball here on this and of course part of the
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.920]  problem out west and this is an issue at the Bundy Ranch we had people who were
[46:06.920 --> 46:11.400]  from local governments in Utah that had shown up to talk about this very issue
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.120]  there were several issues going on at the Bundy Ranch what got us involved was
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.680]  again the excessive use of force the police brutality but there was also an
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.080]  underlying issue that caused this conflict in the first place and that was
[46:24.080 --> 46:29.120]  the fact that most of the land was being what is owned out west by the federal
[46:29.120 --> 46:32.880]  government and what they were doing with the land what Harry Reid and others do
[46:32.880 --> 46:38.280]  with the land is they're now putting it to investment use telling people that
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.200]  they have to protect the desert tortoise specifically in Nevada and yet setting
[46:42.200 --> 46:47.600]  up a lot of projects natural resource exploration in terms of mining working
[46:47.600 --> 46:53.960]  with crony capitalism partners in terms of setting up large solar systems so
[46:53.960 --> 46:56.800]  this is where it's happening they're treating this public land and they're
[46:56.800 --> 47:01.000]  going to treat it as their personal fiefdom they will use it and they will
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.120]  keep you off of it that's what the people the Bundy Ranch said they said
[47:04.120 --> 47:07.440]  we've been here and our ancestors have been here since even before it was a
[47:07.440 --> 47:12.280]  state we've always had access to this land particularly that land they had a
[47:12.280 --> 47:16.240]  lot of cattle there they used to be over 50 ranchers in just that one area Bundy
[47:16.240 --> 47:21.280]  was the last guy there and they said when they come in they're going to do
[47:21.280 --> 47:26.080]  what they've done in every other park and we I saw this in September when I
[47:26.080 --> 47:31.280]  went to Yellowstone they brag about the fact that they've only give you access
[47:31.280 --> 47:36.600]  to 1% of the park that the 99% of the park is off access to you and they said
[47:36.600 --> 47:38.960]  this is what's going to happen to the public it's not going to be public land
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.320]  they are going to put a couple of trails in it put some trails around the
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.840]  perimeter of it and it will be off-limit to the public but they will use it for
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.680]  their own purposes they will use it for their corrupt games that they play with
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.160]  crony capitalist that they can trade influence and trade projects with it's
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.320]  a very serious thing and we need to roll this back and look at how we got into
[48:02.320 --> 48:07.920]  that situation why wasn't that land turned over to the people as it should
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.960]  have been why was it kept by the federal government because places like Utah and
[48:10.960 --> 48:13.360]  other states that were out west they were originally territories as they
[48:13.360 --> 48:18.040]  became states that land should have been turned over to the people it wasn't
[48:18.040 --> 48:21.000]  turned over to the people the federal government retained ownership and now
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.720]  we see what they're doing they're not good stewards at the same time in Nevada
[48:25.720 --> 48:28.240]  that they were talking about protecting the desert tortoise of course they had
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.480]  I think it was 1200 of them that they had euthanized at their center because they
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.080]  didn't have the funds to feed them or whatever their excuse was but they're
[48:37.080 --> 48:43.680]  using these issues of endangered species to in many cases that's the basis on
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.720]  which they want to do this but yeah it's a very serious issue it is a big grab of
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.200]  authority just as we see the FCC trying to extend its authority and ushering in
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.720]  internet censorship and of course that's one of the articles we're going to talk
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.240]  to Paul Joseph Watson about in the next hour we see Obama official is meeting
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.600]  with a Chinese internet censorship czar there's a lot of ways that we see the
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.280]  federal government moving to take control of the internet in the same way
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.840]  that the EPA or the Bureau of Land Management is trying to take control of
[49:11.840 --> 49:17.080]  the land out west and exercise a more rigid exclusive control that of course
[49:17.080 --> 49:21.000]  it all plays into agenda 21 that's the end game if you want to know where all
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.680]  this is headed it means that they're going to concentrate all of us into
[49:24.680 --> 49:28.920]  very small areas high concentration areas we will not be allowed into those
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.080]  areas whatsoever let's move on to we've got somebody with us an ex cop in

[50:17.200 --> 50:23.880]  little worse now I was an ex cop in the 80s and the late 80s and the reason why
[50:23.880 --> 50:30.360]  I got out I spent like two years in which one I got out because I saw so much
[50:30.360 --> 50:38.080]  abuse of regular citizen not doing anything wrong there is there is a

[54:27.480 --> 54:31.880]  Lionel it'll be interesting to talk to him because he is a lawyer a former
[54:31.880 --> 54:35.200]  prosecutor and defense attorney I want to talk to him about some of the issues
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.880]  involved in these grand juries as well as he's in New York I want to see what
[54:39.880 --> 54:45.360]  he's seen the last day or so in terms of reactions but he'll be with us as well
[54:45.360 --> 54:48.600]  as Paul Joseph Watson right now we're getting your reactions and of course
[54:48.600 --> 54:52.520]  we'll take some more calls after Lionel leaves us in the third hour when I'm
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.680]  here with Paul Joseph Watson we'll take some more of your calls but I was
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.960]  talking before the break to an ex cop from Maryland who called in I want to
[55:00.960 --> 55:04.400]  get back to his phone call but just want to point out up on the dredge report
[55:04.400 --> 55:09.080]  right now the top story new dawn China's world China is now the world's biggest
[55:09.080 --> 55:12.720]  economy and they point out this is the first time this has happened since US
[55:12.720 --> 55:19.000]  Grant was president that disparity is going to continue to grow just recently
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.920]  Obama went to China and what did he agree to well he agreed to decline energy
[55:24.920 --> 55:30.800]  output in the United States by 26% over the next 11 years China meanwhile will
[55:30.800 --> 55:37.720]  not decline but will cap their energy output in 16 years they will be allowed
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.920]  to continue to grow there's no restraints nobody is worried about global warming
[55:41.920 --> 55:47.520]  it seems if the global warming if the global pollution is coming from China
[55:47.520 --> 55:53.240]  they're not concerned about that there's only American factories American
[55:53.240 --> 55:59.760]  power plants American automobiles that can contribute to global pollution you
[55:59.760 --> 56:03.240]  understand how this is being used the same way they're using racism of course
[56:03.240 --> 56:07.400]  we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about how they're manufacturing
[56:07.400 --> 56:10.040]  racism I guess that's about the only thing we're manufacturing anymore in
[56:10.040 --> 56:16.360]  this country is government regulations and racism but let's go back to X-cop in
[56:16.360 --> 56:20.720]  Maryland we had to go to our break X-cop but you said you were there for two
[56:20.720 --> 56:26.320]  years and you left because you were concerned about the excessive use of
[56:26.320 --> 56:37.160]  force that you saw yes mr. Knight I am I was I saw a lot of abuse and just on
[56:37.160 --> 56:43.000]  by the way I like that I like the way you said manufactured racism that is so
[56:43.000 --> 56:49.640]  true I happened to be an African-American and I tell you then from a
[56:49.640 --> 56:58.320]  perspective of African-American ex-police more conservative on the
[56:58.320 --> 57:04.880]  conservative side I get I get flack from believe me a lot of African-Americans
[57:04.880 --> 57:11.200]  more can more African-American than on per se all I white people but let me go
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.240]  back to let me ask you a question about that because Giuliani when he was on
[57:15.240 --> 57:18.680]  making his remarks one of the things that he pointed out he says if I recall
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.560]  there was an African-American sergeant on the scene when Eric Garner was killed
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.000]  in charge of the entire situation and never did anything to stop you know
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.640]  that's what I've been saying when I look at Obama saying we're going to get we're
[57:32.640 --> 57:36.080]  going to get racial quotas here we're gonna stop racial profiling but we're
[57:36.080 --> 57:38.600]  gonna get more black police do you think that's gonna solve the problem are
[57:38.600 --> 57:41.640]  they gonna see themselves are they gonna identify with the black community or
[57:41.640 --> 57:47.320]  they're gonna identify as being part of the blue community in your opinion no
[57:47.320 --> 58:01.440]  okay um in my opinion I've seen I've seen a lot of black police officers do a
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.680]  lot of heinous things against black people too mm-hmm so I don't think that's
[58:06.680 --> 58:17.760]  gonna do a lot of things that it's a systemic problem mm-hmm in that when
[58:17.760 --> 58:26.040]  police are allowed to and I and I'm my ex-cop and when please hang on say say
[58:26.040 --> 58:28.200]  with me right after the break we're gonna take a quick break we're gonna be
[58:28.200 --> 58:31.000]  right back I want to get a little bit more from but I do want to get to some
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  other callers that we've got on the line we're also going to have Paul Joseph

[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.000]  today we're gonna be joined in the next segment by paul Joseph Watson from
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.120]  london as well as by lionel the talk show host who comes out of new york he
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.560]  also has a background in law so we'll talk to him about some of these grand
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.320]  jury indictments right now I've got a caller who called in an ex cop from
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.400]  maryland as we were just talking before we had to go to break you were saying
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:53.480]  that your black officer you've seen a lot of black officers abusing people and
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.360]  the in the public general public and as I was reading this quote from juliani
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.640]  that's essentially what he said he said there was a an african-american
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.760]  sergeant on the scene and the entire time did not do anything to stop so
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.920]  obviously he didn't have a problem with what was going on I think it's boils down
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.960]  to training you you were a cop back in the 80s you said don't don't you get a
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.960]  sense that they're being trained in a very different way than people were 30
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:25.800]  years ago yes definitely and and and the caliber of police officers and had
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.960]  like devolved into something like really bizarre but some of the things that I
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.360]  saw with some of the things that I heard were were from other police officers
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.800]  you're a new pair of shoes speaking to the residents in a poor urban area
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.680]  where I work they would tell the people hey you're just a new pair of shoes for
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.680]  my kid because what happens is that if you make an arrest and hearing this
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.720]  hearing this she's just just made me irate because I'm I'd start at college
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.680]  last in my junior year and then join the police office police department
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.120]  thinking that I was gonna do like a greater good because I think I'm a
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.720]  pretty good guy but but hearing this was just it was just so so bizarre you're a
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:21.680]  new pair of shoes so then if I arrest you then then I'm gonna get an extra 40
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:28.680]  $50 $60 back then to take care of my family so what do you consider people
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:35.840]  just a source of revenue and then and then I tried to stop it I tried as a
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.000]  rookie cop coming straight out of the police academy I tried to stop it in a
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.440]  naive way and what I got what I got what they do in the inner city you're
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:59.040]  supposed to have backup oh like supergo did they set you up exactly you're
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.800]  supposed to have backup within 10 seconds 15 seconds Matt what I found out
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.000]  it was taken 30 seconds 45 seconds and these are some of the guys are like bad
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.880]  I mean you know you have four guys up on it you know selling drugs and a lot of
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.720]  them have burritos and stuff on and you call for backup your backup doesn't come
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.760]  so what do you do yeah well you're familiar with the superco's story right
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.800]  you've seen the the movie probably by with Al Pacino yes and of course you know
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.720]  that was exactly the way they got rid of him he didn't want to go along along with
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.120]  the corruption he didn't want to go on the take so they perceived him as a big
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:39.040]  threat to them in his day the issue he said was really graft and corruption
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.120]  although I believe it was still being driven by the same thing and that's the
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.520]  war on drugs it's driving both the crap at the graft and the corruption and the
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.080]  police force and government as well as now of course that's the basis for these
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.080]  SWAT team raids it's all the war on drugs this shoot first mentality we've
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.000]  had the it's been police rookies who have been we've seen a couple of these
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.560]  incidents in just the last last week or so we had the case of the 12-year-old who
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:12.040]  was shot dead and that was a rookie the 12-year-old had a BB gun somebody called
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.960]  it in because this guy was playing around with a BB gun I saw the pictures of
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.880]  him pointing the BB gun around it it reminded me of a Christmas story where
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.600]  Ralphie gets his BB gun I did that kind of stuff when I was a kid I had guns
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.640]  toy guns that I was shooting at imaginary villains with I didn't expect
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.360]  him shouldn't have been shot dead by the cops and in this particular case you
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.720]  got there's video that exists you see the cop car pull up and the rookie jumps
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.440]  out and within one second he shot that kid dead and that kid wasn't pointing a
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.240]  gun at him wasn't any threat to him and it was a toy gun thank you so much for

[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.760]  David Knight your host today joining us this hour joining us right now is Lionel
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.360]  he's a Renaissance lawyer news decoder first amendment sentry and a New York
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.240]  based television legal analysts and so I want to see what he's seeing there on
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.680]  the ground and also talk to him about what's going on with grand juries and
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.240]  kind of fill us in a little bit about how that works Lionel thank you for
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.760]  joining us you sir now you're based in New York what have you been seeing what
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.960]  have you seen over the last 24 hours there well um reaction and I've got to
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:57.320]  say I'm absolutely thrilled that finally Americans are getting off of their
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:03.440]  collective duffs and reacting for the most part it was it was peaceful but
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.840]  obstruction there are your obstruction or whatever the particular adjective but
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:17.560]  very very peaceful the NYPD has been I think equally as as as accommodating so
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.640]  there's a part of me David that says great for the first amendment great that
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.640]  finally instead of sitting home and you know tweeting and favoriting or
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:31.840]  retweeting somebody's actually speaking up now I'm not saying everybody
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:37.320]  necessarily is correct in what they're protesting there's a lot that's going on
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.120]  here but it doesn't really matter the first amendment rings true and I'm very
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.720]  proud as an American to see that that people are utilizing that that right
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.240]  and peacefully that's good and so you're not seeing the New York police
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.880]  essentially getting kind of provocative in the way they interact with the
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.720]  crowds like they did in Ferguson kind of getting in their face drawing a line
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.240]  don't get here stand over there now you can't stand over there we've seen that
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.240]  happen so many times and so many different cities we saw it happen in
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.320]  Dallas with the JFK commemoration we saw it happen in Ferguson that's not
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.680]  happening in New York I'm not well it may be but it's not being reported okay
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:15.560]  right it's a city of 8 million people a lot of areas and so I'm there very well
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.040]  may be but but from what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing they've been most
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.800]  professional as as they normally are I mean let's let's let me just stop right
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.200]  there you know David we always have to do this
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:38.520]  proviso not all police are bad right they do a good job yes we know that we
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.120]  understand that and we don't want to live I don't live in a society without
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:48.760]  police I'm not in a full-blown anarchist or whatever but you brought up
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.440]  something which is the most important you know David in my humble opinion I
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.960]  don't mean to interrupt but just so that you know my point of view the issue is
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.280]  not race the issue is the hyper militarization of the police number one
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.840]  which which we have been talking I haven't talked about for years that's
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.600]  number one right number two there's a systemic if you will attitudinal problem
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:21.280]  in some departments in some cases where the police are almost allowed to assume
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:28.040]  this very hyper adversarial position it's that it's kind of an attitude let me
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:33.200]  ask you this question let's assume we had this time machine we can go back we
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.000]  can look at a situation that happened we take the Eric Garner case exactly as
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  it happened at the same site same players and through the magic of time
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.600]  travel we could put in place of Eric Garner it's gonna be 300 pound rather
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:55.080]  large african-american male let's say a slight african-american man who's 80
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.240]  years old and then a grandmother who's white child and a priest and a man with
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:09.040]  a suit but you very much would we have had same degree of escalation in varying
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.320]  parties involved or would the police have said no this is a one-size-fits-all
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:21.800]  reaction when you resist this is how we react and I would venture to say no you
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:31.480]  would not see the police act the same way so the question is why why would they
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:36.240]  not put a chokehold or camaraderie strained or whatever on a grandmother
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:43.200]  she's resisting or a man in a business suit or a priest and I think we have to
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:49.520]  be honest yes there is a reaction now is that racist I don't know I think that
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.200]  word to patella to Pavlovia racism racism just because there's a
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.680]  disparities because well you know why don't I kind of think I would come up
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.280]  with a different answer kind of think they would based on all the different
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.280]  shots we've seen I know that the statistics show that the predominance is
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.480]  against black people we know that they're arrested at a higher rate for
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.920]  marijuana they go to jail based on the the crimes that come together they
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.240]  they are more likely to serve jail time if they're arrested for marijuana than
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.400]  white people are so I understand there is a systemic bias against blacks there's
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.320]  no doubt about that absolutely but you know I've seen so many police brutality
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  videos just that that video that just went viral we had it up on our site
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.320]  earlier in the week this is what happens when you call the police I mean I see
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.920]  people of all different colors see that happening to them again they've got
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.480]  mandatory drawing blood even if you're not drinking they don't even have to be
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.320]  suspicious that you're a drunk driver they can just demand to draw your blood
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.240]  I've seen pictures of people saying what is this is this America right and
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.560]  that's a white guy in that particular case a point well taken you bring up an
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.320]  excellent excellent point and by the way we need this so much not only in
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:12.760]  media radio but just talking not necessarily say my hashtag my selfie you
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.680]  know image is better than yours or more pithier is pithier than yours let me go
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.160]  back to some other cases which I think are horrible and really speak to what
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.480]  you're saying it was a case horrible case that we saw Kelly Thomas yeah I love
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:31.640]  it in hell mm-hmm schizophrenic homeless man known by Fullerton County these
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:38.480]  police officers who was beaten to death yeah not quickly but it involved a
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.920]  series of blows and contact put them into a coma and then life support was
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.360]  full all right was that situation have been different had it been a different
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.720]  man a different situation I say yes now because of race I think that sometimes
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:04.840]  cops in situations like this do have the ability to say you know this guy is
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.200]  being arrested here Eric Garner back to him for selling loose cigarettes untaxed
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:16.080]  this is not exactly help the enemy number one right exactly this is this is
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.840]  this nonsense called the broken windows here you're gonna hear a lot about the
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:28.080]  broken windows sounds terrific quality of life crimes quality of life I don't think
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.560]  that if somebody would say whoa whoa night holy you and I are partners
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.280]  imagine that hold it hold it set 90 year old grandmother which understand we
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.360]  reacted no people do there is they have the ability to say whoa wait a minute
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.000]  sir back up we don't want to bother you or or to me or rice whatever happened to
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.040]  the bullhorn whatever happened to getting up you drop the gun put your
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.440]  hands up the way police confront going back and I'm jumping around and I'm
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.480]  sorry for that but you you mentioned to me or rice this is a case if you and I
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.880]  were partners I would say why are we driving up to this person that we think
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.760]  has a gun why don't we make it a safe distance call for backup what's the hurry
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:16.040]  he's by himself let's let's use this I don't understand the immediacy that's
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:22.120]  what I'm saying yeah right me it's systemic it's attitude it's us and them
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.040]  is where the cop I don't know and we can see the video there you know he doesn't
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.960]  look to me like he's a serious threat to them like he's fighting back I've got
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.880]  Paul Joseph Watson joined us on the line from the UK and I wanted to get let's put
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.800]  that question to Paul Paul what do you think you think in terms of the way this
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.360]  is being portrayed by many in New York as as racism you've got a story up on
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.600]  info wars.com right now some people tweeting out that they thought that
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.920]  the that playing white Christmas at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony and at
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.600]  Rockefeller Center in New York was racist well I mean this is this is an
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.880]  example how this is degenerated so quickly and you know David I was attacked
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.240]  as a white supremacist for supporting the facts in the brown case just as I've
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.880]  been attacked as a cop hater for supporting the facts in the garner case
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:17.200]  but this has been hijacked by social justice warriors as Lionel said to all
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.200]  be about race when it's not about race it's about violence and now as you
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.400]  mentioned Darius Rucker this black singer sung white Christmas at
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.320]  the New York tree lighting ceremony last night and the outrage was immediate
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:39.880]  that snow itself a form of frozen precipitation could be racist so this
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:46.000]  was a an offensive slur against the garner verdict and you know I sent out
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.720]  the tweet white Christmas is a song about snow it's not a song about white
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:56.080]  people yeah so it's an illustration of how this has been hijacked by many on
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.880]  the left just as the Ferguson protests were hijacked by Communists to make
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.160]  everything about race and not about what it should be which is police
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.480]  brutality which is what we should all be unifying against because when they make
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:16.120]  it about race that only ostracized as conservatives it turns away half of
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.440]  Americans they don't want to support this movement because it comes across as
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.600]  ludicrous when people are saying that singing white Christmas is a racial
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.520]  slur is actually counterproductive size the fact this is about violence it's not
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.640]  about race right now white privilege there's a hashtag Twitter trend
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.880]  and crimeing wild white which is a bunch of white people confessing their white
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.360]  guilt over having minor infractions and not being punished by police but you
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.800]  know Kelly Thomas his white privilege didn't count for anything when he was
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.720]  bleep beaten to a bloody pulp in California James Boyd shot down like a
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.680]  stray dog in Albuquerque he couldn't rely on his white privilege to save him
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.160]  from that situation so it's not about black or white it's about police
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.880]  brutality that's what we need to focus on and we've got it we've got a break
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.360]  against that we've got a break coming up but we've also got this story from
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.800]  Kit Daniels I don't want to get Lionel's reaction to this tweeting out and this
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.880]  is a tweet somebody put out next time someone asks white privilege is fatally
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.000]  choking a man on camera for millions to witness and getting away with it I would
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.360]  say that's not white privilege I would say that that's maybe blue privilege we
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.560]  need to look at what is actually going on with these grand jury situations and I
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.360]  want to get Lionel's reaction to that as a former prosecutor as a defense
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.520]  attorney talk to us about what's going on in these grand juries why aren't we
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:46.240]  seeing indictments come so we can have a public open trial that the the public
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.840]  can see the evidence that's there I think that would deescalate these

[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.200]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we called the
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.680]  bloody bridge to the Alex Joe show I'm David Knight in Austin and we have a
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.120]  brick joining us Paul Joseph Watson from the UK as well as Lionel and I wanted
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.600]  to go back to Lionel about this grand jury indictment or should say non
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:35.960]  indictment we just had Judge Andrew Napolitano going radio show yesterday and
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.080]  say I think it's clearly a case for criminally negligent homicide he said
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.400]  the this I think that the use of deadly forces is not Ferguson Missouri this is
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.800]  not somebody wrestling for your gun this is not where you shoot at or be shot at
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.360]  he said this is a choking death of a mentally impaired grossly obese person
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.880]  whose only crime was selling cigarettes without collecting taxes on him it
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.080]  doesn't call for deadly force by any stretch of the imagination but then he
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:04.600]  says this he says the grand jury decision tells me that the district
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:10.240]  attorney didn't want an indictment does that tell you the same thing Lionel as
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.200]  a former prosecutor and defense attorney no it doesn't it could but it
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:25.640]  doesn't necessarily tell me that let me break this down very very carefully you
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.320]  know you had mentioned something before we said we're not conspiracy theorists
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:37.720]  we're skeptical so yes I can be very skeptical about this grand jury no bill
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:46.520]  okay but it works like this a prosecutor delivers a case of the grand jury and the
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:53.920]  grand jury historically has been almost like an outlier this weird tribunal
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.520]  it's not a part of the criminal justice system not a part of the judiciary not
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.600]  the legislature not really anything it's kind of like this ideally set up as
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:11.360]  this neutral detached buffer between a the magistrate the crown and the people
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.240]  the idea of standing there between the marauding crown and people and say no
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.880]  no you have a case you don't have a case but that might be fine historically what
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.040]  it means is is that provided there's enough probable cause and the best
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.080]  definition of probable cause is he probably did probable cause in burdens
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.560]  is here reasonable doubt is here it's in your hole you're saying the probable
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.760]  cause for people that aren't watching listening on the radio you're saying
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.400]  probable cause is much much lower correct that yeah probable cause means he
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.040]  probably did it's the easiest burden you can imagine but here's the problem if
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.280]  I'm a prosecutor I don't want to bring a case that I think is gonna stink at the
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:00.000]  trial level I don't want to bring a case where the medical examiner in this
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.280]  particular case we believe because we really haven't heard the Staten Island
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.000]  grand jury minutes but let's assume the prosecutor or the medical examiner
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.600]  testified that a this was not a chokehold a chokehold a carotid restraint
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:24.320]  this was a poorly used neck restraint or something he did say that the cause of
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:32.960]  death was compression but also chest compression and also asthma perhaps
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.760]  obesity perhaps other factors so the question number one is imagine that this
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:47.940]  indictment came this indictment was issued and at the trial level the
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:53.680]  defense lawyer says ladies and gentlemen of the jury can you find beyond a
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:01.640]  reasonable doubt that this death was caused by this officer if no that's not
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:07.400]  guilty so just because it works at the grand jury level doesn't mean it's
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.680]  gonna work at the trial level and any prosecutor who merely says I don't care
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.960]  whether this case has a chance of conviction my job is to get a an
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.640]  indictment and that's all I care about that's negligence now the other problem
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.520]  with this is that police officers by virtue of their position can do things
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:35.200]  that citizens can't they can actually arrest wait a minute because we're about
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.960]  out of time on this segment we'll join this when we come back at the bottom of
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.520]  the hour but we're talking about the grand jury I think it's important for
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.720]  people to understand it and this is the problem that I have with it is the fact
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.720]  that this isn't a trial situation where you know you've only got the prosecutor
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.200]  addressing the jury he can tell them anything that he wants to it's not an
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.520]  adversarial relationship there isn't a defense attorney present because
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.120]  nobody's been indicted yet so he can basically tell them whatever he wants
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.400]  to and no matter how skewed the evidence is there's nobody to object to that
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:12.720]  that's why they've had 162,000 grand juries with only 11 cases where it
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.400]  wasn't returned as an indictment that's why you have that familiar saying that
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.720]  Judge Napolitano repeated you can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich I
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.160]  want to pick up with that before we go on to the different rules that we have
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.720]  for police right after we come back from the break we're talking to Lionel
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:34.280]  he's in New York a former prosecutor as well as a talk show host personality
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.320]  there we also have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK I'm gonna give him
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.960]  a chance to ask Lionel some questions about what's going on with police
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.600]  brutality we'll be right back stay with us

[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:18.520]  radio network welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.480]  today joining me is Lionel from New York and of course he is a former
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:27.120]  prosecutor and defense attorney I want to get his take on what's going on with
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.600]  the grand jury part of this because I think a lot of people are looking at
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.880]  this and and seeing the government investigating itself in secret because
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.240]  grand jury proceedings are secret and of course finding itself not guilty we
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:44.880]  see this happening so many times and so I think a lot of people would like to see
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.280]  this happen in public I know I would it makes me suspicious to see this
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:52.400]  happening I look at the statistics the latest year that the Justice Department
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.800]  kept statistics it's like 162,000 grand jury cases that they looked at only 11
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.120]  did not return an indictment so we kind of I look at this as like yes I know
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.440]  they use grand juries to to test to see how strong a case they've got but isn't
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.440]  it possible that we've also got a grand jury being used as a beard for a
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.600]  prosecution that the prosecutor doesn't really want to go through with for maybe
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:21.280]  reasons other than there's there's not anything to look at here before we do
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.840]  before I go back to Lionel and to Paul Joseph Watson who's with us from the UK
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:32.080]  we this is Cyber Week Christmas specials going on this week at InfoWars store we

[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.040]  to our guests Lionel you heard what I had to say about grand juries I mean I
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.240]  think that a lot of people really wanted to see the evidence presented in
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.200]  Ferguson as well as here they wanted to see that it was going to be
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.040]  investigated openly they want to see what evidence there was in Ferguson we
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.400]  got a document dump after the fact and usually we don't even hear anything
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:04.200]  about what goes on in grand juries usually kept secret we don't know in
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:08.080]  New York even what the charges were that were being investigated as to whether
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.760]  he's gonna be indicted go ahead as far as Ferguson goes I've got to tell you
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.080]  something that may be one of the most thorough grand juries ever that was an
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.480]  anomaly it's not supposed to be like that you see what we're doing is we're
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:24.120]  in essence saying how dare Bob McCulloch not be so quick and so railroadish in
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.200]  his grand jury like others how dare he put on so much evidence how dare he be
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.960]  so thorough and putting on evidence which people call exculpatory how dare he
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.200]  do that come on you're supposed to run this thing through and indict that ham
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:43.720]  sandwich which the great jurist Saul Wachtler coined in 1985 no what happens
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.400]  is this I wish more cases were thorough it's the opposite yeah he'd never done
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.560]  that in 28 years why do you think that he never did that in 28 years did he
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.800]  give the other people that he that he went through the grand jury process did
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.160]  he give them a fair trial if he if he only gives the cop a full
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.760]  investigation and of course he's presenting evidence that there's you
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.440]  know he's I guess a lot of people as I look at some of the evidence that's
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.640]  come out of there and as I look at some of the transcripts and there was a like
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.080]  over a thousand pages so people are just now starting to get through that looks to
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.920]  me like there was a lot of coaching a lot of protection it looks to me like
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.480]  Darren Wilson wasn't on trial Michael Brown was on trial and that in that
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:27.280]  grand jury and let me just clarify something I'm not I'm not defending this
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.880]  I'm trying to explain a system that I have spent most of my adult life trying
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.080]  to figure out and with all certainly not directed to you but there are a lot of
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.280]  armchair instant experts who say boy this grand jury thing screwed up I'm
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.520]  thinking where the hell have you been where have you been this whole thing is
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.600]  people have screamed about this for the longest time but let me ask you this
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.920]  question let's assume you're a grand juror because I want to hear from them
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:55.920]  ultimately I want to hear forget McCulloch I want to hear from somebody
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.560]  from from St. Louis or from Staten Island and if you're a grand jury at a
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.680]  juror and I say ladies and gentlemen we have something you don't normally hear
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.400]  here's the target of the investigation to come and he's any takes a stand and he
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.600]  says I was this is the Michael Brown case I was placed in fear I was placed in
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  fear and I reacted because I thought I was saving my life okay good he testifies
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:26.160]  now remember his lawyer can cross-examine he's just there grand jurors can
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.840]  ask questions and that brings up an important point Lionel if you were his
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.880]  defense attorney would you allow your client to go testify before a grand
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.720]  jury where you could not be present or everything he says is going to be on the
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:41.920]  record would you let him talk for four hours if you didn't believe that the
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:49.960]  prosecutor was on his side I wouldn't I wouldn't let anybody testify ever yeah
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.800]  they typically don't do that yeah but but what happens is you see look and I
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.600]  know how this looks it's like hey listen why don't you come and testify and well
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.400]  I'll ask you some simple questions and we'll basically load it up until a
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:13.480]  grand juror says wait a minute I was there and we declined to prosecute not
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.120]  because we were set up but we didn't think there was probable cause now again
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.960]  the probable cause standard is so slight that whenever probable cause is not
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:29.840]  had you wonder what was so special but let me go back to now jumping back to
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.040]  the Eric Garner case what in this particular case if the medical examiners
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:41.800]  said I cannot tell you right now whether this death was caused because of a
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:48.200]  chokehold because of a pre-existing medical condition or it was a the time
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:54.280]  to go let me back up medical examiners determine four types of death there are
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:00.680]  four types of death period think of the mnemonic Nash NASH natural accidental
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:07.760]  suicide or homicide that's it so when a medical examiner says this cause of death
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:14.360]  was homicide that means it was a death caused by or because of the action of
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.160]  another in fact people who are executed people who received a death penalty on
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.200]  their death certificate it says cause of death homicide because you're killed
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.120]  right and that's what the medical examiner said in the case of Eric
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.600]  Garner that it was homicide yes go ahead it wasn't natural death mm-hmm it wasn't
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:38.040]  an accident and it wasn't suicide so natural I mean so therefore there was a
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:44.360]  human a human connection but this particular case the police officer who
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.160]  was under department regulation unable to do a coronary strain or chokehold
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.560]  which in fact it may or may not be that's not against the law so what happens
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.440]  is I'm telling you right now there is no evidence of murder there is no crime
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:05.800]  here there may be negligence now remember there's different fora different
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.240]  forums there's the criminal arena the civil arena that's the lawsuit that's
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:16.000]  where you seek monetary damages big bucks for wrongful death and loss of
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.920]  society the loss of a father the loss of a husband and then there's federal either
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.800]  federal civil rights or some other federal crime just because there is no
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:34.120]  evidence to prove a crime in that there was no evidence of murder in voluntary
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.840]  manslaughter does not mean that he's at all off the hook when it comes to civil
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:45.240]  I'm telling you right now this is a civil slam dunk let me also throw in
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.760]  there's administrative because he most probably will be bounced off of the NYPD
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.680]  because he violated this rule so you would say so judge Napolitano said he
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.000]  thought it was clearly a case of criminally negligent homicide you would
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.440]  say that in your opinion you think it's civilly negligent homicide oh yes
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.600]  because right now I could say this is not you see this is a police officer who
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:15.840]  did not pick somebody out of a crowd who decided on his own to be excessive this
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:22.520]  is a police officer right or wrong who was in essence ordered to try to restrain
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:28.600]  someone and he would testify a trial he did it because he was following the
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:35.240]  department's directions he swore an oath to follow not only the law but his the
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:41.200]  orders of his of his superiors and he was told we have an arrest let's do it
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.520]  like we've done it a thousand times in training so this police officer would
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:52.160]  testify I'm not acting rogue I'm not going off the reservation the only thing I
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.040]  did that was negligent was later on now this is where it gets interesting if
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:05.040]  there was if a jury believed you know we were with you officer until we believe
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:11.200]  that you heard him say I can't breathe yeah at that point you should have let
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.120]  go at that point you should have using all standards of care realized that you
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:23.280]  were going too far maybe then there's a negligence portion of it or maybe the
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.400]  point at which he loses consciousness they tried to do something to administer
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.920]  some CPR or or something like that I want to get give Paul Joseph Watson a
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.200]  chance to get in because I've been dominating the conversation with you
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.040]  it's fascinating Paul was there anything how do you feel about this and did you
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.840]  have any question for Lionel yeah I wanted to get back to this issue about
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.280]  police brutality the causes of police brutality because I think this is what
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.680]  we're being misdirected from these officers are acting in accordance with
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:56.280]  their training and that's the main problem because their militarized
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.880]  training which is being directed to them by the federal government is not to
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.280]  deescalate it's to immediately resort to violence and then when they're
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.080]  exonerated in these cases it only gives them more confidence to act in the same
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:14.800]  manner in future situations like we saw with the Eric Garner case and my
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.920]  article and info was posted a few hours ago we have police in actual police
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:24.640]  forums verified members of the law enforcement departments across the
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.760]  country saying that this decision in the Garner case justifies them being able
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:36.200]  to quote kick some thug ass so they're taking this as a sign that everything
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.560]  they do is justified again legitimizing police brutality within police
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.720]  department so we have a problem centered around violence and the
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:51.120]  justification of violence both in the police department and also in the black
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.360]  community and this is what is not being discussed because it's been hijacked and
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:00.160]  it's all being directed towards a debate about race you've got FBI crime
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:05.280]  statistics which show that black people commit almost the same number of
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:09.920]  homicides as whites and Hispanics put together despite the fact that they only
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.840]  represent 13 percent of the population in America also 93 percent of blacks are
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.120]  killed by other blacks again despite the fact that they're only 13 percent of
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:25.440]  the population so is this because of their skin color no just as because in
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.200]  the case of police they resort to violence not because of their skin color
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.120]  this is about an endemic problem of violence within both police departments
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.720]  and the black community so the way that this has been hijacked and it's all
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.000]  about race it's all about white privilege which again in the case of
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.280]  Kelly Thomas and James Boyd they couldn't exercise their white privilege to
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:52.320]  save them from their fate this is the point it's all being misdirected what
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.080]  we should be focusing on is the training that law enforcement is getting which
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.840]  makes them resort to violence immediately as well as the culture within the
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:06.920]  black community that promotes this criminality which is hyped and promoted
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:11.400]  by white owned entertainment companies which glamorize this thug life
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:16.400]  culture through rap and hip-hop none of this is being addressed now that the
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.280]  social justice warriors have hijacked this case and basically turned it into
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:27.480]  Occupy 2.0 this is being used as a divisive tool to turn us away from the
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.240]  problem of violence in both the police community and the black community
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:36.640]  towards just squabbling with each other over side issues about white privilege
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.040]  so I wanted to get Lionel's take on that I would not have said it better my dear
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:47.520]  friend that I will not try to let me tell you that imagine this hypothetical we
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:54.120]  have a series of doors in this door we can discuss the grand jury problems
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:59.200]  anomalies and the like in this door we can talk about inherent problems within
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.160]  African-American culture but in this door we could talk about the hyper
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.800]  militarization of the police in this door we can talk about training in this
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.840]  door and you're right now the problem is that when we change doors in mid
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:20.280]  sentence and go from police argument to race in a society that is not able to
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.680]  handle critical thinking in a society with this man be pamby almost cartoonish
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.840]  media who cannot handle this throw into the mix this is a rather complex
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:38.280]  situation now what you said Paul I agree with a hundred percent there has been and
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:44.200]  you know in this country let's back up there has been a firewall by design
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:52.520]  posse commentators in 1878 to our loathing of standing armies a firewall
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:58.920]  between civilian law enforcement and military I've often said if you do not
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:04.720]  like being a police officer if you don't like as we say in New York and all the
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.280]  police cars you see CPR courtesy professionalism and respect if you
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.080]  don't want to read rights if you don't want to take down names and be courteous
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:18.200]  and be a peace officer or constable then join the military go someplace where
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:22.040]  you can engage the military start shooting when you're told to because
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.160]  police officers involve a certain skill set that military doesn't and what
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:33.040]  happens is when you throw into the mix this idea through 1033 programs MRAPS
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:39.480]  automatic weapons from when but when Sheriff Andy turns into Robo cop and you
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.960]  have this crew-cutted mirrored glasses heavily armored look when you have the
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:52.560]  Boise police department having urban assault commando trucks when you have
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.400]  this other attitude and this is this is what I've heard well how dare this man
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:06.120]  Eric Gardner dare resist arrest now resist arrest can be and Paul and David
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:10.880]  we've seen this where somebody asks a police officer why am I being arrested
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:17.480]  you're resisting yeah or takes a picture he's arrested this is a country we've
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:24.720]  seen it from TSA from gate rapes from airports we have seen these saw the
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:32.120]  slow systematic systemic heightened militarization on all level it's gotten
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:38.200]  so bad that even in schools little kids who point fingers are in essence
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:45.440]  arrested in the school system so we have become this hyper law and order on
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:53.880]  steroids mentality that I agree Paul is another avenue because I'm sure that if
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:50:00.080]  we look to other cultures other police departments other countries other they
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:08.080]  have their their their store of of thugs in the life and we have a virtue of this
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:14.360]  let me throw another problem when the social media God bless protest but when
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:19.800]  the momentum of the meme starts when somebody says it I know this you know
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:23.560]  how many times I see people running around here who are thrilled to be a
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.360]  part of the protest hey we're going to grad central come on get your phone out
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.600]  let's Instagram this this is I'm not saying people are not sincere but there
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:40.760]  is a celebration sometimes hang on Lionel we got to take a break we'll be
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.880]  right back and as you're talking about the militarization of the police and
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:47.880]  we're talking about the training maybe there's a question if with the system
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.680]  have liability if they found these police officers guilty because they
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.640]  trained them to act that way we'll be right back with Lionel and Paul Joseph

[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:13.920]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Ida have Lionel on the phone with us and
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.320]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us from the UK as we were going to break we were
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.400]  talking about as Lionel have put it there's so many different doors to this
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.320]  we have the excessive use of force the militarization of the police the way
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.160]  they're trained the way they're equipped and of course we also can look at the
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.360]  grand jury why there are so few indictments of the police when they do
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.120]  this and I have a question for Lionel is it maybe because if some of these police
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.960]  officers were indicted for doing what they're trained to do doing what they're
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:45.600]  equipped to do which we as a society need to have this discussion as to
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.640]  whether or not we want militarized police I sure don't and if maybe if
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.840]  they're indicted for some of this stuff would they sue their employers the
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:57.120]  system is that why the system apparently is is going so easy on them
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.000]  because it would essentially be liable if this started to come out
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.200]  well we got a problem with immunity that's because people we don't want to
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.240]  hamstring police we don't want to have them say because God forbid David
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.840]  somebody is attacking you or your family you don't want police officers
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.560]  saying you know I normally be a little bit more aggressive and helping out David
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:24.520]  here but I don't think I want to risk chance of civil liability so I'm I think
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.040]  I'm gonna back off a little bit so we obviously don't want that but David may I
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.400]  ask you something sir I I'm do you remember a time perhaps maybe we're in
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:41.560]  the same generation but I know instances where friends of mine can tell me a
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.240]  time when when they were out acting like a fool police officer came home and
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.280]  brought them home knocked in the doors and this is not yeah well David here's
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:55.600]  been acting up why you oh yeah and and and they can tell these stories you know
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.760]  Norman Rockwell yeah the picture of little boy runs away grand it's a kid
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:10.640]  there are views of in my from Sheriff Andy to Adam 12 to drag net Bumper
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.960]  Morgan the blue night and all of a sudden the idea of the police officer as
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:23.040]  being wise the guy in the community the one who ran the traffic signal on
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:29.760]  Sundays when church let out that image has been changed I want people to Google
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.480]  this I told somebody this and they didn't believe it look at the number of cases
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:38.360]  where people have been denied applications to police forces because
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:43.280]  their IQs were too high yeah there was actually a lawsuit about that yes and
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.480]  the guy lost they wouldn't hire him as a cop because they said his IQ was too
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.200]  high he sued them and they said no they don't have to hire you your IQ is too
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.640]  high if we are going and I'm telling you we're not look no further go back to the
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:06.400]  TSA look to the feds and look to how people handled that look to how we not
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.600]  only do we have this new brand of G men but how we became kind of systematically
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:19.240]  acclimated dare I say another door so we might want to consider this why don't
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:23.880]  we just abolish the grand jury why don't we just seriously we can do it there's
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.960]  no reason why we can't pass a constitutional amendment or a state
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.360]  statute just say we're done with this and have the prosecutor like another
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.160]  other jurisdictions like in the state of Florida the only time he's a grand
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:38.400]  jury is if it's for a first-degree murder or some type of investigation or
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:43.360]  right but just sign the affidavit sign the indice sign it yourself what are we
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:48.800]  doing this for have accountability have the police officer or have special
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:54.080]  prosecutors that's another thing have statewide prosecutors or a law that says
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.400]  when you have a police officer in let's say the city of Austin you don't have the
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:05.120]  Austin DA prosecute somebody that by virtue of natural affinity and propinquity
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.080]  and professional relationships let's automatically bring in another
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:16.280]  prosecutor change the system address it I agree I agree yeah and we've had you
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.480]  know Serpa co who went through this whole ringer he has said that we have to
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.840]  have outside oversight in this and what outside means what that means from
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.040]  another jurisdiction or whatever that means that has to be there thank you so

[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:28.280]  Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:32.640]  we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK in the last hour we were
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:38.160]  talking to Lionel talk show host out of New York about the recent grand jury
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:43.320]  non indictments in Ferguson and now in New York with the Eric Garner case and
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:47.080]  he said something in the last segment that I thought was interesting I wanted
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.720]  to talk to Paul about this and he said remember back when we were younger he and
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.480]  I we had a very different kind of attitude from the police of course and
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.440]  that's what we're all talking about this radical change that's being pushed from
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.720]  Washington this militarization of the police and their equipment and their
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:09.440]  training and the way they regard themselves in the public and Paul want
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:13.280]  to ask you this I remember this as we're dating ourselves here remember this
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.960]  Roger Miller song England swings like a pendulum do they talked about Bobby's on
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:24.840]  bicycles 2x2 I was there in the 80s quite a bit of time with my wife and I was
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:32.720]  really taken back by how kind the police in in the UK were especially around
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.240]  London how approachable they were because they weren't armed and they
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:41.600]  weren't in cars and it was a very different situation when I went back 20
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.160]  years later because they had much more of an American model and I think it was
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:51.320]  easier for me to see it there because it wasn't this very gradual process that
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:54.520]  has happened in the United States although in the last few years they have
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:00.000]  accelerated the change so much I think you have to be pretty blind and deaf to
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.720]  not notice what's going on in American hour just totally apathetic but let me
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.080]  get your take on on what's going on in the UK because that was my take on it
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:10.680]  was it's a very different situation where they were going on patrol two guys
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:14.280]  on foot or on bicycle they had a radio they had their bully clubs they could
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:17.200]  call for support but they were not armed and seemed to me they had a very
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.640]  different attitude well I think there's a statistic David which is I'm not sure
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.400]  if this is correct but this is what I read today that police in America have
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:32.040]  killed more people than police in the UK have ever killed in the history of
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.600]  policing now it's that may not be completely accurate just like the last
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:41.160]  and just the last year what over what period of time in America over the last
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.040]  year in America over the last year I read yeah the last year we know they've
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:51.120]  killed 5,000 Americans since 9-11 and that's primarily as a result of this
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.960]  whatification of the American police force yes and that is that is one of the
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:00.480]  iconic images of America and fortunately to the rest of the world is police
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:08.560]  pulling somebody over on the highway and harassing them exactly the show cops was
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:14.120]  put pretty emblematic of that image and generally it's true I mean police in
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:19.760]  Europe are not nearly as quick to resort to violence and brutality as police in
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:24.680]  America are and again it goes back to their training it goes back to the DHS
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:29.960]  classifying the American people as the enemy you know returning veterans as
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:35.480]  terrorist threats they're constantly harping on about lone wolf extremists
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:40.480]  so police are going out there with this belief that everybody wants to attack
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.080]  them that their lives are constantly under threat and you know they are in
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.840]  some cases but it's completely overhyped and that's why you see such an instant
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.840]  resort to violence in all these situations there's a very explicit aspect
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  of their training as you point out to tell them that you're in a very dangerous
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.840]  situation there are people out there who want to kill you there's actually a
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.120]  killology course that's being taught to police departments around the country
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.200]  saying that it's a war zone out there I mean explicitly saying that I mean that
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.800]  certainly has been the implication but I think even to look at the difference
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:18.640]  that I saw in the police there as they went from essentially being on foot on
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:23.720]  bicycles and then arming them putting them in cars it really changes their
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:27.880]  attitude and if that changes their attitude just that little bit giving
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:31.760]  them a gun changes their attitude think what it's going to do to give them
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:36.960]  military-style assault weapons to give them m-wraps to build it up into a
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:41.360]  militarized situation like that we just had some cops in Alaska the last places
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:46.400]  in America where they're not armed and the cops said my best tool is my mouth
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.840]  because that's how he can keep things from getting escalated into a violent
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:55.080]  situation that's how he keeps from getting shot because he's clever he uses
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:58.400]  his mouth that's the Andy Griffith model we're gonna be right back with Paul
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.600]  Joseph Watson stay with us.

[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.840]  2014 I'm here in studio in Austin and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.320]  the UK we're gonna talk about some of the we've been talking mainly about the
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:49.520]  grand jury non indictment in the Eric Garner case the man who was essentially
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:56.160]  died for an unpaid tax on cigarettes I want to talk about some good cops here
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:59.240]  and get your reactions we're gonna go back to your calls we had some people
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:02.000]  who've been on hold for quite some time and I promise we're gonna get back to
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.400]  you right away but I first wanted to just kind of throw this out here we've
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:09.840]  got a story that's on the free thought project.com Illinois cops are standing up
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.440]  to their own department saying that forcing quotas requires them to make
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:19.200]  arrests without probable cause this is coming in Illinois of all places this is
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:24.640]  a town called normal and I would say that the normal situation is that that's
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:29.560]  what cops appear to be doing in many many cities that's exactly what was
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:33.480]  happening in the New York Police Department that's what Adrian Schoolcraft
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.520]  wore a wire on himself to record that happening over and over again that he
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:44.320]  was told to go arrest people just to have a headcount on nonviolent crime
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:49.560]  allowing serious crime to go unpunished discouraging people from filing complaints
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.840]  on serious crimes and yet hammering people on petty regulations now in this
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:10:00.160]  particular story they say that this is several police officers now have taken a
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:03.560]  lawsuit they have done it taken a different approach than CERPICO did a
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:06.560]  different approach than Adrian Schoolcraft did these guys got together
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:12.200]  and to their credit and we need to as CERPICO said we need to stand up for the
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.480]  cops who do the right thing these cops are doing the right thing patrol
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:23.840]  officers Brian Laramore, Debra Weir, Todd Van Hoven were tired of being forced
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:27.800]  to collect a minimum amount of revenue each month or face disciplinary
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:31.520]  consequences they claim the department is abusing its power and they have filed
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:37.200]  a multi-page lawsuit I think it's 27 pages dealing with these allegations they
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.640]  say that it's more than just traffic citations as well the lawsuit details
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.920]  requirements to make at least two criminal arrests each month so they're
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  not just after petty regulations they're actually going out and have a quota of
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.800]  criminal arrests a quota of criminal arrests hold that thought there for a
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.240]  second think about that think about how they're ruining people's lives for a
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.760]  quota what's the agenda here of the police department these rank and file
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:08.080]  police officers are pushing back against a criminal system that is training our
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:12.840]  officers to act like they're in a war zone equipping them and training them to
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.880]  shoot first to shoot on site hyping them up and then also sending them out to
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:23.640]  arrest people criminally on a quota system so there you go that was what
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:27.120]  was happening in New York that's what Adrian Schoolcraft blew the whistle on
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.600]  for that they put him in an insane asylum until his dad found him and got him
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:38.120]  out and also found the recording where they I think it was the number two if I'm
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.920]  if I'm correct or not the number two at the New York Police Department was
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:45.880]  threatening him and was there at his apartment that when they put him into
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.440]  the insane asylum now I want to get Paul's reaction this way Paul Joseph
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:55.600]  Watson from the UK it seems to me Paul this is very much like the war on drugs
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.720]  this this petty issue here if we can kill a man for a cigarette tax isn't that
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.840]  what we've been doing with the war on drugs you know when we have these SWAT
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:08.840]  teams who basically throw flash grenades into a baby's crib and it's all
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:12.360]  justified and the militarized SWAT teams are all justified because it's about
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:15.880]  this prohibition law that we passed and of course now that we got the law we are
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:22.640]  entitled to do anything to any extreme to enforce that law well exactly this is
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.840]  what people have missed again in the Garner case the confrontation the death
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.040]  of Eric Garner would have never have occurred if not for this ludicrous
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:38.320]  New York State and city cigarette tax there was a 190% hike in cigarette tax
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:46.640]  in New York State since 2006 in turn that led to a 59% increase in cigarette
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:51.480]  smuggling over the same period so now you have a situation where half of all
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:56.680]  cigarettes consumed within New York State are smuggled are in the eyes of the
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:03.280]  government illegal cigarettes because they now have a 435 per pack dollar per
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:10.080]  pack tax in addition to a $1.50 per pack tax for the state for the city as well
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:15.400]  on every pack of cigarettes so if this hadn't have been imposed by the likes
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:20.640]  of Bloomberg who before the confrontation with Eric Garner increased police
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:26.120]  powers to target so-called cigarette smugglers this choking death would have
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:31.080]  never have happened so Garner's death was essentially caused by big government
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:37.160]  caused by these punitive greedy taxes being imposed by the state so again
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.400]  that's that's a major issue these ludicrous taxes again are a direct
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:47.000]  cause of police brutality if we really want to address the issues the solutions
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.680]  in preventing police brutality we need to know how these cases arise in the
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:56.960]  first place and in the case of Garner he was basically summarily executed for
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:01.200]  tax evasion so now they've set that precedent that American citizens can
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:07.240]  be summarily executed choked to death for violating some ludicrous tax law and
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.240]  we've seen this developing over quite a long period of time with the war on
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:16.560]  drugs the massive massive incarceration again that's where we also lead the
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:21.320]  world in terms of our prison population the number of people that we have per
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.280]  capita in prison adjusted for population is far greater than it is in
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.600]  communist China or in Russia it is we lead the world and it's not even close
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.720]  with these other people how many people we've thrown in prison and of course this
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:41.600]  is where those of you who are listening although we've nearly lost jury trials
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:47.120]  if somebody has a jury trial this is where you can have an effect it can only
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:51.760]  be one situation perhaps but you can as the proverb has you know the guy who is
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:57.360]  picking up the starfish and the the the beach was littered with starfish who
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:00.760]  were dying because the water was out the guy goes up picks up one and throws it
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.880]  back in the guy says I'm another guy says how much good is that going to do
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:07.920]  that's just one starfish he goes yes but it is one that is what you can do as a
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:14.240]  jury you can nullify these outrageous draconian laws and the penalties that
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.720]  come with them the mandatory minimums you can nullify that as a single jury you
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.880]  can hang the jury you have the right you have the duty to do that it's called
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:25.960]  jury nullification you need to educate yourself about that but I want to look
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:29.240]  at real quickly Paul get your reaction to this there's a story that was up on
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:34.520]  a reason two days ago talking about the San Francisco to police department and
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.560]  the approach that the police chief there is taking towards the war on drugs I
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:44.400]  said when San Francisco stopped prosecuting drug users violent crime went down
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:49.040]  and so they talked to the police chief there and he says he supports drug
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:52.920]  prohibition he says I'm an arc I've been an narcotics guy forever I feel sorry
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:58.080]  for the people who are addicted to drugs however even though he sees it as a
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:03.040]  serious Paul public health issue that needs to be addressed he is not going
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.480]  out there and escalating the violence they say that San Francisco offers an
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:10.840]  enticing glimpse at what American cities might begin to look like if drugs
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:14.520]  were legalized or decriminalized his department still makes arrests for drug
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:18.760]  dealings but only on a complaint driven basis they don't go out of the way to
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:22.800]  set up stings or raids or SWAT raids as we're talking about he says we're not
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:27.240]  trying to keep a stat game going on arresting people for narcotics and it
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.640]  hasn't hurt us trying to achieve our goal and trying to make San Francisco
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:37.000]  safer or safest is what he said so there's a situation where the deescalated
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.360]  this for they deescalated the violence he's still arresting people if there's
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.600]  complaints about it but he isn't getting in their face about it and I think it's
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:50.200]  an important look at what things might look like if we got rid of the excuse
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:55.080]  that they've been using to create this militarized police force well I mean
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.880]  David we know the ending drug prohibition reduces crime any country
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:03.480]  that has done it that's exactly what happened I mean look at Portugal look at
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:08.280]  other countries in Europe as soon as they start taking those steps crime is
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.240]  reduced and actually even I was watching Fox News a couple of days ago they had
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:19.320]  a host and three panel guests who all agreed that the war on drugs has failed
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:22.920]  that it's completely ridiculous that it's just targeting innocent people
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:27.560]  wasting money creating this huge prison industrial complex and they all agreed
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:32.120]  on Fox News wow they all agreed that the war on drugs had to end so I mean when
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:36.200]  it gets to that stage it's over we've seen Colorado their economy is booming
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:40.120]  as a result the legalization of marijuana we've seen other states
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.000]  take steps in that direction since the midterms and it's just positive
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.680]  benefits all around and if you look at the cases in other countries
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.680]  it works every time so I think that's one front on which we're winning the
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:55.000]  battle that's good you know because prohibition doesn't
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.640]  work it didn't work with alcohol prohibition even though when they did
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:01.720]  alcohol prohibition they had at least enough respect for the constitution
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:05.400]  to file two constitutional amendments we got one creating alcohol prohibition
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:08.760]  another one to repeal it why did they need to have
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:12.360]  a constitutional amendment because the federal government doesn't have the
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:16.040]  constitutional authority to tell you what you can own to tell you what you
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.520]  can put in your body you know what they don't even have the constitutional
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.480]  authority to mandate insurance to you do they Paul
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:24.440]  we're gonna be talking more about that but I think that's really what's been
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:27.480]  driving the violence in the last couple of decades
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:32.680]  we've seen the rule of law eroded in terms of civil forfeiture acts where
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.520]  they can seize property charge the inanimate property with a crime
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:39.880]  when they never charge the person possessing it with a crime just confiscate
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.640]  stuff steal stuff it breeds corruption it's bread violence
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.320]  it's a policy that needs to go but I think that the reason that they're
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.480]  willing to let it go is because they know they can replace
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:55.560]  all of this militarized violent stuff with the
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.600]  war on terror I think that's where they're going to
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.800]  put their next focus on and I think they're going to continue to do
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.360]  the same types of militarized police unless we push back unless we can get
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.920]  above this idea that is this is simply white against black that's the
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:13.800]  thing that they're trying to sell us if we buy into that we're not going to have
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:17.960]  reform exactly and on the on the jury trials just
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:22.680]  quickly there's a story South Carolina jury indicts white officer for
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.720]  killing black man media ignores that's out of
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.680]  truth revolt and basically this was a police chief who back in 2011
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:33.880]  had a struggle with an african-american in a vehicle
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:38.280]  shot him in the chest he was unarmed and this officer has
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.920]  just today or yesterday been indicted by a grand jury in
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:47.320]  South Carolina but of course the media is not going to give that any attention
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.240]  because they're trying to fan the flames of this race war absolutely and ignores

[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:19.240]  for a very long time several of them over an hour one gentleman the next one
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.240]  eric in texas has been waiting for nearly two hours so paul i want to get
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:28.040]  his comments and then we'll go to you eric in texas go ahead
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:32.280]  hi david uh i want to talk about you know the corruption in
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.240]  in the country and it goes with the police i i totally
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:39.560]  agreed mr watson he nailed it on the head i i think what's happening not only
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.560]  if they take in control of the discussion you know we're not we're not
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.520]  allowed to see that you know there's corruption in the judicial system
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:50.440]  as a whole you know the judges the lawyers the whole system
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:55.400]  works with these police they're bad and uh it makes the good ones look bad and
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:58.680]  it causes a lot of people on on on my end you know i have a lot of
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:01.880]  conservative friends a lot of liberal friends they're they're
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:05.400]  disgusted and they've decided to just take the cops side
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:10.680]  and they they see it as side and uh again i see this as you know a
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:14.040]  an attempt to take over the discussion from us remember hillary clinton said
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:18.280]  we're losing the info war yeah i see this is part of a you know a
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:22.200]  desperation act to try to you know take it
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:26.920]  so they maybe you know take it back but how do we reach people david that
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:30.200]  they refuse to listen you know to uh let's say you know we have a black
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:32.520]  community they won't listen any white people
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:36.280]  but we have a white community they won't listen anybody liberal whatever the
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:39.640]  situation whatever group you live in we need to come together
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.560]  yes and and uh how do we how do we do that because
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:46.680]  there's so many people that they're just not gonna hear you you guys are
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:49.560]  absolutely right but you'll you'll never be heard when they start to bring in
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:53.240]  nonsense like that i remember just a couple of weeks ago there was a
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:58.280]  big discussion about an uber executive you know the
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.880]  cyber taxi system an uber executive said that he'd like to hire
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.920]  four people to go after a particular journalist pay him a million dollars to
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:08.280]  do it you know get dirt on her make it public and there was a huge
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:12.040]  pushback against that and then this journalist started turning it into
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:16.120]  sexism instead of attacking people you know that that's a very
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:19.800]  underhanded suggestion to do something like that it's against our first
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:23.480]  amendment but it really showed the character that they
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:26.840]  would do something like that or even think that that would be a reasonable
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:30.280]  thing to do as a guy put it forth but then when they started talking about it
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:33.720]  as as sexism it basically lost all momentum and when
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:37.720]  they start talking about this as being simply a racist issue
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.400]  then we take reform off of the table and that's
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:45.720]  really what Eric Holder is doing he's now promising to end racial profiling
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:49.080]  once and for all he's going to institute rigorous new standards and robust
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:52.520]  safeguards help end racial profiling once and for all
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:55.800]  it's about a problem that's much bigger than that and i'll let
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.080]  paul comment on that but i think when i looked at that video that was up the
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:01.320]  other day this is what happens when you call the cops
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.080]  he was showing the abuse on white people as well he was even showing
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.080]  a cps abuse child protective services abuse and of course we have the article
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:12.920]  today about the couple had their children confiscated
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:16.440]  after their home birth some people reported them because they gave birth at
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:20.120]  home and the cps people start coming there that's their probable cause to
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.560]  intrude into their family then they start nitpicking their lives the next thing
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:26.280]  you know they've confiscated their children so
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:30.280]  so paul yeah how do we how do we get this narrative away from them this
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:34.120]  narrative that they're trying to sell everybody that is simply racism
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:38.040]  well i mean the federal government routinely makes a big show about
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:42.040]  you know federal investigations justice department investigations no matter
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:45.320]  what your take on travon martin michael brown or
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.000]  eric garner those federal investigations go nowhere
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.840]  the travon martin federal investigation is still open
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.360]  and by all accounts it's completely fruitless it's not even come into any
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:00.120]  conclusion again proving they don't care about justice
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:03.560]  but they're right there on the scene in the very first moments
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.320]  inciting the race war like obama was saying that
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.920]  the anger in response to the michael brown case was justified when if you
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:14.120]  actually look at the evidence and the facts of the case
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:17.320]  not the emotional manipulation and the media narrative
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:22.280]  then the anger in that one specific case was not justified based on the evidence
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.240]  the autopsy results the ballistic evidence which
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:28.520]  backed up officer wilson's version of what happened
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:31.720]  it would be justified in the eric garner case and that's the point that i've
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:35.240]  made you know i've been steadfast and consistent
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.560]  in supporting a judgment based on facts and evidence not on emotional
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  manipulation so whereas i agreed with the grand jury verdict in the brown
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.720]  case i disagree with it in the garner case because again i'm not influenced
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.320]  by this media narrative which is pushing race and division
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:55.400]  i think we need to elevate the black voices that are speaking out against
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.280]  both violence within police departments and violence within the black community
[02:29:00.280 --> 02:29:03.320]  because they've got the most credibility and hopefully
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:08.360]  the social justice warriors who get distracted by white privilege and all
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.160]  these other distractions will pay heed to those prominent black voices like
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:15.880]  charles barkley we heard the same criticisms of the
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.520]  bundy ranch we heard people say well you show up here but you're not going to
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:21.000]  show up at the inner city we did show up at the inner city with reporters and
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.600]  you know what there were volunteers who showed up at the bundy ranch to
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.200]  constrain the violence there that was being conducted by the federal
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:33.800]  government and we also had volunteers both keepers show up to protect private
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:37.880]  businesses in ferguson and of course they were shut down

[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:32.120]  now going back to eric in texas i know eric you held on for a long time you
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.200]  were talking about how frustrating it was
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.280]  to try to get uh your friends both conservative and liberal to really see
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:40.840]  what the issue is here because they are being
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.360]  blinded and misdirected by this red herring of
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:49.400]  racism they're not seeing that this is a much broader much deeper problem
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:53.160]  than merely racism and i say merely there certainly is a component
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:57.800]  in terms of a statistical uh disproportionate amount of a crime
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.240]  that's in the black community and the disproportionate number of people
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:04.760]  even if you adjust for that the number of people that go to prison
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:08.840]  in terms of black versus white the system i believe is definitely
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.280]  skewed against the black people but we need to not just say
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:16.440]  let's send more white people to prison or let's send less black people to
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:19.640]  prison for a violation of drug prohibition let's look at drug
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:23.560]  prohibition for example and say this is wrong we should be sending anybody to
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.240]  prison black or white what what are your comments eric
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:30.760]  i think you guys are absolutely fantastic and correct i had a
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.520]  a simple idea probably didn't originate from me but how do we uh i mean can't
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:37.480]  it's impossible we can take people like professor griff
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.160]  you know the real rick ross the real guy uh and send them you know on a little
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:44.120]  tour like a small tour like you know maybe five cities or should just see
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.600]  how it goes and send them to inner cities let them
[02:36:46.600 --> 02:36:50.040]  let them talk to the kids let them talk to the violent the violent
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:53.480]  people you know that we really need to change because there's plenty of good
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.160]  people in those black communities you know if you don't hear them on the tv
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.960]  and they've had the courage to come on our show and talk about that and as a
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.080]  matter of fact rick ross was going around in texas here that's when
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.720]  josh went around and filmed him that's part of our report that we put up yeah
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:08.920]  i agree that's a very important message to get out
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:14.440]  yes thank you mm-hmm thank you very much eric in texas let's go to uh
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:20.920]  chris in nevada go ahead chris well good morning david and paul
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:26.360]  good morning what's on your mind well i'm a former multi-jurisdictional law
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:30.600]  enforcement professional myself having served in four different
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:35.560]  distinct jurisdictions and attended four of their different and separate
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.680]  training academies i wanted to comment on the
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:47.960]  divided misinterpretation or made to be misinterpreted word term
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:55.640]  crime that is set forth in the probable cause description
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:59.720]  probable cause is described as the facts or circumstances that would cause a
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:06.120]  reasonable man to conclude that one a crime has been committed and
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:10.440]  two the person accused committed said crime
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:16.360]  however the word term crime has a specifically delineated meaning
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.760]  constituting that of a felony criminal nature set forth in the
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:27.160]  case thompson versus smith which says for a law
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:30.680]  enforcement officer to have a permissible purpose to be in the
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:35.080]  presence of an individual to make further inquiry he must be able to
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.720]  articulate with extreme specificity the facts or circumstances
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:43.880]  that would cause him to conclude that one a particular
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:49.240]  felony crime had been committed and two the circumstances that would cause him
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:52.280]  to conclude that the person he was stopping
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:57.800]  had some reasonable basis for relating to that felony crime
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:01.160]  okay so so what do you think about these uh two indictments here what's your
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.880]  opinion of of them should they should there have been grand jury indictments
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:09.720]  well what you're seeing there is what's referred to in law is
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:13.800]  lex locae emtori the local law of the emperor
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:20.280]  common parliance is called hometown whenever the jurisdiction that you're
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:25.640]  in is paid for all the police the prosecutors the
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:30.840]  judges uh has their veritable financial liability on the
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:35.320]  line it's to their particular interest to have the
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:40.360]  pre-concluded accumulation of the grand jury or purport
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:44.920]  it's probably a jury trial better than a trial by jury specifically
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:48.840]  but the like you observed in fact i really have to compliment lionel that
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:51.720]  was on here earlier he was an immensely knowledgeable
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:55.320]  experienced prosecutor but he was more of a fender
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:01.960]  but these insinuations for the prosecution in league with the judge
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:07.240]  in their particular court can put their thumb on the scales of justice
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:12.280]  and use their prosecutorial and judicial discretion
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.760]  to influence the presentment and of course the counties have unlimited
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:19.880]  resources to develop the evidence and take and
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:22.760]  choose or cherry pick the evidence that's most
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:26.920]  effectuous to the presentment of their point or political agenda that they
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.000]  wish to put forth to the jury yeah and going to that in the case
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.160]  in Ferguson Missouri for example what we have learned as some of these records
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:37.480]  have been released and they're typically not released at a grand jury is we
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:40.680]  learned things like uh Darren Wilson was allowed to
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:43.960]  wipe any and all blood off of himself he was allowed to wipe
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.280]  off the gun which was a key part of the story that he was wrestling
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:52.760]  with michael brown with his gun and he was able to wipe that off so they
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:55.960]  couldn't verify that they had any fingerprints of michael brown on the
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.960]  gun we also know they didn't record the
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:01.720]  conversation we know that the officer who investigated the scene of the crime
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:05.880]  said he didn't really see any need to measure the distance between the police
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.000]  car the police officer and michael brown when he was
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.760]  shot all of these things start to come out of the grand
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:16.040]  jury trial and so you look at this and you say well do we really have a fair
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:19.240]  hearing here i think that what's going to happen is certainly
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:22.600]  it's going to move to a civil venue and there's still going to be some liability
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.880]  there of course the taxpayers will be the ones who wind up paying that but i
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:29.800]  wonder if these guys were criminally convicted of these police
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:34.280]  officers because of their training because of the way they've been equipped
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:36.760]  and trained i wonder if they would in turn
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:40.760]  sue the city for damages because they were doing what they were
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:44.360]  trained to do uh paul did you want to comment on this
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:48.760]  yeah just on the brown case i mean the ballistics and the blood splatter show
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:53.960]  that brown's blood was on wilson's gun the autopsy results also show that
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:59.080]  brown's thumb was grazed by a bullet which directly suggests that there was a
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.440]  struggle for the gun and that brown tried to grab wilson's
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.920]  gun backing up wilson's testimony also the eyewitnesses
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:10.120]  many of them told the police that they were intimidated
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.640]  by other people living in the immediate area to
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:18.200]  verify this myth that was created by brown's accomplice in the
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:21.960]  robbery of the convenience store which was that brown had his hands up when he
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:25.560]  was shot the autopsy results again say that that's
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:29.800]  false they say that the claim that he was shot in the back is false so
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:33.160]  a bunch of witnesses basically got caught lying and then the ballistics the
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:37.400]  blood splatter um the autopsy results do back up wilson's
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.800]  account which is why i base my judgment on that evidence and which i believe is
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.360]  why the grand jury uh i don't really want to get into you know rehashing
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:49.720]  all the details of the trial and everything i think though what
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:53.160]  the documents that we've seen come out of the grand jury i think show that
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.120]  there's a very different standard of evidence for example
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:00.600]  if i as a private citizen were involved in a shooting
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.120]  and i wiped all the fingerprints off the gun that might
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:07.240]  in and of itself be probable cause to have a
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.680]  a a murder trial or something for me so there's a very different standard of
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:13.160]  evidence there's a very they actually they have a law
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:16.360]  enforcement bill of rights it was put in by senator joe biden
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:20.760]  after multiple times that give a very different approach a very different
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:25.800]  presumption special protections with the police unions and other other things
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.200]  that allow the police to actually have a second a superior bill of rights which
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:33.160]  of course they don't pay much attention to our bill of rights
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:38.360]  but they get a special uh privileged uh approached all this and that's what i
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:42.200]  see coming out of some of these records uh coming out of the grand jury which i
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:45.880]  think is more relevant in the broader scheme of things whether or not
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:49.080]  officer wilson was justified in that and again i don't want to make it so much
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:53.240]  about wilson versus brown or black versus white because this is a very
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:57.560]  broad problem and we and we have a lot of systemic bias a lot of systemic
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:02.200]  corruption and we have a lot of systemic training for violence uh that's
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:07.240]  that's going on this let's go to uh shon in tennessee shon go ahead
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:10.920]  hey how you doing um former police officer i also help
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:14.920]  uh teach constitutional and statutory law with the upper east tennessee
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:17.800]  research institute one thing i wanted to talk about was the fact that
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.320]  jurisdiction we keep talking about all these entities getting away with
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:26.680]  everything they're doing including militarization of the uh police nowadays
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:30.200]  problem is uh like in the money rant issue remember he kept saying i don't
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:32.360]  have a contract with the federal government and they don't have
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:35.720]  jurisdiction yes the fbi cannot write you a speeding
[02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:39.000]  ticket on a roadway because they only have jurisdiction within the
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.280]  territorial jurisdiction of the united states yes and that is
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:46.920]  washington dc and we keep we keep believing the myth that the united
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:49.480]  states of america and the united states are the same thing and then the
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:52.840]  articles of confederation and in the constitution they're not
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:56.200]  that's a very good point when i was at the bunny ranch one of the things that
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.200]  they you know the thing they were most concerned about uh was the violence
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:03.880]  that was being perpetrated against people and that morning that they had
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:07.240]  to stand off later on in the day that morning when uh sheriff gillespie
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:09.960]  showed up at the bunny ranch
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:14.760]  clavin bundy said to him i want you to confiscate the weapons of the blm
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.280]  i want you to open up these roadblocks into these areas because you are the
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:21.640]  one with jurisdiction i'm going to wait a couple hours for you to do this and
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:24.680]  when he didn't do it that's when he said let's go get our cattle
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:27.080]  back because the sheriff wasn't going to do anything
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:30.360]  it's local law enforcement that has the jurisdiction you're absolutely right
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.600]  shon um if you don't mind there's a there's a famous
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.560]  case it's called baren versus the city of baltimore a lot of us believe we have
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:42.360]  constitutional rights we don't as men we are above the constitution and
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:45.800]  outside of it the constitution was written for the united state
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:49.720]  as a limitation on their power not a grand tour of ours we have
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:54.120]  unalienable rights numerator than the declaration from the creator
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:58.200]  and as long as we don't harm anyone there is no crime
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.400]  they can't charge you with marijuana and stuff like i feel like
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:05.880]  when i did that i didn't understand that cops don't understand that code
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:10.760]  is under the uniform commercial code and that walls and codes are two totally
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:16.680]  different things they are not a code is a copyrighted private copyrighted
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:21.160]  list of codes and regulations for a particular jurisdiction and it's only
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:24.760]  a political the corporation state and attorneys
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:29.400]  yes the bar association is not a license to practice law we had a law for
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.960]  a hundred years before the bar ever existed
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:37.080]  the problem is the american people have become completely ignorant as to who
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:39.720]  they are and they're supposed to be above
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:45.480]  the government we don't complain as men and women we file claims on their oaths
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:48.520]  of office in breach of their judiciary duty
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:51.880]  and in breach of their contract when they commit perjury
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:55.080]  and we take their bonds from them that's how you hold them accountable we don't
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:58.040]  keep complaining and whining why do they keep doing this
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:01.240]  absolutely their power away you're absolutely right
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:04.760]  we have those rights from god and we established
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:08.200]  the government and the constitution to protect those rights
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.120]  and they've turned this upside down shon you're going to really enjoy the
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:15.560]  interview that we had with greg morse about this entire
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:20.200]  banking system i mean this thing is is like the iran contra going from
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.120]  the very beginning where they break the chain of title all the way to the
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:26.920]  funding the black ops through the swiss banks
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:30.680]  uh that's a very important process and one of the things that's very important
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:33.640]  about this interview and what greg morse is trying to do and this is someone
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:37.640]  who was involved in the early days of the savings and loan crisis and that is
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.440]  to force a review of this illegal operation that they're doing they went
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:48.120]  in and just these bankers completely changed the way we record and
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.560]  register our properties broke the chain of titles with these new
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:56.040]  institutions that they created from 1995 to 1999
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:59.560]  they created this crisis they created these institutions they've hoodwinked
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:03.880]  the public and then they use that money to fund wars to overthrow governments
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:07.720]  to push the drug war to put it into these black ops that's an important
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:11.080]  thing for people to understand where their rights come from if you want to
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.600]  audit the fed start with auditing your own mortgage see what's going on with
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:17.480]  that um thank you so much shon let's uh i want to try to get some of these other
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.840]  people to comment i want to give uh paul a chance to talk let's go to uh
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:26.200]  jacob in ohio and i'll let paul uh respond his call go ahead jacob
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:32.840]  yes hi um i just recently turned 18 and i kind of did a shadow program with our
[02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:36.680]  local police station
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:42.440]  and well basically it was outrageous some of the stuff that they caught me and
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.680]  some of the stuff they were teaching the other
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:49.160]  shadowers that were that drove around the cops and hung out in the police station
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:53.560]  and well just any questions that you have for me about
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:57.880]  when i was in the program well you so you're basically following them around
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:03.560]  like a career day right yeah okay tell us tell us one thing that was the most
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:06.040]  out you said you're outraged by what happened what was the most outrageous
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:11.800]  thing that you saw well one night it was i think nine
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.080]  fifteen at night there was a group of i think
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:18.120]  four or five teenagers outside of a mcdonald's
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.800]  and one of them took off running and they obviously were dealing drugs or
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:25.880]  something and it turned out to be a dying bag of weed
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.040]  i got out of the car and said you know stop you know and then
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:36.360]  deputy kane came out he didn't shoot him but he got the tazer and shot a i
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:40.920]  think he was a 15 year old boy he shot him with a tazer
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:45.720]  and he sat there and you know twitched out man
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.720]  literally uh well we have a situation here in uh
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.840]  in texas right outside of austin is down a bass drop
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.800]  they had a fight that was going on and between a couple of people a third party
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:00.760]  got between them according to witnesses and broke that up and then you see a
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:05.800]  videotape of a of a cop just walking up and tazering that kid
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:09.480]  not really assessing the situation tazering him he falls down on the
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:12.680]  concrete floor brain damage still in a coma i believe
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:15.320]  that's a lawsuit that's working its way through so
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:19.000]  that's that's something you shadowed the cops as part of your
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.320]  school program i think that's an important thing for people to
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:26.920]  understand what's going on to look at the rules that they're
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:30.840]  giving them to engage the public and have a real discussion about what
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.360]  appropriate use of force is and i hear the music coming in we've got to go to

[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:19.720]  in the uk and we've been taking cars uh george in
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:22.600]  canada can i know you've been holding for a while i want to get back to you
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:25.960]  and overdrive and the other callers that are there i've only got paul for this one
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:31.880]  last segment and i wanted to get his take on what obama is proposing in the
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:36.120]  wake of these high-profile police violence cases
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:42.520]  we've had him propose 263 million dollars for body cameras
[02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:47.160]  we see that eric holder says he can end racism with racist quotas
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:51.480]  and now we've got a police chief that's going to chair the 21st century
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:55.800]  committee on chairing on a 21st century policing
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:03.160]  task force that has a real troubled past this is a police chief who is the
[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:06.680]  police chief of philadelphia he on his watch they say and this is in the
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:09.640]  anti-media.org they say a federal investigation to corruption was
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:13.560]  launched over conspiracy robbery extortion kidnapping and drug
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:16.840]  dealing that's the guy you picked to chair your
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:21.080]  task force on 21st century policing they say the philadelphia police were also
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:25.160]  caught ignoring thousands of rape cases to keep their crime numbers low what i
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:28.440]  talked about earlier in the program going on new york police department
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:32.040]  and even though marijuana was decriminalized he
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:35.480]  is still saying that he's going to continue
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:40.520]  to arrest people pursuant to pennsylvania law even though they decriminalize it
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:45.240]  there in philadelphia paul your reaction on obama's solutions
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:48.360]  well of course the body camera solution has been
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:53.000]  rendered completely invalid by this eric garner case where
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:58.280]  the guy who filmed the choking death himself was indicted and the cop wasn't
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:01.720]  so that's gone completely out of the window that doesn't even matter anymore
[02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:06.280]  that's right as far as racist quotas what are they going to arrest more white
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:09.480]  people to get the quotas up i mean what kind of solution is that
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:12.280]  yeah because we have these private prisons that are guaranteed to have a
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:15.640]  certain occupancy rate so if they're going to arrest people like people i
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:18.280]  guess we're going to have to get more of everybody else to fill up these
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:20.520]  prisons because we got this private prison
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:24.920]  military industrial complex well you know there's some interesting stats that
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:29.080]  have just come out of the center on juvenile and criminal justice department
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:33.960]  in 2012 123 blacks were killed by police with a gun
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:39.560]  and in the same year 326 whites were killed by police with a gun
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:45.000]  so if you take out hispanics from that white total that is generally um in
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.400]  coordination with the population of white and black people in america
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.400]  including hispanics whites are about 70 percent of the population blacks are
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.000]  about 13 percent so if those stats are accurate
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.440]  out of the center on juvenile and criminal justice department
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:05.640]  which says that police killings of blacks are down 70 in the last 50 years
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:09.240]  then again it emphasizes the point that this is not about race
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:13.400]  this is about police brutality which is what i've tried to emphasize
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:16.760]  all along but that's what the social justice warriors
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:20.200]  are taking as a way the focus away from that
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:23.240]  making it about white people and white privilege
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:26.440]  when it's about violence and of course they can take this in any direction
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:28.840]  they want to to avoid any kind of reform
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:33.240]  we also talking about how futile it is to say that body cameras are going to
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.440]  actually uh stop anything we saw the murder of that homeless man outside of
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:40.440]  albuquerque we saw that on a body camera
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:45.400]  we've seen the two recent shootings one of a guy in walmart he was going to buy
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:49.400]  a BB gun we saw that on video he was shot by cops without warning
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:53.880]  we saw a 12 year old who had a BB gun shot by cops we saw that on video
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:57.320]  shot without warning and in both of those cases the amazing thing is even though
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:01.640]  they were holding BB guns people turned the direction
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:05.320]  onto the BB guns and said well we shouldn't even have toy guns because
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:07.320]  people are getting killed with toy guns so let's
[02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:11.160]  ban the toy guns instead of addressing cops who show up on the scene
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:14.680]  shooting first exactly and in the case of the 12 year old
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:17.720]  I mean he was shot instantly there was no hesitation absolutely
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:20.760]  absolutely he jumps out and it was a rookie that's what they're training the
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:24.600]  rookies do thank you so much for joining us Paul Joseph Watson from the UK
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.120]  stay with us right after the break and overdrive we're going to take
[02:58:28.120 --> 02:58:31.400]  the people who've been holding on call try to get as many of those as we can
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:41.480]  through we'll be right back
[02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:58.840]  this is GCN the genesis communications radio network
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:03.960]  fix bayonets we are now entering overdrive with your host
[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:07.880]  alex jones broadcasting live from the front lines
[02:59:07.880 --> 02:59:17.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:21.080]  welcome back to overdrive I wanted to get some of the callers who've been
[02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:25.160]  waiting a long time uh patiently I wanted to finish up with Paul
[02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:27.960]  Joseph Watson while still had him in the UK but let's go to your calls and I
[02:59:27.960 --> 02:59:33.400]  see if we can get through as many as we can here George in Connecticut
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:38.200]  hi Paul I'm the I was listening to Curtis
[02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:44.040]  Sliwa and Ron Kuby at a New York station I think it's indicated throughout the
[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:47.240]  United States and they were talking about the issues and they said the major
[02:59:47.240 --> 02:59:50.760]  they had an expert on there that was sort of neutral he wasn't pro-cop
[02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:54.600]  whatever he's been involved in this uh situations in New York
[02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:58.920]  routinely and he said it was mainly because it was in Staten Island
[02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:02.200]  Staten Island is a bedroom community for lots of the police
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:05.560]  including their families so if you have mostly family and
[03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:08.680]  people who were related to the cops in one way or another
[03:00:08.680 --> 03:00:15.080]  it's harder than ever to get a jury to and the other point they were making
[03:00:15.080 --> 03:00:17.480]  that they should have probably had a special prosecutor
[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:21.240]  but I have another slant on this as well because I've been victimized by police
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:23.800]  as well as not being victimized in other
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:27.400]  countries anybody who thinks that this is the way we should do
[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:30.840]  police business they should do a google search on how many
[03:00:30.840 --> 03:00:36.920]  people were killed by cops in Japan zero probably in the last 10 years oh
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:40.040]  yeah we've had more in one year than they've
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:43.480]  had in the entire history of policing in the UK and they've got a much longer
[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:45.880]  history of policing there than we do here
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:49.320]  and I've had incidents with police in Japan because I lived there several years
[03:00:49.320 --> 03:00:52.600]  and uh even started yelling at a cop because he kept
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:56.200]  bothering me every time I went by he thought all white guys look the same
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:00:59.480]  you know I tell him we don't look the same can't you
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.400]  remember that yeah that's that's part of the problem
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.760]  well you know Lionel said that pointed out that
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:10.120]  in many states if it's a felony they'll go straight for
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:13.960]  a trial they don't go through the grand jury process I think one solution would
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:17.880]  be for these situations especially when people
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:20.520]  are calling into question the excessive use of force I think they ought to go
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:23.080]  directly to a trial skip the grand jury stuff
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:27.320]  we don't need to see some kind of a secretive non trial we need to have this
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:31.320]  as a real trial it needs to be have some outside involvement not just the
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:34.520]  people who live there in the community not people who are part of the system
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:38.440]  and this is a bigger problem than just Staten Island this is a bigger problem
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:41.880]  than white versus black this is a national problem this is happening
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:45.720]  all over the country these rules of engagement this militarization
[03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:48.840]  of the police that's being driven out of Washington thank you so much
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:52.600]  George in Connecticut let's go to uh Dave in New York Dave
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.040]  hey guys how you doing do a great job okay thank you go ahead what's your
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:01.480]  question um I want to comment on the difficulty
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:04.920]  of cooperating and I want to tell you a story I hope
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:08.120]  you can put on your website it would help us
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:12.200]  we're fighting a case where a gentleman was charged with murder
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:15.560]  what led up to the charges is he found out he had a fugitive
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:20.920]  living next door and when he when he helped the guy
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:25.400]  eventually the guy told him that he was uh confessed he was wanted for rape
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:29.640]  and my guy went to the police he made arrangements with the police
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:34.760]  to deliver this guy to the police so he takes him down the road
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:38.600]  he pulled the guy over for speeding reprimand my guy
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:42.200]  through speeding and pulled the the cell out of the car
[03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:46.440]  gently and courteously and asked him who he is and then
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:50.200]  without even cuffing him we're checking to see if there is a warrant they take
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:54.520]  him back to the shack where he stays where he promptly
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:03:01.720]  bolts having no cuffs on them they assure my guy no big deal
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:05.880]  but next day they amount an enormous manhunt
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:10.600]  which my guy again assists telling them to lay of the land
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:15.400]  they surround the wrong building they flush this guy into a reservoir
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:18.600]  where he's swimming at what half a mile an hour
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:25.400]  they ride to the opposite side of the reservoir with swat dogs helicopter
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:29.640]  boat and they miss the guy somehow they lose him
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:33.320]  but do you think this guy we're almost we got 10 seconds was this guy
[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:36.200]  involved with him you think
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:39.400]  no he was not but when he showed up the next day my guy
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:42.280]  shot him after trying to arrest him when he lunched at it
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:45.720]  oh well that's all the time we've got tonight nightly news hang on we'll get
