[02:25.760 --> 02:30.520]  Burma's pop in because he has watched clips of the new BBC hit piece that
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.960]  aired last night in England covering up the building 7 control demolition he is
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.080]  now out there watching the full film he's finally gotten a full download of it
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.880]  you only saw clips last night that have been uploaded to YouTube he's reading a
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.880]  synopsis of the film different synopsis that were done by British viewers but
[02:47.880 --> 02:52.360]  more importantly a big hit piece was written that came out last night on the
[02:52.360 --> 02:58.120]  BBC website with it saying 9 11 truth people are dangerous insane cult members
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.980]  and are just just very very evil and very very wicked and part of some type of
[03:02.980 --> 03:07.080]  devil cult because we know they blew up all three of the buildings and have all
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.800]  these physicists and scientists and engineers and NIST own report has been
[03:11.800 --> 03:15.760]  leaked saying that fires couldn't make it fall down and underwriting laboratories
[03:15.760 --> 03:21.560]  have the same thing and their witnesses in the film are the well one of them's
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.120]  owner of control demolition incorporated who of course help cover up the
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.120]  Oklahoma City bombing help remove the rubble there blew up what was left of
[03:29.120 --> 03:32.840]  the building most of it of course were involved in destroying the quote wreckage
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.800]  and coordinating it off with the 9-11 situation but of course they don't
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.560]  mention in the TV show that it was that they were involved in all of that don't
[03:41.560 --> 03:47.200]  want to tell the cattle that I just let the cattle think that your expert isn't
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.560]  connected in any way to the government's official story kind of like all the top
[03:51.560 --> 03:58.160]  NIST engineers I just so happen to be of thousands and thousands of engineers in
[03:58.160 --> 04:04.880]  the US they happen to be just a few involved in NASA developed explosive
[04:04.880 --> 04:11.560]  thermite thermate that can be sprayed on and of course that is been identified
[04:11.560 --> 04:17.000]  by engineers physicists scientists in multiple samples as one of the compounds
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.680]  used to bring down tower one two and of course seven and then magically they're
[04:22.680 --> 04:26.840]  the ones involved covering it up and magically they're the ones involved in
[04:26.840 --> 04:34.280]  explosive thermate hmm what do you know what do you know what do you say okay

[07:49.440 --> 08:01.640]  today ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:25.160 --> 08:32.080]  I attempt to be as conscious and it's focused and as accurate about the world
[08:32.080 --> 08:37.600]  around me as I can possibly be does that mean that I can fully grasp what the
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.800]  new world order is up to and doing no does that mean I have all the answers
[08:40.800 --> 08:47.640]  no but we are attempting here and we are doing the best possible job we can to
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.160]  rally the population to awaken to the fact that there is an overarching world
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.600]  government that they do not have your best interest at heart and in fact they
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.880]  have a very horrible plans for all of us and in fact have carried out many of
[09:02.880 --> 09:08.520]  those plans with captive populations in the third world and we're in a race
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.640]  against time to wake up a country in a Western world that is fat dumb and
[09:14.640 --> 09:22.040]  happy that has had it good so long and that has a false image of the world in
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.480]  their minds I mean how do you reach out to them how do you wake them up I was
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.960]  thinking this morning about people I talked to visiting family this weekend
[09:31.960 --> 09:37.400]  out in East Texas and how I would try to explain to them because they would all
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.280]  be discussing why is gasoline up why is why are we paying four dollars and you
[09:42.280 --> 09:45.840]  know twenty cents a gallon for gas why are they paying in some areas of the
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.680]  country five fifty five a gallon for gas how bad is it gonna get well the news
[09:50.680 --> 09:54.600]  said this might be yet the news said that might be it and I would just sit
[09:54.600 --> 10:04.120]  there quietly and say well no it's it's it's dollar devaluation and the best
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.480]  parallel or anecdotal example of this that I've seen is let's say you they've
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.800]  got a famous Mickey Mantler Babe Ruth car but they're supposedly only one left
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.320]  of some limited car and it's worth fifty something million dollars and then they
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.000]  find one more of those Babe Ruth cards now it's only worth ten million dollars
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.800]  or they find a box full of a hundred of them now the cards only worth ten
[10:27.800 --> 10:34.800]  thousand dollars a piece well it's the same thing with dollars if they triple
[10:34.800 --> 10:41.800]  the money supply in the last couple years then it's it's going to be devalued
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.080]  or if they and of course people say well how much money have they printed well
[10:46.080 --> 10:52.200]  they made that secret two years ago but most the private firms and outfits that
[10:52.200 --> 10:57.080]  analyze that say there's been a tripling in the money supply but that doesn't
[10:57.080 --> 11:03.720]  mean physical notes that is a tiny fraction less than three percent of what
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.720]  has been issued in quote you know liquidity through the Federal Reserve
[11:07.720 --> 11:13.080]  most of it is digital and electronic and then people say well why is it
[11:13.080 --> 11:16.400]  important they're devaluing the money I mean that's the most ridiculous question
[11:16.400 --> 11:19.720]  I've ever heard in my life but but but I guess we've never had our currency
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.440]  devalued at least this fast and so I guess in a way it is a legitimate
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.400]  question because it destroys your savings it destroys your investments it
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.520]  discredits our currency which is the World Reserve currency and the reason we
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.520]  can still run a hundred plus billion dollar a month trade deficit alone with
[11:42.520 --> 11:50.800]  China that's not the giant trade deficit every month with Mexico or India or with
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.000]  hundreds of other countries that's just with China alone go look it up yourself
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.880]  it's always changing I've seen the trade deficit as high as a hundred and eighty
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.800]  billion dollars a month with China and we're not sending them anything where
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.520]  they're not buying anything to speak of from us all they're doing is sending back
[12:10.520 --> 12:19.860]  DVD players and toys and Crayolas and medicine and picnic table blankets
[12:19.860 --> 12:31.440]  picnic table table cloths just you name it fireworks it comes over here and then
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.360]  the currency the fiat currency goes over there and then they use the fiat
[12:35.360 --> 12:41.120]  currency to buy up ports and roads and water districts and companies and
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.360]  factories and Boeing and it all then moves over there and then what are we
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.860]  left with a bunch of DVD players that break two weeks after you get them out
[12:49.860 --> 12:55.780]  of the box and I guess that's okay as long as they're still holding the fiat
[12:55.780 --> 12:59.980]  currency it just destroys our industry destroys our jobs but we've still got a
[12:59.980 --> 13:06.980]  bunch of confetti fiat currency that people will take and ensure your standard
[13:06.980 --> 13:11.540]  of living starts going down but but but you still got the trinkets of power you
[13:11.540 --> 13:18.580]  still got these symbols of of of wealth but then reality starts setting in and
[13:18.580 --> 13:22.820]  they start dumping the dollars and they start dumping the dollars into any
[13:22.820 --> 13:29.980]  asset they can that they think has real value and so you got oil up 70% of its
[13:29.980 --> 13:34.740]  increase is this according to Bob Chapman and Joseph Sticklitz and
[13:34.740 --> 13:38.620]  everybody else and OPEC people say well where do you get this info I just have
[13:38.620 --> 13:43.380]  the experts on I I report what OPEC is saying in Bloomberg and the Financial
[13:43.380 --> 13:48.940]  Times of London you'll never hear it here because God forbid the public find
[13:48.940 --> 13:55.100]  out that 70 plus percent of it is dollar devaluation and then the other 25% or so
[13:55.100 --> 14:00.260]  that is speculation that is totally caused by the fact that people are
[14:00.260 --> 14:06.140]  saying well even if fuel is overpriced I don't care at least it can't be
[14:06.140 --> 14:13.900]  devalued overnight like the dollar is and so as bad as you think people paying
[14:13.900 --> 14:19.420]  an average of what is it 420 a gallon for gas I got USA Today here in many rural
[14:19.420 --> 14:26.460]  areas where they got to ship the fuel in they're paying 550 plus for gas people
[14:26.460 --> 14:31.620]  are leaving towns are becoming ghost towns because they can't drive the 25
[14:31.620 --> 14:35.660]  miles or 70 miles or 50 miles that they've got different cases here in this
[14:35.660 --> 14:40.420]  USA Today article to buy the gas or they can't drive into work anymore and so
[14:40.420 --> 14:44.220]  they're leaving they're abandoning their family farms and ranches and then now
[14:44.220 --> 14:48.140]  they're going to live in a subsistence level and growing trailer parks and tent
[14:48.140 --> 14:52.500]  cities in other small towns that happen to have a filling station than that and
[14:52.500 --> 14:57.740]  gone out of business and now they're going to get their farms repossessed
[14:58.420 --> 15:05.140]  we're seeing the grapes of wrath you know it took three years to really get
[15:05.140 --> 15:14.500]  the depression raging from 1929 until the depths in 1933 late 1933 and the
[15:14.500 --> 15:19.180]  War Powers Act was declared and federal martial law was installed the state
[15:19.180 --> 15:23.660]  police were set up as federal police to oversee the emergency reorganized
[15:23.660 --> 15:28.340]  states under the federal government's control and now we've been off the races
[15:28.340 --> 15:32.660]  being domesticated being being that's how you domesticate a wild pig or a
[15:32.660 --> 15:36.580]  horse is feeding them training them to come into the government pens getting
[15:36.580 --> 15:41.820]  them domesticated and now we're being taken to slaughter our children are
[15:41.820 --> 15:45.860]  pumped full of fake patriotism an American flag made in China by slaves
[15:45.860 --> 15:50.180]  is stuck on their face and told submit to the flag they march off for the new
[15:50.180 --> 15:55.180]  world order to steal oil and for trillions of dollars and no bid
[15:55.180 --> 16:07.140]  contracts the Halliburton's and the dine cores and the mercenary armies like
[16:07.140 --> 16:12.700]  blackwater all move overseas leave the US are still hailed as pro-america and
[16:12.700 --> 16:18.260]  loved and worshipped and I start thinking about where this is going to go
[16:18.260 --> 16:21.220]  where this is going to lead I mean it's really going to happen we're really
[16:21.220 --> 16:24.980]  going to enter into hyperinflation it's already happening it's going to get
[16:24.980 --> 16:30.900]  worse and worse and as bad as it is now if the people could just wake up to the
[16:30.900 --> 16:36.660]  fact if they could just learn that it was the government with policies openly
[16:36.660 --> 16:43.060]  trying to devalue the dollar and OPEC is begging them to sure up the dollar and
[16:43.060 --> 16:47.300]  press releases and trying to buy more dollars to sure it up even some
[16:47.300 --> 16:50.460]  European sovereign wealth institutions have been trying to sure up the dollar
[16:50.460 --> 16:53.980]  and then every time they do the Treasury Department the private Federal Reserve
[16:53.980 --> 16:58.900]  and the White House and the Congress say no no we're we're we're letting the
[16:58.900 --> 17:03.460]  dollar slide don't do that and so there's even big interest trying to prop
[17:03.460 --> 17:07.220]  it up because they're scared of what it's going to do not because they care
[17:07.220 --> 17:10.620]  about you and your family they care about their own interest they're afraid
[17:10.620 --> 17:16.940]  of a global meltdown but the big boys on top say hey we're doing this we're
[17:16.940 --> 17:22.580]  putting the dollar and the United States's economic future on the altar of
[17:22.580 --> 17:26.900]  the New World Order because the US has to fall and it's happening from within
[17:26.900 --> 17:33.300]  and I hear these good old boys knowing them Iranians may want to jack up the
[17:33.300 --> 17:37.580]  price of our oil but we're gonna nuke them bastards for doing it Iran has
[17:37.580 --> 17:44.060]  nothing to do with it and the good old boys think new king Iran is going to get
[17:44.060 --> 17:50.340]  them more oil let me explain something if just the talk of a blockade has fuel
[17:50.340 --> 17:59.300]  above 145 a barrel $145 a barrel just talk of it may drive it up to $200 a
[17:59.300 --> 18:02.500]  barrel as Ron Paul just said last Thursday here and as the Wall Street
[18:02.500 --> 18:08.740]  Journal said today you understand Jack and what are you saying you're saying

[24:21.660 --> 24:30.860]  world's debt around our necks and leave us and our progeny with the bill if we
[24:30.860 --> 24:34.940]  are ignorant and unaware of how the World Banking System works and how they
[24:34.940 --> 24:39.340]  engineered this giant Ponzi scheme they use the profits from the Ponzi scheme to
[24:39.340 --> 24:44.180]  buy up control the world they are now again imploding the Ponzi scheme running
[24:44.180 --> 24:49.900]  off out of town with the money offshore and leaving us holding the bill now the
[24:49.900 --> 24:56.540]  the slide into total serfdom is now accelerating and it's going to get worse
[24:56.540 --> 25:00.660]  and worse and we have to ask ourselves listeners how do we get the word out to
[25:00.660 --> 25:06.180]  the general public how do we teach them about basic economics how do we teach
[25:06.180 --> 25:12.140]  them how in third world nations different corrupt groups of politicians
[25:12.140 --> 25:17.260]  would do this on a accelerated basis where big foreign multinational
[25:17.260 --> 25:21.460]  corporations the IMF the World Bank will come in and give them say a $20
[25:21.460 --> 25:26.620]  billion loan wink wink they are then ordered not to pay that back behind the
[25:26.620 --> 25:33.500]  scenes the politicians then sign over the natural resources of the country for
[25:33.500 --> 25:37.460]  pennies on the dollar to the multinationals the politicians keep the
[25:37.460 --> 25:43.620]  billions themselves leave the nation moved to Switzerland or to Spain or to
[25:43.620 --> 25:50.140]  Japan and then leave the third world nation in the hands of the multinationals
[25:50.140 --> 25:56.060]  now under the IMF 100 part plan before they leave in that 10-year period they
[25:56.060 --> 25:59.700]  set up a police state and the IMF and World Bank documents that are right
[25:59.700 --> 26:04.940]  about my book sent to tyranny the BBC is even reported on Greg Paulus they leave
[26:04.940 --> 26:09.860]  a vanguard of militarized police and prisons and a surveillance grid in
[26:09.860 --> 26:14.940]  place before they implode it knowing the people are gonna freak out totally being
[26:14.940 --> 26:19.860]  turned into slaves even the middle class and so they have built that grid they
[26:19.860 --> 26:24.940]  are pulling out of the country they're moving out and they're doing it it's
[26:24.940 --> 26:29.140]  happening and I don't know how you explain to people that what's done to
[26:29.140 --> 26:33.580]  third world countries is being done to us because they're just mesmerized
[26:33.580 --> 26:38.700]  looking at American flags and crying at July 4th events feeling good being told
[26:38.700 --> 26:42.140]  the Arabs are the reason the oil is expensive your government loves you
[26:42.140 --> 26:46.420]  everything's wonderful have fun leaving from the rodeo is or you know from the
[26:46.420 --> 26:50.700]  local event as police run checkpoints everywhere pulling you over feeding on
[26:50.700 --> 26:56.540]  you like lions feeding on gazelles all the illegal aliens are above the law and
[26:56.540 --> 27:00.100]  overrun you with the government the corporations rolling out the red carpet
[27:00.100 --> 27:06.180]  and and saying they're above the law it's just complete lawlessness and I
[27:06.180 --> 27:11.060]  watching my country be rolled up watching my country be looted and just the
[27:11.060 --> 27:14.340]  public completely blind
[27:15.180 --> 27:20.460]  professionals are blind doctors lawyers successful company owners I talked to
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.940]  now a lot of times the light bulb goes off and they go absolutely it is dollar
[27:23.940 --> 27:27.740]  devaluation I've read about dollar devaluation but I never thought that
[27:27.740 --> 27:30.860]  that's the reason gas prices are up or I never thought that they're going to
[27:30.860 --> 27:34.100]  devalue it further they do do that in third world countries you mean there's
[27:34.100 --> 27:39.700]  documents yes let me tell you and some of them go wow that's scary but most of
[27:39.700 --> 27:49.380]  them just well whatever it'll be fine my investments are doing just fine so I
[27:49.380 --> 27:52.580]  know I talk more and more about dollar devaluation I know I talk more and more
[27:52.580 --> 27:56.780]  about what's happening with the economy and gas prices because folks it's going
[27:56.780 --> 28:01.140]  to get worse and worse and worse and worse and we had better all be having
[28:01.140 --> 28:04.220]  a national discussion and debate about what we want to do about this but
[28:04.220 --> 28:12.220]  instead I'd have to say maybe 5% of the population knows what's going on now we
[28:12.220 --> 28:17.020]  were able to get 10 15 20% educated quickly we may be able to turn this
[28:17.020 --> 28:22.060]  around because the globalist won't drop the hammer fully if they know that the
[28:22.060 --> 28:28.660]  public is going to be aware that it was done by design I mean a good third of
[28:28.660 --> 28:31.540]  the Mexican government of their Congress and Salinas their president
[28:31.540 --> 28:36.940]  remember in the early 1990s had to flee because it came out that they devalued
[28:36.940 --> 28:42.620]  the currency by design after looting the nation at the behest of multinationals
[28:42.620 --> 28:53.060]  Chase Manhattan City Bank and others JP Morgan Goldman Sachs see they just run
[28:53.060 --> 28:59.220]  a third world implosion up on us then we're in the middle of it we're in the
[28:59.220 --> 29:04.780]  start of it and the Mexicans even though they were enslaved even though they
[29:04.780 --> 29:11.060]  don't have guns rioted burn cities and ran their government out and then they've
[29:11.060 --> 29:16.540]  built their currency back up somewhat still totally corrupt not America folks
[29:16.540 --> 29:21.580]  they're gonna be drooling and snickering and worshipping television and
[29:21.580 --> 29:29.060]  believing the bankers as they pose as saviors and have an emergency reorganization
[29:29.060 --> 29:33.340]  and I'll tell you what that's gonna look like see instead of instead of knowing
[29:33.340 --> 29:37.700]  who to blame and being able to rebuild they're gonna use the crisis they create
[29:37.700 --> 29:42.900]  to bring us into a new level of tyranny we'll be right back and break that down
[29:42.900 --> 29:52.300]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:58.300 --> 34:02.980]  the attacks as a pretext to launch their global war of tyranny and of course to
[34:02.980 --> 34:09.180]  lock down the domestic operations here and fully set up a control grid here so
[34:09.180 --> 34:13.340]  that we can have our assets fully extracted and so our young people can
[34:13.340 --> 34:18.300]  be used as manpower for the New World Order if you don't understand that the
[34:18.300 --> 34:22.420]  attacks were about capturing our minds so that we would be willing servants of
[34:22.420 --> 34:26.980]  the New World Order believing we were defending our own country you need to

[35:41.060 --> 35:44.980]  anything you've ever seen you know I've always made these voiceover films that
[35:44.980 --> 35:49.740]  are kind of like film books it's a book that's like a film it's like a book and
[35:49.740 --> 35:55.500]  then that has some cinematic sections to it you know some classical documentary
[35:55.500 --> 36:00.860]  formats but this is all documentary this is all true documentary and we're gonna
[36:00.860 --> 36:06.380]  make the next JFK film is going to be somewhat cinema verite it's gonna have
[36:06.380 --> 36:10.340]  some graphics and some diagrams but you know it's mainly about the personal
[36:10.340 --> 36:16.660]  story of you know the son of the CIA hit man and of course then Jim Mars with a
[36:16.660 --> 36:20.700]  narrative and some other top experts but but I'm gonna like I said make two
[36:20.700 --> 36:27.100]  films in that line we're also working on fabled enemies that is a kind of a
[36:27.100 --> 36:31.620]  loose change style film right now but totally new information gets into the
[36:31.620 --> 36:39.540]  Israelis and a lot more that will make everyone mad that will make the hail
[36:39.540 --> 36:43.980]  Israel lobby mad and it will also make those that have their preconceived
[36:43.980 --> 36:49.580]  notions about us because we don't we're not any Semitic we just will expose that
[36:49.580 --> 36:53.980]  Israel was clearly involved at some levels that that will make them even
[36:53.980 --> 36:57.100]  matter because they have the preconceived notice of notion that we don't talk about
[36:57.100 --> 37:00.820]  Israel that we do every day and always have or the preconceived notion that we
[37:00.820 --> 37:04.540]  don't talk about the Vatican which we will always have I think I've had like six
[37:04.540 --> 37:07.660]  guests on the last month and they're still putting out reports that I never
[37:07.660 --> 37:11.900]  cover it again all people have preconceived notions it doesn't matter we
[37:11.900 --> 37:17.460]  put the truth out even people lie and say we don't so that is also coming out

[40:03.940 --> 40:08.100]  unbelievable book stuff I didn't know I thought I knew it all about the occult
[40:08.100 --> 40:11.300]  and their religion of architecture now they believe they get power from it we
[40:11.300 --> 40:16.300]  talked about that for two hours coming up with text Mars in about 20 minutes okay
[40:16.300 --> 40:20.940]  I'm done talking about all that we're getting rave reviews of truth rising as
[40:20.940 --> 40:26.500]  I said and I thank you for being moved by it we were moved by the information in
[40:26.500 --> 40:31.420]  it it humanizes a 9-11 truth movement it will organize people and energize them
[40:31.420 --> 40:35.500]  to get involved in not just fighting for 9-11 truth and confronting the global
[40:35.500 --> 40:41.860]  us but across the board it also again shows what's really happening the 9-11
[40:41.860 --> 40:47.340]  first responders and it shows the police state I mean nothing educates about the
[40:47.340 --> 40:52.740]  police state like police coming up and saying you can't videotape in New York
[40:52.740 --> 40:55.260]  and we're gonna say you're terrorist we know you're not terrorist but we're
[40:55.260 --> 40:59.820]  gonna frame you I mean I mean just police all over the country saying there's no
[40:59.820 --> 41:03.740]  first amendment to people protesting it's all on tape it's just it's just
[41:03.740 --> 41:12.340]  unbelievable okay let me get back now into what's happening with the economy
[41:12.340 --> 41:19.820]  to state it very simply the private banking families that for 200 plus years
[41:19.820 --> 41:26.580]  of controlled England that for 90 plus years of control the United States they
[41:26.580 --> 41:32.860]  want all the assets and they've created hundreds of trillions of dollars it's
[41:32.860 --> 41:38.340]  actually in the thousands of trillions 600 plus trillion in in in imaginary
[41:38.340 --> 41:43.300]  currency and credit that they've bought up most the world with in fact they have
[41:43.300 --> 41:51.260]  thousands of times fiat assets versus all the assets in the world all the lakes
[41:51.260 --> 41:55.860]  all the rivers all the fish all the minerals all your homes all the Picasso's
[41:55.860 --> 42:03.260]  all the Rembrandt's all the Van Gogh's all the movie studios all the mines all
[42:03.260 --> 42:07.900]  the oil all the timber all the intellectual properties thousands and
[42:07.900 --> 42:13.940]  thousands times just fiat assets they've convinced the world in a magic trick
[42:13.940 --> 42:18.900]  that they can issue the currency and the liquidity and that and that but but the
[42:18.900 --> 42:24.860]  problem is people won't turn loose of the final assets and so they need police
[42:24.860 --> 42:28.940]  state mechanisms in Guatemala and Nicaragua and El Salvador and
[42:28.940 --> 42:33.780]  communist China and Russia to forcibly take what people have and they do it
[42:33.780 --> 42:39.460]  over and over again in nations around the world now they are getting ready to
[42:39.460 --> 42:49.180]  do that here now they are setting that system up here in the United States now
[42:49.180 --> 42:54.220]  they're going for broke and now they need to bring us into a depression to
[42:54.220 --> 42:58.300]  fully bankrupt most the population so they'll run to the government and say
[42:58.300 --> 43:02.100]  do anything to feed my family do anything to take care of me they're
[43:02.100 --> 43:06.260]  going to set up work brigades make work systems they're going to have forced
[43:06.260 --> 43:10.460]  national service where you all go on welfare then they're going to with a
[43:10.460 --> 43:16.380]  Barack Obama or whoever or McCain he's a socialist but again for the elite turn
[43:16.380 --> 43:21.260]  the people against the middle class who the who the general public thinks is
[43:21.260 --> 43:24.940]  rich they think if you're in a million dollar house and have ten million
[43:24.940 --> 43:29.020]  dollars that you're an ultra elite not just a middle class person they're
[43:29.020 --> 43:33.940]  going to sick them on you saying we've got to take the rich people's assets to
[43:33.940 --> 43:36.980]  rebuild America and we're going to nationalize this and we're going to
[43:36.980 --> 43:41.040]  nationalize that they've gotten all the court rulings in line and the laws in
[43:41.040 --> 43:47.820]  line and they do this over and over again in hundreds of countries okay and
[43:47.820 --> 43:50.220]  then all the good old boys that thought they were members of the elite are
[43:50.220 --> 43:53.660]  going to get hopping mad that won't matter if they resist they'll just be
[43:53.660 --> 43:56.940]  killed by the local death squads you know them as the SWAT teams now radically
[43:56.940 --> 44:02.380]  expanding now they'll just be taken to a forced labor camp and local SS local
[44:02.380 --> 44:06.420]  thugs will want your wife want your business they'll be given power it
[44:06.420 --> 44:12.220]  always happens the same we're going into a criminal system see tyranny means
[44:12.220 --> 44:17.620]  you're told tyranny's beating up some Muslims and profiling some people and
[44:17.620 --> 44:20.740]  throwing some foreigners out no no no the tyranny means totally getting rid of
[44:20.740 --> 44:24.300]  the borders bringing in unlimited numbers of foreigners and then it means
[44:24.300 --> 44:28.780]  shoving you around in your cowboy hat driving your big truck out there on your
[44:28.780 --> 44:32.500]  ranch house with your oil lease thinking you were David Rockefeller you're
[44:32.500 --> 44:35.460]  going to find out you're not you're going to find out you're a schmuck and a
[44:35.460 --> 44:39.300]  slave it means having your guns taken it means having a gun shoved in your mouth
[44:39.300 --> 44:41.940]  and believe me the local crooks that are going to be working for the feds
[44:41.940 --> 44:44.700]  they're going to be more than happy to do it because they're going to get a piece
[44:44.700 --> 44:49.020]  of it the globalist for their administrative convenience want to
[44:49.020 --> 44:53.540]  work with just a few thugs a few local thugs and they'll run and own
[44:53.540 --> 44:59.300]  everything and you'll kiss their butt and when the other business people and
[44:59.300 --> 45:03.780]  ranchers and people see you getting gunned down or taken to prison they're
[45:03.780 --> 45:07.940]  going to go kiss the butt of the local boss hogs and it's going to get worse
[45:07.940 --> 45:13.660]  and worse okay because you're gilded men you're castrated cowards who just
[45:13.660 --> 45:20.260]  posture posture and strut around acting tough now some of us aren't going to
[45:20.260 --> 45:31.140]  submit and go along with it okay so that's basically what's happening and
[45:31.140 --> 45:36.340]  going on there that's the plan the tyrannies aimed at you the good old
[45:36.340 --> 45:41.580]  boy the know-it-all the flag waiver okay you're the schmuck you're the one
[45:41.580 --> 45:47.180]  they're laughing at and they put out propaganda like this for you when
[45:47.180 --> 45:51.260]  they're getting ready to strike Iran Iran has resumed a bomb project says
[45:51.260 --> 45:55.940]  West London Telegraph Iran has resumed work on constructing highly
[45:55.940 --> 45:59.740]  sophisticated equipment that nuclear experts say is primarily used for
[45:59.740 --> 46:03.580]  building atomic weapons according to the latest intelligence reports received
[46:03.580 --> 46:08.180]  by Western diplomats and of course these are those reports by their agents inside
[46:08.180 --> 46:15.380]  Iran just like inside Iraq who make up whatever they want to put out the work
[46:15.380 --> 46:19.540]  is aimed at developing the blueprint provided by Dr. AQ Khan which is what
[46:19.540 --> 46:23.220]  the US and England provided to Pakistan the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb
[46:23.220 --> 46:28.020]  who sold Iran to tales of how to build atom bombs in the early 1990s they get
[46:28.020 --> 46:31.540]  no proof of that it's all made up Iran's Revolutionary Guard which is overall
[46:31.540 --> 46:34.940]  responsibility for the country's nuclear program has set up several civilian
[46:34.940 --> 46:38.060]  companies to work on the program whose activities are being deliberately
[46:38.060 --> 46:42.180]  concealed from the United Nations nuclear inspector teams the companies
[46:42.180 --> 46:45.500]  based on the outskirts of Tehran or he'll constructing components for the
[46:45.500 --> 46:49.580]  advanced P2 gas centrifuge which can enrich now even if they put thousands
[46:49.580 --> 46:52.500]  of those online it would be five to six years before they could build a
[46:52.500 --> 46:56.540]  primitive weapon but see this is written where the average gullible moron
[46:56.540 --> 47:00.860]  will believe it meanwhile Israel's got 400 nukes Pakistan's got a bunch our
[47:00.860 --> 47:08.460]  government gave them Iran has had the UN totally you know inspect their whole
[47:08.460 --> 47:12.940]  system doesn't matter they've got to blow the daylight side of them because
[47:12.940 --> 47:17.860]  they got to run the gas up to $500 a barrel because they've got to ins to
[47:17.860 --> 47:23.300]  rape us and see while we're being raped will wave flags if there's an attack
[47:23.300 --> 47:31.660]  going on and it just goes on from there so the lots of unsubstantiated bull just
[47:31.660 --> 47:38.660]  like uranium and just like yellow cake and out of Niger and aluminum tubes and
[47:38.660 --> 47:44.260]  nuclear weapons centrifuges hidden under rose bushes in Iraq and all the same
[47:44.260 --> 47:50.260]  stuff germ warfare fear over African monkeys taken to Iran the times of
[47:50.260 --> 47:56.540]  London another big Rupert Murdoch propaganda arm is telling you that they
[47:56.540 --> 48:02.060]  they've they've got bio weapons now hundreds of endangered monkeys are
[48:02.060 --> 48:05.620]  being taken from the African bush and be sent to secretive laboratory in Iran
[48:05.620 --> 48:10.420]  for scientific experiments whichever government does an undercover inquiry by
[48:10.420 --> 48:13.700]  the Sunday Times has revealed that wild monkeys which are banned from
[48:13.700 --> 48:18.220]  experiments in Britain oh see it's the incident they play on your heart strings
[48:18.220 --> 48:22.180]  all the poor monkeys are being freely supplied in large numbers in laboratories
[48:22.180 --> 48:26.660]  in other parts of the world all to undergo invasive and maybe painful
[48:26.660 --> 48:30.340]  experiments leading ultimately to their death these all go on here I'm not saying
[48:30.340 --> 48:33.140]  they're good but the point is playing on your heart strings oh see they're
[48:33.140 --> 48:37.660]  killing monkeys they were adults are like children now they're frozen in a
[48:37.660 --> 48:45.700]  childlike level one Tanzanian dealer who runs African primates an animal
[48:45.700 --> 48:50.180]  supplying company based in Dar Salam said that in recent years he's been
[48:50.180 --> 48:56.820]  selling up to 4,000 vervent monkeys a year to laboratories charging about 60
[48:56.820 --> 49:07.020]  pounds each and it goes on with really no proof to say that they could use them
[49:07.020 --> 49:12.940]  for biological weapons testing but the headline germ warfare fear over African
[49:12.940 --> 49:18.500]  monkeys taken down Tehran now remember how they showed the Afghans
[49:18.500 --> 49:22.580]  supposedly nerve-gassing a yellow lab course it turned out that was a fake
[49:22.580 --> 49:26.620]  video just like all the rest they know how to manipulate just like they said
[49:26.620 --> 49:31.380]  the Iraqis were throwing babies out of incubators turned out it was the head of
[49:31.380 --> 49:36.820]  a USPR firm totally made up never been to collate just just that was
[49:36.820 --> 49:44.740]  admittedly fake didn't matter now we've got to attack Iraq and have a sanctions
[49:44.740 --> 49:48.660]  on them for 18 years and have millions of them die because they threw babies out
[49:48.660 --> 49:55.500]  of incubators talking to the American people like the children that they are
[49:55.500 --> 50:07.300]  and they go on to say that they might use the a germ warfare probe so see we've
[50:07.300 --> 50:11.300]  got to attack them just they got germ warfare just like they claimed Iraq on
[50:11.300 --> 50:17.020]  the eve of the war in 2003 they said they've got secret EMP cannons that can
[50:17.020 --> 50:24.780]  destroy all electronics in the US and it was in the same papers totally made up
[50:24.780 --> 50:31.700]  just talking to the public like their children we come back more war propaganda
[50:31.700 --> 50:35.340]  you know what Ron Paul is saying about what an attack will mean what the Wall
[50:35.340 --> 50:42.620]  Street Journal is saying they're saying the attack is on the attack is on you
[50:42.620 --> 50:48.740]  like $4 gallon gas we'll get ready for a dollar a gallon gas all right we'll be
[50:48.740 --> 51:01.340]  right back stay with us another untold story here it come another untold story

[55:14.900 --> 55:20.220]  nuclear weapons are going to be rained out in their nation and we're now the
[55:20.220 --> 55:31.620]  bad guys pitcher poor sick Americans going to the liquor store buying cases of
[55:31.620 --> 55:38.100]  whiskey no one home barbecuing watching television cheering I know liquor store
[55:38.100 --> 55:41.900]  owners I know pizza place owners whenever they have these wars it's just
[55:41.900 --> 55:45.860]  weeks of drunkenness as good old boys celebrate as they watch the military
[55:45.860 --> 55:50.340]  actions as they feel like they have personal power and associate their
[55:50.340 --> 55:57.420]  manhood with the slaughter with the evil and those poor men have no idea that as
[55:57.420 --> 56:03.380]  they do that their nation's name dies that their nation's honor dies that
[56:03.380 --> 56:07.740]  their currency dies that the globalists are using us just as they destroy
[56:07.740 --> 56:11.660]  Iran and Iraq we are being destroyed that's why they're globalist they're
[56:11.660 --> 56:15.540]  outside the nations they play the nations off against each other there's
[56:15.540 --> 56:21.380]  like they played England and Germany off against each other in World War one
[56:21.380 --> 56:25.660]  which then helped bring down Russia and the globalist in England in the US
[56:25.660 --> 56:31.500]  funded the takedown of Russia and the murder of 50 million Russians at the
[56:31.500 --> 56:37.500]  hands of the communist of the Bolsheviks the international bankers are the
[56:37.500 --> 56:50.340]  master craftsmen the masterminds they understand the dark science of evil and
[56:50.340 --> 56:55.380]  they are carrying it out against us and I see other propaganda listen to this
[56:55.380 --> 56:58.580]  ridiculous headline other times of London and there's literally scores of
[56:58.580 --> 57:03.700]  these today in every major publication Iraq he's a lead of final purge of
[57:03.700 --> 57:09.380]  al-Qaeda meanwhile the United States publicly runs the four Sunni al-Qaeda
[57:09.380 --> 57:13.620]  groups and is using them to attack Iran while telling our gullible idiot public
[57:13.620 --> 57:20.140]  that Iran is running al-Qaeda again their Shiite arch enemies of al-Qaeda based
[57:20.140 --> 57:23.780]  out of Afghanistan based out of Afghanistan but the main base of
[57:23.780 --> 57:30.860]  course is in Saudi Arabia but that's too complex for the average American who is
[57:30.860 --> 57:36.500]  a hog to the slaughter Iraq he's lead final purge of al-Qaeda meanwhile the
[57:36.500 --> 57:42.100]  US runs al-Qaeda that's incredible Americans and Iraq he's forces are
[57:42.100 --> 57:46.700]  driving al-Qaeda in Iraq out of its last redoubt in the north of the country in
[57:46.700 --> 57:50.220]  the culmination of one of the most spectacular victories of the war on
[57:50.220 --> 57:55.260]  terror so they're giving you spectacular victories after being forced from its
[57:55.260 --> 57:59.780]  strongholds in the west and center of Iraq in the past two years al-Qaeda's
[57:59.780 --> 58:03.860]  dwindling band of fighters has made a defiant last stand in the northern city
[58:03.860 --> 58:09.140]  of Mosul a huge operation to crush the 1,000 hundred fighters who remain from

[59:50.780 --> 1:00:03.700]  network government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:12.500]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:34.380]  finishing up with the big picture I don't have the personnel to do this I am
[1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:38.540]  tempted when I'm getting this bigger office in the next month or so to allow
[1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:43.500]  interns to come in because we don't have the funds to do this to pay people to do
[1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:47.100]  it but I think it's important to educate people because that does seem to
[1:00:47.100 --> 1:00:52.540]  amaze the public and actually get them to listen to me if you go back to the
[1:00:52.540 --> 1:01:01.380]  weeks leading up to the mid-march attack on Iraq in March of 2003 you will hear
[1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:06.500]  me say these exact words and it's the same on every major subject I said
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:10.620]  because we have the Israeli and US battle plans and I read those on air I
[1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:16.100]  said they are not going to leave by Christmas they are not going to leave in
[1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:19.660]  six to eight months as they're saying on the news and I would play clips on air
[1:01:19.660 --> 1:01:25.020]  Rumsfeld's lying they plan to build all of these permanent bases they're going
[1:01:25.020 --> 1:01:29.340]  to break the country in three to four parts they are then going to fund
[1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:34.300]  different elements to kill each other to destabilize and further recognition and
[1:01:34.300 --> 1:01:39.820]  I read the Israeli plan then I said five to seven years in because the plans
[1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:44.940]  differed that they weren't exact about that they said within five to seven they
[1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:49.580]  would then declare victory by paying off the factions to stop killing each other
[1:01:49.580 --> 1:01:54.660]  and then break it up in the three to four parts and then use that strategy of
[1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:58.820]  tension or the British Imperial great game as they call it to export the
[1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:03.540]  violence into Iran and into Syria and then break Iran up into six parts
[1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:10.260]  Syria up into two to three parts linking up with Afghanistan and then being on
[1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:15.420]  the shoulder of Iran then playing Pakistan and India and China all off
[1:02:15.420 --> 1:02:23.940]  against each other and I said they will go in they will fund different fashions
[1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:29.180]  to kill each other and our troops and now it's come out they did just that now
[1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:33.820]  again I'm not a genius I wasn't looking into a crystal ball I read the Israeli
[1:02:33.820 --> 1:02:38.980]  83 plan 84 plan that was even in her odds that then got codified into the
[1:02:38.980 --> 1:02:45.500]  US structure of the plan then the Navy wrote articles on September 10th in the
[1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:52.180]  Washington Post saying Israel may provocateur terror attacks to get us into
[1:02:52.180 --> 1:02:59.860]  a war to carry out this plan you can go pull that report up so again Alex
[1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:03.860]  Jones didn't predict this I want to be clear all I did was go gee here's the
[1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:09.620]  actual plan you're going to see it carried out so go back listeners there's
[1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:13.300]  archives all over the web just pick any day in the lead up to the war and the
[1:03:13.300 --> 1:03:17.420]  in the week before the war and you will hear me in the first hour every day
[1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:23.420]  say exactly what was going to happen and what was going to unfold and then I
[1:03:23.420 --> 1:03:28.820]  said that a decade after you would see the United Nations come in I said
[1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:34.020]  within six to ten years you would see the UN then come in stabilize things
[1:03:34.020 --> 1:03:38.500]  after it had been broken up in all those parts and that they would then organize
[1:03:38.500 --> 1:03:43.060]  it and run it and then carry out forced inoculations and you know quote a
[1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:47.980]  central banking grid as PNAC calls for and then they'll just be like the US a
[1:03:47.980 --> 1:03:52.540]  dumb down and slave population having sterilization and other eugenics
[1:03:52.540 --> 1:03:57.540]  policies carried out against them and with the government information service
[1:03:57.540 --> 1:04:02.620]  you know with all sweet and happy and look how great Iraq is boy and it funny
[1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:07.940]  the women have been sterilized and cancer rates are up five-fold and that's
[1:04:07.940 --> 1:04:12.220]  what's been done and that's what's happened and if there's an attack on Iran
[1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:15.940]  which they're saying they're planning to do and Ron Paul saying has been green
[1:04:15.940 --> 1:04:19.940]  a green-minded then all hell is going to break loose and we're just going to see
[1:04:19.940 --> 1:04:24.340]  a further slide because everything the globalists do is multi-faceted it's
[1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:29.540]  also about waging war against us here economically but having us rally around
[1:04:29.540 --> 1:04:34.980]  the flag and going along with our captors into full bondage because after all
[1:04:34.980 --> 1:04:39.980]  there's a war on and you can't criticize it but I'm asking our listeners to go
[1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:45.260]  get my audio files of my show and to integrate it in with what I just said so
[1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:49.420]  people can see that we're telling you the truth we'll be right back

[1:08:56.860 --> 1:09:02.820]  so much of what I know Tex Mars in the early 1990s he was already a best-selling
[1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:09.180]  author on robotics and a best-selling author on passing the military exams I
[1:09:09.180 --> 1:09:14.620]  mean the best-selling author just in on so many fronts Air Force officer
[1:09:14.620 --> 1:09:21.700]  University of Texas station aeronautics professor a military professor very well
[1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:25.740]  accomplished then he found out about the New World Order and he wrote books in
[1:09:25.740 --> 1:09:30.860]  the early 1990s about the RFID chips the cashless control grid like project
[1:09:30.860 --> 1:09:35.780]  Lucent now it's more cutting-edge than the quote RFID experts you hear out
[1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:39.140]  there and I'm praising them as well it's just Tex is really a man before his
[1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:43.420]  time he wrote books and things about nanotech decades before then it all
[1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:48.020]  turned out to be accurate he exposed the phony evangelist before anybody else
[1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:53.060]  was doing it I mean he is so prolific and then I think the best book he ever
[1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:58.140]  wrote for information wise was phone book size in fact for prisonplanet.tv

[1:10:21.820 --> 1:10:25.960]  documents and we know that the Masonic orders at the higher level are
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:28.980]  worshipping Lucifer they say that in their own books but low-level Masons
[1:10:28.980 --> 1:10:33.260]  don't know that we know that ties into other networks of mystery schools we
[1:10:33.260 --> 1:10:36.900]  know the global elite are obsessed with the occult and he has the Rockefellers
[1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:40.900]  and the Rothschild's homes and businesses and the devils and demons and
[1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:47.260]  and satanic spirits they have all over the totems the United Nations is his
[1:10:47.260 --> 1:10:50.020]  first book that we carry by the way when we've got a deal where you can get both
[1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:55.540]  them together on this subject which is this big coffee table book is codex
[1:10:55.540 --> 1:11:01.060]  magica this is the second part to that and I have to say it's my new favorite
[1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:06.700]  because I didn't think that anybody could top the lavish nature and just and it
[1:11:06.700 --> 1:11:11.780]  is lavish how well it's done you can't put it down perfect to wake somebody up
[1:11:11.780 --> 1:11:15.180]  perfect for the average America who doesn't read because it has a lot of
[1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:19.900]  text but has so many photos and documents that keeps you engrossed but
[1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:25.140]  he's done it with this incredible new book mysterious monuments that we have
[1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:28.300]  on your television screen for those of you that are watching on prison planet
[1:11:28.300 --> 1:11:33.100]  dot TV the encyclopedia of secret illuminati designs masonic architecture
[1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:39.180]  and occult places now what's important to understand is that just like local
[1:11:39.180 --> 1:11:44.940]  gang members the crypts are the bloods just like police who need to know what
[1:11:44.940 --> 1:11:49.820]  those gang signs mean you need to know what the new world order gang signs mean
[1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:56.260]  and with codex magica and and with his newest book mysterious monuments you
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:00.380]  will see the symbols they have on TV the symbols in books but more importantly
[1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:03.900]  the symbols that are buildings they believe they're magical talismans and
[1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:08.180]  I've had university professors who are secular on to cover this they believe
[1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:13.300]  they're energizing spiritual power from it they believe that this is how they
[1:12:13.300 --> 1:12:18.180]  control society now whether it's real or not they believe it's real and so this
[1:12:18.180 --> 1:12:22.100]  is like learning a new language French or German or Spanish except this is the
[1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:27.540]  elite high Luciferian language and it's pretty simple to learn it's a lot easier
[1:12:27.540 --> 1:12:33.340]  than French or German or Japanese or Chinese or a new it you in just a few
[1:12:33.340 --> 1:12:38.500]  weeks can be a expert and have more knowledge than even 33rd degree
[1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:43.300]  mason's because text Mars has gone into all of these mysteries he's used his
[1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:49.100]  scholarly scientific mind to integrate into two books really the whole of their
[1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:53.980]  system and this is knowledge we all need to have when we're fighting the enemy
[1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:59.580]  text Mars it is it is just wonderful to have you on well Alex it's great to be
[1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:05.180]  with you again and I appreciate what you said about my prior book codex magica
[1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:10.140]  and this really is a sequel and yet it's totally different you know I guess it
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:15.340]  was Shakespeare who once said that the whole world is a stage but these
[1:13:15.340 --> 1:13:21.820]  people are doing occult magic in plain sight and the I'll tell you it's very
[1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:27.940]  important because people are you know every day you come on your program the
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:32.420]  Alex Jones show with stunning information but here's the here's what
[1:13:32.420 --> 1:13:35.980]  most people need to understand I believe you you know that your listeners
[1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:40.940]  every day do this doesn't just come out of a hat somewhere I mean you really
[1:13:40.940 --> 1:13:47.180]  research it you document it you know the evidence but it is an intellectual thing
[1:13:47.180 --> 1:13:52.260]  for many people it's hard for them to fathom and understand even though it's
[1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:57.940]  totally documented it's out there and you've done the research to bring this
[1:13:57.940 --> 1:14:04.060]  to pass and in every day of chronicles even your new video of 9 11
[1:14:04.060 --> 1:14:08.820]  chronicles chronicles the truth of that but still some people find it hard to
[1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:13.420]  grasp and I know I had a friend of mine a physician who came to visit me this
[1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:18.940]  week and he said text how can I how can I get to my friends that the truth of 9
[1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:24.140]  11 you know I gave out copies of videos to them books and they just laughed at
[1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:27.180]  me they they all come on and if they don't even want to watch the videos
[1:14:27.180 --> 1:14:32.680]  one of the things that we've done with this book missed the mysterious
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:40.700]  monuments it's not just intellectual truth it's actually items people can see
[1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:47.500]  once they once they read mysterious monuments and see over over 800 photos
[1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:54.860]  of architecture then they say oh and once they understand the architecture you
[1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:59.580]  know at first you just visit Washington DC as I did many years ago and you say
[1:14:59.580 --> 1:15:05.580]  how wonderful oh you've these great buildings of marble and granite and the
[1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:09.780]  in the huge Washington Monument and the goddess above the capital and how
[1:15:09.780 --> 1:15:14.940]  lovely and but but once you understand the meaning of all this and then it's
[1:15:14.940 --> 1:15:19.380]  not only that it's not just what was built you know 200 years ago in
[1:15:19.380 --> 1:15:25.660]  Washington DC they're building new world order architecture that has a meaning
[1:15:25.660 --> 1:15:32.260]  for their coming global empire of Satan this is satanic architecture that
[1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:39.180]  represents the occult theological view or vision and as you said these are
[1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:43.980]  talismans they're charms they're creating what they believe is a black
[1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:52.860]  magical environment to entrap men souls you know many people Alex where amulets
[1:15:52.860 --> 1:15:57.620]  necklaces with talismans and charms around their neck but what if the whole
[1:15:57.620 --> 1:16:03.180]  wall is full of talismans and charms and amulets what if it's full of devil
[1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:08.740]  architecture and what if that can be proven as I as I moved through the
[1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:12.500]  United States and around the world proving proving that there is an
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:18.740]  architectural colossus then everything changes now of course the the critics the
[1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:23.620]  skeptics will fail this can't be and just as they don't want to watch the
[1:16:23.620 --> 1:16:27.300]  videos you put out or listen to your program they're not going to want to
[1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:32.180]  look at this book if they did it would bother them so much they couldn't they
[1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:36.260]  couldn't stand the the pressure a lot of people just are looking for a comfort
[1:16:36.260 --> 1:16:39.460]  zone you know they want to party they want to spend their money they want to
[1:16:39.460 --> 1:16:44.260]  have a good time well they don't realize they're in great great danger they're
[1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:48.500]  about to go over the cliff whether it's economically or war but they don't
[1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:53.300]  know it if if they would research but here now we have and wood and stone and
[1:16:53.300 --> 1:17:00.100]  metal and granted these are real tangible things proving the new world order
[1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:07.380]  culture now to be clear even where they build Memphis or Atlanta or DC key
[1:17:07.380 --> 1:17:13.540]  cities are even on these lay lines even the Greenwich meantime everything they
[1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:18.760]  do is part of a giant ritual they really believe in this even if people are
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:22.540]  atheists out there and don't believe this they need to know that the globalists
[1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:27.940]  that govern the planet are all deep occultist and there's so much text in
[1:17:27.940 --> 1:17:31.660]  this book for the next hour and 30 minutes or so I want to go over the book
[1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:35.460]  and take calls and then at the end I do want to get 10 minutes or so from your
[1:17:35.460 --> 1:17:38.780]  Air Force perspective about whether you think they're going to hit Iran what you
[1:17:38.780 --> 1:17:42.420]  think will happen why the dollars plunging where you see things going I
[1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:45.780]  want to get some of your expertise on that so that's coming up later as well
[1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:50.540]  and for prison planet dot TV viewers we're going to be skipping some of the
[1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:53.620]  breaks on the radio and you'll be able to see us at prison planet dot TV
[1:17:53.620 --> 1:17:57.540]  continue the discussion also on the internet screens at info wars dot com

[1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:09.420]  few of those breaks coming up but before we go to this first break tax
[1:18:09.420 --> 1:18:14.540]  going over this book you're the expert on this how should we start in the next
[1:18:14.540 --> 1:18:18.900]  hour and a half or so of time that we have to really give people a basic
[1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:24.300]  grasp of this well I think we need to ask yourself if there is a satanic
[1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:29.420]  arc of architectural colossus going up around the world and even being
[1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:35.660]  escalated today who is behind it who is behind it the second thing is why are
[1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:39.620]  they doing this if they're designing these things who are the architects
[1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:47.620]  building these monuments these new skyscrapers the statues why are they
[1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:53.300]  doing this and what kind of occult wisdom are they are they using and so this is
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:57.340]  really who is behind it and why are they doing it I think are the two key
[1:18:57.340 --> 1:19:03.700]  things we need to look at start tax go over for us well one of the things you
[1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:07.260]  see in this book and you mentioned the names like Rockefeller's Rothschild's

[1:25:09.940 --> 1:25:13.900]  monuments you know going all the way back to the Tower of Babel in the book of
[1:25:13.900 --> 1:25:18.580]  Genesis in the Bible I wanted to see what kind of architecture what kind of
[1:25:18.580 --> 1:25:23.500]  symbols were in what kind of religion we're an ancient Babylon Egypt and so
[1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:29.500]  forth even the you know the Mesa America of the Aztecs the Incas and so forth
[1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:36.140]  but but interestingly enough as I began to study this as I travel around the
[1:25:36.140 --> 1:25:40.220]  United States being on various TV and radio talk shows for other books I
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:46.780]  discovered the same architecture the same principles to being built across
[1:25:46.780 --> 1:25:54.020]  America then when I went overseas I saw it being built in Europe and now it's
[1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:58.140]  really being escalated did you know there's an illuminati city of mystery
[1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:05.700]  called Astana or the star in Kazakhstan an entire new city and and and it's
[1:26:05.700 --> 1:26:09.940]  incredible they have pyramids they have huge globes there they're spending
[1:26:09.940 --> 1:26:14.500]  billions of dollars and they're in a spot of the new world order elite have
[1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:19.700]  built a great palace of peace and reconciliation it's going to be like a
[1:26:19.700 --> 1:26:24.860]  united nations as such and then there's the Congress of leaders of world
[1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:31.180]  religions they're bringing together in the Houston Texas they're building a
[1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:35.460]  great spirit of Houston or at least the planet a spirit of
[1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:42.420]  Houston goddess statue it's going to be towering voluptuous and I have a
[1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:48.020]  picture of it in the book and it's 555 feet tall which is the same as the
[1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:51.940]  Washington the monument the obelisk the great Egyptian obelisk in the
[1:26:51.940 --> 1:26:55.940]  Washington DC and the reason why I explain it and show the the meaning of
[1:26:55.940 --> 1:27:00.900]  the number 555 numerologically and of course if you translate that into
[1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:05.420]  inches it's six thousand six hundred and sixty inches they don't count the zeroes
[1:27:05.420 --> 1:27:12.140]  numerology so that's six six six but but back to this architectural colossus I
[1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:16.900]  asked myself who is behind this I see these buildings I see these monuments
[1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:24.140]  who did this and why are they continuing at a frantic pace to build up a new
[1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:29.900]  paradise or kingdom of Satan on earth and then I found out that the architects
[1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:35.900]  behind it are members of the secret societies the black lodges and as you
[1:27:35.900 --> 1:27:40.140]  know Alex they've spawned scores of subordinate organizations there's the
[1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:44.580]  Scottish Rite with its headquarters in Washington DC they live in by the way
[1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:51.540]  they worship in a tomb literally a tomb a mausoleum in Washington DC and I
[1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:55.860]  picture that in the book with all its fabulous Phoenix serpent in its black
[1:27:55.860 --> 1:28:01.340]  altar and when you imagine that that many of the senators and even former
[1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:07.020]  presidents have gone there and drank wine from a human skull in the sanctuary
[1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:12.460]  of this tomb in Washington DC and I picture it I did not know for example
[1:28:12.460 --> 1:28:17.620]  until you know I began research for this book some 20 years ago that under the
[1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:22.460]  great rotunda that's the central section of the tripod capital of the United
[1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:28.380]  States there is a crypt for dead bodies a crypt under the rotunda nobody ever
[1:28:28.380 --> 1:28:33.620]  goes and visit there but they have a crypt for the dead and I think that is
[1:28:33.620 --> 1:28:38.660]  very curious these people as you've said before are fascinated with the dead
[1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:42.420]  well we know that where the Hellfire Club with Benjamin Franklin in England
[1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:49.660]  they had their orgies and crypts they did and you know they have now found in
[1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:54.860]  the astonishing site in the place where Benjamin Franklin lived in the building
[1:28:54.860 --> 1:28:58.540]  where he stayed when he was in Great Britain and lived there for a while
[1:28:58.540 --> 1:29:04.580]  they found many dead bodies in the foundation of children yeah yeah it's
[1:29:04.580 --> 1:29:08.740]  a astonishing and they did a Hellfire Club and that was the beginning of the
[1:29:08.740 --> 1:29:13.380]  modern Illuminati exactly and it dates back to when he lived there so these
[1:29:13.380 --> 1:29:17.340]  are secret societies the Grand Orient Lodge the Grand Lodge of Jerusalem the
[1:29:17.340 --> 1:29:23.460]  Scottish right the order of skull and bones the P2 propaganda lodge in the
[1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:29.580]  in Italy all of them are building these incredible things around the world
[1:29:29.580 --> 1:29:33.420]  tech stay there we're gonna continue to talk behind the scenes right now and I
[1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:36.780]  want to continue going through the book and I've got so many questions about
[1:29:36.780 --> 1:29:40.900]  different architecture different things that I've never seen before we're on the

[1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:46.980]  that newsletter is a good little tool to give somebody to Texas really good at
[1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:50.340]  getting people to become interested in something the way he presents it because
[1:34:50.340 --> 1:34:55.780]  you know he's able to telegraph how amazing all this is text now let's get
[1:34:55.780 --> 1:35:00.140]  in to the book I mean there's so many areas to cover so many facets so many
[1:35:00.140 --> 1:35:07.540]  angles I mean well I said 15 minutes ago where do we start and and and you have
[1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:11.700]  started and you've covered so much I'm tempted just to ask you about you know
[1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:14.740]  different sections of the book or different areas but I think sure first
[1:35:14.740 --> 1:35:19.620]  off seeing all of this they want to bring in this one-world government as you
[1:35:19.620 --> 1:35:23.620]  were just saying they believe now is the time they believe they're in a hurry to
[1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:30.060]  get this done so so can you describe their basic cosmology and then seeing
[1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:34.860]  this there's all these different cults but they have the same central ideas in
[1:35:34.860 --> 1:35:37.260]  them and then when you look at the leaders of all the different Rosa
[1:35:37.260 --> 1:35:42.940]  Crucians and the Masons you notice it's a few hundred people are the heads of all
[1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:46.940]  these major groups and they're part of other elite groups hence the symbol is
[1:35:46.940 --> 1:35:52.020]  the pyramid for compartmentalization and they set up all of their institutions
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:56.940]  along these lines so if you can't give us their in-game or their big picture and
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:00.900]  and what they believe all these new cities they're building what they believe
[1:36:00.900 --> 1:36:05.340]  those do you know what they're what they're building towards this global
[1:36:05.340 --> 1:36:12.340]  plantation that you mentioned and then I want to basically break down then
[1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:15.580]  some of the details of that that you cover in your book I mean basically what
[1:36:15.580 --> 1:36:18.740]  I'm trying to say here is they're building their new world order why do
[1:36:18.740 --> 1:36:21.780]  they believe architecture such a big part of it it shows they're all really on
[1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:26.500]  the same team if the communists Chinese and the Russians and the US and the
[1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:31.580]  and the Mexicans and the Brazilians and everybody that the Muslims the
[1:36:31.580 --> 1:36:35.380]  Central Asians the Middle Easterners I mean they're all building the same stuff
[1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:39.940]  they all are parts of the same group and I guess this transcends Catholic
[1:36:39.940 --> 1:36:44.140]  Protestant it's all controlled by the same the Jews you know at the top we're
[1:36:44.140 --> 1:36:48.180]  striking right at the core here that's a big question but I wanted to you know
[1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:52.620]  get some of the different facets of it out text absolutely let me let me just
[1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:56.540]  prove your point in Shanksville Pennsylvania you know that's where the
[1:36:56.540 --> 1:37:03.420]  one of the the flight 93 crashed they have spent 54 million dollars of US
[1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:08.540]  taxpayer money to build a monument to the 40 or so people who died on that
[1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:14.900]  aircraft okay so 9 11 now what would you believe they have built or they
[1:37:14.900 --> 1:37:19.380]  they're building a monument and by the way this was all set up by senator Alan
[1:37:19.380 --> 1:37:24.620]  Spector all inspector of Pennsylvania remember he's a 33rd degree Mason he's
[1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:29.420]  the guy that created the magic bullet theory by good the JFK Commission time
[1:37:29.420 --> 1:37:35.460]  and the two senators and the governor of Pennsylvania are all free bases but I
[1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:39.060]  want you to understand something this is an outrage maybe you've covered it on
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:42.780]  your program but I have an actual picture on page 68 of my book I'm gonna go
[1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:47.100]  to page 68 for people watching on prisonplanet.tv I tell them what it is
[1:37:47.100 --> 1:37:54.780]  text this is the new monument called the fight 93 national memorial now people
[1:37:54.780 --> 1:38:02.660]  will love the fact they paid for this it's oriented toward Mecca and it is a
[1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:07.300]  star and crescent moon now let's be clear it isn't just a star and crescent moon
[1:38:07.300 --> 1:38:13.620]  it's aimed at Mecca it's oriented toward Mecca it's a star and a crescent
[1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:18.340]  moon which is the symbol of Islam universally and it's actually called
[1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:23.180]  that member now they used the star and the crescent moon in the
[1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:29.380]  Islam this is actually called the crescent of embrace the crescent of
[1:38:29.380 --> 1:38:35.140]  embrace now at first you're shocked you say well are they Muslims the Illuminati
[1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:41.020]  or these these evil pre-Mason's Muslims no no some of the highest symbols of the
[1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:44.820]  Masonic orders is the crescent moon and they they wear the red fez for the
[1:38:44.820 --> 1:38:49.180]  murder of Christians above that that's right the sun and the moon are actually
[1:38:49.180 --> 1:38:54.780]  cosmological deities to them now the interestingly enough the Shriners which
[1:38:54.780 --> 1:38:59.340]  until recently you had to be a 32nd degree Mason to be a Shriners the
[1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:04.220]  Shriners actually have ceremonies in which they worship at the altar of Allah
[1:39:04.220 --> 1:39:10.100]  and Mohammed so so here we have the Shriners and the very word Shriners of
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:17.780]  Freemasonry means Shrine of Allah and Mohammed so I now keep in mind this is
[1:39:17.780 --> 1:39:22.140]  not even true of Islam they are intending to bring all of the religions
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:26.580]  together first they will destroy the true doctrines of religions such as
[1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:30.780]  Christianity and others and Judaism then they'll bring them all together in this
[1:39:30.780 --> 1:39:35.620]  horrible Illuminati and we know that people are religious and we know that
[1:39:35.620 --> 1:39:40.740]  from Albert Pike explain that to the Muslims out there Albert Pike said this
[1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:45.500]  he said he was the former sovereign grand commander of all Freemasonry and
[1:39:45.500 --> 1:39:53.540]  then in the Illuminati chieftain he said every Masonic Lodge is a temple of
[1:39:53.540 --> 1:39:59.420]  religion what religion is it well it's very clear what religion if they
[1:39:59.420 --> 1:40:04.780]  Luciferian religion they worship the great star God who is Lucifer
[1:40:04.780 --> 1:40:11.180]  and and by the way is going back to this building of architecture all the
[1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:19.060]  masons say that their God is the great architect of the universe Jesus is a
[1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:24.660]  word that is not mentioned in the in the Masonic lodges or the other occult
[1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:31.140]  orders and such but they will mention that the builder or the great architect
[1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:36.700]  in fact in the one of the pictures I have in my book is the Wilshire Tower in
[1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:44.260]  Los Angeles where they have a great carving statue of Zeus he was one of
[1:40:44.260 --> 1:40:49.740]  their cosmological God of the Greek God Zeus here's the God above but there's a
[1:40:49.740 --> 1:40:53.980]  God called Neptune or Poseidon whose statue is in front of the Library of
[1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:58.900]  Congress in Washington DC and fountain and he is the God below you see they're
[1:40:58.900 --> 1:41:05.180]  bringing together the cosmological gods and deities member the Bible says that
[1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:11.820]  Satan is prince of the power of the air and they're bringing that God in the
[1:41:11.820 --> 1:41:15.900]  form of Zeus and their statues of Zeus there did you know that there's even
[1:41:15.900 --> 1:41:20.900]  one of Zeus on the Rockefeller Center in New York and he's holding the compass
[1:41:20.900 --> 1:41:26.140]  the square and compass is the major symbol of Freemasonry it's the symbol
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:34.340]  of the builders they're building a new utopia on this planet the new world order
[1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:40.780]  in stone their gospel is a gospel in stone now don't let me interrupt you but
[1:41:40.780 --> 1:41:44.260]  I want to go back to that but just since you mentioned it when I got back from
[1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:49.780]  Bilderberg in Virginia there outside DC and Chantilly I spent off and on more
[1:41:49.780 --> 1:41:54.180]  than two days trying to videotape the occult architecture didn't even know
[1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:59.660]  you were working on this book we're both so busy and when I return they're laying
[1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:03.580]  on my desk is your new book with a nice letter from you asking if I wanted to
[1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:09.060]  carry it and on the cover he is something we shot 20 minutes of video of
[1:42:09.060 --> 1:42:13.780]  and marveled at and had police walk up and say you can't videotape it with
[1:42:13.780 --> 1:42:18.940]  Poseidon with the mermaids and the mermen and the turtles spraying the water on
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:27.100]  them and they've got this these eels flotsam and Jetsam swimming around and
[1:42:27.100 --> 1:42:31.380]  and I just marveled at that and and you know shot video of that and on every
[1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:35.900]  building supreme court you name it is little devils little owls I mean it is
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:39.980]  and then of course so above below they always have the water gods down on the
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:43.860]  bottom they'll always have a goddess up on a building looking down just like in
[1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:47.860]  England they always have the sacrifice it'll say 10,000 dead troops 20,000
[1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:52.060]  dead troops 200,000 dead troops depending on the monument looking at her
[1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:55.340]  sacrifice it's always the same and then they've got in front of the vice
[1:42:55.340 --> 1:43:00.780]  president's residence right next to the White House in gold the goddess with a
[1:43:00.780 --> 1:43:05.340]  flaming sword and down below her little demons and then little demons with
[1:43:05.340 --> 1:43:10.100]  pitchforks and but it's all laid out the same and when you're there I mean it's
[1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:13.820]  like a dog in a butcher shop if you're trying to shoot a cult architecture it's
[1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:18.980]  everything is just laden and festooned with it go ahead well it does and it
[1:43:18.980 --> 1:43:23.540]  goes all the way back again to Babylon to Egypt to Greece and Rome now here's
[1:43:23.540 --> 1:43:28.500]  the interesting thing some people say well that's Greco your Greek Roman
[1:43:28.500 --> 1:43:32.540]  architecture and even you know the state houses the capital bill is in Texas and
[1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:37.860]  around the United States are all built in this format surely that's not fake I
[1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:43.220]  think it's just Greco Roman but wait wait wait one of the top occultists in the
[1:43:43.220 --> 1:43:48.100]  world Jeffrey Hudson wrote a book called the brotherhood of angels and men and I
[1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:54.020]  quote him extensively in mysterious monuments he says quote we need these
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:59.860]  as the spirits told him this we are devils really we are Greek reincarnate
[1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:06.580]  we're building fairer cities than even were built in ancient Greece now why
[1:44:06.580 --> 1:44:09.820]  Greece I agree seems like a nice enough to come you know
[1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:16.420]  of compatible nation today but remember Greece born all this from Babylon and
[1:44:16.420 --> 1:44:21.900]  Egypt and have all these gods and goddesses and really they are a function
[1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:26.700]  of the satanic court in other words they're a mirror of the satanic court
[1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:30.940]  and what is going on with this architecture this architectural so
[1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:35.780]  was above so below that's right they're mirroring what they vision as in the
[1:44:35.780 --> 1:44:41.540]  hell and they're building it on earth they're building a hellish utopia right
[1:44:41.540 --> 1:44:46.700]  here on earth let me give you an example the pyramid of course was built by the
[1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:52.020]  Pharaohs I believe with demonic intentions it's a place of death and the
[1:44:52.020 --> 1:44:57.140]  sarcophagus of the king or Pharaoh is in the king's chamber deep in the middle
[1:44:57.140 --> 1:45:01.700]  of that but a man named Isaac Tigret and I have a picture in the book giving a
[1:45:01.700 --> 1:45:08.500]  satanic hand sign a multi-millionaire I think he on the Phoenix Suns basketball
[1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:15.460]  team NBA and he's the founder of hard rock cafe restaurant chain okay now
[1:45:15.460 --> 1:45:19.780]  remember their symbol is the sun what the hell is he on what page is he on the
[1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:24.860]  sun god what page is that on text I'm not sure what page it's on this you know
[1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:29.460]  book is 624 pages there is the index here I just remember looking at it it was
[1:45:29.460 --> 1:45:34.460]  amazing I was trying to find it sure go ahead sorry yeah Isaac Tigret went over
[1:45:34.460 --> 1:45:38.700]  to Egypt in his own testimony and this was an American Airlines magazine of
[1:45:38.700 --> 1:45:44.100]  all places he says he bribed a guard so we could spend the night in the king's
[1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:49.300]  chamber deep inside the great pyramid of Giza in Egypt and it exactly the stroke
[1:45:49.300 --> 1:45:55.500]  of midnight a great light came to him on a voice and it's in it said you will
[1:45:55.500 --> 1:46:04.420]  build a pyramid like this and our sister city of Memphis in America now I
[1:46:04.420 --> 1:46:09.300]  recognize right away what was going on because in the ancient mystery religions
[1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:14.900]  they had an exact replica of this ceremony in which they went deep into a
[1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:20.220]  cave they claimed at midnight the Sun God came they call it the Sun at midnight
[1:46:20.220 --> 1:46:25.140]  and by the way Alistair Crowley the great British Satanist who called himself
[1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:29.340]  the wickedest man on earth six six six he also said he went through the same
[1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:35.500]  ritual and he met an Egyptian demon who told him to write a book about the
[1:46:35.500 --> 1:46:40.980]  bloodshed that's coming upon the earth in any case Isaac Tigret came back went
[1:46:40.980 --> 1:46:46.260]  to Memphis Tennessee and with other rich illuminous they convinced the city
[1:46:46.260 --> 1:46:51.980]  fathers to build a great pyramid sitting on the Mississippi River sister of the
[1:46:51.980 --> 1:47:01.140]  Nile and there it sits today this gleaming sun pyramid in Memphis Tennessee
[1:47:01.140 --> 1:47:06.020]  now you see how they do things but wait but they're not finished one of the
[1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:10.180]  greatest architect probably of the 20th century the two were Frank Lloyd Wright
[1:47:10.180 --> 1:47:16.740]  and I am pie PEI a Chinese-American Mr. Pie went over to France because the
[1:47:16.740 --> 1:47:21.380]  Grand Orient Lodge wanted him to build a great pyramid there and he built one
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:27.620]  right in front of the ancient erotic Louvre Museum now can you imagine a
[1:47:27.620 --> 1:47:32.900]  King Louis the 14th ornate place gigantic magnificent building and now they
[1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:39.260]  have a huge glass pyramid right in front of it and by the way the man who
[1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:43.180]  arranged and I have a picture of the president of France Francois Mitterrand
[1:47:43.180 --> 1:47:48.420]  and him then I read in the lay mom the world newspaper from Paris sort of like
[1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:52.300]  our New York Times Francois Mitterrand is totally obsessed with the occult it was
[1:47:52.300 --> 1:47:56.260]  all over their news and then he had to get this built before he left and he was
[1:47:56.260 --> 1:48:00.300]  worshipping and a member separately seeing that go ahead Tex yeah the
[1:48:00.300 --> 1:48:03.980]  Lamont says that Mitterrand each year that we're talking about a modern
[1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:09.140]  president okay a guy that has nuclear bombs and submarines that is at his
[1:48:09.140 --> 1:48:14.420]  disposal he France while Mitterrand would go to the top of a
[1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:20.540]  sacred mountain in France and use drums and drum up the spirits and
[1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:26.300]  communicate with them and get an agenda for the for France from the spirits
[1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:31.060]  now he said all this is impossible Tony Blair same things but in all their
[1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:37.460]  major papers he goes in right he goes in these pyramids go ahead yeah all of
[1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:42.340]  these people and of course we know about Bush's satanic order of skull and bones
[1:48:42.340 --> 1:48:48.780]  that by the way those young men chosen each year from Yale University meet in
[1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:54.020]  the tomb and at all of these you know I I went back and I studied the life of
[1:48:54.020 --> 1:48:59.300]  John D Rockefeller founder of standard oil okay now this guy talked about the
[1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:04.260]  oil industry and the oil of futures market today I found out that John D
[1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:09.580]  Rockefeller his grave site is a huge Egyptian obelisk and I picture it in the
[1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:16.220]  book after picture of the obelisk of John D Rockefeller so I found it all the
[1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:23.020]  way back George Washington I discovered his grave site is built in the form of
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:29.380]  an Egyptian a tool has two obelisk and an Egyptian temple this is George our
[1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:36.100]  nation's founder George Washington so by the way also found that Rothschild is
[1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:41.980]  building an incredible series of a pyramidal architecture in Hebrew
[1:49:41.980 --> 1:49:47.900]  University now imagine Hebrew University in Israel visited and you'll see in the
[1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:53.460]  courtyard I have a picture of it a great pyramid you go to the city of Elot
[1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:58.140]  which is the city and the Israel that comes out of when you go from Egypt
[1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:04.620]  into Israel there Rothschild has built a great pyramid right in the middle of the
[1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:08.700]  street everybody has to pass it with pillars and the Masonic square in
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:14.700]  compass he's built a huge Supreme Court building their intention is to make this
[1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:21.060]  the Supreme Court of the world in Jerusalem in 1992 and it's shaped the
[1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:26.420]  library is shaped like a Masonic a pyramid with a capstone missing there
[1:50:26.420 --> 1:50:31.620]  are pyramids all around their circles are all kind of a occult stumble now back
[1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:35.860]  to this I'm getting ahead of myself but back to this standard all and John
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:40.180]  Rockefeller I tell you what text stay there we're about to go to break but
[1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:44.780]  we'll keep talking behind the scenes of post watching on prison planet dot TV and

[1:53:48.900 --> 1:53:51.180]  brother
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:07.620]  he knows the family and the daughter of one of the biggest heirs one of the
[1:54:07.620 --> 1:54:12.980]  largest oil companies and that when he goes into each room he has little owl
[1:54:12.980 --> 1:54:18.900]  figurines in each room and he mumbled something you know frightened to it like
[1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:23.500]  an incantation when he enters each room see people say well bohemian grove
[1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:26.900]  they're in there worshipping the owl that can be lila there can be any other
[1:54:26.900 --> 1:54:32.540]  names why are they doing this you know this is just a play they're just having
[1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:36.980]  fun well I could have thought that too but I was in the crowd of several thousand
[1:54:36.980 --> 1:54:43.380]  men watching the the ritual take place that they were breathing heavy grinding
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:47.260]  their teeth very silent until they started doing the mock sacrifice and
[1:54:47.260 --> 1:54:51.220]  they were like oh yes oh and then Mike Hansen next was going hey this is a great
[1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:55.100]  event boy that's neat they looked at him with total hatred and he just shut up
[1:54:55.100 --> 1:55:00.380]  this was a very reverent they said be reverent before her and they and now
[1:55:00.380 --> 1:55:05.700]  they call it mo look in some of their writings we know who the owl is Lilith
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:10.900]  and some other things in you know the cultures but with these occultists it's
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:16.100]  all interchanged you know we understand that mo look is a bull but at bohemian
[1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:21.340]  grove they they call it a owl and don't we find this with the occultist text that
[1:55:21.340 --> 1:55:24.740]  they interchange things and have different meanings and multiple names
[1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:30.540]  and multiple faces to things oh yes because they're gods morphed into
[1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:37.500]  different about beings you see for example and and remember now even the
[1:55:37.500 --> 1:55:42.060]  the great symbol of the United States which is that eagle with the with by the
[1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:49.620]  way the six-pointed star above it it has an obverse or a reverse side so there's
[1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:54.540]  always a hidden side for example Vanderbilt the Vanderbilt's one of one
[1:55:54.540 --> 1:55:59.180]  of the richest men in the world at one time a Vanderbilt at the grant of the
[1:55:59.180 --> 1:56:05.340]  grand central railroad terminal in york you can still see it built a great
[1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:13.980]  statue of mercury the god mercury mercury is symbolized in astrology by
[1:56:13.980 --> 1:56:20.700]  Gemini he's a dual god he has has two aspects so so if you always call it the
[1:56:20.700 --> 1:56:26.140]  double-faced gods remember the Romans worshiped Janus so the masons today
[1:56:26.140 --> 1:56:31.340]  they're their premier symbol is the double-headed eagle so we have a
[1:56:31.340 --> 1:56:37.060]  double-headed all-seeing eye on one side of our great field which they put in
[1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:41.340]  there with a pyramid and they all sing up horse the Egyptian sun god the sun
[1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:47.180]  s o n of Osiris and and then the other side being the eagle and yet even the
[1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:53.020]  eagle is bastardized by the Illuminati in its many forms and if you go then visit
[1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:58.540]  the Rockefeller state in upper New York I could it's called I have a picture of
[1:56:58.540 --> 1:57:05.020]  it you'll see the great eagle the imperial eagle atop his estate in a
[1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:11.020]  home he has the huge eagle if you visit the Fed reserve building poor mr. Ben
[1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:15.340]  Bernanke works head of the Fed reserve you're gonna see a very simple
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:20.620]  adornment only the great eagle so again they use many things now back to this
[1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:28.140]  owl Athena Athena was the goddess of wisdom and the owl is the symbol of
[1:57:28.140 --> 1:57:34.220]  her wisdom it's a night wisdom it's a black magic wisdom at the owl is the
[1:57:34.220 --> 1:57:42.900]  killer of night and he can see it's like an all-seeing eye and again Athena one
[1:57:42.900 --> 1:57:49.260]  of her representations is atop the statue atop the the Capitol building and
[1:57:49.260 --> 1:57:53.420]  thus right below her way deep below on the earth in the basement is the crypt
[1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:59.980]  that they've secretly built there at now if not only that but behind the
[1:57:59.980 --> 1:58:05.580]  Capitol and and right actually in the street design of Washington DC that
[1:58:05.580 --> 1:58:10.540]  whole area if you look at it and I have a picture of the street layout you will

[2:00:03.140 --> 2:00:10.140]  Austin Texas Alex Jones I am just biting my lip here because text brings up so
[2:00:10.140 --> 2:00:13.500]  many points and then I think about the hundreds of things I've learned
[2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:17.020]  separately when he's talking about something and I I know he's so right
[2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:20.820]  on I'm just like biting my lip here not wanting to interrupt because I want to
[2:00:20.820 --> 2:00:25.140]  pump him for all the info I can there is so much in his new book that I didn't
[2:00:25.140 --> 2:00:29.580]  know and the more I learned the more I don't learn that I don't know that much
[2:00:29.580 --> 2:00:32.980]  but I thought I knew it all about architecture and all the occultism and
[2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:36.140]  the things they've done but when you really start reading this book and start
[2:00:36.140 --> 2:00:42.580]  looking around you it is everywhere in fact here's an example I read junk
[2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:46.700]  science fiction sometimes not very often I'm so busy and I was at my parents
[2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:50.020]  house about a week ago and my dad reads a lot of science fiction and there was
[2:00:50.020 --> 2:00:54.260]  this book called the worthy saga and I picked it up he said yeah I've read it
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:59.380]  you can have that I haven't had a chance to read it yet and it shows a guy on the
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:06.540]  cover I'm gonna put this on screen for people and put it up there on screen for
[2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:10.220]  folks that are watching on prisonplanet.tv and he's encased in
[2:01:10.220 --> 2:01:15.220]  something that is a pyramid and then below him in blue is a pyramid with a
[2:01:15.220 --> 2:01:20.060]  white capstone and and then I started looking around at all the other science
[2:01:20.060 --> 2:01:24.940]  fiction books I have this is what Alan Watt talks about and it's all got
[2:01:24.940 --> 2:01:28.900]  Illuminati stuff on the book covers and you start looking it is literally
[2:01:28.900 --> 2:01:33.940]  everywhere text how many adherents to this Babylon mystery religion do you
[2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:38.460]  have any idea what the percentage is well of course there are millions who
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:45.060]  are involved in various occult things and many of them are just dumb people you
[2:01:45.060 --> 2:01:50.300]  know and independently not involved in these secret societies and cults but
[2:01:50.300 --> 2:01:57.460]  as in terms of the more hideous new world order elite I'm going just to say
[2:01:57.460 --> 2:02:02.980]  that there's probably no more than 10,000 around the globe that really know
[2:02:02.980 --> 2:02:10.660]  the plan and are in their accomplishing what they call the great work of the
[2:02:10.660 --> 2:02:16.820]  Illuminati which is to regenerate mankind to destroy the world that is and
[2:02:16.820 --> 2:02:24.220]  build a new world made up of stone and steel and glass if because of the
[2:02:24.220 --> 2:02:29.220]  visions they receive from demonic spirits so maybe 10,000 in the United
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:34.820]  States probably only about a thousand that really are deep into this and
[2:02:34.820 --> 2:02:38.620]  various areas now I want to stop you right there because that's earth
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:41.900]  shattering and that is the facts and I've been to Bohemian Grove I've covered
[2:02:41.900 --> 2:02:45.820]  it I've been to London in DC I've seen the architecture I've been to Latin
[2:02:45.820 --> 2:02:52.340]  America and seen it there is no doubt that the world's controllers do believe
[2:02:52.340 --> 2:02:56.900]  they're channeling angels they space aliens is the more modern thing they
[2:02:56.900 --> 2:03:01.540]  say they're channeling and they are telling them what to do they're telling
[2:03:01.540 --> 2:03:05.020]  them genetic engineer destroy the old bring in the new they're telling them
[2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:09.020]  start World War 3 they're telling them kill these children do these medical
[2:03:09.020 --> 2:03:13.180]  experiments I mean even whether you believe it or not folks they believe it
[2:03:13.180 --> 2:03:17.340]  I mean could it be more dangerous that we have these world leaders and control
[2:03:17.340 --> 2:03:22.780]  the nuclear weapons as you said earlier and they are completely a bunch of
[2:03:22.780 --> 2:03:28.100]  mumbling nutcases I mean that the mainstream British news reports Tony
[2:03:28.100 --> 2:03:32.820]  Blair flops around the ground every morning channeling the quote spirit of
[2:03:32.820 --> 2:03:38.180]  light I mean I mean yes indeed yes indeed and you know I have a picture in
[2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:43.620]  the mysterious monuments of the European Union's modern-day headquarters this is
[2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:50.100]  this is a power of babble in fact it actually is designed as an unfinished
[2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:56.540]  power and a babble and the national anthem of the European Union is devoted
[2:03:56.540 --> 2:04:02.540]  to the great goddess of magic and fire you found it on page 489 490 to 491 of
[2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:09.060]  my book now and by the way also show a picture of they have a statue in some
[2:04:09.060 --> 2:04:14.660]  of the European Union headquarters of a great goddess and she's holding up in
[2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:21.020]  her hand the euro and below her are people like their powering their
[2:04:21.020 --> 2:04:25.180]  supine and their powering beneath her the whole of humanity is powering and
[2:04:25.180 --> 2:04:30.220]  here is the great goddess we get back to the same goddess they worshiped the
[2:04:30.220 --> 2:04:35.340]  hemean growth the streets of Washington they are laid out in one place as a
[2:04:35.340 --> 2:04:41.060]  great owl I have a picture of also the light even the landscaping in the pool
[2:04:41.060 --> 2:04:48.060]  area of the new part of state hold on Tex did you know the accumulation of

[2:09:51.620 --> 2:09:55.700]  candles doing a ritual and but then I want to spend a lot of time on their

[2:10:00.220 --> 2:10:06.020]  chaos to bring their order how do you see their plan building and then finally

[2:10:17.380 --> 2:10:22.660]  thankful for your time text well Alex maybe we should start in Washington DC
[2:10:22.660 --> 2:10:28.420]  with a place of worship to the National Cathedral you know Pierre Lafond who was
[2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:33.540]  the of an occultist and designed the original layout out of the city of
[2:10:33.540 --> 2:10:39.260]  Washington DC said that the National Cathedral would be a church for
[2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:45.140]  national purposes remember after 9-11 they had a big interfaith ceremony they
[2:10:45.140 --> 2:10:50.980]  had the Buddhist there Buddhist monk they had a Muslim
[2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:55.700]  Imam and of course even Billy Graham was there and the former president and and
[2:10:55.700 --> 2:10:59.900]  the president Bush and everything they made a big show of the National Cathedral
[2:10:59.900 --> 2:11:05.180]  now I visited the National Cathedral and I noticed right away the demon
[2:11:05.180 --> 2:11:12.300]  gargoyles in stone that wrap around the building I found I just decided to do
[2:11:12.300 --> 2:11:18.540]  some research of the National Cathedral and I found the the newest the newest
[2:11:18.540 --> 2:11:25.580]  grotesque or gorgol horn devil and so forth that's going up is Dorf Vader the
[2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:30.860]  Star Wars saga he's actually in stone he's looking down on passers-by that
[2:11:30.860 --> 2:11:37.060]  first it's sort of a comedy Dorf Vader that you know the galactic evil commander
[2:11:37.060 --> 2:11:40.180]  what is this is this some kind of a straight you know you mentioned
[2:11:40.180 --> 2:11:46.020]  science fiction a number of the science fiction writers are privy to the
[2:11:46.020 --> 2:11:52.140]  knowledge that as Hollywood directors are and and Dorf Vader remember he was
[2:11:52.140 --> 2:11:57.220]  part of the dark force the force would you believe that the book of Daniel
[2:11:57.220 --> 2:12:01.940]  prophetic book in the Bible says that the God that they worship in the last
[2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:09.060]  days this Illuminati elite will be a god of forces and he will heap up great
[2:12:09.060 --> 2:12:14.820]  treasure gold money to them it will not be a god that his father's worship but
[2:12:14.820 --> 2:12:21.900]  instead the God of forces Dorf Vader comically as it may seem is now one of
[2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:26.700]  the demonic gorgols looking down on people I have a huge picture of him in
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:35.660]  the book I think it's on pages 588 to 589 now I found out that the bishop who's
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:42.340]  the rector of the National Cathedral is Episcopal and I have a picture of him
[2:12:42.340 --> 2:12:47.140]  in codex magicka doing the the the Freemasonry hand sign where you put your
[2:12:47.140 --> 2:12:52.780]  hand under your vest or under your your coat the hidden sign of Jabil on their
[2:12:52.780 --> 2:12:57.100]  god that they worship but the archbishop who's in charge of the whole
[2:12:57.100 --> 2:13:03.340]  Washington DC area is the man his last name is more and he was recently outed
[2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:07.980]  for being a homosexual so you can see the kind of people that are involved and
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:13.620]  now they're in charge of this taxpayer funded National Cathedral and by the way
[2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:18.060]  I have a picture of a devil literally with horns in stone at the National
[2:13:18.060 --> 2:13:22.660]  Cathedral high up you can barely see him you need a telephoto lens the devils
[2:13:22.660 --> 2:13:27.220]  looking down on people from the National Cathedral but I also show in
[2:13:27.220 --> 2:13:31.260]  France remember President Mitterrand would go up to a sacred mountain and
[2:13:31.260 --> 2:13:37.620]  pound-on drums and communicate with the spirits well at Renele Chateau in the
[2:13:37.620 --> 2:13:41.860]  Pyrenees Mountains of France probably where Mitterrand went I have pictures of
[2:13:41.860 --> 2:13:48.180]  the chapel there a Catholic Chapel as you enter notice there's a sign in France
[2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:53.940]  over the door carved and it reads and this is astonishing Alex this place is
[2:13:53.940 --> 2:13:58.980]  terrible well right away you know you're in a strange Catholic Church there's
[2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:02.540]  also a skull and bones emblazoned in stone I have an image of it in my book
[2:14:02.540 --> 2:14:08.500]  but once you go in and the lobby there is confronting you to the right of you
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:16.100]  and a black devil with horns and he's carrying a little basket and what is in
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:22.380]  the basket to dragon of course one that represents Satan the other represents
[2:14:22.380 --> 2:14:28.260]  his son and to Christ this is in a Catholic Chapel in Renele Chateau
[2:14:28.260 --> 2:14:33.820]  France and here again we have the satanic Illuminati around the world
[2:14:33.820 --> 2:14:37.980]  weren't you mentioning earlier when we hit a break the asters and their symbol
[2:14:37.980 --> 2:14:42.420]  being the dragon oh yes yes I have a picture on their estate they have a
[2:14:42.420 --> 2:14:47.660]  building an exterior building and I believe they must be the chapel where
[2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:53.340]  they conducted ceremonies and there you will see their their great emblem of the
[2:14:53.340 --> 2:15:00.220]  Aster family and what is it yes it's a dragon remember even the oral verse
[2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:05.420]  oral boros serpent the one that swallows its tail meaning we shall conquer the
[2:15:05.420 --> 2:15:11.620]  whole earth it's really a dragon serpent and so everywhere you go
[2:15:11.620 --> 2:15:20.580]  serpent horns devils now you remember you remember that Anderson Cooper is
[2:15:20.580 --> 2:15:25.620]  one of the heirs to the asters and then we've got the other one Tucker Carlson
[2:15:25.620 --> 2:15:29.860]  is a heir to another one of the big families but you never hear that on the
[2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:35.100]  news so it's still the same people in power speaking of Catholic churches you've
[2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:37.900]  got a lot of big Protestant ones too I want to go over some of those but on
[2:15:37.900 --> 2:15:43.140]  page 463 and I'm showing the camera this right now you have Pope Benedict said
[2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:48.780]  mass at this Illuminati's design Catholic Church in Poland and I mean this is an
[2:15:48.780 --> 2:15:53.500]  all-singot pyramid with rays coming out and the whole thing I mean it is just
[2:15:53.500 --> 2:15:58.740]  unbelievable yeah that's it that is very interesting there on page 462
[2:15:58.740 --> 2:16:04.500]  actually Pope Benedict saying mass you can tell look at this church it looked
[2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:09.540]  like something from outer space it's in Poland they have a new Catholic church
[2:16:09.540 --> 2:16:13.540]  called a cathedral of the angels but it must be the dark angels in Los Angeles
[2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:18.420]  that it has all kind of satanic symbology to it and of course they're the
[2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:23.300]  Protestant churches as well you know we mentioned the Episcopal Church the the
[2:16:23.300 --> 2:16:28.500]  Church of in New York City the largest cathedral there is St. John the Divine
[2:16:28.500 --> 2:16:34.940]  and wow they actually had a Buddhist statue implanted in the sanctuary for a
[2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:41.180]  while and they statue where the you know the cross and crucifix were behind the
[2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:46.420]  altar they put up Christa a goddess statue all across now now what about
[2:16:46.420 --> 2:16:51.540]  what I think Jesus Christ what about oral Roberts well the whole university
[2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:56.740]  oral Roberts or Roberts is a 33rd degree Mason he's probably he's always voted
[2:16:56.740 --> 2:17:01.500]  Democrat whether it was Bill Clinton or whoever he's always voted Democrat and
[2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:06.460]  he is a 33rd degree Mason and when you study and I have about three or four
[2:17:06.460 --> 2:17:12.060]  pages of oral Roberts University you'll find even the praying hands are built
[2:17:12.060 --> 2:17:17.580]  in the form of a pyramid you know that you'll see the statue these monuments
[2:17:17.580 --> 2:17:22.300]  like they look like praying hands but the hands are in a strange formation
[2:17:22.300 --> 2:17:28.220]  there's stars there's circles there's the sun sign atop the power everything to
[2:17:28.220 --> 2:17:33.540]  indicate the illuminous mothonic nature of oral Roberts University I'm sorry to
[2:17:33.540 --> 2:17:41.900]  say even the oral Roberts University Medical Center is built in that format
[2:17:41.900 --> 2:17:47.740]  and in fact it's sort of a sex sign also the picture of all Roberts with Gene
[2:17:47.740 --> 2:17:53.660]  Dixon he was a big brand of the psyche astrologer Gene Dixon and fought her
[2:17:53.660 --> 2:17:58.620]  out for advice all Roberts once said that he had the healing power he had he
[2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:04.220]  claimed because he was part Indian in his bloodline and he said you know the
[2:18:04.220 --> 2:18:09.220]  Indians have this special power because they're connected to the earth here
[2:18:09.220 --> 2:18:16.420]  again we have this the God of nature and of course the God of earth is actually
[2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:22.700]  this God Poseidon or Neptune whose statue is on the cover of my book with
[2:18:22.700 --> 2:18:28.220]  his horns with his with his with this satanic serpent spitting in front of him
[2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:33.300]  and by the way there's also it that's the great fountain where Neptune or
[2:18:33.300 --> 2:18:38.220]  Poseidon the God from under the earth member as above so below he comes up
[2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:43.980]  the fountain represents the chaos of earth the chaotic fees and here comes up
[2:18:43.980 --> 2:18:48.580]  Poseidon this is in front of the Library of Congress now that represents the
[2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:54.860]  collective wisdom of the United States people and does this devil that comes up
[2:18:54.860 --> 2:19:00.380]  out of the sea represent America I don't want it to be so and I think for the
[2:19:00.380 --> 2:19:05.260]  average citizen it is not so this is the elite Illuminati that are forcing this
[2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:11.340]  on us Alex well I was at the National Archives and the security guys ran out
[2:19:11.340 --> 2:19:15.020]  and threatened to arrest us for being there but it had every religion on earth
[2:19:15.020 --> 2:19:21.220]  and every God and goddess including Satan but no Christian or Judaic gods and
[2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:26.580]  we were there about 20 I mean nothing sorry go ahead that's true that's true
[2:19:26.580 --> 2:19:30.460]  there are all these pagan gods and goddesses all over Washington DC I
[2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:35.260]  wonder I want to make a statement well okay we'll do that after the break text
[2:19:35.260 --> 2:19:38.500]  but but I want to come back over the break and get to that statement but
[2:19:38.500 --> 2:19:41.860]  right now behind the scenes I want to talk more about the layout of DC so we'll
[2:19:41.860 --> 2:19:46.060]  come right back with that statement we're right back you ever have one of

[2:22:51.260 --> 2:22:56.460]  debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of 14.8 trillion
[2:22:56.460 --> 2:23:01.300]  dollars marking 10.57 percent annual increase outpacing its previous 10
[2:23:01.300 --> 2:23:05.660]  years the US economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private

[2:23:09.620 --> 2:23:14.260]  growth collapsed to only 4.5 percent it's bad enough that the US citizens is
[2:23:14.260 --> 2:23:18.340]  bound by debt in order to have commerce however shocking the economy with the
[2:23:18.340 --> 2:23:22.620]  reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio

[2:24:01.300 --> 2:24:05.900]  the scenes and he was just getting to it about page 386 with the witches out
[2:24:05.900 --> 2:24:11.140]  worshipping at the phallus there in DC for everybody in the occult they know
[2:24:11.140 --> 2:24:14.500]  what all this is it's a big joke the general public doesn't know and the
[2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:18.700]  occultists that run things work to teach you to be atheist to teach you that
[2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:22.300]  there's nothing spiritual in the world and that there aren't even people that
[2:24:22.300 --> 2:24:26.500]  believe in this see they don't want you looking into that kind of like I got
[2:24:26.500 --> 2:24:32.620]  protested by the Bohemian Grove Action Network that was real mad about me
[2:24:32.620 --> 2:24:35.980]  saying there's a cultism at the Grove and then I should just talk about world
[2:24:35.980 --> 2:24:39.380]  policy being set there well I covered that too in my film dark secrets of
[2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:42.940]  Bohemian Grove but then we went out the next year there they were doing a
[2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:46.860]  ritual a lot of the members of it sending in their own spirits to fight the
[2:24:46.860 --> 2:24:50.180]  global elite now whether you believe it's real or not the point is they
[2:24:50.180 --> 2:24:55.500]  didn't want me talking about that text get into these witches well you know I
[2:24:55.500 --> 2:25:00.980]  have a picture from USA Today a major publication and by the way the picture
[2:25:00.980 --> 2:25:04.740]  actually is from the associated press in which these witches came to
[2:25:04.740 --> 2:25:10.020]  Washington and they created a great circle and they they did it around the
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:15.820]  Washington Monument so witches over Washington DC and they said we're going
[2:25:15.820 --> 2:25:23.460]  to have a 33 hour interfaith digital to pray for peace and the natural world
[2:25:23.460 --> 2:25:29.300]  here again the god of nature a pan the horned goat god and they did they did
[2:25:29.300 --> 2:25:33.580]  actually shows them raising up their hands to the skies and conducting their
[2:25:33.580 --> 2:25:38.980]  circle of harmony now 33 hours now they they must have done this with great
[2:25:38.980 --> 2:25:43.980]  glee and fun because they they think that we're all stupid 33 of course is
[2:25:43.980 --> 2:25:50.500]  the holy number of Freemasonry member if the age at which Jesus Christ was
[2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:56.300]  slain on the cross it's believed so they actually they enjoy thinking about the
[2:25:56.300 --> 2:26:01.220]  fact that Jesus was slain they don't of course talk about his resurrection now
[2:26:01.220 --> 2:26:05.980]  on that same page Alex is the is another picture from Google a Google
[2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:15.380]  error of dot com aerial view photo of the great 555 foot a Washington Monument
[2:26:15.380 --> 2:26:21.940]  the Egyptian obelisk and it's showing it's essentially a great sundial as
[2:26:21.940 --> 2:26:28.860]  well as an Egyptian Monument and of the I call it the phallus of Neptune or
[2:26:28.860 --> 2:26:33.260]  Poseidon remember the beast that's covered that cover by book has a
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:38.660]  picture of the in front of the Library of Congress Revelation 13 one in the
[2:26:38.660 --> 2:26:43.980]  Bible John said I saw a vision this the apostle John this is prophecy now in the
[2:26:43.980 --> 2:26:50.260]  last days he said I saw a vision of a great beast rising up out of the sea
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:57.580]  and what is this beast rising up out of the fountain which represents the sea the
[2:26:57.580 --> 2:27:02.340]  chaos of humanity he's rising up and there he is in front of the Library of
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:07.820]  Congress and the Bible on the opposite page page 387 you see that the the
[2:27:07.820 --> 2:27:15.620]  incredible Delphic Oracle a tripod fire urn which has beef paws and feet and the
[2:27:15.620 --> 2:27:19.860]  face of serpentine devil and as you said you have the male phallus of the sea
[2:27:19.860 --> 2:27:25.980]  God rising out the thing that should not be out of the big reflecting pool as
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:31.220]  above below so that's right now here's an interesting thing in Alexandria
[2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:36.580]  Virginia now that's another city sister to Egypt city of Alexandria where they
[2:27:36.580 --> 2:27:42.540]  had the great Pharaoh's lighthouse that devoted to Zeus who's the God of the
[2:27:42.540 --> 2:27:48.740]  skies the God above were Poseidon is the God below and interestingly enough in
[2:27:48.740 --> 2:27:54.460]  Alexandria Virginia the Mason built the Washington National Masonic monument
[2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:59.860]  they actually still have rituals and ceremonies inside this of the various
[2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:05.380]  Masonic orders including the modern-day night Templar they admit and at the
[2:28:05.380 --> 2:28:11.460]  very top bit is a power and it is a recreation of the great lighthouse of
[2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:19.340]  Pharaoh's Egypt in which sat a or it was a great statue to Zeus and Zeus had
[2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:23.060]  his hands reaching up to the heaven remember Satan is prince of the power
[2:28:23.060 --> 2:28:29.860]  of the air according to the Bible so here we have below the phallus of Zeus
[2:28:29.860 --> 2:28:34.660]  or Neptune and there at the Washington National Monument is is this great
[2:28:34.660 --> 2:28:38.580]  lighthouse he's the God of life well it's the same thing when I was at Bohemian
[2:28:38.580 --> 2:28:42.820]  Grove in the hour-long ritual they first introduced it as a female she heals you
[2:28:42.820 --> 2:28:46.700]  she's great she gives power let our dead brothers who were members be
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:50.900]  conjured by her she orders them back from the dead and the men around me
[2:28:50.900 --> 2:28:55.360]  were going oh they were really oh I mean they were taking this all these world
[2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:59.060]  leaders were really taking this serious bringing back the spirits you know of
[2:28:59.060 --> 2:29:03.700]  the dead ones to be there this necromancy then they addressed it as a
[2:29:03.700 --> 2:29:08.820]  male god of the forest and so they always do the same thing text we're

[2:33:21.220 --> 2:33:28.380]  going to be in studio there was a big BBC hit piece on 9-11 truth we've had a
[2:33:28.380 --> 2:33:32.820]  chance to watch it he's in there watching it right now analyzing it we're
[2:33:32.820 --> 2:33:35.780]  reading different articles that have been covering and we're going to break
[2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:39.860]  down the propaganda with that piece supposedly debunking the building 7 was
[2:33:39.860 --> 2:33:43.300]  blown up or that they announced that it was going to be blown up beforehand
[2:33:43.300 --> 2:33:49.700]  which they did just a complete failure in what they've done and so we'll be
[2:33:49.700 --> 2:33:53.460]  breaking that down the last 30 minutes of the show or so we're going to go back
[2:33:53.460 --> 2:33:58.980]  to text Mars here as I said in just a moment up on the prison planet dot TV

[2:34:13.420 --> 2:34:17.860]  they're taking over media events and confronting all these different globalist
[2:34:17.860 --> 2:34:22.260]  we expose how the government knew that the first responders were breathing
[2:34:22.260 --> 2:34:29.260]  dust we're getting very very sick and that all of that was basically covered
[2:34:29.260 --> 2:34:33.020]  up for their administrative convenience we also get into how they blew the
[2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:37.540]  buildings up why they blew them up with eyewitnesses to the countdown and we
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:41.460]  also show you the growing police state in the United States such an important

[2:34:51.580 --> 2:34:55.020]  something that hopefully will energize the population to go out and confront
[2:34:55.020 --> 2:35:01.900]  politicians world leaders media whores so that the big live 9-11 can completely
[2:35:01.900 --> 2:35:05.940]  come down an Achilles heel of the globalist is their problem reaction
[2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:10.500]  solution if we expose that most terror is manufactured or provocative by them
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:17.740]  then their tool of scaring us into submission will be removed so that is of
[2:35:17.740 --> 2:35:21.940]  the utmost importance to everyone that that happens so please get the 9-11

[2:36:07.820 --> 2:36:13.820]  depression and war we saw Katrina and other events where the establishment
[2:36:13.820 --> 2:36:22.660]  uses crises as a pretext to disarm the population if you have food and water
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:26.860]  filtration that's a big part of not being beholden to the government to the

[2:36:59.020 --> 2:37:05.020]  monuments and mysterious monuments is a book of course that we're also carrying
[2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:09.420]  at info wars dot com but you can also get it at power prophecy dot com and at
[2:37:09.420 --> 2:37:13.420]  text Mars dot com text make that statement that you're gonna make earlier
[2:37:13.420 --> 2:37:16.700]  when we when we had a break there was some key statement you wanted to make
[2:37:16.700 --> 2:37:22.580]  and we forgot to do that well Alex you know many listeners to your program are
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:26.740]  Christian but there are also people who are not Christians but love liberty love
[2:37:26.740 --> 2:37:31.460]  freedom I love our Constitution and I and I appreciate them even though I'm a
[2:37:31.460 --> 2:37:36.260]  Christian I appreciate them very very much and no doubt they're people who are
[2:37:36.260 --> 2:37:42.300]  into Judaism and even Islam listening to your program and they certainly have
[2:37:42.300 --> 2:37:47.180]  nothing to do with terrorist philosophy now what what we need to
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:53.500]  understand whatever religion you you have or if you have none at all we
[2:37:53.500 --> 2:38:00.060]  should all be opposed to false religion a satanic religious philosophy and what
[2:38:00.060 --> 2:38:04.460]  we have to understand there's three legs to the new world order and that the
[2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:10.340]  chief leg is religion and the the subordinate legs of the tripod you
[2:38:10.340 --> 2:38:15.820]  might say are politics and economics but always believe it or not
[2:38:15.820 --> 2:38:21.540]  spirituality trumps the other two and that's why people such as Blair of
[2:38:21.540 --> 2:38:26.500]  England and meteor on and bush in and in all of these people are involved in
[2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:31.500]  these satanic secret societies that harken back to the mystery religion so
[2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:36.420]  I want to make this statement what we're opposed to here is an incredible system
[2:38:36.420 --> 2:38:43.580]  of politics of the black politics until that dark now politics black magic
[2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:50.940]  witchcraft politics and economics talk about voodoo economics but also it is
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:56.100]  a theocracy now you know a lot of people worry about a theocracy that's the
[2:38:56.100 --> 2:39:02.100]  government of of horrible religionists that bring in a dictatorship this is
[2:39:02.100 --> 2:39:07.260]  what this is they are actually with art with satanic architecture they believe
[2:39:07.260 --> 2:39:13.220]  they are communicating with and receiving powers from devil and they
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:19.340]  create a natural magical environment James Wasserman who wrote a book I quote
[2:39:19.340 --> 2:39:24.020]  him on page 121 of mysterious monuments he wrote a book about the occult
[2:39:24.020 --> 2:39:28.340]  traditions in the art and architecture he says the basis of the mystery
[2:39:28.340 --> 2:39:34.140]  religions is the law of correspondence as above so below it goes all the way
[2:39:34.140 --> 2:39:41.100]  back Alex to the emerald tablet of Hermes back way into the Greek city
[2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:48.620]  state era but it basically means that they're building on earth in stone or
[2:39:48.620 --> 2:39:56.300]  glass wood steel what have you hell to building a hellish new utopia and they
[2:39:56.300 --> 2:40:02.940]  often conceal the true meaning of this by veiling it in symbols in satanic
[2:40:02.940 --> 2:40:07.620]  symbols but not up not always because you're going to find in this book such
[2:40:07.620 --> 2:40:11.900]  things as serpents and dragons and demons and as I mentioned at the national
[2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:18.660]  faderal even a gargoyle of darts fader there and all of this is a they're creating
[2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:26.220]  remember they say we're regenerating earth and so we're rebuilding earth and
[2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:31.220]  everywhere is they're building this architectural colossus even entire new
[2:40:31.220 --> 2:40:38.460]  cities in Brazil in Kazakhstan and so forth with the aim of bringing the
[2:40:38.460 --> 2:40:43.420]  Lucifer's kingdom on earth and they believe they're literally communicating
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:49.060]  with higher minds the the spirits from beyond they believe they're talking to
[2:40:49.060 --> 2:40:55.140]  quote angels or gods and goddesses oh yes and they're worshiping them now you
[2:40:55.140 --> 2:41:02.940]  know if the our constitution says that Congress will make no law respecting the
[2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:09.620]  establishment of religion they have established these mystery religions and
[2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:14.620]  that they admit to it and you'll see quote of by quote of a luminous and a
[2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:17.780]  cultist and my book mysterious monument and you have that but let me just make a
[2:41:17.780 --> 2:41:22.460]  point here backing up what you're saying when you go and you look at Washington
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:27.020]  DC or every other major state capital or governmental buildings city buildings
[2:41:27.020 --> 2:41:32.900]  whether it's Austin or San Francisco it doesn't matter it is all Babylonian
[2:41:32.900 --> 2:41:37.940]  slash Egyptian if you look at the government buildings in Ottawa or the
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:42.540]  government buildings in Manitoba they admit they are a cultic they were built
[2:41:42.540 --> 2:41:47.620]  by a cultist the people that designed them are a cultist and and so here they
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:52.980]  are saying oh get the 10 commitments out of a out of a Supreme Court building
[2:41:52.980 --> 2:41:57.100]  in Alabama get it out of the Supreme Court in DC get these little trappings
[2:41:57.100 --> 2:42:02.460]  now but then they can have their stuff everywhere because they believe it's
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:07.460]  giving them power and so people even if you don't believe in this they believe
[2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:11.500]  in it is the whole point this is what drives the world this you know
[2:42:11.500 --> 2:42:16.020]  psychologists should look at this this is what they believe governs the planet
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:22.140]  now now now text they also know that they're cross species Chimeras cross
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:26.780]  species you know spider with goats humans with pigs chimpanzees with humans
[2:42:26.780 --> 2:42:32.740]  growing at least for a decade humanoids their part bovine in utero and cows for
[2:42:32.740 --> 2:42:36.700]  organ harvesting we saw that medical documents 10 12 years ago now it's
[2:42:36.700 --> 2:42:41.860]  mainstream news and now it's in newspapers have had top scientists on
[2:42:41.860 --> 2:42:45.020]  who were making millions dollars until they found out that the potatoes that
[2:42:45.020 --> 2:42:47.780]  we're eating are killing us until they found out that all this cross-species
[2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:52.140]  stuff is deadly you know they don't care about the environment they clear it's
[2:42:52.140 --> 2:42:55.500]  you know they claim they're taking our rights and carbon footprints and global
[2:42:55.500 --> 2:43:00.300]  taxes and regulation and control you know is to save Gaia but in reality they
[2:43:00.300 --> 2:43:05.260]  want to overthrow what they believe is the old creation and people can say
[2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:09.300]  well that's your Christian view no no no you can say you don't believe in God of
[2:43:09.300 --> 2:43:13.700]  the Bible the point is the elite do they hate it and they say they're
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:17.060]  overthrowing it so if you really love the earth and you really love this
[2:43:17.060 --> 2:43:22.060]  creation you need to understand that they are seeking to overthrow it and
[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:26.260]  destroy it so it's so they know we love the planet they know we have common
[2:43:26.260 --> 2:43:29.860]  sense and want to you know breathe clean air and drink good water they say oh
[2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:33.740]  sign on to what we're doing to save the earth when in reality they want to
[2:43:33.740 --> 2:43:38.420]  overthrow it and destroy it to rebuild it in their hellish image
[2:43:38.420 --> 2:43:43.420]  Alex that is exactly right they want to create a new reality a new way of
[2:43:43.420 --> 2:43:49.100]  thinking and a new earth built on these regenerative principles play God remember
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:54.900]  they are not creators so their God is not the great creator he's the great
[2:43:54.900 --> 2:44:01.420]  architect he is building a new world order and this is the reason for all of
[2:44:01.420 --> 2:44:05.780]  this satanic architecture and the great work of the Illuminati and they
[2:44:05.780 --> 2:44:10.620]  actually use that term the great work and it hearkens back again to the
[2:44:10.620 --> 2:44:17.100]  mystery religions so it is a theocracy and sometimes it's disguised for
[2:44:17.100 --> 2:44:22.380]  example let me give you an example you'll find various monuments around the
[2:44:22.380 --> 2:44:28.140]  United States and Canada of state buildings including the Manitoba you
[2:44:28.140 --> 2:44:33.980]  and Winnipeg of Canada and I saw this but also AT&T building the Rockefeller
[2:44:33.980 --> 2:44:40.860]  Center and others have a a very beautiful statue of a golden boy who is
[2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:45.780]  that golden boy you might ask isn't that interesting the AT&T building in New
[2:44:45.780 --> 2:44:54.460]  York City was built exactly 666 feet high okay I document that in my book and
[2:44:54.460 --> 2:45:01.260]  they have a great statue of a golden boy holding up lightning bolts at the
[2:45:01.260 --> 2:45:07.420]  Rockefeller Center they have a fountain with the golden boy inside a circle like
[2:45:07.420 --> 2:45:12.540]  the circle of the earth or a ring now who is this golden boy he's none other
[2:45:12.540 --> 2:45:18.820]  than the then the Greek god Apollo he was called Horus by the Egyptians here
[2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:26.460]  we have Antichrist the son of of of of Osiris the this is amazing the golden
[2:45:26.460 --> 2:45:30.940]  boy and that's what he was called the golden boy now text since you brought up
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:37.940]  666 remember it was in the Associated Press I have the article 666 of these
[2:45:37.940 --> 2:45:43.740]  pink slat and gold pieces that fit exactly in at the Louvre to build the
[2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:49.700]  pyramid and meteor on demand and it had to be he told the architect the 666
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:57.500]  pieces and then I've had the the head you know professor on who who wrote this
[2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:02.060]  big book and he's he's not even you know religious about how up in Canada their
[2:46:02.060 --> 2:46:07.020]  government building has a room where they do rituals he admitted that that it's
[2:46:07.020 --> 2:46:12.460]  designed for that that's exactly 666 or the calculation for the sun god go
[2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:19.420]  ahead absolutely you know Rome had built a great capital building the ancient
[2:46:19.420 --> 2:46:24.740]  empire role that they they got the religious idea this from the Etruscan
[2:46:24.740 --> 2:46:30.700]  the Etruscan's always had their capital in you know building their capital of
[2:46:30.700 --> 2:46:35.940]  their various regions and they were built exactly like our US capital now at
[2:46:35.940 --> 2:46:42.300]  one time each year on their holy day where they were they really worship the
[2:46:42.300 --> 2:46:47.740]  devil they would go into the crypt of their capital building okay this is in
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:55.440]  Rome this is in Etrusca and they would there they had an a a cover at the
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:59.820]  bottom of the crypt right in the very center of it there would be a usually a
[2:46:59.820 --> 2:47:05.340]  metal maybe golden maybe brass or bronze or copper and they would lift that up
[2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:10.900]  and there they had built a huge cave or tunnel to the bottom of the earth where
[2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:14.780]  they believe the spirits would come up they would open up the cover and allow
[2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:20.700]  the spirits to come forth to bless their capital city now I I realizing this I
[2:47:20.700 --> 2:47:26.220]  began to study the architecture of the US capital I found it in the crypt beneath
[2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:30.980]  the rotunda where they they actually had a place there he was never laid but they
[2:47:30.980 --> 2:47:37.260]  even had a crypt a sarcophagus for George Washington built but they have a
[2:47:37.260 --> 2:47:44.300]  what they called the rose compass it's a cover and it leads down into the middle
[2:47:44.300 --> 2:47:50.020]  of the earth supposedly now so there in Washington DC at the capital down in the
[2:47:50.020 --> 2:47:55.940]  crypt I'm convinced these the luminous actually have an occult ritual once each
[2:47:55.940 --> 2:48:02.500]  year when they lift the rose compass plate out of the center of the capital
[2:48:02.500 --> 2:48:06.500]  and you mentioned the lay lines they believe the capital is built on this
[2:48:06.500 --> 2:48:10.740]  power well let me stop you let me stop you they literally ours they admittedly
[2:48:10.740 --> 2:48:14.820]  with the wine and the corn in the oil in an ancient Babylonian Masonic ritual
[2:48:14.820 --> 2:48:20.620]  lay the cornerstones and have guys in priest outfits do it we have I have I
[2:48:20.620 --> 2:48:24.860]  have a picture in fact of the book where they were laying the cornerstone of the
[2:48:24.860 --> 2:48:32.060]  US capital now in in London many of the people there are convinced and I am as
[2:48:32.060 --> 2:48:36.500]  well that many of the buildings there the mason's actually had cornerstone
[2:48:36.500 --> 2:48:41.540]  laying ceremonies and by the way post offices government buildings courthouses
[2:48:41.540 --> 2:48:44.820]  throughout the United States you'll find my sonic plaques they say we laid the
[2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:49.020]  cornerstone to this building on certain certain date but in the ancient
[2:48:49.020 --> 2:48:54.780]  mystery religions they sacrificed human beings and along with corn and oil and wine
[2:48:54.780 --> 2:49:01.700]  they consecrated this great stone with human blood and then they laid the stone
[2:49:01.700 --> 2:49:06.100]  here's an interesting thing for you Alex I want you to picture this on the 200th
[2:49:06.100 --> 2:49:11.860]  anniversary that was what in 1990 or so two or something the pre-masons of
[2:49:11.860 --> 2:49:16.100]  Washington DC in the United States from all 50 states actually held a great
[2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:22.140]  ceremony a recreation I have a film of it a recreation of the laying the original
[2:49:22.140 --> 2:49:27.580]  laying of the cornerstone the second and you know by Centennial but guess what
[2:49:27.580 --> 2:49:31.940]  they claimed that the architect of the capital there's a full-time person the
[2:49:31.940 --> 2:49:37.420]  architect of the capital he could not find the where the original cornerstone
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:42.500]  was laid they were going to unearth it and reunited again with their corn and
[2:49:42.500 --> 2:49:48.620]  oil in their occult ceremony he claimed he could not find it I wonder if they
[2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:52.420]  actually have human bones they killed individuals and laid them under that
[2:49:52.420 --> 2:49:56.900]  great cornerstone because this is what the ancient mystery religions did and
[2:49:56.900 --> 2:50:02.020]  this is nothing more than a theocracy of mystery religions this architectural
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:06.020]  co-op is the evidence of it that's right imagine if Christians tried to come out
[2:50:06.020 --> 2:50:10.140]  and do a ritual at the laying of new government buildings the ACLU would how
[2:50:10.140 --> 2:50:15.300]  but you have the masons come in and do that they are more than happy again
[2:50:15.300 --> 2:50:20.500]  absolutely the Denver International Airport there is a plaque saying the
[2:50:20.500 --> 2:50:27.660]  new world commission built this airport of course it was the US taxpayers but
[2:50:27.660 --> 2:50:32.500]  that was also done by the pre-masons of Colorado well and then we have the who
[2:50:32.500 --> 2:50:35.900]  built the Rosa Crucians building the Georgia guide stones saying they're
[2:50:35.900 --> 2:50:40.460]  going to kill 90% of us I mean they mean business they run things they're coming
[2:50:40.460 --> 2:50:45.020]  and they think you deserve to die for their god Lucifer

[2:54:10.940 --> 2:54:14.980]  Soviets had all the purges the Catholic Church has done that in areas they take

[2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:22.340]  amazing North American Union pyramids built in Princeton West Virginia outside
[2:55:22.340 --> 2:55:26.940]  of bluefield and by the way they were built even before the nineteen ninety
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:32.500]  five concordant you know agreed to by bush and fox than the Martin the
[2:55:32.500 --> 2:55:36.460]  prime minister of Canada than the president of Mexico so the North American
[2:55:36.460 --> 2:55:43.280]  Union was planned but took to consecrate it 33rd degree masons senator
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:47.740]  Robert Byrd I believe in these people met and had an occult ritual a
[2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:53.340]  panic ritual ceremony inside these three amazing pyramids who would have ever
[2:55:53.340 --> 2:55:58.220]  thought and by the way in front of those pyramids and they were built by the
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:56:04.500]  US Transportation Department taxpayer dollars or the flags of Mexico Canada in
[2:56:04.500 --> 2:56:10.420]  the United States in West Virginia the amazing North American Union pyramids
[2:56:10.420 --> 2:56:14.260]  with flags of the three countries then we have the Mooney Gardens of all sorts
[2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:18.980]  of occult stuff down in Galveston oh oh yes these pyramids are going up
[2:56:18.980 --> 2:56:25.100]  everywhere but maybe if we really want to see what the ultimate is on pages 434
[2:56:25.100 --> 2:56:32.100]  3437 of the book Alex I talk about the pyramid mysteries of the atomic bomb you
[2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:34.860]  must have what does that got to do with anything well you were talking early in
[2:56:34.860 --> 2:56:38.740]  your program and this is very vital get this in your mind you know there was a
[2:56:38.740 --> 2:56:43.780]  movie some years ago it was almost comical but but after a third world
[2:56:43.780 --> 2:56:48.620]  war people began to worship an idol and they went into this temple and it was
[2:56:48.620 --> 2:56:53.980]  an atomic bomb they were worshiping the actual atomic bomb and at first you
[2:56:53.980 --> 2:57:00.620]  say well now that's crazy you know this is a post war world you know but but
[2:57:00.620 --> 2:57:06.540]  wait just a minute maybe it's not so crazy after all because I disclosed the
[2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:12.380]  pyramid mysteries if you visit New Mexico near Alamogordo they have a
[2:57:12.380 --> 2:57:18.820]  monument built near where the first atomic bomb was unleashed you know at
[2:57:18.820 --> 2:57:24.260]  the during the manhattan project and guess what form it's in a pyramid a
[2:57:24.260 --> 2:57:29.540]  rock pyramid now J. Robert Oppenheimer is called a father of the atomic bomb he
[2:57:29.540 --> 2:57:34.540]  was head of the manhattan project turns out he was a commonist spy now this is
[2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:40.100]  interesting the first atomic bomb that they dropped on Japan they gave the name
[2:57:40.100 --> 2:57:45.980]  of the little boy but this is like the golden boy it's the antichrist and once
[2:57:45.980 --> 2:57:53.740]  he explodes he has such huge magical power a great mushroom comes up on the
[2:57:53.740 --> 2:57:59.580]  face of the planet and millions will be incinerated burned to death in a fire
[2:57:59.580 --> 2:58:06.420]  sacrifice now these are incredible things and but even the name Adam
[2:58:06.420 --> 2:58:15.220]  comes from the Egyptian God of death call at them at you him well he was an
[2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:18.740]  admitted Bohemian Grove member Robert Oppenheimer and the Grove admits in their
[2:58:18.740 --> 2:58:27.020]  own papers they hatched the plan there at the chalet we'll be right back thank

[2:59:55.500 --> 2:59:59.660]  be with us in about 20 minutes in studio text Mars is my guest he's gonna stay
[2:59:59.660 --> 3:00:06.180]  with us till 19 after we will take a run of your calls after this break in
[3:00:06.180 --> 3:00:11.180]  about eight minutes from now I wanted text be able to finish up with the
[3:00:11.180 --> 3:00:15.540]  occultist involved with the atomic bomb now this is a fact it's even mainstream
[3:00:15.540 --> 3:00:21.940]  history but his book really documents that so please continue text we know
[3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:31.140]  it's interesting the the first atomic bomb was dropped 716 1945 you say well
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:38.300]  what's the significance of that July 16th 1945 at the number 716 1945 you
[3:00:38.300 --> 3:00:43.140]  come up with a number 33 of course that's the highest level of free
[3:00:43.140 --> 3:00:46.860]  basing rate so we have the magical numerological number of the occult
[3:00:46.860 --> 3:00:52.340]  33 everything was planned that the bomb was called the little boy after the
[3:00:52.340 --> 3:00:57.540]  Antichrist a little boy of the goddess and the great god so everything Jay
[3:00:57.540 --> 3:01:01.540]  Robert Oppenheimer of course and then meanwhile it was called a Manhattan
[3:01:01.540 --> 3:01:07.340]  project well what were they doing in New Mexico well it was because of Illuminati
[3:01:07.340 --> 3:01:15.100]  chieftains who conceived of this and what to do about it to literally
[3:01:15.100 --> 3:01:18.540]  incinerate two cities and again everything is
[3:01:18.540 --> 3:01:25.260]  numerological two cities same as in 9-11 two towers and this is the the
[3:01:25.260 --> 3:01:31.780]  Antichrist and Satan his father you see and so everything is done in a magical
[3:01:31.780 --> 3:01:36.740]  ceremonial black magic fashion and now we know that Hitler wanted more blood
[3:01:36.740 --> 3:01:41.220]  linen called and mainstream history for more blood to get more power and they
[3:01:41.220 --> 3:01:46.260]  took the Babylonian famous gate and the seat of Satan as it was translated by
[3:01:46.260 --> 3:01:50.260]  the Babylonian south the Baghdad and Hitler had a huge my parents just
[3:01:50.260 --> 3:01:56.100]  visited in Berlin a huge concrete bomb shelter over the entire moved temple
[3:01:56.100 --> 3:02:00.820]  just to protect the seat of Satan and and and Hitler was obsessed with it
[3:02:00.820 --> 3:02:04.620]  that's why they make movies about you know the Raiders the Lost Ark Hitler
[3:02:04.620 --> 3:02:09.300]  running around wanting all these artifacts he was obsessed with it you
[3:02:09.300 --> 3:02:13.420]  know that is so true about the hitler in that situation that the book of
[3:02:13.420 --> 3:02:18.700]  revelation has as an interesting statement it talks about it says that
[3:02:18.700 --> 3:02:25.420]  it mentions the city in Greece named Pergamos or Pergamon where the seat of
[3:02:25.420 --> 3:02:31.380]  Satan is or where Satan dwells that's actually in the book of revelation the
[3:02:31.380 --> 3:02:36.580]  prophetic book in the Bible now Pergamos Hitler they had this incredible
[3:02:36.580 --> 3:02:43.220]  museum there in Berlin called the Museum or Temple of Pergamon and he
[3:02:43.220 --> 3:02:49.700]  actually recreated not only the great gate of Babylon but he had the the great
[3:02:49.700 --> 3:02:54.260]  temple of Zeus built and I have that that pictured in my book mysterious
[3:02:54.260 --> 3:03:00.020]  monuments so so imagine he was part of the same occult system even though he
[3:03:00.020 --> 3:03:05.100]  sort of double cost them and attempted to set up his own world a
[3:03:05.100 --> 3:03:11.860]  empower there you know Alex there's one place I think it's on pages 26 and 27
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:19.060]  talk about scary 20 years ago a Christian group came to visit me they had
[3:03:19.060 --> 3:03:23.500]  just come back from a missionary trip to the Dominican Republic and they were
[3:03:23.500 --> 3:03:27.660]  frightened and they sat in my office and they told me something that seemed
[3:03:27.660 --> 3:03:31.620]  fantastic and at first if these people had not been reliable I would not have
[3:03:31.620 --> 3:03:37.780]  believed it they said text you must investigate a great night from Malta
[3:03:37.780 --> 3:03:42.940]  temple that has been built in just outside of Santa Domingo Dominican
[3:03:42.940 --> 3:03:49.700]  Republic they said it is a temple of blood sacrifice in death well I saw come
[3:03:49.700 --> 3:03:54.820]  on you know they said we believe that Christians and those who oppose a new
[3:03:54.820 --> 3:04:00.180]  world order will be brought in on aircraft jets so nobody will they'll
[3:04:00.180 --> 3:04:04.740]  just be the disappeared they will be brought in and sacrificed in this
[3:04:04.740 --> 3:04:13.260]  fantastic structure that was just opened up in 1992 now I did not believe

[3:08:10.060 --> 3:08:14.900]  office we have a CBS news clip where they admit that Oppenheimer and others
[3:08:14.900 --> 3:08:18.980]  hatched the A-bomb plan at the Bohemia Grove where they conduct rituals but
[3:08:18.980 --> 3:08:24.820]  we've got a clip here of Oppenheimer saying I have become death you know
[3:08:24.820 --> 3:08:30.740]  passages out of the Bible and then they talk about Vishnu and the God of death
[3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:35.380]  and they talk about Kali and put it all in religious terminology this was a
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:41.820]  power trip for them and a very very sick see that they're into playing God
[3:08:41.820 --> 3:08:48.620]  let's go ahead and play that clip of Oppenheimer here it is oh we're we're
[3:08:48.620 --> 3:08:52.020]  loading that clip up we're doing all this right here on the fly that's what I
[3:08:52.020 --> 3:08:56.660]  was trying to ascertain earlier we'll play that clip before text Mars leaves
[3:08:56.660 --> 3:09:01.060]  us text you were continuing to make a point we went into break well you know
[3:09:01.060 --> 3:09:04.340]  talking about the pyramid mysteries of the atomic bomb in the monument being a
[3:09:04.340 --> 3:09:08.780]  pyramid and Oppenheimer you mentioned he quoted the Bible of the Hindus actually
[3:09:08.780 --> 3:09:14.260]  the Bhagavad Gita and he actually said and this was all planned of course it
[3:09:14.260 --> 3:09:19.300]  was a ritual as the mushroom cloud of the first atomic bomb test came up off the
[3:09:19.300 --> 3:09:26.060]  face of the desert he said I am become death the destroyer of world this is a
[3:09:26.060 --> 3:09:31.580]  quote taken right out of the Hindu beating scriptures of course they worship
[3:09:31.580 --> 3:09:36.260]  all of these false religions and they're like one big jumbo mumbo jumbo
[3:09:36.260 --> 3:09:41.060]  up to the occultist of the Illuminati okay let's go up and I'm recording this
[3:09:41.060 --> 3:09:43.900]  let's go ahead and play the clip we do have it now here he is here's the
[3:09:43.900 --> 3:09:48.940]  audio we knew the world would not be the same
[3:09:48.940 --> 3:10:02.460]  few people laughed few people cried most people were silent I remembered the
[3:10:02.460 --> 3:10:13.900]  line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita Vishnu is trying to
[3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:23.620]  persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his
[3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:35.300]  multi-armed form and says now I'm become death the destroyer of worlds I suppose
[3:10:35.300 --> 3:10:40.900]  we all thought that so there he is for you now understand folks you hear it they
[3:10:40.900 --> 3:10:45.420]  have to come become death and then kill you to show you to do as you're told you
[3:10:45.420 --> 3:10:49.460]  will accept the love of Lucifer you will kill people in mass the police will
[3:10:49.460 --> 3:10:54.740]  wear the black uniform of Saturn we will murder you for the love of Lucifer for
[3:10:54.740 --> 3:11:00.860]  the for the loving sweet death of Lucifer isn't that right Tex it absolutely
[3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:06.580]  isn't it's so astonishing that they want to bring death to the world you know a
[3:11:06.580 --> 3:11:11.620]  kid Turner who says we'll leave 500 million people that means well six
[3:11:11.620 --> 3:11:15.820]  billion must be exterminated you mentioned the Georgia guide stones
[3:11:15.820 --> 3:11:21.180]  built in Everton Georgia I visited those I have pictures of them in this book I
[3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:25.940]  talk about the the guide stones there's a plaque there in eight languages
[3:11:25.940 --> 3:11:32.620]  including Babylon Babylonian cuneiform and hieroglyphics and English and it
[3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:39.220]  says that we must return the world to only 500 million people to keep it in a
[3:11:39.220 --> 3:11:46.500]  perpetual balance with nature so this is this is their their plan to massacre
[3:11:46.500 --> 3:11:52.340]  and a great blood sacrifice and Alex this this temple of blood that's what I
[3:11:52.340 --> 3:11:57.420]  call it and Santa Domingo that I discovered in page 26 27 of my book
[3:11:57.420 --> 3:12:06.420]  in 1992 they had the great opening ceremony and a reporter freed cannot
[3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:10.140]  freed of the Los Angeles Times reported he says that it's a memorial in a
[3:12:10.140 --> 3:12:16.860]  688 foot tall lighthouse monument it's called he says quote this from the LA
[3:12:16.860 --> 3:12:24.660]  Times the new memorial is a gigantic and some say grotesque lighthouse built in
[3:12:24.660 --> 3:12:29.940]  the form of a horizontal cross 10 stories high and two and a half football
[3:12:29.940 --> 3:12:37.580]  feels long now Alex at the very top the apex of this gigantic building I mean
[3:12:37.580 --> 3:12:44.420]  it's it's it's huge it's like you know 50 Walmarts it looks like powering at the
[3:12:44.420 --> 3:12:51.620]  top is built nothing more than a Mayan temple to the Sun God remember they they
[3:12:51.620 --> 3:12:55.980]  untold thousands of human victims were sacrificed to the devil the Sun God and
[3:12:55.980 --> 3:13:01.580]  the ancient at the very top the altar of these my it's a supposedly it's a
[3:13:01.580 --> 3:13:06.420]  supposedly Catholic temple or church and the thing is built like an Aztec
[3:13:06.420 --> 3:13:12.100]  sacrifice center just just just right in front of everybody it's just amazing
[3:13:12.100 --> 3:13:19.580]  it's built as a as a a a temple of blood dedicated to the Mayan deity the May's
[3:13:19.580 --> 3:13:24.180]  God who was believed to die and resurrect each year have a picture of him an
[3:13:24.180 --> 3:13:30.380]  idol stone idol of him on page 27 he had a brutal taste for bloodlust but he
[3:13:30.380 --> 3:13:35.260]  would guarantee a fruitful harvest so the Mayan temples had these human
[3:13:35.260 --> 3:13:39.900]  sacrifices of maybe hundreds of thousands where they would cut out
[3:13:39.900 --> 3:13:43.740]  literally the beating heart of their victims and then they would as cannibals
[3:13:43.740 --> 3:13:50.500]  eat his flesh but this is so grotesque it's unbelievable now this great temple
[3:13:50.500 --> 3:13:56.060]  has and in center Domingo Dominican Republic has a great laser light beam
[3:13:56.060 --> 3:14:02.340]  built into the very top of it and and therefore they can beam up a holographic
[3:14:02.340 --> 3:14:07.820]  image and you know the Bible warns of the image of the beast that people will be
[3:14:07.820 --> 3:14:11.700]  made to worship in the last days made me sort of think of that but here's the
[3:14:11.700 --> 3:14:19.700]  thing this building has no windows in it this great monument one of the
[3:14:19.700 --> 3:14:22.780]  persons who visited said they were only allowed to go in certain areas but they
[3:14:22.780 --> 3:14:27.300]  looked down this gigantic hall that looked like it went for miles maybe
[3:14:27.300 --> 3:14:30.980]  only you know the two-and-a-half football feels long they said what looked
[3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:37.260]  like to be bars the dungeon were there now it's a giant it's a giant crypt is
[3:14:37.260 --> 3:14:42.060]  what it sounds like a giant dungeon it is and it was built by the secret order
[3:14:42.060 --> 3:14:45.980]  of the Vatican called the Knights of Malta they were the ones who helped bring
[3:14:45.980 --> 3:14:50.340]  in the Nazis into the United States under Operation Paperclip after World War
[3:14:50.340 --> 3:14:55.380]  II and in the Brazil and South America the Rat Line the Rat Line that's right
[3:14:55.380 --> 3:15:00.740]  so this is literally a grotesque thing now they do have what looked like
[3:15:00.740 --> 3:15:04.140]  windows if you look at that picture on page 26 it looks like windows but let me
[3:15:04.140 --> 3:15:10.060]  tell you what that is those are murals painted murals of the world's flag this
[3:15:10.060 --> 3:15:14.860]  represents all the nations of earth so it's a big win at big tech here's the
[3:15:14.860 --> 3:15:18.380]  deal I have already twisted your arm into 20 extra minutes I got loaded phone
[3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:21.820]  lines and we got about five minutes left I don't want to wish I don't want to
[3:15:21.820 --> 3:15:25.020]  twist your arm to the bottom of the hour but you can make the choice keep going
[3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:30.940]  and then take calls or or or take calls now and get out of here Alex we can we
[3:15:30.940 --> 3:15:34.260]  can do whatever you want to because I'll tell you this is this is the message of
[3:15:34.260 --> 3:15:39.420]  the hour and we need okay let people know there is graphic yeah tangible proof
[3:15:39.420 --> 3:15:43.820]  okay then let's do this architectural colossus let's let's do this let's finish
[3:15:43.820 --> 3:15:50.380]  up with the bizarre activities of the Knights of Malta and then let's take
[3:15:50.380 --> 3:15:52.900]  these five phone calls go ahead Texan will keep you to the bottom of the hour
[3:15:52.900 --> 3:15:56.900]  but then I promise you'll be gone well this Christian group that first came to
[3:15:56.900 --> 3:16:01.380]  see me they said that they talked to some of the locals who were frightened to
[3:16:01.380 --> 3:16:05.980]  talk to them about this and they say that all the workers were brought in
[3:16:05.980 --> 3:16:10.300]  from outside the city most of them were peasants and afterwards they
[3:16:10.300 --> 3:16:13.940]  disappeared their families were coming into the capital city Santa Domingo and
[3:16:13.940 --> 3:16:19.100]  saying my brother my father are missing and so they must have taken all the
[3:16:19.100 --> 3:16:24.180]  laborers and after they built this great thing they killed them so that tells
[3:16:24.180 --> 3:16:27.540]  you a little bit but talking about the those who have to build a new world
[3:16:27.540 --> 3:16:32.500]  order the lower minions what they think of those people but now the people told
[3:16:32.500 --> 3:16:36.100]  me that they had the message that they would bribe people from the United
[3:16:36.100 --> 3:16:41.020]  States over there and have human sacrifice rituals and then they would
[3:16:41.020 --> 3:16:47.060]  deposit their bodies or their ashes into the sea because this this great temple
[3:16:47.060 --> 3:16:52.500]  of the Mayan modern temple of blood goes into the ocean there now I thought
[3:16:52.500 --> 3:16:58.220]  this is so fantastic why would they load people up dissidents or whoever
[3:16:58.220 --> 3:17:02.380]  opposing the new war why would they load them up on aircraft couldn't they I
[3:17:02.380 --> 3:17:06.460]  know they're building gulags in America we know they've built in Oklahoma the
[3:17:06.460 --> 3:17:11.540]  giant federal distribution center for prisoners and they say the thing is so
[3:17:11.540 --> 3:17:16.740]  huge it could do a million people in just a few days and it's way bigger than
[3:17:16.740 --> 3:17:20.020]  what they need they're just a you know few prisoners a day going through there
[3:17:20.020 --> 3:17:24.860]  and they're like it's just gigantic well I that's what escapes me but on the
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:29.580]  other hand you know I've been pondering this for many years now and then
[3:17:29.580 --> 3:17:34.900]  suddenly with a so-called war on terror we learn about that that euphemism
[3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:41.900]  Alex extraordinary rendition worth what are they doing secretly grabbing US
[3:17:41.900 --> 3:17:46.500]  citizens and flying them out to quote ghost sites or black sites all over the

[3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:55.740]  States prisons around the world and what did general to goomba the army

[3:24:26.820 --> 3:24:31.740]  question black nobility out of Genoa out of Italy yeah the black nobility is
[3:24:31.740 --> 3:24:38.700]  based in in Europe and they're involved with the European Bank and the European
[3:24:38.700 --> 3:24:43.380]  Union putting it all together so that is the black nobility probably that
[3:24:43.380 --> 3:24:47.460]  extends also to those people that are pushing such things as the Da Vinci code
[3:24:47.460 --> 3:24:54.340]  and you know that the chapel at the Renele Chateau and the devil god in
[3:24:54.340 --> 3:24:58.980]  there and all that's involved with the black nobility and of course you have
[3:24:58.980 --> 3:25:05.660]  the Habsburg dynasty they're still very big Queen Elizabeth all of the you know
[3:25:05.660 --> 3:25:10.980]  that the the British set are very much involved and look what happened to a
[3:25:10.980 --> 3:25:17.100]  princess Diana when she became engaged to a Muslim there she was the most
[3:25:17.100 --> 3:25:21.420]  definitely assassinated we know that so that's the black nobility as far as
[3:25:21.420 --> 3:25:24.700]  some of the other names the Rockefellers the Rothschild seem to be
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:29.460]  primary and the you'll see pictures of their estate and the various symbols
[3:25:29.460 --> 3:25:33.340]  and things in mysterious monuments the whole section gotta go to the next call
[3:25:33.340 --> 3:25:37.380]  here gotta move fast for everybody in let's go ahead and talk to Scott in
[3:25:37.380 --> 3:25:41.580]  Arizona you're on the air thanks for holding Scott yeah just wanted to make
[3:25:41.580 --> 3:25:45.580]  a statement and a question real quick my statement is that as you were saying
[3:25:45.580 --> 3:25:49.540]  that these people really believe in and Satan and the the latest really put
[3:25:49.540 --> 3:25:53.700]  their time into demon worship and what I wanted to say is the Bible also says
[3:25:53.700 --> 3:25:57.180]  that the that we were fighting principality and powers not flesh and
[3:25:57.180 --> 3:26:01.100]  blood and at this this not only a you know an information war but also a
[3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:04.980]  spiritual warfare that's going on behind the scenes been going on for a long
[3:26:04.980 --> 3:26:08.820]  time now that they want to make it the question I have is is there any whistle
[3:26:08.820 --> 3:26:13.900]  blowers on the inside of these higher up elitist and they throw them out and
[3:26:13.900 --> 3:26:16.900]  you always hear about Rockefeller secretary's being shot or thrown out of
[3:26:16.900 --> 3:26:21.180]  windows they're killing their people all the time text oh yeah one of the
[3:26:21.180 --> 3:26:27.060]  younger Rothschilds was found a suicide in a hotel room and they say he hung
[3:26:27.060 --> 3:26:32.460]  himself with a necktie so you know and uh so there we have a Sinclair was also a
[3:26:32.460 --> 3:26:37.100]  kill every went to the Holy Land and and began to shoot his mouth off too much
[3:26:37.100 --> 3:26:41.580]  so this thing happens and even here in the United States the deputy director of
[3:26:41.580 --> 3:26:49.180]  the FBI with O'Neill was found dead and they claimed he was killed and if you
[3:26:49.180 --> 3:26:53.700]  look at Royalty if you look at elitist and royalty there's much higher
[3:26:53.700 --> 3:26:58.460]  statistics of being murdered being drowned dying suspiciously then they're
[3:26:58.460 --> 3:27:00.700]  always killing each other throughout history to cover stuff up
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:05.220]  now Steven Colorado you're on the air with text Mars go ahead yeah hi there
[3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:09.140]  had two quick comments and a quick question we're not have time for all
[3:27:09.140 --> 3:27:13.340]  three go ahead okay well the first one is often time to hear that the Muslims
[3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:16.780]  and the Christians worship the same God well that's not true and that's easily
[3:27:16.780 --> 3:27:21.340]  provable by the fact that Allah has no son that's the first comment the second
[3:27:21.340 --> 3:27:27.460]  one is that the God of free masonry pike clearly declares in his book morals and
[3:27:27.460 --> 3:27:31.260]  dogma he says that Lucifer is God unfortunately I don't know what page
[3:27:31.260 --> 3:27:35.780]  that is text you may and that the third thing is Alex you had mentioned that
[3:27:35.780 --> 3:27:39.620]  there was an article about Tony Blair flopping around on the ground channeling
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:43.140]  the spirit of life where was that at scores of them we wrote articles about
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:47.980]  an info wars like five years ago three years ago he goes to Aztec temples for
[3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:52.580]  rituals he goes to temples all over his wife is an admitted witch text you want
[3:27:52.580 --> 3:27:56.260]  to back that up I don't have it in front of me oh yeah go to google.com and put
[3:27:56.260 --> 3:28:01.340]  up the Blair occult new age just use those words now it says he gets on the
[3:28:01.340 --> 3:28:05.760]  ground he takes him over and he falls on the ground as he channels the spirit
[3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:10.180]  of life tax oh oh yes they have they have little pyramids in their home that
[3:28:10.180 --> 3:28:13.980]  they believe we're holy objects he does well I think her name is Cheryl or
[3:28:13.980 --> 3:28:18.460]  Sherry I can't remember which area but but it's sort of a fun thing that the
[3:28:18.460 --> 3:28:23.380]  tabloids have a big joke about going you know over in Great Britain one time he
[3:28:23.380 --> 3:28:28.100]  went on a trip to meet you a picture of Pichu in the with the Peru yes and
[3:28:28.100 --> 3:28:32.740]  there and they bathe in the holy waters inside the cave and it said they held and
[3:28:32.740 --> 3:28:38.100]  screamed yeah yeah it's amazing what you and of course that they do howling and
[3:28:38.100 --> 3:28:42.820]  screaming laying naked in a coffin at the skull and bones and George W. Bush and
[3:28:42.820 --> 3:28:45.980]  George Herbert Walker Bush yeah let's let's cram one more in and I'm gonna go
[3:28:45.980 --> 3:28:49.540]  into the break and say bye to Tex on air and I'm sorry to be going through you
[3:28:49.540 --> 3:28:53.940]  guys so fast I just want to get to all of you Travis in Seattle go ahead yeah
[3:28:53.940 --> 3:28:58.300]  hi Texas I'm wondering if these people actually think their name in the book of
[3:28:58.300 --> 3:29:03.260]  life and they have nothing to lose so they got to save their ancestors as such
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:06.220]  and try to win this battle with God when he comes back is that what they're
[3:29:06.220 --> 3:29:09.860]  planning anything they believe they're reincarnated and they're gonna rule
[3:29:09.860 --> 3:29:14.100]  with Lucifer text I believe they do too because second testimony into the Bible
[3:29:14.100 --> 3:29:20.220]  says of the last days that these people will suffer under a strong delusion so
[3:29:20.220 --> 3:29:23.660]  that they will not believe the truth they're deluded by the devil the wolf
[3:29:23.660 --> 3:29:27.260]  pulled over their eyes they say there stay there let me say bye to you right

[3:38:58.620 --> 3:39:03.020]  chance to analyze the BBC piece you've had a chance to also read their hit piece
[3:39:03.020 --> 3:39:08.540]  that accompanied it just try to a through Z break down what we're looking at
[3:39:08.540 --> 3:39:11.820]  here then we're gonna get an article out in the next 24 hours that we need to
[3:39:11.820 --> 3:39:16.260]  hammer them with because the last BBC piece was so shoddy we use it to really
[3:39:16.260 --> 3:39:20.700]  damage them really expose their lies and fraud and corruption and disinfo or
[3:39:20.700 --> 3:39:24.100]  they're completely retarded I mean you know you can get it but I mean
[3:39:24.100 --> 3:39:27.940]  regardless it's pure bull the new one it looks like is even worse from what you
[3:39:27.940 --> 3:39:31.500]  were telling me absolutely and I'd like to kick it off with the fact that we
[3:39:31.500 --> 3:39:34.820]  preempted them with our Barry Jennings interview and they had to put out an
[3:39:34.820 --> 3:39:38.940]  article two days later trying to counter our Barry Jennings interview and they
[3:39:38.940 --> 3:39:44.140]  actually did include Dylan showing them the video in the BBC piece but that
[3:39:44.140 --> 3:39:47.980]  gave them a heads up to come out with it but only in the side piece not in the
[3:39:47.980 --> 3:39:52.180]  main piece just like I made popular mechanics when we put out reports about
[3:39:52.180 --> 3:39:58.500]  how they were did a hit piece on Michael Jackson how they're dishonest how they
[3:39:58.500 --> 3:40:02.900]  lie to people to get the interview about how they claim it's not a hit piece and
[3:40:02.900 --> 3:40:06.980]  then I also reported oh do you mention your film that popular mechanics owns
[3:40:06.980 --> 3:40:12.300]  you do you mention that that I hear you're showing the book advertising it
[3:40:12.300 --> 3:40:16.820]  they had to they postpone it two weeks and went and remove that I'm told so go
[3:40:16.820 --> 3:40:20.460]  ahead yeah and then it's just an official version love fest for instance they
[3:40:20.460 --> 3:40:24.220]  pay a lot of attention to Martin Lizzo head of CDI that's control demolition
[3:40:24.220 --> 3:40:28.820]  incorporated the company that was hired to clean up both Oklahoma City and the
[3:40:28.820 --> 3:40:32.500]  World Trade Center disaster and he just goes on and on and on about how there's
[3:40:32.500 --> 3:40:35.580]  no way they could have demolished that building he would know about it of course
[3:40:35.580 --> 3:40:40.380]  now another key point is that the BBC themselves reported that the building
[3:40:40.380 --> 3:40:44.860]  had fallen 20 plus minutes before now of course the BBC tries to spin this and
[3:40:44.860 --> 3:40:49.260]  say we're all saying the BBC is part of a conspiracy but if you go back to when
[3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:53.460]  you broke that story Alex and I called in the thing that I said I said and you
[3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:57.020]  said we need to know who told them that we need to find out if this was a script
[3:40:57.020 --> 3:41:01.420]  they laughed in two BBC articles saying nobody told us that but now they've had
[3:41:01.420 --> 3:41:05.900]  to admit they were told exactly just like I said it went out over the wire went
[3:41:05.900 --> 3:41:09.260]  out over the Reuters wire and what is so interesting about that Reuters wire is
[3:41:09.260 --> 3:41:12.580]  the fact that they had the official version of why the building had fallen
[3:41:12.580 --> 3:41:18.420]  fires and damage seven plus years before the report and they said seven
[3:41:18.420 --> 3:41:21.740]  plus years well now if you think about for the newness report it's not out yet
[3:41:21.740 --> 3:41:28.180]  exactly and so the Reuters before hours before and then CNN and BBC it fell
[3:41:28.180 --> 3:41:31.940]  from structural fires a complete collapse building seven Solomon brothers
[3:41:31.940 --> 3:41:35.180]  getting their script together and I remember on the news them saying building
[3:41:35.180 --> 3:41:39.220]  seven may fall building seven has fell I remember hearing that on the radio
[3:41:39.220 --> 3:41:42.940]  locals remember it and we have folks that saw the countdown and I want to go back
[3:41:42.940 --> 3:41:47.060]  well let's go through this Barry Jennings yes who he is briefly how he got
[3:41:47.060 --> 3:41:50.540]  scared and said please don't play that what what he really said in this piece
[3:41:50.540 --> 3:41:54.140]  and how they tried to counter our preemption sure he was an emergency
[3:41:54.140 --> 3:41:57.300]  operating officer who happened to be in World Trade Center seven one of the few
[3:41:57.300 --> 3:42:00.940]  people that went there on the morning in 9-11 now he goes there with the City
[3:42:00.940 --> 3:42:04.860]  Corporation Council Michael Hess of course the BBC did not go interview Michael
[3:42:04.860 --> 3:42:08.660]  Hess wasn't interested in his story was only interested in the story that we
[3:42:08.660 --> 3:42:12.740]  have and then Barry Jennings offered us the information that he was stepping
[3:42:12.740 --> 3:42:16.020]  over bodies if you watch that interview I don't say Barry were there dead bodies
[3:42:16.020 --> 3:42:19.420]  what were you doing he's the one that volunteered the information that in
[3:42:19.420 --> 3:42:23.060]  fact when he had been rescued he was stepping over bodies in the lot but the
[3:42:23.060 --> 3:42:26.980]  key is the building's blowing up before tower one or two falls correct that's
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:31.620]  the key correct and and he's in that 23rd floor and what on his way down when
[3:42:31.620 --> 3:42:34.980]  they hit about the 8th floor that's when that explosion happens and that is
[3:42:34.980 --> 3:42:40.500]  prior to either tower collapsing and that is again not in the BBC piece at all
[3:42:40.500 --> 3:42:43.220]  they just show him talking about explosions inside and outside the
[3:42:43.220 --> 3:42:46.540]  building they give no relevance to when they occurred and they go with the
[3:42:46.540 --> 3:42:50.860]  official FEMA timeline that it's the first tower coming down and those are
[3:42:50.860 --> 3:42:56.140]  the explosions that Barry heard now how do they do you watch sitting there
[3:42:56.140 --> 3:42:59.740]  bless your watching and how do they counter Jane Stanley saying the
[3:42:59.740 --> 3:43:02.340]  building's collapse and it's right behind well they have Jane Stanley on
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:05.740]  and she's upset with us of course she's been harassed but she would never come
[3:43:05.740 --> 3:43:10.020]  on our show why they call it absolutely not and now the other guy the other
[3:43:10.020 --> 3:43:13.900]  anchor he I mean let's go through what he said a few months ago but go ahead
[3:43:13.900 --> 3:43:17.460]  we are changed in front of the anchor that was talking to Jane Stanley and
[3:43:17.460 --> 3:43:20.260]  when he was confronted with the information first there was a little
[3:43:20.260 --> 3:43:23.220]  time discrepancy so he said he wasn't sure he was there but then they showed
[3:43:23.220 --> 3:43:26.900]  him the tape and he was like well that is really odd isn't it there could be
[3:43:26.900 --> 3:43:31.860]  first he said I didn't report on on 9-11 I was off at who could who could not
[3:43:31.860 --> 3:43:36.460]  remember they didn't report on 9-11 okay he's reporting on it all day long in
[3:43:36.460 --> 3:43:41.700]  there as the main anchor going to the reporters on BBC world and he does and
[3:43:41.700 --> 3:43:45.500]  then they should I do remember yes but now I remember he has the full story
[3:43:45.500 --> 3:43:50.380]  suddenly he's telling the truth folks and but but then at the end he does say
[3:43:50.380 --> 3:43:53.620]  well those sounds suspicious to me yeah absolutely but I mean I mean so how does
[3:43:53.620 --> 3:43:56.860]  she counter all this she does encounter she basically just says you know I got
[3:43:56.860 --> 3:43:59.860]  that report it wasn't a question it was a fact in other words she read it off a
[3:43:59.860 --> 3:44:04.060]  teleprompter off of that wrote Reuters press release and they actually have the
[3:44:04.060 --> 3:44:08.020]  email Reuters admitting that Reuters is the one that put out that info but all
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:11.900]  these years we said we call Jane Stanley we call the other guy and say well you
[3:44:11.900 --> 3:44:15.020]  got that on a news wire you were told that who reported they would say that's
[3:44:15.020 --> 3:44:18.140]  a conspiracy remember the guy who wrote the the whole the editor I mean the
[3:44:18.140 --> 3:44:22.620]  head of BBC wrote two articles saying we were conspiracy theorist and no one
[3:44:22.620 --> 3:44:25.620]  told him that and it was a mistake then they said we said well give us the
[3:44:25.620 --> 3:44:29.940]  original tapes oh no we lost those then they found them for this report yeah
[3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:32.900]  absolutely and they they make it out to be like we're saying oh they were
[3:44:32.900 --> 3:44:36.420]  covering it up well they were covering it up they obviously have the archives
[3:44:36.420 --> 3:44:39.620]  from 9-11 it wasn't really that big of a search they said that they found them in
[3:44:39.620 --> 3:44:43.740]  the 2002 section instead of the 2001 section you would have thought that
[3:44:43.740 --> 3:44:46.140]  someone would have checked that out right from the beginning those tapes are
[3:44:46.140 --> 3:44:50.380]  gold all the 9-11 tapes were gone over I mean they they rearm on TV from every
[3:44:50.380 --> 3:44:54.620]  major channel so so it's just what we thought it would be yeah I mean the
[3:44:54.620 --> 3:44:59.220]  first BBC hit peace claims that you guys say the debris four miles away but you
[3:44:59.220 --> 3:45:03.340]  used a map quest which you didn't do in the news reports say eight miles away
[3:45:03.340 --> 3:45:08.980]  they just made that up eight miles away over a mountain ridge in New Baltimore
[3:45:08.980 --> 3:45:13.140]  this was not eight miles away in Indian Lake this was over a mountain ridge let
[3:45:13.140 --> 3:45:16.500]  me say that again eight miles away over a mountain ridge in New Baltimore and
[3:45:16.500 --> 3:45:20.020]  they just totally gloss over that fact and when they talked to the mayor of
[3:45:20.020 --> 3:45:23.900]  Indian Lake in Shanksville in Indian Lake he's like oh well that's absurd when
[3:45:23.900 --> 3:45:27.420]  we interviewed him he said to us on camera well I would have known a plane
[3:45:27.420 --> 3:45:30.700]  to crash there until they told me I was asking where now now you have that
[3:45:30.700 --> 3:45:33.260]  footage you didn't put it in a loose change final cut are we gonna put that
[3:45:33.260 --> 3:45:36.140]  in favorable animation we can we can put that in the extras for sure just to show
[3:45:36.140 --> 3:45:39.380]  because we're also going to show Anthony Santalamacia who was Willie
[3:45:39.380 --> 3:45:43.020]  Rodriguez's supervisor already cut that together as an extra backing up his
[3:45:43.020 --> 3:45:46.060]  entire story explosions in the basement prior incredible part is we have
[3:45:46.060 --> 3:45:49.940]  hundreds of witnesses the firefighters of Willie in their unlock and doors for
[3:45:49.940 --> 3:45:53.860]  him and the debunkers just say he's a liar wasn't there and John Schroeder is
[3:45:53.860 --> 3:45:57.860]  in truth rising you know and and he's a firefighter in the lobby video evidence
[3:45:57.860 --> 3:46:01.300]  you know he was there but you gotta understand Alex their big their big
[3:46:01.300 --> 3:46:04.500]  argument is they're confused everybody that doesn't agree with the official
[3:46:04.500 --> 3:46:08.620]  version of 9-11 is obviously confused and we need to tell you well well well
[3:46:08.620 --> 3:46:12.580]  why this BBC thing is important is it's just like in New Zealand Australia and
[3:46:12.580 --> 3:46:19.460]  Thailand multiple countries hours before he's captured in his name is released
[3:46:19.460 --> 3:46:23.460]  they already had the papers come out right about the time Kennedy's killed
[3:46:23.460 --> 3:46:28.100]  he's not caught for hours that Lee Harvey Oswald did it in print on news
[3:46:28.100 --> 3:46:33.220]  stance before it happens now they got their time zone screwed up same thing
[3:46:33.220 --> 3:46:36.780]  with building seven they got there something went wrong that's what they
[3:46:36.780 --> 3:46:39.260]  kept saying it's gonna come down at two o'clock it's gonna come down at three at
[3:46:39.260 --> 3:46:43.220]  four and it's got these little fires and people are going why don't we fight it
[3:46:43.220 --> 3:46:46.700]  well buildings always come down it's going to you're gonna see and then
[3:46:46.700 --> 3:46:51.220]  perfectly falls down and I've recently seen a video of a much smaller steel
[3:46:51.220 --> 3:46:55.340]  structured building where the facade does fall due to fire but then when it's
[3:46:55.340 --> 3:46:58.500]  gone all the steel structure is still right where the debunkers always show
[3:46:58.500 --> 3:47:01.780]  buildings where she rocket stuff collapses yeah that's what we're saying
[3:47:01.780 --> 3:47:06.140]  and there's the skeleton yes absolutely the metal the steel structure of that
[3:47:06.140 --> 3:47:09.900]  building is unharmed when that thing comes down you just have to look it up
[3:47:09.900 --> 3:47:12.380]  and you know the debunkers always try to pull well there's fire bringing the
[3:47:12.380 --> 3:47:15.460]  building down now fire is never brought down now what's this other part you're
[3:47:15.460 --> 3:47:18.820]  saying where he put out about my press release saying that we're basically a
[3:47:18.820 --> 3:47:23.620]  cult oh that's the new thing we're we're a crazy cult of half the population well
[3:47:23.620 --> 3:47:27.540]  the London independent you know followed up this BBC story saying that of course
[3:47:27.540 --> 3:47:30.620]  we were not going to be convinced even though Cheyenne Sunder the guy who told
[3:47:30.620 --> 3:47:34.340]  popular mechanics that 25% of the building was scooped out is the main guy
[3:47:34.340 --> 3:47:38.100]  he's the main this guy and he's on there going oh well now we really the working
[3:47:38.100 --> 3:47:41.220]  hypothesis is fire and structural damage but we have their own internal
[3:47:41.220 --> 3:47:44.180]  report saying it's not fire yeah that's the femur report where they say it has a
[3:47:44.180 --> 3:47:49.260]  very low probability of occurrence and it's just wild to me I mean they're
[3:47:49.260 --> 3:47:53.580]  making excuses like oh if there was a control demolition then the wielding
[3:47:53.580 --> 3:47:56.660]  the buildings next door their windows would have popped out from the force
[3:47:56.660 --> 3:48:01.220]  but you have this building come down in a symmetrical manner not to damage the
[3:48:01.220 --> 3:48:04.900]  other buildings see if it was if it was an asymmetrical collapse it could have
[3:48:04.900 --> 3:48:08.380]  hurt the building to the left to the right no no it's a beautiful job they
[3:48:08.380 --> 3:48:11.860]  did and you did get windows blown out in the buildings beside it yeah but but
[3:48:11.860 --> 3:48:16.140]  I mean you have the swabs the blast and and they just hope that everybody's
[3:48:16.140 --> 3:48:19.020]  stupid I mean they're in a lot of trouble because they've got all these
[3:48:19.020 --> 3:48:22.620]  physicists all these scientists accredited scientific journals publishing
[3:48:22.620 --> 3:48:26.460]  this now peer-reviewed what are they gonna do well they what they'll do is
[3:48:26.460 --> 3:48:29.060]  they'll ignore the hard evidence such as the molten metal under the scene they
[3:48:29.060 --> 3:48:32.740]  won't show you the NASA thermal imagery that proves there are hot spots beyond
[3:48:32.740 --> 3:48:36.540]  what the jet fuel could cause under seven and then that's admitted that you've
[3:48:36.540 --> 3:48:40.420]  got a thousand plus degrees above jet fuel and they just won't discuss it well
[3:48:40.420 --> 3:48:44.500]  when the BBC guy Smith little snake was here I would say we'll talk about North
[3:48:44.500 --> 3:48:48.100]  Woods I'm gonna talk about US troops mass in Afghanistan to see Christina's
[3:48:48.100 --> 3:48:53.060]  bigger stand I'll talk about I'm trained at US bases he would not talk about no
[3:48:53.060 --> 3:48:56.060]  he said no we're not gonna talk about that we're not gonna talk about that we're
[3:48:56.060 --> 3:48:59.500]  not gonna talk about that you know and then for they're here for three four
[3:48:59.500 --> 3:49:03.740]  days following me and then I switched Galileo with Copernicus and then that's
[3:49:03.740 --> 3:49:06.820]  their big thing oh look he got it wrong or you know you know backwards who
[3:49:06.820 --> 3:49:10.340]  discovered what yes yeah it's just like when we were on the history channel
[3:49:10.340 --> 3:49:13.540]  and I mentioned how the FBI had said that they're they're working theory at
[3:49:13.540 --> 3:49:17.220]  the time were bombs in the basement and I used Pat Dawson as an example no Pat
[3:49:17.220 --> 3:49:20.740]  Dawson was told by Albert Turry but there's a separate clip of the guy on
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:24.340]  NBC News saying that we think there were truck bombs in the basement that started
[3:49:24.340 --> 3:49:27.260]  the explosions that brought down the bill well let's be clear that the state
[3:49:27.260 --> 3:49:31.540]  police the fireman the governor that was video them removing the bombs from the
[3:49:31.540 --> 3:49:35.420]  Oklahoma City building and then a controlled emulation comes in you got
[3:49:35.420 --> 3:49:39.620]  65% of the building standing they coordinate off they blow up the rubble
[3:49:39.620 --> 3:49:43.780]  take it to a landfill arm guards from Wackenhart guard to this day they bring
[3:49:43.780 --> 3:49:47.860]  in hundreds of concrete trucks to mix concrete in with the chunks some
[3:49:47.860 --> 3:49:51.700]  archaeologists can't come in and dig it up and prove bombs and now I mean how
[3:49:51.700 --> 3:49:56.540]  suspicious is that and only that I mean Martin Lizzell the the main guy they go
[3:49:56.540 --> 3:50:00.900]  to was on 9 12 official version advocate straight up he's like well the
[3:50:00.900 --> 3:50:04.180]  energy is stored in the building to make it collapse upon itself that's
[3:50:04.180 --> 3:50:08.480]  literally what he says all you need is a mechanism to release that energy but we
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:11.700]  all know that the path of greatest resistance is the center of that
[3:50:11.700 --> 3:50:15.140]  building it had a huge steel core and that's why the media had to lie and say
[3:50:15.140 --> 3:50:18.900]  it was hollow that's right Burma someone to talk behind the scenes people

[3:56:32.780 --> 3:56:36.620]  any real environmentalism they'll just give somebody the scientific name for
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:43.900]  water and 99% of people will say ban it unbelievable it's the same thing with
