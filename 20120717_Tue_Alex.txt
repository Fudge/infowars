[00:20.880 --> 00:30.000]  welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Tuesday July 17th 2012 this is Mike Adams the
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.800]  health ranger sitting in for Alex today on this truly monumental day of news that
[00:36.800 --> 00:44.000]  that just stretches your your your construct of reality it's it's so amazing
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.240]  let me give you a hint of what's coming up here we've got well yesterday at the
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.440]  end of the Alex Jones show we had a caller Chris from Oklahoma who began
[00:51.440 --> 00:58.160]  describing his involvement in military gun confiscation of US citizens in in
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.400]  New Orleans and he talked about the New Orleans Police Department the NOPD
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.280]  involved in some rather heinous crimes including raping of women and other
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.920]  other things that that set off really a firestorm of research here at the
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.800]  Info War Studios in Austin Texas last night Rob do then had on Info Wars
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.080]  Nightly News a video compilation because you see so many people can't believe
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.160]  this is really happening they they they live in denial about the gun
[01:27.160 --> 01:32.200]  confiscation issue and what the military is ordered to do when a crisis occurs in
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.080]  these cities so Rob do and the team put together a video compilation of footage
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.840]  eat some of it from mainstream news media showing US military engaged in gun
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.000]  confiscation and doing it rather violently and and as Chris said during the
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.040]  call without negotiation so we're going to feature that video clip coming up in
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.880]  just a few minutes to show that to you and remove any doubt in your mind that
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.880]  this is the plan when there's a crisis when there's an attack a natural
[02:00.880 --> 02:07.680]  disaster a bomb a dirty bomb a a release of let's say a pandemic bio weapon of
[02:07.680 --> 02:12.120]  some sort this is what's going to happen in the US have no doubt about that but
[02:12.120 --> 02:15.600]  that's just the beginning of the show today we have much more coming up as
[02:15.600 --> 02:22.800]  well including a an exclusive worldwide radio first of Blair Hamrick the
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.480]  whistleblower from Glaxo Smith Klein he and his partner Greg Thorpe well they
[02:28.480 --> 02:32.840]  were colleagues I should say ex-employees of Glaxo Smith Klein they
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.400]  initiated the whistleblowing suit involving the Department of Justice
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.600]  turning over evidence to the US government that eventually resulted in
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.080]  the largest settlement and the largest admission of criminal activity in the
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.680]  history of medicine in the entire history of modern medicine a three billion
[02:50.680 --> 02:55.680]  dollar settlement with the Department of Justice and he is here on the Alex
[02:55.680 --> 03:01.760]  Jones show joins us at 1230 central with an interview and to take some of your
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.920]  questions and the details that he has ready to share with us will blow your
[03:05.920 --> 03:10.320]  mind we're talking about bribery of doctors kickbacks from doctors we're
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.760]  talking about off-label marketing of drugs to children even though they were
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.240]  never tested for children never approved for children all that and much more
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.240]  straight ahead also the FDA has just been caught surveilling the emails of its
[03:22.240 --> 03:29.080]  own employees and scientists this is a mafia type of surveillance criminal
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.520]  thug racket type of operation that the FDA has just been caught doing you know
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.440]  instead of being transparent they now have to be big brother to their own
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.480]  employees because they know their own employees are trying to expose the truth
[03:42.480 --> 03:46.720]  and expose the corruption and expose the criminality to the world just like
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.840]  Dr. David Graham did over the viox issue many years ago and the FDA is now
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.080]  turning to what could be criminal type of activities to suppress and censor and
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.720]  intimidate their own employees that's America today it's not just the government
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.440]  engaged in gun confiscation of private citizens following a natural disaster
[04:07.440 --> 04:13.480]  it's the FDA itself going after its own employees imagine that we've also got
[04:13.480 --> 04:17.920]  information here appalled Joseph Watson article the UN gun grab follows state
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.960]  Department plan plus the breaking news coming out of Washington Times that says
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.880]  the law of the sea treaty that was the UN that small arms treaty was was part of
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.080]  that this says the law of the sea treaty is now dead that's called lost LST is the
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.520]  acronym for that but but we know and you know if you're a regular listener that
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.680]  even if Congress is not approving of something the executive branch of
[04:43.680 --> 04:48.080]  government will bypass Congress and do the UN's bidding anyway so all of that
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.160]  and much more including G. Edward Griffin is a guest at the bottom of this

[08:44.120 --> 08:48.240]  of the sea treaty reports are that it is now dead because the US Senate will not
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.560]  ratify it at this point but if the UN passes it could the executive branch
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.600]  Obama in particular bypass Congress and go ahead and say that guns should be
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.840]  confiscated from all law-abiding Americans I'm talking about legal guns
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.800]  guns that people bought with the FBI background checks with concealed weapons
[09:05.800 --> 09:12.640]  permits with ATF approval form for equipment for example all legal but it

[11:30.760 --> 11:37.640]  Company first at the 279 second platoon during Hurricane Katrina I'm kind of
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.880]  calling in on yesterday's subject I'm sorry about that sorry but it's just
[11:43.880 --> 11:48.080]  I've always wanted to get old you guys and kind of get the word out there for
[11:48.080 --> 11:51.280]  those of you that still have that slight hesitation in the back of their head
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.840]  that gun confiscation can't and won't happen here it already has and I was
[11:56.840 --> 12:02.200]  only 21 years old just really gung-ho really dedicated to the army especially
[12:02.200 --> 12:06.800]  to the infantry and I did whatever I was told and what are they asking to do
[12:06.800 --> 12:13.760]  how I first let's see the first thing we do is we got a three-week a book full
[12:13.760 --> 12:17.560]  of three-week old 9-1-1 phone calls right and then we had to go around and
[12:17.560 --> 12:20.360]  answering all the phone calls so we were like cadaver dogs for about three
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.560]  weeks and in between then we would run night missions and here's the thing a
[12:25.560 --> 12:29.200]  lot of people may think that they'll see this on the news or they'll have time
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.000]  to to get ready when you know when the when the crap hits the fan or whatever
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.960]  it's just it's a truck you know what I mean it's a group of trucks they pull up
[12:36.960 --> 12:42.120]  they stack right on your home as we did and we broke entry yeah we would yell
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.880]  out Oklahoma Army National Guard is anybody in need of assistance but that's
[12:45.880 --> 12:49.440]  as we were booting in the door oh wait a minute it sounds like you weren't part

[13:42.080 --> 13:47.680]  protect their mansions residents were handcuffed on the ground in the end
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.480]  police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes they were a little
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.000]  bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons Chris Montgomery
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.640]  says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.440]  walking up and down these streets you don't you don't want to think about

[14:20.920 --> 14:25.440]  describing how you and your your team were kicking indoors and confiscating

[14:43.560 --> 14:47.760]  Greyhound bus station which was the police station at the time we well I
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.960]  was saying like before we came up for the break like I think it was like the
[14:52.960 --> 14:56.920]  second day we were there this redhead lady came up to our platoons area and
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.680]  she sat her to our company area she sat on the curb with her knees in her chest
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.600]  just rocking back and forth crying uncontrollably she sat there for almost
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.120]  27 hours refused to move we you know we talked to her we did everything we could

[15:59.080 --> 16:04.260]  guardian and guardian and everybody was and but how it was it was just a free
[16:04.260 --> 16:08.160]  for all every police from all over the country Dallas Dallas County Dallas
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.280]  Texas Harris down there how did you and your team justify to yourselves and
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.080]  each other that gun confiscation would help this situation when it was a free
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.360]  for all I mean isn't that the time when citizens need to be able to defend
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.320]  themselves it never you know like I said I was just ignorant as hell and that's
[16:24.320 --> 16:27.280]  kind of something that I worry about with it with the kids today you know if
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.040]  they really realize what they're doing you know I had no idea the only time it
[16:31.040 --> 16:35.200]  ever occurred to me that something may be wrong is we came up we were down by
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.440]  the old French district we came up to this man's house he had a big wooden
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.120]  sign it says I'm here alone with my dog and my shotgun looters beware we thought
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.600]  you know it's funny everyone stopped took pictures of the sign but eventually we
[16:48.600 --> 16:54.080]  took his guns we left him there with nothing I you know so now that you know
[16:54.080 --> 16:57.120]  what you know now that you're you're you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.000]  and you're you're informed what would you advise people to do if this happens
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.200]  again well I called I mean no no offense I mean Michael will love everything you
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.360]  do I'm big fan of the health venture by I was hoping to get a hold of Alex for
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.640]  the fact that what do you do when they stack right you know what I mean yeah
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.160]  and they're prep to come into the home there's no there's no negotiating with
[17:22.160 --> 17:26.280]  us trust me there was no negotiating yeah if you resisted you died for the
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.800]  orders you go for gunner you die yeah but but well I mean this this isn't
[17:31.800 --> 17:35.360]  valuable information I'm I apologize we only have a limited limited time here I
[17:35.360 --> 17:39.720]  gotta let you go just we've got so much more coming up here but fascinating I

[17:49.400 --> 17:54.840]  information and it's I just hope that the military that you know that the
[17:54.840 --> 17:59.320]  members of the military say no they refused to engage in gun confiscation
[17:59.320 --> 18:02.800]  because no doubt there there could be outbreaks of violence and a lot of
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.440]  needless death and bloodshed if that happens but thank you for your call
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.960]  Chris that's that's very concerning it was traumatic all of a sudden they
[18:11.960 --> 18:17.400]  were banging in the front door the side door and the back door and they said
[18:17.400 --> 18:23.080]  let us in I'm saying look at all my food I got plenty of food they kept pushing
[18:23.080 --> 18:30.160]  me back pushing me back and ended up like this then Patty show them a small
[18:30.160 --> 18:35.080]  revolver she was carefully holding in the palm of her hand a camera crew was
[18:35.080 --> 18:43.600]  there to capture what unfolded next I said it's not even loaded and I
[18:43.600 --> 18:51.520]  dropped it on the floor well they punched me in the face look at my black
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.680]  and blue marks looking you say guns guns will be taken no okay wow there you go
[18:56.680 --> 19:01.680]  the footage a compilation from Info Wars Nightly News put together from

[19:15.880 --> 19:20.960]  I am just emotionally hit by all this as well when you see this going on that
[19:20.960 --> 19:26.000]  that woman that they just showed just had a you know a revolver to protect
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.360]  herself from looters or home invasion and they punch her in the face they
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.560]  throw her against the wall and take her gun and leave her there defenseless in a
[19:34.560 --> 19:39.640]  situation where the looters are running rampant this is America I mean it is that
[19:39.640 --> 19:43.840]  this is Chicago this is New York this is everywhere that the citizens are being
[19:43.840 --> 19:48.520]  left defenseless and the murder rate is soaring even without a natural disaster
[19:48.520 --> 19:53.680]  even without some kind of a false flag attack going on imagine what's going to

[24:31.560 --> 24:35.600]  by point this is a strategy it's it's called freedom from war and it goes
[24:35.600 --> 24:41.480]  back to September of 1961 and it is upon this document that the current
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.880]  discussions of the United Nations and its treaty for small arms disarmament
[24:45.880 --> 24:50.080]  registration confiscation and so on is based so this has been an agenda going
[24:50.080 --> 24:56.040]  on for a very long time the truth is look no matter what you think about your
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.800]  neighbor owning a firearm or you owning one the point is the United States
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.560]  Second Amendment is unique in all the world just like the Bill of Rights as a
[25:04.560 --> 25:11.040]  sacred almost a divinely inspired document is unique in the world and they
[25:11.040 --> 25:15.760]  want to destroy it the globalist want to destroy the Bill of Rights and Obama's
[25:15.760 --> 25:21.240]  doing a good job for them really really obedient puppet to get that job done and
[25:21.240 --> 25:23.800]  of course there are other puppets standing in line to do it for them but
[25:23.800 --> 25:28.440]  they're trying to destroy every right every freedom every liberty that we
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.720]  have in America today now we opened up the phone lines for callers who were
[25:33.720 --> 25:39.440]  engaged in the military or even National Guard would also qualify to who
[25:39.440 --> 25:42.600]  were engaged in gun confiscation and we want to invite them to call in the
[25:42.600 --> 25:47.400]  number is 800-259-9231 we also want to give a shout out to Chris from Oklahoma

[25:51.280 --> 25:55.520]  took place there and just a quick heads up G. Edward Griffin is joining us very
[25:55.520 --> 25:59.080]  soon in a few minutes gonna ask him questions about gun confiscation and
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.760]  then we've got a big whistleblower who was inside GlaxoSmithKline who's
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.480]  joining us at the bottom of the next hour about an hour from now with
[26:07.480 --> 26:12.920]  incredible details about bribery of physicians off-label marketing violations
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.320]  of law fraud you name it it's a it's a big breaking story right here on the
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.760]  Alex Jones show now I want to go to a caller right now because of the video
[26:21.760 --> 26:26.360]  we just played that last segment we've got Charles in Louisiana joining us
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.400]  you're on the air Charles go ahead welcome to the show yes I was reporting
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.360]  every day I was from New Orleans to Alex on a show yes I was down there but let
[26:36.360 --> 26:39.640]  me explain something to you when they would take the guns away from the
[26:39.640 --> 26:43.080]  people people they wouldn't go back to the night ward because they would fight
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.400]  and they were running police out then they would come at night and rape the
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.920]  women and knowing that they didn't have guns right you understand what I mean I
[26:50.920 --> 26:57.120]  know exactly and the police they were busy they were busy Robin it does the
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.960]  jewelry stores that's right the police was doing that I've seen this and people
[27:02.960 --> 27:07.600]  and a man was nothing and all these men talk all the spare stuff they were
[27:07.600 --> 27:11.360]  shaking when they come there but the main thing is that they took them guns
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.760]  they made themselves victims for the thugs that come up there they were just
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.880]  coming to a house and take what they wanted take food jewelry and I'm gonna
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.560]  tell you something I don't know where the men had but given these guns up it's
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.520]  gonna be a good most awful thing you ever had this is the important point
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.320]  Charles is that if you sorry to interrupt you but if you give up your guns now
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.360]  you can expect to be that that's gonna be followed up by a police department or
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.840]  or other people and by the way I don't want to say I mean not all cops are bad
[27:42.840 --> 27:46.320]  I know a lot of law enforcement mostly they're good people they and they
[27:46.320 --> 27:49.560]  wouldn't engage in this kind of behavior but in New Orleans now we're
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.960]  hearing it from so many places again and again they went back and they raped
[27:52.960 --> 27:55.880]  those women and they broke into the houses and they stole the jewelry like
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.360]  you were just saying it happened and it's time to get out of denial and realize
[27:59.360 --> 28:02.360]  what happens when you give up your second amendment in this country go ahead
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.160]  Charles
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.240]  innocent people on the bridge just trying to cross the bridge I reported that to
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.760]  Alex sir as that happened they just started down like dogs sir we were there
[28:13.760 --> 28:20.840]  yeah I recognize your voice I remember you calling in and that woman and our
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.960]  channel they broke her jaw about beat up she just come with a Bible and a
[28:24.960 --> 28:30.920]  revolver and I tell you the thing is the military I have no respect after the
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.520]  military what they did to women show me your breath for some water so show me
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.240]  you're not thirsty and the police it was so bad but they're gonna take off the
[28:40.240 --> 28:43.720]  military they're gonna take the guns away from them and the police too and I
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.000]  told them that they're gonna take your guns away and then you get now what
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.800]  they're gonna do when they take their guns away they're gonna want to be friends
[28:50.800 --> 28:57.160]  and now also remember then none of those police were ever brought up on
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.920]  charges who engaged in that they got away with it because the people were
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.680]  disarmed they couldn't fight back it was a chaotic type of situation I mean
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.240]  isn't that the time when citizens and neighborhoods and communities need to
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.880]  have a common lawful defense against looters against lawlessness against
[29:15.880 --> 29:19.120]  violent criminals that's the time when you need to band together with your
[29:19.120 --> 29:23.800]  neighbors in a common defense with legal and lawful firearms that's the point of
[29:23.800 --> 29:30.280]  having those tools of protection and defense yeah this is this is this is
[29:30.280 --> 29:33.600]  really okay we've got more callers on the line a lot more straight ahead but
[29:33.600 --> 29:38.480]  thank you Charles for calling in and it's stay with us we'll be right back

[33:17.240 --> 33:26.360]  all right let me lay it out for you here the big issues of the day we're
[33:26.360 --> 33:30.280]  talking about the gun confiscation that really took place that it's already
[33:30.280 --> 33:33.840]  part of American history took place in New Orleans on the record we just showed
[33:33.840 --> 33:37.440]  you the video clips I mean that some of those were mainstream media video clips
[33:37.440 --> 33:41.640]  we've got people witnesses firsthand you just heard a caller Charles who called
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.120]  in who has actually called in many times in the past telling us firsthand
[33:45.120 --> 33:49.680]  what he witnessed taking place the most heinous crimes the big picture here and
[33:49.680 --> 33:51.880]  by the way we've got jean we're Griffin on the line we're going to be joining him
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.480]  just him in just a second we've also got callers on the line we're going to get
[33:55.480 --> 33:59.160]  to you so please stay on the line James in Tennessee with law enforcement Joe
[33:59.160 --> 34:03.560]  from Georgia and tango from Georgia also so please stay on the line we'll get to
[34:03.560 --> 34:09.240]  you the big picture here is look I know that Alex and myself both would rather
[34:09.240 --> 34:15.760]  be here talking about the you know the the spiritual connection with the
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.160]  great the creative forces of the universe the creativity and the beauty of
[34:20.160 --> 34:26.840]  the world and human achievement and and you know actually positive outcomes for
[34:26.840 --> 34:32.640]  the future of humanity we would rather focus on that but the truth is when
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.560]  you've got gun confiscation taking place when you've got an oppressive a world
[34:37.560 --> 34:42.200]  government that's trying to take away your liberties then you have to pay
[34:42.200 --> 34:46.720]  attention to that because you are not going to to solve that problem by sitting
[34:46.720 --> 34:51.640]  in a room let's say and just meditating you know the gun confiscation the the
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.320]  the Federal Reserve the printing of currency the stealing of your economic
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.360]  prosperity the taking away of your rights these things are real and even
[35:00.360 --> 35:03.160]  though we don't want to dwell on them because we don't want to stay in that in
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.440]  that area we do have to beat them we have to achieve victory as info warriors
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.960]  as defenders of liberty and life and love and truth and all that is good in
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.520]  the world and even in the universe I mean we have to defeat tyranny if we hope
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.600]  to move on and actually achieve something great as a human civilization and
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.240]  that's why we do this I don't want to dwell in the negative but we have to be
[35:27.240 --> 35:31.520]  realistic about what's out there and this is going on you know Obamacare is
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.000]  forcing you to do business with monopolized criminal pharmaceutical
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.640]  organizations it's in your face the gun confiscation is really happening the
[35:39.640 --> 35:44.360]  NOPD really did go out there and rape women after taking the guns away from
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.520]  the family so they were defenseless so it's it's real we can't live in denial
[35:47.520 --> 35:51.880]  if we hope to achieve greatness we have to beat the tyrants we have to restore
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.880]  liberty and that's the only way that we can actually achieve greatness as human
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.160]  civilization and protect the future for our own children and grandchildren as
[35:59.160 --> 36:04.280]  well now with more comments on that big picture view is of course Ed Griffin he
[36:04.280 --> 36:09.320]  is really one of the pioneers of the Liberty movement realityzone.com is
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.920]  one of his websites he joins us now by phone with his comments on what's
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.360]  happening in the world today Ed thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.040]  show what's on your mind today well thanks a lot Mike for inviting me what's on
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.760]  my mind well I feel rather schizophrenic this morning everything at once is all
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.200]  in my mind somewhat like you I appreciate your comments that we would
[36:33.200 --> 36:38.280]  rather focus on the more pleasant aspects of life but the reality is in your
[36:38.280 --> 36:42.880]  face that you said good good analogy while you were saying that it reminded me
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.680]  of the the fellow that was in on death row in prison and he was sentenced to be
[36:48.680 --> 36:54.560]  electrocuted in the morning or hung let's just say hung and he wasn't very
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.640]  happy about the idea he was in his cell he was dejected this was the end of his
[36:58.640 --> 37:04.600]  life and everything and the guy in the cell across the way that the what's the
[37:04.600 --> 37:08.000]  matter why you're looking so dejected and he said well I'm good I'm gonna die
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.560]  here in a few hours they're gonna they're gonna hang me and so the other
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.240]  fellow said well look at the bright side you still have your health my little
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.400]  gallows humor there yeah that's kind of how I feel because sometimes people say
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.440]  oh you're so negative you're always talking about these bad things why don't
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.840]  you look at the bright side you know I'm so I'm so tired of hearing that from
[37:28.840 --> 37:32.560]  people it's it's like what if your neighbor's house is burning down you
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.360]  shouldn't tell them you shouldn't call 911 just let it burn down don't don't be
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.800]  negative don't tell the truth about something bad happening exactly it's
[37:39.800 --> 37:44.000]  ridiculous I call it the Jiminy Cricket mentality you know the song if you
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.240]  wish upon a star no matter where you are it'll all come true if you just wish
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.320]  wish wish and we kind of teach that to kids that if you're good and that you're
[37:53.320 --> 37:58.520]  pure and your intentions are correct and you know everything will work out just
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.080]  fine because you're good well the fact of the matter is we live in a world where
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.400]  there are a lot of people who are not so good and as a matter of fact the the
[38:06.400 --> 38:10.440]  criminal mentality tends to gravitate into positions of power because that
[38:10.440 --> 38:14.520]  means that they know government power in particular because they figured it out
[38:14.520 --> 38:17.200]  a long time ago why should you fight the government when you can be the
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.760]  government absolutely what and what are you seeing in terms of the trending of
[38:21.760 --> 38:25.400]  criminality because one of the well one of the trends that's becoming very
[38:25.400 --> 38:29.880]  obvious to info warriors and all of us who fight for liberty is that in the
[38:29.880 --> 38:35.600]  last even just five years there seems to be a an acceleration of just the
[38:35.600 --> 38:39.280]  outright criminality thuggishness of government not just federal but I mean
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.440]  at local levels to look at California look at Chicago well I guess Chicago's
[38:44.440 --> 38:47.680]  always been steeped in corruption and criminality but is it really getting
[38:47.680 --> 38:51.400]  worse in your opinion well yes it is because I think there's almost a
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.200]  mathematical relationship here this is a social event happening but I think
[38:56.200 --> 39:00.520]  there's a lot of mathematics in it in the sense that the reason that all
[39:00.520 --> 39:06.320]  governments eventually evolve into criminal syndicates is because we give
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.440]  them power and power is a magnet power is a magnet that attracts the the
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.920]  criminal mentality the predator class and so the more power we give to
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.680]  government the more inevitable it becomes that that magnet gets stronger and
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.480]  attracts more and more of the predator class and finally we we just have
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.760]  basically a government that we thought was of the people gradually evolved into
[39:29.760 --> 39:35.000]  a criminal syndicate so yes there's a mathematical relationship the more power
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.960]  we give to government the more we create a criminal environment well yeah look at
[39:40.960 --> 39:45.000]  the UN where you have total diplomatic immunity so anywhere that you have total
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.680]  immunity you get complete and utter corruption of course runaway
[39:48.680 --> 39:52.640]  criminality yeah that's it so it was once people connect the dots and realize
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.560]  that there's a cause for this criminality it's not just because oh it
[39:57.560 --> 40:02.440]  happened that way there's a cause it's that relationship between the power that
[40:02.440 --> 40:07.920]  we tolerate government having in fact we often become when I say we I mean the
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.440]  people in general not you and me of course but in general the population
[40:12.440 --> 40:15.880]  has been conditioned to think that no matter what problems we have in society
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.320]  the solution is to give more power to the government and so we create this
[40:20.320 --> 40:24.600]  environment we are creating ourselves creating this this magnet toward the
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.000]  criminal class well what do you think about the gun confiscation issue I
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  don't know if you heard the last segment but it's rising up again because of
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.120]  this UN treaty being negotiated that would potentially I mean this was
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.400]  written up right right in Forbes magazine in fact which typically doesn't
[40:41.400 --> 40:44.720]  doesn't reveal this much information about what's really going on but it
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.560]  could potentially result in gun registration confiscation of legal
[40:48.560 --> 40:53.360]  firearms basically a total disarmament of the US population of course they
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.080]  deny that that's what the treaty would do but if you read between the lines
[40:56.080 --> 40:59.400]  that's what that's what it actually could do what are your thoughts on that
[40:59.400 --> 41:03.320]  issue Ed Griffin well that pretty well summarizes that they do deny it they
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.280]  always deny the negative consequences of their programs they like to talk about
[41:08.280 --> 41:15.040]  their other measures in glowing terms I mean this is this they don't call it gun
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.640]  confiscation or gun control you know they call it a disarmament reducing crime
[41:20.640 --> 41:26.120]  and they like what things like you know crime reduction program well of course
[41:26.120 --> 41:29.640]  but but of course the greatest armed criminals I should say the the most
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.240]  severe the worst armed criminals are the government themselves just look at
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.120]  history look at democide figures of death by government so what I think what
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.120]  the mainstream people are missing is that it's not gun disarmament it is a
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.960]  movement of all firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens into the
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.120]  hands of the most centralized corrupt power-hungry groups of all which is
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.480]  government that's the thing that that's the message that doesn't get through to
[41:55.480 --> 42:00.160]  people for some reason yeah because the the media and the confiscators are
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.760]  always talking about criminals they're always talking about taking guns away
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.000]  from criminals and you know reducing accidental deaths and injuries that's
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.360]  the total focus that's the limits of the debate no one's allowed to discuss the
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.360]  real purpose of the second amendment the second amendment was not added to the
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.480]  Constitution by our forefathers to protect the citizens against crime it
[42:22.480 --> 42:26.200]  was added there for one purpose that's to protect him from totalitarian
[42:26.200 --> 42:29.960]  government yes yes their own government they were they were leery that their own
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.120]  government might someday it become tyrannical and so therefore they said
[42:34.120 --> 42:38.160]  the people must be armed so that the people will have the ultimate control
[42:38.160 --> 42:43.040]  over their own government well who talks about that today well maybe we should
[42:43.040 --> 42:49.240]  support disarmament of the government but you know hey I'd be I feel a lot
[42:49.240 --> 42:52.880]  safer with firearms in the hands of sheriffs and sheriff's deputies all
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.480]  across the country and not in the hands of let's say some renegade ATF ages not
[42:57.480 --> 43:02.000]  that they're all bad but there are a lot of renegade ATF agents out there but how
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.760]  about this are you willing to take a call from a police officer who's on the
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.880]  line why sure all right let's go to James in Tennessee law enforcement James
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.520]  you're on the air here with Mike Adams and Ed Griffin go ahead sir yes sir how
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.920]  are y'all doing today doing good what's on your mind well you may say we know
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.200]  you're about the police officers not being bad and I think that's pretty much
[43:21.200 --> 43:25.760]  common knowledge there shouldn't be any way that you know that I haven't been in
[43:25.760 --> 43:29.480]  for a while I'm not as old as some of the guys that I work with but most of your
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.200]  younger guys are the ones that are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.480]  they've come in with police forces and sheriff's departments you know they have
[43:36.480 --> 43:42.440]  programmed these guys and not all of them but I'm running to a few and you
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.240]  you know I was thinking some people just can't be reached they effectively
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.560]  walled them off and that will be one biggest threat that I see so what are
[43:51.560 --> 43:57.200]  you saying that they come back with a mindset of just do anything and kill
[43:57.200 --> 44:00.680]  and it's like they can't think for themselves or what exactly how does
[44:00.680 --> 44:06.120]  that look to you when you see these guys well you know it's really weird because
[44:06.120 --> 44:10.840]  you know being raised in a law enforcement flesh military family tell
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.240]  speaker over the years you see these guys and you think you know when I went in
[44:15.240 --> 44:21.480]  when I got into the business it was God family country or God country
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.120]  family and that kind of thing you want to do by your fellow citizens and your
[44:26.120 --> 44:30.720]  brothers and sisters and that seems to be missing it seems to be the element
[44:30.720 --> 44:34.800]  that's missing is just a compassion you know they've been desensitized I guess
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.240]  you might say to killing yeah and not they're all around saying that but you
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.360]  can pick up on those little nuances and when you get into certain situations you
[44:44.360 --> 44:49.000]  know let me be a little quicker to shoot and you know use this use the 40
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.320]  caliber hipster the taser or something of that nature I'll see in different
[44:53.320 --> 44:58.760]  places not just where I'm at this point okay good good good points James thank
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.140]  you for your call add your comments on on that caller well yes that's been my
[45:02.140 --> 45:07.240]  observation to of course I was in the military I fortunately I was never
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.240]  called upon to go into actual combat but I was kind of braced for it and I can
[45:13.240 --> 45:19.680]  recall at the time that I had actually gone through basic training to condition
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.360]  my mind to follow orders not to question anything of course that's
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.000]  necessary in any military I realized that but I was prepared that if somebody
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.280]  said see that group over there that's the enemy go kill them I was prepared to
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.640]  say well my officers said that's the enemy and my orders are to go kill the
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.680]  enemy that's the patriotic thing to do is I'm fighting for my country and my
[45:41.680 --> 45:45.600]  family and everything that was that I was prepared to actually do that of course
[45:45.600 --> 45:50.040]  I didn't I didn't know nothing as they say at the time of what really was going
[45:50.040 --> 45:54.080]  on in the world I was there because I was you know I love my country and that
[45:54.080 --> 45:59.440]  was the patriotic thing to do and but now in retrospect that I'm a lot older
[45:59.440 --> 46:04.000]  and I've seen that there are hidden agendas quite often behind wars and
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.640]  even hidden agendas behind local police actions or sometimes hidden agendas down
[46:09.640 --> 46:13.320]  at the local police at sheriff level too well and let me let me ask you this
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.320]  question what about the pharmaceutical influence on these young minds because
[46:17.320 --> 46:21.280]  this is the first generation of soldiers that is actually deployed with
[46:21.280 --> 46:27.120]  mandatory mind-altering drugs we're and I know you're you're well versed on big
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.760]  pharma and the cancer cover-ups the cancer industry corruption things like
[46:31.760 --> 46:37.240]  that do you think that their minds are being rewired literally with the
[46:37.240 --> 46:40.680]  chemicals that are now being given on deployment well I don't think there's
[46:40.680 --> 46:45.560]  any question about that I think it's just an extension of the mind conditioning
[46:45.560 --> 46:51.720]  that was done through training in the old days it was just done through exposure
[46:51.720 --> 46:57.040]  training repetition and mental programs educational program whatever you want to
[46:57.040 --> 47:01.320]  call them but now they've added the the element of drugs themselves and that
[47:01.320 --> 47:07.000]  gosh I just it's a frightening thing because I know that all of most of
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.440]  these shootings that we find in schools they're done by kids that have been
[47:12.440 --> 47:19.240]  given these like the SSRIs and yeah they're all they're all supposedly
[47:19.240 --> 47:23.920]  attention deficit disorder kids or something like that and this just blows
[47:23.920 --> 47:28.320]  their minds it pushes them over the edge into either suicidal or homicidal
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.320]  well it's not unusual today for a soldier to be on six different pharmaceuticals
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.280]  during active duty and you know you notice sometimes when they go crazy and
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.120]  they kill a bunch of civilians out there in a local village those those people
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.200]  are almost always on psychotropic drugs and usually sometimes half a dozen like
[47:45.200 --> 47:48.600]  a chemical cocktail but you got to think maybe they come back and they are so
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.960]  detached that they they can't even they can't even see what they're doing to
[47:53.960 --> 47:56.960]  their own brothers and sisters their own neighbors in their own country anymore
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.600]  right it's yeah that their mind is there incapable of coming to you know
[48:01.600 --> 48:04.760]  judgment independent judgment and I they've been trained to do that they've
[48:04.760 --> 48:09.360]  been conditioned to do that and I really I fear those people but I also feel
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.480]  sorry for them sure nevertheless you know if that if they're ordered to come
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.280]  over and pick you and me up and throw us in the truck and take it out wherever we
[48:18.280 --> 48:21.600]  have to go and eliminate it that's what they would do they would absolutely do
[48:21.600 --> 48:24.480]  that let's go to another caller who's on the line and I'll ask for your comments
[48:24.480 --> 48:31.600]  and tango from Georgia US Army is the designation I'm getting here tango go
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.360]  ahead please run you're on the show what's on your mind well thanks for
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.760]  taking my call first of all one thing I did want to touch on real quick it's
[48:40.760 --> 48:47.200]  sort of on subject when you join any military service in this country you
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.760]  take an oath and it's an oath that I think these kids nowadays need to
[48:50.760 --> 48:54.520]  remember you take an oath to protect the people of the United States and the
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.040]  Constitution United States against all enemies foreign and domestic and that's
[48:58.040 --> 49:03.280]  something that I take very seriously when I was you know first then they
[49:03.280 --> 49:08.560]  really didn't hit me as hard as it did when I was out I battled with depression
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.680]  for about a year once I got out from the withdrawal from the drugs you all were
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.840]  just talking about I was suicidal for a long time but I'm over that now and I'm
[49:16.840 --> 49:22.800]  trying to get the word out there I also worked for a security company just
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.080]  recently and this is a touch on another subject about the TSA outsourcing to
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.060]  private security companies that just happened to the company that I worked
[49:32.060 --> 49:36.760]  for I just quit yesterday I told my boss outright that it was against my moral
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.160]  compass to do such a thing wow you're you're rare then because most people
[49:40.160 --> 49:45.560]  just go along with the tyranny absolutely not no I've been I'm over it
[49:45.560 --> 49:51.400]  man I'm ready to take up arms to be honest with you and I hope there are a
[49:51.400 --> 49:54.560]  lot of other ex soldiers out there just like me who are ready to do the same and
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.000]  fight for this country and for the ideals that the founding fathers tried to
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.980]  instill but I mean I've also been witness I mean I was stationed up for
[50:03.980 --> 50:06.800]  bending I've been witness to these drills that you are talking about the
[50:06.800 --> 50:14.000]  weapons confiscation drills I've been witness to the land seizure drills where
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.560]  the the terrorists the so-called terrorists quote-unquote are men dressed

[50:29.160 --> 50:34.120]  but I know it goes on and yeah so the impact is on the young on the young
[50:34.120 --> 50:39.120]  soldier that's being recruited and he's being told that he's serving his country
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.000]  by learning how to do these things he's impressed by that he gets a paycheck and

[54:12.640 --> 54:16.960]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today thanks for continuing
[54:16.960 --> 54:21.720]  with us we've got G Edward Griffin on the line from reality zone dot com one of
[54:21.720 --> 54:26.520]  the top freedom fighters and Liberty advocates in our world today we've been
[54:26.520 --> 54:31.240]  we've had callers who are active duty law enforcement and military given us
[54:31.240 --> 54:35.760]  information about gun confiscation we've got other callers on the line but I
[54:35.760 --> 54:41.720]  want to ask Ed this question there's a there's an event coming up April let's
[54:41.720 --> 54:47.640]  see I'm sorry August 18 it's called lemonade freedom day 2012 this is
[54:47.640 --> 54:52.080]  brand new I don't think anyone's covered this yet website is lemonade freedom
[54:52.080 --> 54:58.280]  dot com and this is an attempt to show that selling lemonade from your lemonade
[54:58.280 --> 55:02.560]  stand should not be a crime as it is being increasingly considered by law
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.520]  enforcement all across the country Ed Griffin your thoughts on lemonade freedom
[55:06.520 --> 55:11.080]  well I like the idea I like the the fact that there's enough indignation out
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.040]  there at the grassroots level for people to even consider that but you know I
[55:15.040 --> 55:19.520]  have to say that putting yourself out there and saying come arrest me for
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.840]  selling lemonade as much as I admire that I would like to think that people
[55:23.840 --> 55:31.960]  will put in an equal amount of effort and time and money to try and reelect
[55:31.960 --> 55:38.040]  those stupid local politicians that pass at ordinances like that and get to the
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.280]  root of the problem which is it's not that the police are being told to go
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.000]  and force stupid ordinances but it's because stupid ordinances have been
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.160]  passed in the first place by collectivists who don't understand what
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.680]  America is all about so I always try to go to the source of the problem not the
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.000]  problem itself and the source of the problem is that we're electing the wrong
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.800]  people I agree with you completely agree I'm trying to understand what is the
[56:00.800 --> 56:06.080]  mindset of those who think gun confiscation from citizens is a great
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.720]  idea because let's face it there's there's a significant percentage of the
[56:09.720 --> 56:13.400]  country that somehow believes that what do they imagine that when all the people
[56:13.400 --> 56:16.800]  are disarmed and only the government has all the guns that they're going to be
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.920]  safer is they actually do I have some personal friends that I just think the
[56:22.920 --> 56:27.680]  world of them they're very nice people but that's their attitude they think
[56:27.680 --> 56:31.760]  every time something happens there's an accident a little child gets killed by a
[56:31.760 --> 56:37.520]  gun accidentally or some shooter goes into a school and kills a bunch of kids
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.160]  they focus on that and say look you see the problem there was guns if those
[56:43.160 --> 56:47.840]  people didn't have guns they think but none of these crimes would take place
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.920]  and they might be they might be right that some crimes might not be committed
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.040]  if there were no guns out there but there would be more crimes committed if
[56:57.040 --> 57:00.040]  there were no guns out there I have a little slogan I bought used for years
[57:00.040 --> 57:04.760]  that you know guns are dangerous people get killed with guns you know guns they
[57:04.760 --> 57:08.400]  are accidents with guns guns are very dangerous the only thing more dangerous
[57:08.400 --> 57:14.000]  than having guns is not having well and also I love how the how people who who
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.160]  think we should all be disarmed when they have a problem when they have an
[57:17.160 --> 57:20.560]  intruder hiding in the bushes outside their house what do they do they pick up
[57:20.560 --> 57:26.000]  the phone to call men with guns to come solve their problem you know I just say
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.720]  take out the middle man let's do it ourselves we're here in Texas we can
[57:29.720 --> 57:33.800]  defend our own homes against crazy people and looters I mean that's that's an
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.200]  American right yeah well if they like to paint people like you and me it's some
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.920]  kind of wild killers under the yahoos it hardly wait to kill somebody you know
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.520]  right yeah well I fired a lot of guns when I was in the military a little
[57:48.520 --> 57:53.360]  bit little practice since I came out and and they kind of jar me a little bit
[57:53.360 --> 57:57.680]  but I I think they're very important for every family they have you know just to
[57:57.680 --> 58:03.880]  the great equalizer as they say well yeah this is what gives 110 pound grandma the
[58:03.880 --> 58:07.960]  ability to stand her ground against a 250 pound thug who wants to steal her
[58:07.960 --> 58:12.080]  purse that's right it is the great equalizer well Ed Griffin I really

[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:45.480]  in the next segment but first check this out the IRS has no legal basis to
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.880]  collect the Affordable Care Act tax Obamacare in other words it's all an
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.440]  act this is this is the headline that we've got this is up on info wars.com
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:02.760]  it's a natural news.com story by Ethan Huff and the the thrust of it is that
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.840]  even though the IRS is now put in charge of collecting this penalty well now
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.080]  they call it a penalty but of course it's a tax right the IRS has no legal
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.360]  ability to collect this penalty and in fact all they can do is send you
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.760]  threatening letters and try to intimidate you into voluntarily paying it how's
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.600]  that for interesting I guess some people would argue that the entire income tax is
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.520]  voluntary but that's probably a whole different show in any case the only way
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.480]  that the IRS can actually get this money from you legally under current law and
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.120]  regulations is to take it out of your withholdings in other words to not send
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:48.280]  it back to you so this is another great reason to not have the IRS take as much
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.920]  money out of your paycheck every month and then send you back a refund at the
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.880]  end of the year because that's how they can then have leverage over you for the
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.400]  Obamacare penalty now I'm on the record saying that I I refuse to participate
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.640]  in this I refuse to buy health care in the corrupt mafia medical system I
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:13.440]  refuse to pay the IRS this penalty but I guess they're just gonna probably take
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.240]  it out of my withholdings and there's nothing that I can do about it that's
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.520]  the reality that we're facing in America but I will not voluntarily
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:28.400]  participate in this corrupt criminal medical system that's bottom line if they
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.440]  take it out of out of my filings because I do file taxes that's a battle that I
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.480]  don't wish to deal with right now you know I'm not a tax protester person so I
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.720]  do pay taxes if they take it out then I guess I just have to write it off as
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.120]  another loss to the corrupt police state for a service that I will never use
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.840]  because I don't go visit doctors I mean I'm in perfect health here's you know
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.720]  here's my here's my medicine right here you this you see this I'm famous for

[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.320]  healthy and state healthy it's nutrition it wasn't doctors it wasn't Obama's
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.040]  healthcare system it wasn't vaccines I haven't been vaccinated and well over
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.560]  20 years maybe now I don't know the exact number and I wish I was never

[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.560]  ranger editor of natural news dot com filling in today and of course we're at
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.400]  the info wars dot com studios here in Austin Texas thank you for joining us
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.400]  it's always great to be here and to reach out to you with all this incredible
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.840]  information I always love info wars callers too they're so well informed you
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.600]  know if if there's anywhere that I would want to just hang out with really cool
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.880]  people it would be at an info wars event because I know you could just talk to
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.560]  people about reality you know you don't have to deal with delusions you don't
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.120]  have to deal with people who were uninformed it's just talking about
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.480]  reality and and that's sort of what what I left off with there in the last
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:57.680]  segment is this this quote that I I'm fond of saying you know again if if God
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.760]  wanted us to take vaccines he wouldn't have given us an immune system and there's
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.880]  a lot of people find that funny but it's true you know why why do you have an
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:12.160]  immune system because you're supposed to survive you're supposed to have that
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.560]  blueprint for health and vitality and you're supposed to feed it right with
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:22.400]  nutrition with minerals with vitamins and nutrients and real food not with GMOs
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.360]  and vaccines and chemicals and and hormones and antibiotics and all those
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.200]  things I don't mean to segue into health too much because we've got so much
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.080]  other news here but it is important and by the way I prepared another quote and
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.840]  see we show that on screen for the prison planet TV viewers another quote
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.080]  because I believe in divine truth divine rights here's another quote I put
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.320]  together if our creator did not want us to be free he would not have given us
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.920]  free will now think about that for a minute and think about the Constitution
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.960]  the Bill of Rights the divine inspiration of those documents why is the
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.240]  first amendment a divine right why is the second amendment a divine right
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.480]  you might be asking whoa how can that be a divine right well look around you look
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.640]  around you in nature if you go see a cactus plant for example that cactus
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.680]  plant has its own second amendment rights the right to keep and bear spines and
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.920]  the spines protect the little cactus plant from predators and the spines are
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.640]  our nature's way of saying leave me alone let me just grow here in my own
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.240]  space and mine my own business and that is common throughout nature you see
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:38.400]  defenses in plants and animals and so on it is a divine truth to have the right
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.560]  to defend yourself to protect yourself your family your children your
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.920]  community your neighborhood that is a divine right it is granted to us by our
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.120]  creator it is not something that we have to go begging the king to give us
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.200]  because he feels like we should have it for that day or that week or that year
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.920]  it is a divine right and it cannot be taken away from us and free speech is
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.360]  the same way it's a divine right to have that freedom of expression you see
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.120]  that again reflected throughout nature in in plants and animals and in just
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.160]  patterns of nature throughout the cosmos freedom of expression is is really a
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.680]  reflection of the intent of God and the Creator I'm not going to get preachy on
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.560]  you here I just want to share that you know this there is a divine element
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.360]  behind everything that we do here when we talk about freedom of speech when we
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.480]  talk about the right to defend yourself against aggressors and against violent
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.520]  criminals those are divine rights and we will not give them up not under any
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.520]  circumstances if you're an info warrior out there and you enjoy the show
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.920]  remember we do not give up these rights we do not surrender what is divine in
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.480]  our lives oh they're showing some cactus right there on the screen yes some
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:57.240]  succulents on on screen thank you for that for prism planet TV viewers alright
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.840]  I want to go to some more callers right now I've got tons of other news but I
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.320]  actually think the callers are more important than this other news right
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:09.280]  now so so the phones are all wow okay let's go to Chad in Long Island former
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.120]  Army Chad thank you for your call and you're on the show here on the Alex
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.920]  Jones show go ahead sir what's your what's your what's on your mind how you
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.880]  doing mr. Adams I'm doing great it thank you for calling in great to hear your
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.120]  voice great to hear you sir one I just want to say to all the veterans and all
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.880]  the police and all the first responders remember you oh that's number one number
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:37.920]  two how can you vilify a tool that's like a carpenter saying a hammer is bad
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.520]  because he hit his hand a gun is nothing more than a tool if the person
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:48.560]  uses it is evil not the tool itself and that's what we need to remember we need
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.360]  to instill that in our children is that you can't blame tools for all the
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.680]  problems in the world you have to blame individuals that's right we've got to
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.760]  have the ethics we've got to have the morals we have to have that personal
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.840]  responsibility which is again taught in in many religions it's a it's a code of
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.360]  ethics that makes society more peaceful and you're right that that tool can be
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.640]  used to protect life to defend life why why do people think cops carry guns to
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.200]  stop violence I mean that's what that's the way they're trained to stop the
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.160]  violence using the threat of force against someone who doesn't have those
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.400]  those ethics would you agree with that oh yes I definitely would agree with that
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.000]  and I think that also we as citizens need to weed out the people that are in
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  authority that have those guns and use the authority to brutalize and step on
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.080]  the necks of the poor people of this world of course of course we can't
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.880]  tolerate corruption we can't tolerate bad cops absolutely exactly I mean my
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.840]  thing is I personally believe Mr. Adams and this is just my personal belief I
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.960]  think there should be all across this country citizens groups that police the
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.880]  police for the corrupt police that are in these neighborhoods and in these
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.560]  communities because where I live in Long Island it is corruption what you would
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.280]  not believe I mean they have illegal roadblocks all the time meanwhile you
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.360]  got prostitutes down the street you got drug dealers down the street and they
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.640]  do nothing to these people but yeah they want to check people's registration to
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:25.200]  make sure you got your seatbelt on oh I know nanny mr. nanny gardener all the
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.380]  time no think about it like it like in LA County or Ventura County in
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.280]  California they use the sheriff's deputies to go out and raid at gunpoint
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.040]  the raw milk sellers meanwhile the drug dealers and the violent criminals down
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.320]  the street are completely unmolested oftentimes because there's such a
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.200]  shortage of law enforcement great call chat really appreciate your thoughts
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.880]  let's go to Ray in Virginia former army is that correct Ray yes go go ahead
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:57.960]  please what's on what's on your mind okay Mike is it yes yes sir Mike Adams
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:06.760]  okay Mike I want to kind of chastise you for some of the terminology used when
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.720]  you're talking about military and police and all that in the sense that I hear
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:22.280]  pages all time saying that all the cops military are not bad okay yeah I hear you
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:30.880]  go ahead all right I understand something the global corporation is here
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:38.520]  okay and we're simply working for a corporation in any status we have in it
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:46.440]  okay as we live all right and I tell you there ain't no way you can quit your
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.960]  job like if you work for IBM and you didn't like company policy theoretically
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:58.800]  you can quit okay but this global corporation IBM all these other
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.840]  small companies you know whatever they're just subsidiaries of the global
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.320]  corporation what I mean is that I know a lot of law enforcement I know sheriff
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:13.000]  sheriff's deputies for example they have said they will not participate in for
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.560]  example gun confiscation they they have boundaries that are based on their own
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.120]  ethics their own respect for life and liberty I'm not saying you know some of
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.200]  them have those boundaries and some of them don't obviously and I just don't
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.360]  want to paint all law enforcement as bad people because they're absolutely not I
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:33.320]  know a lot of a lot of guys that will defend rights when it comes down to it
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.520]  is so are you saying that if they work for law enforcement they're automatically
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:43.320]  tied into that global system or what exactly are you saying sir okay let me
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:48.440]  deal with the word cop or a place when I was a child they were still called the
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.840]  peace officers yeah all right you're right all right now what would a peace
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.920]  offer what would you expect from a peace officer if if you're saying where
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.240]  situation might get out control where some damage could take place you would
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.280]  expect him to come and restore peace keep the peace that's it all right now what
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.480]  do you think is why did they move this thing over into common police money for
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.280]  they're gonna please you man you know you know you're right about that we
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.320]  should say police officer a peace officer see I did it again we should say
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.240]  peace officer and in fact Alex is is good at this reminding us that they are
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.440]  the servants that they serve the the people so you're you're absolutely right
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.480]  about that point I I really appreciate that peace officer we will keep that in
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.920]  mind appreciate your call let's it could be an interesting conversation but I
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.760]  want to give room to other callers but I will keep that in mind peace officer yes
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.280]  got it Sam in California from the Air Force it says go ahead Sam you're on
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.320]  the air hey Mike can you hear me good yeah you coming through just fine go
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.640]  ahead awesome okay one short a quick comment and then a very short story
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.320]  hopefully fairly short anyway if guns kill people then pencils miss the bell
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.400]  words and we should confiscate all the pencils well pencils can stab people too
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.360]  so I think you're right we should confiscate all pencils especially the
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:11.720]  short ones those are the dangerous ones so in 2007 I re-read George Orwell's
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:17.760]  1984 because I was seeing it was happening that he reminded me of it so I
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.400]  figured I should read it again well it killed me to the bone because of the
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.120]  parallels I saw with what's going on in our society today and then now since
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:35.400]  then I it seems like I can't go through a day without listening to some radio
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:41.520]  show and not hear other people saying the same thing that I saw that we are
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:49.280]  now living in George Orwell's 1984 yes it's not worth it it's chilling to the
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.800]  bone it truly is and four years now I've had a thinking feeling in my like a lot
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.440]  like Alex says that the worst is yet to come well you and me both brother I feel
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:06.280]  the same thing and then you know that we being beings who have compassion for
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.960]  other humans for other our brothers and sisters all across the planet we don't
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.800]  want to see bloodshed we don't want to see suffering we don't want to see loss
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.520]  of freedom that's why we're here man that's why we want to see liberty we
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.560]  want to see peace we want to see achievement by humanity what are your
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.320]  thoughts on that yes we do and when I see what's going on in Syria and they're
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:36.960]  doing that in our name makes me sick it makes me truly sick I cry yeah it makes
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.560]  me sick too I mean war is sick it is a sickness it is a psychosis of power
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.920]  hungry tyrants who run the world governments and I appreciate your call
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.240]  we got to go to break here but you're right war is the desire that to to have
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.680]  power and dominion over others is a kind of mental disorder maybe we should have

[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.680]  you know I was really struck by the linguistic reminder of one of the
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.320]  previous callers he's exactly right we've got to be careful about what
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.600]  language we use because that language goes right into your brain and becomes
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.200]  a kind of truth your brain interprets language and makes it real even when
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.160]  it's not real and this is why we get phrases I wrote down some notes during
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.000]  the break this is why we get phrases oh and by the way for just joining us this
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.200]  is the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today he'll be
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.400]  back tomorrow by the way but one of the phrases we often hear in the mainstream
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.920]  media is of course gun violence this is a linguistic trick it's trying to link
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.120]  guns with the word violence but was there actually gun violence is there
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.680]  such a thing violence has to be an act with an intent and a gun can't have any
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.480]  intent because it has no free will so you don't see for example if there's a
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.000]  machete type of massacre somewhere in some other developing nation you don't
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.680]  hear them come on the air and say well there was these people were victims of
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.360]  machete violence or somebody gets stabbed with a knife you don't hear on
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.680]  the news oh there's knife violence you don't hear that they only use that phrase
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.920]  for guns but they don't report all the people that were protected by them so
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.840]  what about the phrase gun protection so instead of what you know what about
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:35.760]  let's say an elderly person Mrs. Parkinson who's the break-in to her
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.760]  house was prevented by a neighbor with a concealed carry permit and Mrs. Parker
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.400]  was therefore a beneficiary of gun protection you never hear that on the
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.720]  news that's not news they won't report that even though that happens maybe who
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.480]  knows hundreds of times more often than somebody actually becoming a quote
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.120]  victim of being shot by somebody with bad intent so we got to watch these words
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:07.760]  so gun violence is a brain trick that phrase is a trick and gun protection is
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.840]  actually far more common now some other terms of course is a peace officer like
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.760]  the caller mentioned he's right about that instead of law enforcement we
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:23.240]  should refer to them as peace officers and also instead of public officials or
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.600]  authorities we should refer to people in the government as public servants so
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.600]  you got that these are the three phrases that I want to encourage us all to use
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.720]  all of you listening out there we want to be informed and tell the truth using
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.720]  accurate language we have gun protection when when firearms are used in the
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.400]  protection of life and property and that happens very often we want to use the
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.760]  phrase peace officer to refer to cops police law enforcement and so on peace
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.200]  officer and then we want to use the phrase public servants when we're
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.960]  talking about bureaucrats authorities you know enforcers of codes and things
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.600]  like that but of course again on the mainstream media you're going to get the
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.040]  the spin of all this you're going to get you're going to get gun violence you're
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.320]  going to get police officers like they're supposed to police you and then
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.000]  you're going to get a government authorities as if they are the
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.840]  authorities over you and your life it's all an act okay it's all just a facade
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.080]  a linguistic little mind trick that they use to try to convince you that
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.160]  something is real when it isn't the truth is that your rights are granted to
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.840]  you by the creator they are described by the bill of rights they are then
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.400]  selected powers are delegated to a government for the sole purpose of
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.160]  serving the interests and the protection of life and liberty of the people
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.800]  that's the way it works and anybody who tells you otherwise is psychotic insane
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:56.040]  crazy evil deceptive trying to trick you trying to take your power trying to
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.520]  take your money anybody who says the government is the powerful entity and
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:04.160]  then they grant you the people rights that person is a dangerous person it
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  doesn't belong in America period they should leave the country go to some
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.360]  communist regime go join North Korea for all I care you can give up your guns
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.600]  give up your free speech give up your rights you can go to North Korea and
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.880]  live in a country where the barbed wire keeps you in and you can worship the
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.240]  the latest version of Kim Jong-il whoever whoever that happens to be
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  generation after generation yeah just bow down on the ground lick their boots
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.520]  and do your little fake cry for how much you love living under total tyranny
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.120]  otherwise if you want to live in America you should honor American rights and
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.800]  values and that sacred freedom and liberty that makes America great and
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.880]  there's no more excuses for any of it I'm tired of the linguistic mind games
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.560]  I'm tired of the double-speak from Obama and Romney the same I'm tired of
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.520]  just the lies that keep coming out of Washington it's just too much I'm just
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.760]  sick of it so let's let's tell the truth and that's what we practice doing
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.360]  right here on info wars calm and of course I'm happy to be here and be part
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:10.120]  of that now coming up coming up after the coming break we've got a great
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.920]  truth teller a whistleblower a former employee of Glaxo Smith Klein the
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:20.800]  company that just played a guilty to criminal fraud and ended up paying a
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.080]  $3 billion fine yeah billion to the US government kind of wonder where that
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:31.000]  money goes by the way who who gets the $3 billion whose budget does that go into
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.360]  they don't tell you that but anyway we're gonna have an interview with him
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.040]  Blair Hamrick coming up right after this break lots of incredible details about

[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:46.920]  anywhere we'll be right back stay with us
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:56.160]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:04.440]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.920]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.480]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.840]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.600]  worldwide exclusive for national radio interview coming up for you right now
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.280]  the interview is with Blair Hemrick he is one of the two people the others
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:36.720]  Gregory Thorpe who were former employees of GlaxoSmithKline and Blair in
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:43.440]  particular was a drug rep and as he began to see some I'll say not quite so
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.920]  above-the-board activities going on inside the company he raised the alarm
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.920]  and he ended up losing his job and has been out of work for many many years
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.640]  we'll talk about that and ended up turning information over to the
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.240]  Department of Justice which then reached a three billion dollar settlement with
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.480]  GlaxoSmithKline that was a widely distributed or widely publicized in
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.720]  the last week or so and it's the largest settlement in the history of Big
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.160]  Pharma now Blair joins us now here on the Alex Jones show to give us details
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.840]  about what he saw going on inside the company this will give you a clue about
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:27.400]  the runaway criminality that exists today in what I call mafia medicine and
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:32.080]  Blair Hemrick joins us by Skype video to give us the details Blair welcome to
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.340]  the Alex Jones show hey Mike nice to be here thanks a lot for having me you
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.600]  bet it's great to have you on now give us a just a quick background for the the
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:46.280]  many listeners across the country and around the world about your how did you
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.920]  start out with Glaxo I mean what what position did you have there I started
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.400]  out with Glaxo as a sales rep just a sales rep calling on primary care
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.080]  physicians after a couple of years with the company I was promoted to what was
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:06.360]  called a therapeutic area specialist and what that is is basically you call on
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:16.320]  specialists specialists more specifically neurologists doctors and who are who
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:23.600]  are you know who have you know not your primary care guys but sure but your
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:30.760]  specialist and my job essentially was recruiting these specialists to speak to
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:38.640]  other physicians to about Glaxo products now I know that we spoke before and I
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.160]  asked you about the the kickbacks and the bribery to doctors I know that what in
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:48.800]  that position as a specialist one of your jobs was to recruit doctors and make
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.040]  sure they were paid very well to go on speaking gigs you told me they could make
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:58.240]  as much as $2,000 for a 30-minute speech promoting a drug to other
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.240]  physicians tell us about how that worked well how that works is you know depending
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.200]  on how desirable the physician is you know interestingly enough there's a
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.760]  website where people can look and see if your personal physician is in the
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:19.080]  pocket of Big Pharma it's called ProPublica.com and you can and it not
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.120]  only goes back for about a year you know of course Pharma doesn't want to
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.840]  disclose what they've been paying the physicians before that but anyway it's
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:36.880]  based upon how desirable the speaker is meaning how how well thought of he was
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:43.920]  or or if they were a high rider if they wrote a lot of prescriptions that they
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:50.840]  had a lot of business and it could be anywhere from $500 a talk to $2,500 was
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.400]  was one of the most that one of my physicians got but they could stack
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.880]  these they could have multiple talks in one day I remember you saying so they
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.520]  could yeah they could rack up let's say $6,000 in one day and it was so lucrative
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.400]  for some doctors these kickbacks that they actually stopped seeing patients in
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.640]  their own practice and just became sort of professional speakers making all
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:16.280]  this money right well I mean as I told you before I mean I some of these
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:24.040]  offices I would go I'm sorry about the dog barking yeah she sure is um anyway
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.760]  a lot of these you know many times I'd walk into offices and doctors like oh
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.560]  you're the you're the guy who sets up the programs can you get me a gig you
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:40.200]  know and and so you know these docs you know they would they would all their
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.840]  travels paid for they would you know they would schedule them for sometimes a
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:49.800]  breakfast meeting a lunch meeting and a dinner meeting all in one day and so they
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.400]  get three honorariums is what they call it and so they get three of their
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.400]  speaking fees so this was characterized by the Department of Justice as a system
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:03.120]  of kickbacks and it really is generally just called bribery it seems like these
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.080]  doctors were being financially incentivized or sort of paid as a quote
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.360]  speaking gig when they would write higher prescriptions for the Glaxo Smith
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:17.240]  Klein drugs but a lot of these doctors really in the open market wouldn't
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.920]  command those kinds of speaking fees and often they would just speak to very just
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.440]  maybe six people at a time or things like that is it is that correct that's
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:30.040]  correct I even had one physician we we flew to Louisiana and he wanted me to
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  go with him and he spoke to one physician so there was five drug reps one
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.480]  physician the doctor that I brought in and we went to a fish camp in and
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:46.600]  Louisiana and I don't really I don't recall what his honorarium was at the
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:52.280]  time but you know it was a nice it was a nice weekend for him to go home to his
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:59.880]  hometown and you know so I mean it's a it's a pretty pretty nasty business I
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:06.520]  mean it's you know and as I said you know if you read ProPublica you can you
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.440]  can see that there's guys still making a lot of money doing this well yeah one
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.400]  doctor this came out in the Department of Justice lawsuit or settlement
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.280]  documents one doctor was paid I believe around two million dollars it also came
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.560]  out that another celebrity radio doctor had received I think two hundred seventy
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.360]  five thousand dollars that was reported in the Wall Street Journal and that he
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.800]  he then went on the air and discussed I think intimacy or depression during
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.960]  intimacy but failed to disclose to his audience that he was taking money from
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.520]  the drug company that's right yeah I think that was dr. Drew yeah right dr.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.640]  Drew dr. Drew and and and you know and yeah he was discussing into intimacy
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:55.480]  and depression because many of the SSRI's have sexual side effects you know
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:04.480]  a decreased libido and so what what what Glaxo decided to do was that because
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:10.720]  well Butrin's not an SSRI they decided to promote it to increase libido and
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.600]  that's when they came up with that catchphrase you know the happy horny
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:20.680]  skinny drug and you know it was you know I mean these are you know these are not
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:24.800]  these are chemical compounds that are very dangerous and they're not toys you
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.120]  know it's not it's not a game and and unfortunately the company just seems
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.440]  very cavalier and the way that they they handled it but you told me in a
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.120]  previous conversation and folks you can check out some of these quotes on
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.600]  naturalnews.com also on info wars.com I'm sure these quotes would be there
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:48.080]  remind the guys to post that from our site that most of the slide shows that
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.440]  that these physicians used during their speeches for which they were receiving
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.040]  pretty big dollars some of them or most of them actually came from the company
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.760]  marketing departments and so so essentially the company would hand the
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.160]  money pay their airfare set up the hotel and then give them a PowerPoint
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.640]  presentation to go out and speak that's correct give them a PowerPoint
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.560]  presentation and then you know it was one of the thing one of the jobs of the
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.400]  representative you know because there would always be a representative or
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.120]  manager at these conferences or these these you know continuing medical
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:30.000]  education you know full tongue-in-cheek there and right but but but just along
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.240]  those lines this kind of quote education is required by state medical
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.400]  licensing boards for doctors to keep their licenses they have to go and
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.200]  submit themselves to this kind of propaganda right that's correct that's
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:47.560]  correct yeah it's it's you know it's a it's a big facade it's you know it's
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:54.640]  it's absolutely a facade and you know at some point in time you know my for
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:00.480]  myself and Greg Thorpe just said you know this is wrong and and what do if a
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:08.560]  child has you know a seizure because of the drug that that we're promoting is
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.120]  given to a child when it's not even indicated it's for 18 and above it's
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.120]  clearly stated in the package insert it's not for children you know who's at
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:22.080]  fault there and and where does the buck stop right that's that's a I have that
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.920]  question for you what caused you to stand up and speak out when most people
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.880]  would be happy to have a cushy job I mean you've been out of work I think you
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.720]  were blackballed by the pharmaceutical industry I know you're not you're not
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.600]  claiming that but that's just what it looks like to me you've been out of
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.960]  work for now what ten years during this battle I've had some odd jobs you know
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.840]  since then but you know on all the intensive purposes I have never
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.760]  financially recovered you know when I left the company I was making about a
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.360]  hundred and forty thousand dollars a year and so you know because of pending
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:02.160]  litigation I can't discuss the circumstances that led to my
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.800]  dismissal sure and by the way you're the law firm I want to give a shout out to
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.920]  Kenny and McCafferty out of Philadelphia that law firm specializes in whistle
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:15.920]  blower cases and they took on your case and and they achieve quite an amazing
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.320]  victory the largest settlement in the history and that law firm specializes
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:27.920]  in fraud cases medical fraud sometimes tax fraud I see your dog very much
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.240]  approves of that as well yeah I wish I could you know I know we're under time
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:36.560]  constraints or I'd go in and try to get her to stifle I apologize
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.600]  that's right let me let me throw in a comment here yeah go if you want to do
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.520]  that okay let me throw in some comments here while you're doing that we'll have
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.960]  better audio clarity for everybody but you know folks this is real radio this
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.480]  was live radio and Blair Hamrick you know that's where he lives he gave up a
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.960]  cushy job it could have been a very wealthy situation for him he gave that
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:02.840]  up to tell the truth to blow the whistle so that he could then help protect other
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.520]  people from this kind of thing going on and by the way he told me in a previous
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:11.280]  interview that at the time he left Glaxo Smith Klein they had over 40,000
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.680]  speakers on their speakers bureau so just as we were talking about this you
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:19.880]  know $2,000 for 30 minutes that the doctors were getting paid as quote
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.200]  kickbacks there were it turns out there were more than 40,000 the court
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:30.400]  documents revealed there were 49,000 speakers on Glaxo's speakers bureau which
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.240]  again even the Department of Justice characterizes as a kind of an elaborate
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.640]  network of kickbacks that Glaxo has pleaded guilty to conducting this is
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.320]  not this is not a debate it's not like Glaxo is denying this they have pleaded
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.720]  guilty to this and they said we're gonna you know we're gonna make some changes
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:55.280]  we're gonna do better but this is they they plead guilty to criminal fraud go
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.760]  ahead Blair I mean one of the things it's interesting and why I mean I'm not
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.600]  with the company anymore and I've been a I've been away for a while so you know I
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.960]  can't attest to what's going on currently but you know you're talking
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.480]  about compounds you know right now in the newspaper you know they they made a
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:17.440]  big to-do about stop paying you know stopping paying the reps on market
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.880]  share and going to educating physicians and that's how they're gonna start paying
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.440]  their reps but how much can you educate a physician on a compound that's 30 years
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.120]  old or 25 years old I mean you know you've got you know you've got a drug
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.880]  like for instance Advir that is a new compound but it's basically two very old
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:44.280]  compounds together so so how much how much more education is a person with a
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.680]  business degree gonna give a physician that did 10 years of school on on a
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.080]  compound that's 25 years old well that's a really good point and you know the
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.400]  drug companies are desperate to try to come up with new combinations that they
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.760]  then spin as being breakthrough drugs when like you like you described they're
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.480]  really this is the same old chemicals just sort of repackaged but let's talk
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.000]  about off-label marketing and marketing to children because this is something
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.720]  else that Glaxo pleaded guilty to they admitted that they were illegally or in
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:20.280]  violation of FDA regulations I should say marketing these drugs to children
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.080]  that were never approved for children never even tested for children no safety
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.240]  record for children give us the load out on that Blair as the insider who saw it
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.680]  firsthand well sure I mean you're talking about drugs where just a percent
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.640]  market share can be made mean a huge sum of money so you know the company was
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.800]  very concerned about patent expirations on these compounds and they were trying
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:51.120]  to squeeze every penny they could so you know they would you know they would you
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.400]  know and with say with like well Butcher or Paxil you know they were trying to
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:00.760]  squeeze every penny they could so they were trying to find new avenues to
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.400]  create to generate more money and you know one of the things that you got to
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.200]  ask yourself is like when you are selling off-label to a child you know the
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.120]  package insert has dosing and administration well what do you tell
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.160]  a doctor you know who's going to use it on a 12-year-old I mean how do you tell
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:19.440]  him to dose it well so I mean there's there's some inherent dangers with that
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:23.360]  but just to be clear Blair so when you were in meetings with your managers
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:27.160]  being trained on how to approach doctors and what to say I just want to be
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.560]  clear were they telling you specifically you pushed this drug for
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.720]  children you know wink wink or how did that go down what actually took place
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:41.000]  well sure well there was absolutely in fact you can look in some of the court
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.040]  documents there's there's some documents about to the effect that that show that
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:53.360]  they were they were wanting to promote well butrin for for children and they
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:59.920]  are in a in a disease state and you know I don't want to say too much but the
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:06.200]  allegations in the in the document are for ADHD and children so you know it
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.600]  was a nod nod wink wink we all you know there was a written set of rules and then
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  there were the real rules and the and the real worlds were basically if you
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.800]  didn't sell off label you weren't you weren't going to get the market shares
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.640]  and if you didn't get the market shares you wouldn't be employed very long so
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.160]  there was this this really aggressive push and obviously your salary was tied
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  into probably bonuses for how many prescriptions were written by doctors off
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.200]  label and on label both is that how it worked that's correct and and you know
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.480]  they couldn't you know with the way that they were tracking the prescriptions
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:43.160]  they couldn't distinguish what was on label or what was off label it was you
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.600]  know it was just just get get the prescriptions at whatever costs and and
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.120]  if you know and like you know and like that you said if you weren't making the
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.680]  numbers you were then you know if you were falling to the bottom half of the
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:02.040]  pool then they would target you to and coach you to start pulling your numbers
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:06.760]  up and so the way to get numbers up was to do speaking programs bringing these
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.280]  thought what are called thought leaders in to engage with your physicians
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.560]  whether it was just bringing a doctor in for a lunch or or having a dinner
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:22.800]  program and you know many times I mean so often they would talk off label
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.400]  whether you know whether it was for you know well-butioned for weight loss or
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:33.520]  for you know ADHD for for sexual dysfunction or you know or you know
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.400]  just children and in the whole gamut I mean it was it was just you know you
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:44.200]  would have thought that the drug should have been in the water that's that yeah
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.720]  don't don't say that to too many people they're going to try that right they
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.280]  want to they want to put cholesterol drugs in the water supply that's how
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.600]  crazy they are but you mentioned a well-butered in particular that the
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.120]  the catchphrase that you would repeat to doctors if you only had a minute to
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.080]  talk to them was the quote happy horny skinny drug and yet there was there was
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.120]  no data there was no clinical trial data whatsoever on the treating sexual
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:14.360]  dysfunction or weight loss at all right so that was just just a fairy tale there
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:20.720]  may have been there may have been some shady trials or some some data you know
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.400]  they also did this thing called the fax back where you would engage with your
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.720]  doctor you know and of course you would they you know they were they would
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.120]  instruct you to according our allegations in the complaint they would
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:41.800]  instruct you to write you know doctor request off-label information on
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.360]  whatever drug and then you would call an 800 number all right Blair we got a

[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.240]  are filling in and we are talking with former Glaxo employee and now whistle
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:30.520]  blower Blair Hamrick who's one of the top two key people responsible for taking
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.200]  evidence to the Department of Justice that resulted in the three billion
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.240]  dollar settlement the largest in the history of medicine wow incredible hey
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:43.360]  Blair let me ask you this the typical uninformed consumer out there let's say
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.960]  just a mainstream news watching someone who's not really informed doesn't for
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.080]  example listen to the Alex Jones show so that they're not really awakened that
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.240]  much that kind of person thinks this is what they believe and I want you to tell
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.600]  us why this belief is is wrong if you think so but they believe that all the
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.160]  drugs are meticulously tested by upstanding scientists that it's the
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.480]  gold standard of evidence-based medicine and that the FDA scrutinizes all of this
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.520]  information and makes sure that drugs are only approved and released to the
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.280]  public after just these huge in-depth studies proving their safety and
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.160]  efficacy and that the drug companies they're really out to just help humanity
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.120]  and in fact they only kind of make money accidentally it's not their main
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:29.680]  intent they're really just trying to help people you know it should be like a
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.560]  big nonprofit organization is what they the way they portray themselves so
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:39.000]  what's wrong with that view of medicine today
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:47.640]  to when they start testing it for approval according to the FDA a new drug
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:53.160]  only needs to show that it's better than placebo that it works better than
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:59.240]  placebo so there's many compounds out there that are have been available for
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.120]  years and years and years that are available generically that are pennies
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.400]  on the dollar and these these drug companies would never put these products
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:14.080]  up against those products sometimes head-to-head they only put it through
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.680]  against placebo because if it's better than placebo then they get the
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.440]  approval and then whereas if they put it head-to-head against something that is
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:30.240]  already approved and is cheap and is efficacious and safe then and they show
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.680]  inferiority to that product well then you're taking a drug that may be eight
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.960]  nine dollars a pill and and something that may take three cents a pill yeah
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.900]  just just just a rephrase what you're saying a lot of the new drugs that are
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.480]  hyped up that are expensive like you say eight nine ten dollars a pill some are
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.720]  even more a lot more than that fifty bucks a pill in some areas right it may
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.840]  be an old you know nickel a pill drug actually works better but they never
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:59.600]  they never run the head-to-head test because that would show that the new
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:05.960]  drug isn't worth the extra ten bucks right that's correct you know and may be
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:10.520]  safer you know I mean there's many compounds out there for instance they've
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:15.440]  got the Glaxo has a new product called treximate which is a combination of an
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.680]  older product of emitrex and naproxen naproxen so I think it's either a
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:26.520]  common painkiller yeah right and naproxen has been I you know that drug is
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:33.760]  like 45 years old and emitrex came out in 19 I want to say 1991 I think is when
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.360]  that drug was launched so there you have you've got a 20-year-old drug and a
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:42.400]  40-year-old drug they mix them together and they call it a new drug when they
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.840]  at the same time you've got the drug companies actively interfering with the
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.720]  generic drug manufacturers trying to bring drugs to market for cheaper prices
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:54.280]  I saw for example I think AstraZeneca just got slapped by the court for trying
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.440]  to engage in that Pfizer's being sued under allegations of price fixing and
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:02.720]  monopolization to prevent a competing generic cholesterol drug from entering
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:06.400]  the market that would potentially reduce their sales of I believe Lipitor so
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.200]  you've got these drug companies actually working against the interests of
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:14.280]  consumers so you know why doesn't the FTC get involved in anti competitive
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.440]  practices with these companies I don't know I can't answer that question but you
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:23.680]  know what I can say is that for every day that a generic stays off the market
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:29.480]  they make tens of millions perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars a day
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:33.120]  yeah they're making money every minute stay with us Blair sure please stay
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.420]  with us we're gonna continue in just a minute with much more from Blair
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:53.920]  Hamburg hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.560]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:01.040]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:04.920]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even golden silver
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.700]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:12.300]  friends and solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:17.580]  hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:21.620]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:25.620]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:29.700]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:34.860]  survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:45.620]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:51.900]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:59:51.900 --> 02:00:00.300]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:12.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers? Well so does he
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:21.180]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:29.020]  Jones. All right welcome to the third hour it's already the third hour of the
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:33.940]  Alex Jones show wow time flies when you're telling the truth doesn't it we're
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:37.740]  joined in this segment continuing with Blair Hamrick the whistleblower former
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:42.700]  employee of the GlaxoSmithKline one of the key informants that went to the US
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:47.660]  government that then took action and got a three billion dollar settlement out of
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:53.420]  Glaxo now we're going to continue with Blair for this segment and in fact for
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:56.500]  the next half hour so I hope you can stay with us Blair but here's some of
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:01.740]  the stories we just spoke about AstraZeneca tries to block generic drug
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:07.220]  approvals gets slapped by the court and there's there's just another case of
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:10.780]  pharmaceutical companies trying to interfere with free market practices
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:16.060]  that would actually benefit consumers and this is routine you probably weren't
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:20.100]  in that area of the company Blair but do you have any any other knowledge about
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:25.540]  drug companies blocking generic drugs that would benefit consumers well you
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:31.540]  know if they don't block they can also do things like manufacture the compounds
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:39.060]  for the for the generic companies many times after the drug is is made it gets
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:46.260]  the approval generically and they were unsuccessful you know usually successful at
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:52.060]  and making that time a lot longer but then when the the the generic finally
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:57.180]  comes out then they'll have cut a deal with the generic house to manufacture
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:02.820]  either the the raw compound for them to press it into a pill or maybe even
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:08.180]  manufacture it themselves sometimes the you know as you know sometimes they'll
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:14.620]  have two two lines running at the same time the exact same pill on each line
[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:19.540]  one's going in a generic bottle one's going in a brand name box so so I mean
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.100]  it's there's a lot of malfeasance going on here
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:26.380]  well I mean there's nothing nothing let's say technically illegal about having
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:30.860]  a generic line but where I have issues is where are these drugs manufactured
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:34.340]  because I remember reading a lot of stories talking about manufacturing
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:40.740]  facilities for example in Puerto Rico and in India where they would find machine
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:47.220]  parts in the pills and they would find a specs of paint from you know Cheryl
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:53.260]  Eckers was the whistleblower in another Glaxo case about a year ago where she
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:03:00.380]  was reporting malfeasance going on in Puerto Rico where the drugs were mislabeled
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:05.220]  you know I mean all kinds of all kinds of things and even having the reports
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:09.620]  written to North Carolina and Spanish so that the people at the main office
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:15.700]  couldn't read the reports you know I mean and you know unfortunately Cheryl you
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:21.140]  know because I was in sales I was a I'm a pretty good communicator where Cheryl
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:27.740]  was on 60 minutes and she you know her specialty was something else and so she
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:32.780]  wasn't a communicator and so she was dismissed very quickly but she her story
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:40.580]  is is significant and itself and you know and and and so you know what what
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:44.940]  these companies are doing it's a very filthy business and you know like I
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:48.500]  said to you in our last interview I mean what what are they they're a corporate
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:51.820]  defendant and what's a corporate defendant it's nothing but a table full of
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:56.740]  attorneys you know justifying behaviors and making it up you know I mean when
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:01.580]  they can't when they can't justify a behavior they just make a story up yeah
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:05.420]  I want to talk to you about that in more detail this segment is not carried by
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:09.620]  all of the radio affiliates so when we get into the next segment I want to ask
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:14.940]  you about CEOs being held criminally responsible which hasn't happened yet
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:19.580]  but I believe that should happen and I want to get your views on that Blair
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:25.260]  sure how come these companies can simply admit to felony crimes admit to fraud
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:31.740]  admit to violating federal law pay a fine get away with it nobody gets arrested
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:35.660]  nobody goes to jail nobody goes to prison and they just keep doing it over and
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:39.060]  over again in this case for example Glaxo paid its three billion dollar fine
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:45.140]  out of quote cash reserves yeah this company's so big they have three billion
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:49.060]  dollars sitting around can you imagine that's like around hey is there three
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:51.980]  billion dollars under this table anywhere they just pull it out pay to the
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:55.700]  government keep doing business it's incredible but stay with us Blair we've
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:58.700]  got to go to a quick break and then we'll be right back on the other side with

[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:23.660]  either we're not doctors so don't please don't ask us health questions but Blair
[02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:28.580]  getting getting back to you we we spoke about the importance of having some
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:33.860]  corporate responsibility for these kinds of actions why is it that nobody's
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:39.780]  going to jail you know nobody's being arrested the the CEO of Glaxo is not
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:44.460]  being investigated or prosecuted for these crimes that his company has
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:49.340]  admitted to committing why is that how does that make you feel amen I mean it's
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:54.580]  it's the veil of the corporation I mean you know there a corporation is
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:10:02.100]  basically a sociopath and and they have so many veils of protection that you know
[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:05.740]  and and so many attorneys you know nobody's nobody's gonna face the music
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:10.940]  and you know unfortunately maybe somebody in the UK will wake up I mean I've
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.860]  already heard that some prime ministers in the UK are calling for an
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:19.620]  investigation of Glaxo to see if they really have changed like they say they
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:24.020]  have and you know quite frankly if if they are a changed company then why
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:30.340]  doesn't Glaxo HR give me a call and try to hire me back in and their in their
[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:33.540]  compliance department I'd gladly go back to work for them in their compliance
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:36.900]  department oh yeah I bet they would love that you you in their compliance
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:41.700]  department yeah but hey who knows maybe that's some way they could actually show
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:45.420]  that they're serious about reforms but here's something interesting in the
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:51.140]  natural products industry if a let's say a provider of cherry supplements is
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:55.580]  investigated by the FTC for what is essentially the same as off label
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:11:00.620]  marketing or making it making invalid marketing claims the FTC will often go
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:04.700]  in and seize all their inventory shut down their entire company sees the
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:08.700]  entire customer email list sees all the computers all the literature everything
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:12.100]  this happened to the life extension foundation many years ago by the way in
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:17.460]  an FDA raid and then they will require the company to refund the money to every
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:22.020]  customer in the history of that company so my question is as someone who's
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:27.660]  covered this journalistically why doesn't the FTC or the FDA go in and
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:32.780]  require Glaxo to refund all the money from all the sales of these drugs that
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:38.980]  they admitted to off label fraudulent criminal marketing and wouldn't that
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:43.780]  make sense refund everybody right well absolutely I mean you know listen one of
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:47.460]  the things I mean I've suffered my family and I have suffered for me
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:52.180]  blowing the whistle no question but I haven't suffered nearly as much as say
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:57.940]  some mother or father whose child committed suicide because they were their
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:03.140]  their child's doctor was marketed you know Paxil for off label I mean so I
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:07.420]  mean I keep that in perspective yeah you know I don't know it would be a breath
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:12.940]  of fresh air if if the punishment fit the crime it really would be because then
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:17.300]  it would it would be a disincentive exactly and the companies would stop
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.260]  doing them doing the behavior that's the issue you just nailed it right there
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:23.940]  Blair it's a disincentive because right now let's say let's say Glaxo might have
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:28.220]  made I'm just guessing 30 billion dollars off of selling these drugs so
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:33.100]  okay 30 billion they set aside three billion and have a stack of cash in the
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:37.060]  CEO's office let's say that'd be a pretty big stack even right even in fiat
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:41.740]  currency but they take the three billion when they get caught they take the three
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:47.100]  billion handed to the feds and say we're gonna keep doing business and and they
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:51.700]  never have to to pay back their profits that they made illegitimately in the
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:55.100]  first place so they just keep doing business it's just a cost of business and
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:01.300]  never ends in the way the law reads the way the false claims acts reads it's
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:06.940]  supposed to be ten thousand dollars per violation so when you start thinking about
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:11.460]  every prescription a ten thousand dollar fine per violation you know the
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:15.820]  company and the company's not allowed to do business with the if convicted the
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.980]  company's not allowed to do business with the with the federal government at
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:23.820]  all well that's the other thing Pfizer setting up the dummy corporation to take
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:29.100]  the fall you know it's it's it's all smoke and mirrors why why does Medicare
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:33.660]  and Medicaid keep doing business with these companies that admit to felony
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:39.980]  crimes why does Obamacare force us to do business with these companies by
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:45.140]  forcing us to buy into a health insurance system and I know your your your thoughts
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:49.140]  on you know you you like the fact that everybody needs some kind of health care
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:54.020]  safety net I understand that right but shouldn't we have a choice and not be
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:59.180]  forced to do business with criminal companies I think I concur with that
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:04.380]  completely I mean I mean I think that you know that you know like our
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:09.700]  education system everyone has a right to a basic high school education right you
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:13.780]  know I think that you know we should everyone should be able to get you know
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:18.740]  health care but I don't think you know the way what's been proposed is the
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:23.940]  right way to go about no look I I used to live in in Taiwan and that's that's
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.300]  where I went out of college because we're in a an economic recession at that
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:31.740]  time and there they have a health care system that is kind of a government run
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:36.780]  system right it's dirt cheap an employer at that time literally they were paying
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:42.140]  about four dollars a month per employee for full coverage I four bucks a month
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:46.700]  now today that might be 20 bucks a month but imagine if US employers only had to
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:51.260]  pay 20 bucks a month for each employee I don't think there would be much debate
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:55.300]  about that part of the problem with Obamacare is that it's so expensive it
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:59.100]  bankrupts the companies it bankrupts families and now it's going to be hit
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:03.100]  with a tax I mean I didn't mean to get you to the political issue Blair but you
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:06.860]  know the the criminality of the drug companies becomes an issue when we're
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:11.140]  forced to do business with those companies right I mean you wouldn't do
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:17.420]  business with a with a known criminal if you can help it and you know one of
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:20.340]  the thing that's interesting you brought up is the number one cause of
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:25.520]  bankruptcy in the United States is is medical bills that's right medical
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:29.740]  bills and and of and I don't remember what the percentage was but it's like of
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:35.260]  those people who declare bankruptcy many of them have insurance so I mean just
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:38.460]  because you have insurance doesn't guarantee that they're not going to come
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:41.940]  after you and bankrupt you well said Blair let's go to some calls we've got
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:46.580]  callers on the line and let's go to Cindy in Iowa first Cindy you're on the
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:51.220]  air go ahead what's your question hi Mike thank you so much for having this
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:55.940]  guest I I work at a research facility that has all the companies that y'all
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:01.820]  name I wanted to say that I don't think the efficacy is a lot of the drugs can
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:09.900]  be no pure as they're reporting to the FDA when when we perform procedures on
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:15.660]  subjects that they they do these studies for living for a living and you're
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:20.100]  supposed to have a 30-day washout but yet they do because there's not like the
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:24.740]  main database to show all the all the research places who have done a study
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:31.060]  people will do it with those drugs in their system because of money and the
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:35.900]  financial benefit way before 30 days and I know this because I've been working
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:42.460]  at the facility over 10 years and I've heard you know subjects talk and so that
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:48.660]  is so to me how in this age of you know technology how can that be going on
[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:51.660]  because that that's the efficacy and what y'all are talking about the
[02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:57.500]  faciness of these drugs so you're saying that about the 30-day washout you're
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:01.780]  saying that then they they decide they what they they eliminate people from the
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.500]  trial that are having bad results to make the to shape the data to look better
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.620]  that kind of thing no what I'm saying are the subjects there's no regulation
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:15.060]  because the subjects are lying they're going to other facilities before that
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:19.620]  washout and doing studies and there's no database in the research industry
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.940]  and so how can the efficacy of the drugs you know what I'm saying yeah so
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:27.700]  they're they're actually involved in multiple clinical trials at the same
[02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:33.340]  time and stacking drugs and things like that good good question good questions
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.700]  any thanks thanks for your call Blair your your comments on that I know you
[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:39.500]  weren't in the research side of the companies though your comments may be
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:43.260]  limited but did does that ring a bell to anything I mean what are your thoughts
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:47.980]  well I mean I do know how to read read the studies and I can pick apart a good
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:54.700]  study and a bad study and unfortunately many of the people that have to be in
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:57.220]  these you know that are in these studies they're doing it for financial
[02:17:57.220 --> 02:18:03.220]  reasons they're not doing it because you know because you know they're just they
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:07.060]  just coincidentally happen to be at a doctor's office and have this disease
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:12.380]  state so you know if you have people in multiple studies taking multiple products
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:16.500]  then you're gonna have you know you're gonna have skewed results whether it's
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:19.700]  gonna be you know skewed positive or skewed negative you're not gonna have
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.060]  the reason you're gonna have inappropriate results you know the results
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:27.540]  thinking about what kind of person would I mean I guess you know the
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:32.900]  economy is being destroyed by Obama policies well virtually every every
[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:37.100]  president has been destroying the economy lately but people are desperate
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:41.700]  for work and income so I mean are they literally just selling their bodies into
[02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:44.900]  multiple clinical trials to get drugged up and paid something that I mean that
[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:49.220]  sounds like suicide to me it really yeah I wouldn't do it I mean as desperate as
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:52.940]  I've been in the past ten years I I wouldn't do it either but you see it in
[02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:57.740]  the newspaper all the time you know drug study will pay you for your time and so
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:02.380]  you know you you get to see the doctor for free and so you know it's they
[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:07.540]  coerce you into this and yeah you become a human guinea pig wow wow and then and
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:12.660]  then of course well the quote this was a pharma discussion behind the scenes why
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:16.220]  do you use human guinea pigs and the answer is they're cheaper than monkeys
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:22.700]  I mean I mean lab lab monkeys cost more money than paying you know a human down
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:27.940]  the street to do it it's incredible and and you know the animal rights folks you
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:32.780]  know would be offended if they you know if you know what they do and rightly so I
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:38.260]  mean in the end but and they and they rabbit but with what they do to humans
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:41.780]  it's you know hey we got to get rid of all the incredible anyway then these
[02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:46.300]  experiments like in Nigeria on on children there's experiments in Guatemala
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:49.540]  on the prisoners that took place the whole history Jonas Salk and his
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:54.540]  experiment experiments on antibiotics in prisoners and in all kinds of things
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:58.500]  mental asylums incredible a lot more straight ahead stay with us here on the

[02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:37.580]  sure all right here we go Roger from Minnesota calling in Roger you're on
[02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:41.420]  the air thanks for joining us what's on your mind yes first of all I want to
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:44.020]  congratulate Blair for being a whistleblower because it takes a lot of guts
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:47.540]  a lot of courage to do that but what's on my mind Blair might be able to respond
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:50.900]  to this too I just had my first granddaughter about a year ago when I've
[02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:54.580]  been able to convince my daughter and saw a lot of the evils of vaccination
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:59.260]  totally anti-vaccination anti-pig pharma but my daughter has supposedly done some
[02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:02.940]  reading herself also and she just thinks at a minimum my daughter should have
[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:06.860]  granddaughter should have two shots the pertussis and the polio vaccine of
[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:10.700]  course I've read about talk I read about the polio vaccine and the reason my
[02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:13.460]  daughter thinks she'll get the polio vaccine they plan to travel go to Europe
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:17.620]  and of course India had high incidence of polio and I know it's caused by the
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:21.460]  by the vaccinations they're receiving older so my daughter is very intelligent
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:25.540]  my fellow is very intelligent and they respect me they respect my knowledge but
[02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:29.980]  I just can't get them to convince them hey don't give my granddaughter any
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:34.100]  vaccination none of them are any good well you know the polio vaccine I mean
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:37.620]  we've run those right here on infowars I'll ask you Blair for your comments in
[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:40.380]  a second I know you weren't you weren't involved in the vaccine division there
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:45.020]  but you know the polio vaccine has had stealth viruses SV 40 in it throughout
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:49.500]  throughout history and there's a lot of paralysis happening today in India in
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:53.260]  particular from the vaccine itself so people get the vaccine and then they
[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:58.220]  end up with paralysis so we know we know we know these vaccines are not clean I
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:02.340]  mean just come on just look at I mean the call is right you can't trust these
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:07.460]  companies Blair your your thoughts well I tell you what I was watching Alex's
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:13.140]  show a couple of weeks ago and he had the I forgot the lady's name who has that
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:20.100]  movie that's on Alex's website the common good oh yes right yeah I don't
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:25.100]  recall her name at the moment either Manukian right right right and and you
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:29.500]  know I haven't seen the film but I did see her interview and I found her
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:35.420]  interview captivating I like the fact that you know she's she's not so skewed
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:39.900]  one way or the other she's trying to to bring both sides of the issue yeah and
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:46.100]  let you decide for yourself so I would recommend for Roger to you know buy that
[02:26:46.100 --> 02:26:51.140]  video I think that's great I haven't seen it so I can't endorse it that's a
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:54.540]  great idea in fact I think that's available at info wars store.com isn't
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:27:00.060]  it the video yeah I think so yeah I think so and you know and I'm not sitting
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:04.860]  here trying to pinpoint your products I mean no but at the same time it's it's
[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:10.700]  you know I mean information is power and well yeah and I think it's important
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:14.580]  to hear both sides of the story first there's the deceptive evil lying
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:19.660]  pharmacide and then there's the truth side to the story so yeah here both sides
[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:23.100]  I mean hey if you want to believe folks out there if you want to you know be
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:28.260]  injected with the DNA and RNA fragments from disease animals go ahead get
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:34.060]  vaccinated at Bill Gates wants you to be a lower population infertility reduce
[02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.500]  human population you can be part of that you win the Darwin Award that's you can
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:41.460]  you can give yourself the Darwin Award by getting vaccinated that's that's my
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:44.500]  answer that let's take another call Blair because I love those calls we've got
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:48.860]  Ed in Arizona now joining us Ed you're on the air with Blair Hamrick go ahead
[02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:52.820]  Hey great to talk to both of you guys I just wanted to get your take on the
[02:27:52.820 --> 02:27:56.500]  massive drugging of the youth we have going on in America right now I as a
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:28:01.820]  teenager was kind of rebellious kind of crushed me in the system so in my parents
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.780]  they met no harm they thought they're doing all his best for me at the time
[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:10.940]  took me to see a doctor and long story short got put on a sexer and had some
[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:15.420]  real nasty side effects I mean I turned just into that absolute zombie game a
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:20.540]  bunch of ways and there's no way you can wake up if you're taking those drugs I
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:24.180]  just wanted to get your guys take on that good point go ahead Blair well I
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:27.860]  tell you what you know I mean unfortunately you know what what
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:34.180]  pharmaceutical companies have done to bastardize the research you know and
[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:39.900]  you know when I was a rep they used to call you know they some of the reps
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:44.620]  other reps from competing companies would call a flexor side effector and you
[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:48.780]  know I mean just just beating up drugs for no reason but you know I don't know
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:52.300]  whether it was a primary care physician that puts you on on the medication or
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:57.820]  whether it was a psychiatrist that did so I mean you know the unfortunately
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:29:03.820]  these these compounds have side effects and they're dangerous so you know to
[02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:07.620]  cavalier Lee I mean you I'm sure your parents were just trying to help you out
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:13.220]  and and because you know going through you know the the the the problems of
[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:21.100]  adolescence but you know I mean for childhood is a childhood is a disease I
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:26.540]  guess is the thing called the human condition you know Blair it's sad Blair

[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:09.140]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:31:09.140 --> 02:31:13.460]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:17.420]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:21.740]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:26.100]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:29.820]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:33.980]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:37.940]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:41.780]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:21.900]  the health ranger filming in here and by the way you know I heard an ad on GCN
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:25.180]  during in the previous segment I just want to give a shout out to the stuff
[02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:30.340]  that I know works that was an ad from Ty Bollinger with the carnivora that's
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:35.300]  the real deal you know a lot of the products actually that get promoted on
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:38.900]  info wars are things that I I've done research on previously sometimes years
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:43.780]  ago for example the the Maudi the Maudi Filan I did I interviewed the the
[02:33:43.780 --> 02:33:47.740]  founder of that company years ago and talked about it and really research it
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:53.060]  it's the real deal to Brown Seaweed extract that and and the carnivora these
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:56.580]  are powerful they can't even tell you in the ad everything it does because of
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:00.420]  FDA regulations but really good stuff so here's what we're going to do for this
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:04.700]  segment for the rest of show I'm going to take a lot of your calls and at this
[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:09.340]  point it's a free-for-all you can talk about the issues from the first hour the
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:13.380]  gun confiscation you can talk about healthcare and medicine anything you
[02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:16.580]  want you can ask me a question and then I'm going to intersperse that with some
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:20.860]  additional breaking news but just very quickly lemonade freedom calm is
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:25.940]  something you need to check out that's coming up August 18th a protest about
[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:30.540]  you know being able to sell lemonade and lemonade stand without being harassed by
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:36.500]  local police I've also got news about BPA but not what you think it turns out
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:43.500]  that all these BPA free bottles now many of them are using something worse BPS
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:50.580]  yeah it's a different chemical so and by some studies it is what 15 or 19 times
[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:56.020]  more absorbable in the skin than BPA and it may be just as toxic it's another
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:02.060]  hormone mimicking chemicals so now now that when BPA got a bad rep then a lot
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:06.180]  of these companies said they reformulated with BPS and then started
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:12.300]  claiming BPA free on their products or the grocery receipts and that's another
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:15.740]  big source by the way if you go to the grocery store or anywhere that you get
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:20.780]  one of those receipts that's kind of slick that is loaded with toxic BPA or
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:27.260]  BPS so if you handle those receipts wash your hands before eating anything do
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:33.460]  not touch food after touching those receipts or you might you might you
[02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:37.820]  might become well if you're a male you might get literally chemically
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:43.060]  hormonally feminized that's that's what the chemicals do you know say what you
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:47.300]  want but that's what the chemicals do it's cause and effect in basic bio
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:51.180]  chemistry but now let's go to the first caller that we've got in the queue here
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:56.940]  a sky in North Carolina is now you're on the line with Mike Adams here hello
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:02.220]  sky how you doing hey Mike my question was for Blair but you probably can
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:06.300]  answer it up I'm calling didn't get like an information download on the drugs
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:11.700]  and bottle or the drug maker that makes them both my grandma just recently fell
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:15.460]  ill she's been to three major hospitals and nobody no doctor can tell what's
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:18.780]  wrong with her they just they can't figure it out and I'm looking at her
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:22.300]  medical record and I'm seeing where they prescribed and bought it to her for no
[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:26.780]  real reason and then right then when she started taking that drug she just went
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:30.660]  into a zombie zombie coma state well I'm wondering if you knew anything about
[02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:35.460]  that I'm not I'm not going to comment on specifically on a brand-name drug like
[02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:38.340]  that but you can do your own research and that's what I encourage you to do
[02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:44.500]  search for Simbalta side effects or Simbalta clinical trials you sound like
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.300]  a very well-informed intelligent guy you'll be able to do some research and
[02:36:47.300 --> 02:36:51.740]  find out and then hey ask for the package insert from the physician and
[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:55.260]  read the side effects right in the package insert most physicians haven't
[02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:58.660]  even read that insert so that'll give you a wealth of information you might be
[02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:03.780]  able to find that that insert states the side effect that your was it your your
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:10.500]  mother experiencing or your grandmother on the show we can't really trust those
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  inserts or we can't trust what I can look up and find because the studies
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:18.540]  well be asked basically but the inserts will list the side effects they are
[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:21.140]  required to list the side effects that normally aren't talked about in the
[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:25.260]  advertising so go ahead and do that job and I I think you're correct to be
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.700]  skeptical let me just I'll leave it at that I wouldn't take that drug myself and
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:33.300]  I if I had a family member that was on that drug or basically almost any
[02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:36.940]  pharmaceutical I would encourage them to find safer alternatives to get off of
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:39.780]  those drugs let's go to another caller and thank you for your call sky but
[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:44.180]  let's go to shell a Sheldon in Wisconsin Sheldon you're on the air on the
[02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:49.940]  Alice Jones show go ahead please I have a question for you I work in a inner
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:55.860]  inner-city clinic and I've noticed that a lot of our kids are over vaccinated
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:38:00.700]  there the mammograms is off the chain and everything like that but here's my
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:06.100]  question I was telling a bunch of my friends about apricot seeds how I would
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:09.300]  eat that would crack over the core of the apricot and eat the seeds out of it
[02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:16.100]  yep and a friend of mine was telling me about a physician who overdosed off the
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:23.180]  cyanide poisoning of apricot seeds is there anything to that or I don't know
[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:29.460]  you know it sounds like a scare tactic I've eaten lots of apricot seeds in the
[02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:33.580]  past and they do contain what's sometimes called vitamin B17 or leitreal in
[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:38.180]  fact our earlier guest Ed Griffin has an entire book on that thing it's called
[02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:43.380]  war the war on cancer or the I forgot the exact title of it but you can check
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:48.060]  check that information out by Ed Griffin it is it is a basically a natural
[02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:53.980]  chemotherapy agent now has somebody ever been harmed by it I don't know but
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:57.900]  they try to tell these scare stories like about colloidal silver they try to
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:02.180]  scare people away from colloidal silver with these these myths that that you know
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:06.540]  it'll do weird things to that's complete disinfo the real threat is the
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:10.300]  pharmaceuticals and the vaccines and you get things from nature they tend to be
[02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:14.740]  orders of magnitude safer and more effective so I've eaten many of those
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:20.060]  apricot seeds myself hey I'm still here I have no cancer I have no health
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:23.700]  insurance and I don't have a doctor not looking to get one anytime soon either
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:27.300]  I'd rather eat something out of nature than out of a pharmaceutical lab so
[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:29.300]  that's a good question from you thanks for bringing that up
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:35.740]  Craig in Oklahoma you are on the air Craig go ahead please Mike howdy from
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:43.140]  above the Red River from you wanted to comment on I'm a recently disabled
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:47.700]  peer support specialist for the Department of Mental Health subsidy
[02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:54.980]  services in Oklahoma yes I'm no longer employed there and I'm so glad to get
[02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:59.820]  hold of you because with big pharma coming in under the microscope what they
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:07.420]  are I'm kind of tying in something as far as a conspiracy if Mike in 1963 the
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:14.860]  state Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma had over 2,000 beds today there are only
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:21.700]  one little over a hundred beds at the state mental hospital now let me tell
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:27.180]  you something that's wrong with this picture the state's number one number
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:32.740]  one expenditure compared to any and all expenditures combined in the state of
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:40.540]  Oklahoma for psychotropic medications is the Oklahoma County Jail and I've
[02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:47.140]  written Senator Coburn I've written Senator Sparks Coburn's a US Senator
[02:40:47.140 --> 02:40:51.620]  Sparks's and I always get this really good feedback from them but nobody's
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:56.980]  seems to want to you know to get these this information published don't say
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:59.500]  there was a way wait what's the thrust of you're saying that the top two
[02:40:59.500 --> 02:41:04.300]  expenditures are jails and mind-altering drugs is that the thrust of your of your
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:10.180]  call no pharma pharma psychotropic medications yeah yeah pharma the state
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:15.620]  the state of Oklahoma's number one expenditure force for psychotropic
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:21.300]  medications if it's not the mental health service combined or anything the
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:26.500]  number one expenditures is the drugs all my Oklahoma and Oklahoma and Tulsa
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:31.580]  County Jails no well okay you know I think I think you're right on but the
[02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:37.860]  point is these states these states are going broke under the corrupt the the
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:43.420]  collapsing society that they're building which is going to be a prison run
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:46.860]  you know everybody's gonna be thrown in prison and if you don't go along with a
[02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:49.860]  system you got to be on your psychotropic drugs you're gonna be
[02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:55.820]  considered mentally unhealthy or mentally impaired if you oppose authority
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:42:00.620]  that's another thing the in fact the DSM the for the psychiatry industry has a
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:06.700]  disorder called oppositional defiance disorder or ODD that means if you are
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:12.660]  against authority in any way it for example the government says you got a
[02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:18.340]  you got to start recycling your plastic bottles and you say no I don't then you
[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:21.860]  get diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder put on psychiatric drugs and
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:26.300]  perhaps throwing one of these jails thank you for your call by the way it's a
[02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:30.020]  good point on what the priorities are in society now why and why we've got to
[02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:34.060]  change that and get back to liberty to freedom to health to raising healthy
[02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:36.940]  children and keeping them informed I'm gonna go to another college just a
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:41.340]  second but first let me read you a new story the FDA has been caught spying on
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:46.940]  emails of its own scientists in a huge surveillance operation that's up now on
[02:42:46.940 --> 02:42:52.980]  the on the web info wars calm natural news calm is carrying that story also
[02:42:52.980 --> 02:43:00.180]  check this out the USDA has published a graph that is the adoption of genetically
[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:03.100]  engineered crops in the US let me let me give you some light here in the studio
[02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:07.020]  in case you want to get a shot of that it shows that these three main crops
[02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:15.260]  soybeans cotton and corn are headed toward 100% adoption across the planted
[02:43:15.260 --> 02:43:20.860]  acres in the US in other words it means that the GMO imperialism that is
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:27.300]  taking place in America has achieved almost 100% adoption in many of these
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:32.860]  areas it's it's 70 to 80% on some some are herbicide tolerant crops others are
[02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:36.380]  insect resistant crops they're all genetically modified now we're showing
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:40.740]  the graph on screen for you right there this is right out of the USDA and you
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:45.260]  see all these all these lines going straight up into the 100% or approaching
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:50.660]  100% range that means very soon if we don't stop this thing guys and gals
[02:43:50.660 --> 02:43:54.900]  everybody listening if we don't stop this genetic pollution and this this
[02:43:54.900 --> 02:44:02.280]  agricultural intellectual imperialism this this destructive genetic approach
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:06.500]  to agriculture we're going to end up with a hundred percent of the soybeans
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:10.940]  corns corn and cotton all being genetically modified let's go to another
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:17.020]  caller Ali in Illinois you're on the air go ahead Ali hi Mike it's so nice to
[02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:20.220]  talk to you I've listened to the show every day and I've never called in
[02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:25.260]  before but when I heard Blair's story I had to call in because I used to work for
[02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:30.380]  a company that managed that speaker bureau program really tell us more yes
[02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:36.260]  well they paid out we paid out those honorariums quote-unquote to speakers to
[02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:41.180]  go around and tell other doctors to prescribe and get this the company's
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:46.060]  name that I worked for was called scientific voice that's some Orwellian
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:51.620]  speak right there but we would pay them up to thirty two hundred dollars for an
[02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:57.140]  hour's worth of work and these doctors got to think that they were rock stars
[02:44:57.140 --> 02:45:01.940]  they would go around thinking that they were so cool and I mean making a living
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:05.940]  off of talking to other doctors and honestly the only thing bigger than
[02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:11.460]  their heads was their wallet they were so ecotistical and so rich from it it
[02:45:11.460 --> 02:45:14.460]  was insane this is awesome that you called Ali let me ask you some more
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:19.340]  questions then so so your company was the the in between that that like a
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:22.780]  pharma company would hire your company to sign up a lot of doctors to be
[02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:27.820]  speakers and would manage that relationship exactly and we would try to
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:32.220]  manage all of the little regulations in between what Blair was saying earlier
[02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:36.900]  also about the slide presentations that the doctors would use absolutely those
[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:40.940]  were written by the marketing people my direct clients were the marketing people
[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:48.380]  at Sanofi eventist AstraZeneca Wyeth and absolutely the doctors were paid to
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:53.660]  prescribe wow so what was the behavior of the doctors were they willing to sell
[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:58.100]  out to get this money what or what was their attitude about all this are you
[02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:05.300]  kidding me they loved it they would like tack on these speeches into a vacation
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:09.620]  they would go off they would have dinner lunch breakfast with other doctors and
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:13.620]  then get the hotel paid for them get their airfare airfare paid and they
[02:46:13.620 --> 02:46:18.460]  would take a couple of days also extra and just go on vacation and these are
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:22.260]  the people responsible for your health many people believe that remember that
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:26.020]  folks when you go see your doctor you're probably dealing with a criminal who
[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:29.460]  accepted bribes that's what these are these are bribes these are kickbacks but
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:31.980]  they were never talked about that way right Ali they were just sort of
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:37.180]  honorariums that kind of language absolutely and it's so funny because I'm
[02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:40.860]  sure all of the listeners right now are shocked by this this was every day
[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:45.260]  obvious for us I knew it was wrong in my heart and my full I knew that this was
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:49.900]  wrong which is why I had to get out of it but it was so blatantly obvious what
[02:46:49.900 --> 02:46:55.460]  was going on but everybody just like she kept walking toward the edge of the
[02:46:55.460 --> 02:46:58.940]  cliff just kept doing it just didn't care I mean the doctors wanted the money
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:04.500]  the reps were getting money they were the more that prescriptions that they got
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:08.220]  the better their sales were the better their region did the more kickbacks
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:13.060]  they got everybody was everybody was complicit it was not a big secret
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:16.740]  everybody knew what they were doing so Ali we're not going to break yet but
[02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:20.900]  when we do could you stay on the line we want to get your number and talk to you
[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:24.660]  off off the air you know we you don't have to share your name or make it
[02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:27.220]  public or anything but I'd like to I'd like to talk to you more it sounds like
[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:31.100]  you know some other inside details that the public needs to know about this would
[02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:34.940]  you be willing to to give our producers your phone number sure I'd love to talk
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:38.460]  to you guys okay okay great yeah just don't give it live on the air you can
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:42.220]  you get a million calls but so let me ask you some other questions so how many
[02:47:42.220 --> 02:47:48.500]  doctors overall did your company deal with in your estimation I mean per it
[02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:53.820]  was doctors for each and every single drug so it was the you know for instance
[02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:58.260]  of Santa Fe event has had their overall list of quote-unquote speakers and then
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:05.300]  each individual drug had their speakers it had to be thousands how and and what
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:09.820]  was the the highest amount that you saw paid to doctors for these speaking
[02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:17.820]  gigs 3200 was the highest ever saw and well it was for usually that was for a
[02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:23.500]  day's work but I mean they could very easily there were some sometimes where
[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:28.380]  they would make up to maybe 15-1800 dollars for an hour for a visit a lunch
[02:48:28.380 --> 02:48:32.140]  breakfast or dinner but they could go do a breakfast and then a lunch and then a
[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:35.260]  dinner stack it up and all of a sudden they're racking up five or six grand a
[02:48:35.260 --> 02:48:38.220]  day yeah that's that's what Blair was telling us exactly that they would do a
[02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:41.420]  breakfast speech a lunch speech a dinner speech and of course all the meals are
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:45.860]  paid for by the drug company the travel was paid for the hotel was paid for
[02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:50.060]  even other things you know like tickets to concerts and baseball games and
[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:53.780]  Disneyland and places like that were paid for by the drug companies and then
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:58.140]  the doctor would walk home from this vacation with an extra you know 12 grand
[02:48:58.140 --> 02:49:03.180]  in their pocket for two days of given speeches while they eat absolutely there
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:06.740]  were so many little things that they could get reimbursed for dry cleaning
[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:11.860]  meals at the airport just little anything that was incidental toward the
[02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:16.260]  trip they got picked up too so how did but what was your position then were you
[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:22.540]  recruiting doctors or what exactly did you do yes I would recruit the doctors
[02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:27.780]  based on the representatives of the pharmaceutical reps suggestions so they
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:31.740]  might find a doctor who they thought was in on the deal so they'd submit their
[02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:35.580]  paperwork to get this doctor signed up to be on the speakers bureau and then I
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:39.940]  would just physically coordinate the meetings and cut the check so I would
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:46.060]  set up the to get the speakers airfare hotel and to get him the slide
[02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:50.060]  presentation everything he needed to do to go to this meeting I would set up the
[02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:54.180]  onsite meeting you know all of the little details I mean it might be a
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:58.780]  meeting that had 50 60 people it might be one doctor like Blair was saying there
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:04.380]  were times where the doctor would get paid too grand to go talk to one guy
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:09.900]  wow that's funny because I volunteer here to talk to two million people I do
[02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:13.620]  it because I believe in liberty but these doctors are just pocketing money to
[02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:20.300]  tell lies about pharma is all propaganda education amazing absolutely unbelievable
[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:25.140]  I'm really glad you called so you said in your heart you felt you knew this was
[02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:29.980]  wrong did you eventually leave because of that obviously you're not working with
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:34.540]  that organization anymore what happened yes it was my first corporate job out of
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:40.380]  college so I was maybe 23-24 I was just happy to be getting a paycheck and
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:44.260]  honestly I didn't know what I was doing at first we got to go to break sorry
[02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:47.580]  to interrupt you we got to go to a quick break but stay with us if you would
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:50.900]  please Ali we'll be right back on the other side with a lot more stay with us
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:51:04.380]  folks this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:08.700]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:12.860]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:16.900]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:21.180]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:24.980]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.140]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:33.460]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:37.140]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:41.340]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:44.740]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:38.820]  revolution taking place in medicine the the exposing of the pharma crimes the
[02:54:38.820 --> 02:54:43.340]  mafia the corruption it's all coming out the whole thing is a facade of just
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:48.220]  disinformation falsified clinical trials doctors getting kickbacks FDA
[02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:52.300]  bureaucrats getting paid off CDC officials getting lucrative multimillion
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:56.620]  dollar jobs with the vaccine manufacturers it is a giant orgy of
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:55:00.900]  corruption that's called medicine and if you take that medicine out there folks
[02:55:00.900 --> 02:55:05.420]  if you take these drugs if you take these vaccines you are a sucker of these
[02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:10.700]  industries who are using your body to make profits for their own rich filthy
[02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:15.380]  rich executives you are a sucker if you fall for that and the doctors are gonna
[02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:19.940]  line you up for it too as they're making money under the table at the same time
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:24.500]  you trust your doctor you're a fool let me tell you you trust your doctor unless
[02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:28.220]  that doctor is in the holistic health and alternative complimentary medicine and
[02:55:28.220 --> 02:55:32.940]  understands nutrition if you trust a mainstream drug taking drug pimping
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:36.260]  doctor you're a fool and yeah you can quote me on that and we're going to
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:40.500]  continue with Ali right here who's on the phone Ali amazing information that
[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:43.780]  you were bringing to us it just it just backs up everything else that we've been
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:47.900]  talking about here with with Blair Hamrick the Glaxo whistleblower all the
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:51.820]  other information that's coming out what do you think about the big picture Ali
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:57.100]  well I think as you said don't let them use your body but more importantly don't
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:56:01.660]  let them use your mind either as I was saying before we broke I was just a
[02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:06.820]  young kid doing this job and I just needed the money and as I got deeper and
[02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:10.180]  deeper into it I worked for the company for three to four years I knew it was
[02:56:10.180 --> 02:56:15.700]  wrong I was unhappy every day I just felt bad and icky in my soul so I got out I
[02:56:15.700 --> 02:56:21.100]  started my own business I am completely unrelated to pharmaceuticals but I
[02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:24.700]  started following my own passion in my own heart and that's what the overall
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:29.140]  message is follow your passion follow your heart and you can't go wrong yeah
[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:33.740]  I bet you made less money but you you your soul felt better for it is that
[02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:37.660]  accurate oh I made a frack I'm making a fraction of the amount of money that I
[02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:42.220]  made but I'm happy I feel like a happy person now yeah I never had that before
[02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:47.260]  what is your what do your family and friends say about about all this do are
[02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:50.620]  they aware of what you just shared with us that all this is going on is it just
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:54.900]  this big secret that nobody talks about I think my you know I only really have
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:57:00.300]  my parents and they're very skeptical as well so to them it's yeah they kind of
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:04.060]  get it it's no big surprise I mean here in the Midwest it's the secret that
[02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:08.300]  everybody knows but nobody talks about everybody knows that it's it's the
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:13.120]  Leonard Cohen's on everybody knows that I soloed it and it's just time to start
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.260]  talking out about it it's time to start making life changes about it absolutely
[02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:22.980]  it's time to catalyze the whistleblowers it's time to unleash that truth telling
[02:57:22.980 --> 02:57:27.500]  everywhere why you know what why bury your head in the sand out there folks
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:30.740]  there's no more need for that if everybody just told the truth we could

[03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:22.220]  overdrive this is Mike Adams filling in today for Alex Jones I wanted to just
[03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:25.620]  take a little bit of time here because there's so many issues we did not have
[03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:30.780]  a chance to cover but wow what a show what a show today I I don't know what
[03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:33.820]  you think about it but I thought we had some great guests and great information
[03:00:33.820 --> 03:00:38.100]  that got shared out there with the public you know look things are changing
[03:00:38.100 --> 03:00:42.060]  that the transformation is upon us the the global police state is getting
[03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:46.740]  desperate to try to shut down free speech precisely because this kind of
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:50.860]  information is coming out the truth about the drug industry is coming out it's
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:55.780]  it's complete fraud it is just a system of kickbacks and payoffs and corruption
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:00:59.780]  with everybody on the take as long as they make their money they're willing
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:03.700]  to sacrifice the health of some child who's going to go into a seizure and be
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:07.580]  paralyzed or dead from a vaccine they don't care as long as they make their
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:10.780]  money and they can buy their Mercedes and they can get their their fancy house
[03:01:10.780 --> 03:01:15.060]  they don't care what happens to you and your children all right that's what
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:20.940]  we're dealing with here it is a it is a an evil kind of destructive almost an
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:24.460]  infestation of the human spirit that has happened with these people they've been
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:29.540]  taken over by I mean almost literally demonic forces of some kind it's that
[03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:35.700]  bad I mean who who on earth would sacrifice the health of children or
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:39.860]  senior citizens just so they can make an extra buck selling another few billion
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:44.100]  dollars worth of pharmaceuticals and vaccines who would do that I hope you
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:48.460]  wouldn't do that I would never do that I think most most listeners to the Alex
[03:01:48.460 --> 03:01:52.340]  Jones show would not do that because you have ethics because you have a heart
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:56.980]  because you have you you know you know there is eternal judgment on your
[03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:00.660]  actions in this life right you know there's going to be a record there's be
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:04.820]  a record is kept of everything you do and you will be held to account for it
[03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:08.660]  well let's get to some other stories here this is my curtain emo up on info
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:14.420]  wars.com right now Iran accuses us of using weather weapons I wanted to get
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:19.060]  to this during the show but this is this is fascinating and Iran is right now
[03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:23.860]  experiencing its worst drought since 1964 now here's the other thought on this if
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:29.100]  the US has these weather weapons is it using them against the US heartland
[03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:34.620]  right now to destroy the corn supply the food supply it's being crushed by
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:40.020]  about 60 percent maybe 70% could be even worse before this is over so are they
[03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:43.940]  are they being used against the domestic population and the farmers in
[03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:48.660]  America today maybe so I don't know maybe that's another that's another show
[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:54.060]  let me know this one a business leaders hit back at Obama after he says the
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:02:58.220]  wealthy aren't responsible for their own success remember this remember this
[03:02:58.220 --> 03:03:02.300]  quote from what was just yesterday or two days ago Obama said during a speech
[03:03:02.300 --> 03:03:06.660]  if you've got a business you didn't build that somebody else made that happen I
[03:03:06.660 --> 03:03:12.940]  can't tell you how offensive this statement is how detached from reality
[03:03:12.940 --> 03:03:18.620]  it is how ignorant of basic economic fundamentals this is to claim that
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:22.900]  business owners and innovators and the people that put in the hours the long
[03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:26.900]  hours like I see people putting in hours around here you know Alex Jones built
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:32.020]  this network I I built up natural news Alex Jones built up info wars all the
[03:03:32.020 --> 03:03:35.260]  other innovators innovators out there have built up their businesses for
[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:40.660]  Obama to come along and say that we didn't do that that's absurd it's
[03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:47.180]  offensive it is ignorant it is detached from reality I just can't tell you how
[03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:52.780]  offensive that is and even Rush Limbaugh then accused the president of quote
[03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:57.460]  destroying the American dream I don't agree with Rush Limbaugh on a lot of
[03:03:57.460 --> 03:04:01.740]  things but on this one he's right this is Obama destroying the American dream
[03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:07.940]  what what is this this weird sickness the psychosis among the the communists
[03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:12.220]  who think that society gives you everything that you don't that the
[03:04:12.220 --> 03:04:16.860]  individual isn't responsible for your own outcome your own success or failure
[03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:22.140]  that is a communist manifesto type of belief system and it is un-American it
[03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:27.180]  is anti-American to say that business leaders aren't responsible for their
[03:04:27.180 --> 03:04:31.740]  own success that that is so offensive it's the small business owners that
[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:37.660]  generate that create the jobs for 90% of Americans that's a fact that you can't
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:42.060]  argue with even if you're the president in any case I enjoy sharing this info
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:46.620]  with you today thanks for your support thanks for allowing me to come on and
[03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:50.180]  and just basically be part of the info war this is Mike Adams the health
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:54.580]  ranger sharing my thoughts with you today hope to be back in the future until
[03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:59.580]  then take care and keep fighting the info war
