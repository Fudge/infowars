[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.796]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:11.378]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.941]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:17.127]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.173]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:25.554]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:27.695]  It is Tuesday, July 17, 2012.
[00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:37.563]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, sitting in for Alex today on this truly monumental day of news that just stretches
[00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:44.043]  Your construct of reality, it's so amazing.
[00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.564]  Let me give you a hint of what's coming up here.
[00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:58.955]  We've got, well, yesterday at the end of the Alex Jones Show, we had a caller, Chris from Oklahoma, who began describing his involvement in military gun confiscation of US citizens in New Orleans.
[00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.957]  And he talked about the New Orleans Police Department, the NOPD.
[00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:09.440]  Involved in some rather heinous crimes, including raping of women and other things.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.361]  That set off really a firestorm of research here at the InfoWars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:20.843]  Last night, Rob Dew then had on InfoWars Nightly News a video compilation.
[00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:25.044]  Because, you see, so many people can't believe this is really happening.
[00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:29.225]  They live in denial about the gun confiscation issue and what the military
[00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:29.905]  I think?
[00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:30.165]  I think?
[00:01:48.172 --> 00:02:08.681]  So we're going to feature that video clip coming up in just a few minutes to show that to you and remove any doubt in your mind that this is the plan when there's a crisis, when there's an attack, a natural disaster, a bomb, a dirty bomb, a release of let's say a pandemic bioweapon of some sort.
[00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:10.022]  This is what's going to happen in the U.S.
[00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:14.163]  I have no doubt about that, but that's just the beginning of the show today.
[00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:25.626]  We have much more coming up as well, including an exclusive worldwide radio first of Blair Hamrick, the whistleblower from GlaxoSmithKline.
[00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:27.387]  He and his partner, Greg Thorpe,
[00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:32.669]  Well, they were colleagues, I should say, ex-employees of GlaxoSmithKline.
[00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:38.472]  They initiated the whistleblowing suit involving the Department of Justice turning over evidence to the U.S.
[00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:49.837]  government that eventually resulted in the largest settlement and the largest admission of criminal activity in the history of medicine, in the entire history of modern medicine.
[00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:50.638]  A $3 billion
[00:02:51.858 --> 00:03:06.325]  Settlement with the Department of Justice and he is here on the Alex Jones Show joins us at 1230 Central with an interview and to take some of your questions and the details that he has ready to share with us will blow your mind.
[00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:18.331]  We're talking about bribery of doctors, kickbacks from doctors, we're talking about off-label marketing of drugs to children even though they were never tested for children, never approved for children, all that and much more straight ahead.
[00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:18.591]  Also,
[00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:24.438]  The FDA has just been caught surveilling the emails of its own employees and scientists.
[00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:34.831]  This is a mafia type of surveillance, criminal thug racket type of operation that the FDA has just been caught doing, you know, instead of being transparent.
[00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:56.842]  They now have to be big brother to their own employees because they know their own employees are trying to expose the truth and expose the corruption and expose the criminality to the world just like Dr. David Graham did over the Vioxx issue many years ago and the FDA is now turning to what could be criminal type of activities to suppress and
[00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:58.743]  We're good to go.
[00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:16.918]  We've also got information here, a Paul Joseph Watson article, the U.N.
[00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:24.484]  Gun Grab Follows State Department Plan, plus the breaking news coming out of Washington Times that says the Law of the Sea Treaty, that was the U.N.
[00:04:24.484 --> 00:04:27.626]  Small Arms Treaty, was part of that.
[00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:33.370]  This says the Law of the Sea Treaty is now dead, that's called LOST, L-O-S-T is the acronym for that.
[00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.814]  But, but, we know, and you know if you're a regular listener,
[00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:47.420]  That even if Congress is not approving of something, the executive branch of government will bypass Congress and do the UN's bidding anyway.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.583]  So all of that and much more, including G. Edward Griffin as a guest at the bottom of this hour.
[00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.105]  All that straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:55.645]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:56.466]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:01.710]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.211]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.112]  The freedom to choose?
[00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:05.072]  The freedom to vote?
[00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.073]  The freedom to worship?
[00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:08.294]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.544]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride
[00:06:26.544 --> 00:06:27.004]  We're good to go.
[00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:01.975]  888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.975 --> 00:07:10.081]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:08.394]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:11.376]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.774]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:17.674]  Tuesday, July 17th.
[00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:18.895]  We are continuing here.
[00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:22.176]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, sitting in for Alex today.
[00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:24.257]  I'm the editor of NationalNews.com.
[00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:25.097]  You probably know that.
[00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:31.319]  And Alex, of course, InfoWars.com, where you can find articles on all these topics that we are discussing today.
[00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.360]  A huge show straight ahead.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.681]  In fact, there's so much here.
[00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.081]  We've got
[00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:38.582]  Military gun confiscation of U.S.
[00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:42.503]  citizens, that issue is high on the radar right now.
[00:08:42.503 --> 00:08:45.544]  We're going to discuss the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:47.504]  Reports are that it is now dead because the U.S.
[00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:49.705]  Senate will not ratify it at this point.
[00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:50.485]  But if the U.N.
[00:08:50.485 --> 00:09:00.288]  passes it, could the executive branch, Obama in particular, bypass Congress and go ahead and say that guns should be confiscated from all law-abiding Americans?
[00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:06.270]  I'm talking about legal guns, guns that people bought with the FBI background checks, with concealed weapons permits.
[00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.511]  We're good to go.
[00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:30.773]  And he had an astonishing story about gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:38.876]  He and his teammates, his fellow soldiers going in and doing very aggressive kicking in doors, arresting people, taking their guns.
[00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:41.202]  I want to ask him to call back in.
[00:09:41.202 --> 00:09:46.428]  We're going to open up the phone lines and see if he's listening, want him to call back in, have him back on.
[00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:58.060]  Otherwise, if other people who have been in the military and who are involved, who were involved in gun confiscation drills or actual missions, we would invite them to call in as well.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.962]  We'll be taking your calls later on in the show.
[00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:06.927]  We've got G. Edward Griffin coming up at the bottom of the hour with some additional information in all this realm of global control of the situation.
[00:10:06.927 --> 00:10:10.069]  But first, we're going to introduce a video compilation.
[00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:16.153]  For those of you who don't believe what we're talking about, that this kind of gun confiscation is actually going on in America,
[00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:23.878]  Rob Dew and the Infowars Nightly News crew put together a video compilation that will blow your mind.
[00:10:23.878 --> 00:10:40.951]  And this includes some clips from the call yesterday with Chris from Oklahoma, plus some mainstream news footage that actually shows this going on, kicking in doors, screaming at innocent citizens, taking their guns, and leaving them wide open to violent crime in their areas hit by natural disasters.
[00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:44.474]  We're going to go to that video clip right now, and then we'll be right back after that.
[00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:44.874]  Take a look.
[00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:46.235]  Guns will be taken.
[00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:47.716]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:51.558]  We will take all weapons.
[00:10:51.558 --> 00:10:54.440]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.581]  Police department, anyone home?
[00:10:56.581 --> 00:11:02.925]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too.
[00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:04.266]  Police department!
[00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:10.290]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.812]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:16.918]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:18.880]  Let's go to Chris in Oklahoma.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.902]  Chris, you're on the air, on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:22.263]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:22.903]  Hey, Hildrender.
[00:11:22.903 --> 00:11:24.264]  How's it been?
[00:11:24.264 --> 00:11:24.485]  Good.
[00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:25.085]  It's good here, man.
[00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:26.226]  How about yourself?
[00:11:26.226 --> 00:11:26.967]  Oh, pretty good.
[00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:28.067]  Pretty good.
[00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:36.134]  I was with the 45th Infantry Brigade, Delta Company, 1st of the 279th 2nd Platoon.
[00:11:36.134 --> 00:11:39.477]  During Hurricane Katrina, I'm kind of calling it in on yesterday's subject.
[00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:40.398]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:41.518]  That's alright.
[00:11:44.198 --> 00:11:54.210]  I've always wanted to get ahold of you guys and kind of get the word out there for those that still have that slight hesitation in the back of their head that gun confiscation can't and won't happen here.
[00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.112]  It already has.
[00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:59.516]  And I was only 21 years old, just really gung ho.
[00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:03.868]  Really dedicated to the Army, especially to the infantry.
[00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:05.690]  And, uh, I did whatever I was told.
[00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.691]  And what did they ask you to do?
[00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:08.952]  Alright.
[00:12:08.952 --> 00:12:10.253]  First, let's see.
[00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:15.718]  The first thing we did was we got a three-week, uh, a book full of three-week-old 911 phone calls, right?
[00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:21.783]  And then we had to go around and answering all the phone calls, so we were like cadaver dogs for about three weeks.
[00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.625]  And in between them, we would run night missions.
[00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:33.625]  And here's the thing, a lot of people may think that they'll see this on the news or they'll have time to get ready when the crap hits the fan or whatever.
[00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.566]  It's just, it's a truck, you know what I mean?
[00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:41.450]  It's a group of trucks, they pull up, they stack right on your home, as we did, and we broke entry.
[00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.613]  Yeah, we would yell out, Oklahoma Army National Guard, is anybody in need of assistance?
[00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:47.714]  But that's as we were booting in the door.
[00:12:47.714 --> 00:12:51.776]  Wait a minute, it sounds like you weren't part of the Oklahoma National Guard.
[00:12:51.776 --> 00:12:53.798]  I mean, you were US military.
[00:12:54.622 --> 00:12:59.965]  Yeah, I was, uh, I was activated, um, I think about a week after Katrina.
[00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:08.829]  I was, I was watching it on, on, on the news and Sheriff Kimiko, Fox 23, told me before my unit even got a hold of me that I was going to New Orleans.
[00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:14.452]  Wow, so, so... Yeah, we got, we got sent in and we were, we were the very, very first boots on the ground.
[00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:17.754]  Alpha Company... And you were confiscating, you were confiscating firearms?
[00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.225]  Left and right, yes.
[00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:27.729]  And we were also monitoring the New Orleans police because we kept having like, you know, like the first day we had this little beautiful red-headed lady come up.
[00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:28.630]  All right, wait a minute.
[00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.290]  We're almost out of time.
[00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.711]  Will you stay on the line for us, please?
[00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:32.312]  I want to continue with you on the other side.
[00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.773]  Stay on the line with us.
[00:13:33.773 --> 00:13:34.613]  This is fascinating.
[00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.774]  We're going to continue this right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.035]  We'll be right back.
[00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:43.058]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:47.282]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:50.982]  In the end, police took their weapons, but let them stay in their homes.
[00:13:50.982 --> 00:13:54.183]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:58.964]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:03.725]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're going to have to do.
[00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:06.446]  Somebody pops around the corner, and they shoot an American.
[00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:19.080]  We have Chris on the line from Oklahoma relating a story about gun confiscation in New Orleans and that entire region following Hurricane Katrina several years ago.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.281]  And Chris, go ahead.
[00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:28.104]  You were describing how you and your team were kicking in doors and confiscating firearms from people.
[00:14:28.104 --> 00:14:29.184]  Did anybody resist?
[00:14:29.184 --> 00:14:30.805]  Did anybody ever shoot back?
[00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:31.265]  What happened?
[00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:38.495]  Well we had a couple people resist verbally and they got stuffed and cuffed very violently.
[00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:45.962]  We throw them in the back of the five ton or the deuce and a half or whatever and then we take them out to the Greyhound bus station which was the police station at the time.
[00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:58.397]  I think it was like the second day we were there, this red-headed lady came up to our company area.
[00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:04.640]  She sat on the curb with her knees in her chest, just rocking back and forth, crying uncontrollably.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.481]  She sat there for almost 27 hours, just refused to move.
[00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.930]  Oh, you're kidding me.
[00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:33.278]  The FBI had us out there at Tudor Brown, which is the NOPD Sheriff's Brothers Bar.
[00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:34.979]  It's like the big cop bar there in New Orleans.
[00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:39.342]  Just so people know, NOPD is New Orleans Police Department, just for people who know.
[00:15:39.342 --> 00:15:41.543]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:15:41.543 --> 00:15:45.266]  So, a lot of those cops were then just total rogue.
[00:15:45.266 --> 00:15:50.249]  I mean, we saw a video of some of them going in and looting retail stores and things like that, but they were raping women down there?
[00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:52.195]  Definitely raping women.
[00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:56.557]  We've got two separate women that came to our company alone.
[00:15:56.557 --> 00:16:00.219]  And when I was there, I met cats from the California Guard, Indiana Guard, you name it.
[00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:03.581]  Everybody was there.
[00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:04.961]  It was just a free-for-all.
[00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:06.262]  Police from all over the country.
[00:16:06.262 --> 00:16:09.904]  Dallas County, Dallas, Texas, Harris down there.
[00:16:09.904 --> 00:16:16.407]  How did you and your team justify to yourselves and each other that gun confiscation would help this situation when it was a free-for-all?
[00:16:16.407 --> 00:16:19.729]  I mean, isn't that a time when citizens need to be able to defend themselves?
[00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:24.093]  It never, you know, like I said, I was just ignorant as hell.
[00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:29.234]  And that's kind of something that I worry about with the kids today, you know, if they really realize what they're doing.
[00:16:29.234 --> 00:16:30.534]  You know, I had no idea.
[00:16:30.534 --> 00:16:38.196]  The only time it ever occurred to me that something may be wrong is, we came up, we were down by the old French district, we came up to this man's house.
[00:16:38.196 --> 00:16:40.977]  He had a big wooden sign that says, I'm here alone.
[00:16:42.063 --> 00:16:44.084]  With my dog and my shotgun.
[00:16:44.084 --> 00:16:44.864]  Looters beware.
[00:16:44.864 --> 00:16:48.045]  We thought it was funny everyone stopped and took pictures of the sign.
[00:16:48.045 --> 00:16:50.386]  But eventually we took his guns.
[00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:53.247]  And we left him there with nothing.
[00:16:53.247 --> 00:17:02.350]  So now that you know what you know, now that you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and you're informed, what would you advise people to do if this happens again?
[00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.431]  That's why I called.
[00:17:06.648 --> 00:17:09.390]  No offense, I mean, Mike, we love everything you do.
[00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.831]  I'm a big fan of the Health Ranger.
[00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:16.696]  I was hoping to get ahold of Alex for the fact that, what do you do when they stack right?
[00:17:16.696 --> 00:17:17.456]  You know what I mean?
[00:17:17.456 --> 00:17:18.497]  Yeah.
[00:17:18.497 --> 00:17:19.898]  And they're prepped to come into the home.
[00:17:19.898 --> 00:17:23.081]  There's no negotiating with us, trust me.
[00:17:23.081 --> 00:17:24.342]  There was no negotiating.
[00:17:24.342 --> 00:17:24.942]  Yeah.
[00:17:24.942 --> 00:17:25.983]  If you resisted, you died.
[00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:26.623]  That were the orders.
[00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:28.525]  You go for Gunner, you die.
[00:17:29.724 --> 00:17:32.706]  Yeah, but well, I mean, this is invaluable information.
[00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:35.267]  I apologize, we only have a limited time here.
[00:17:35.267 --> 00:17:36.888]  I gotta let you go.
[00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:39.929]  Just we've got so much more coming up here, but fascinating.
[00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:43.471]  I hope you call back and get to Alex as well.
[00:17:43.471 --> 00:17:50.595]  I'll pass on this conversation to Alex and let him know, but that's some frightening information.
[00:17:50.595 --> 00:17:52.696]  And I just hope that the military
[00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:57.118]  The members of the military say no.
[00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:05.261]  They refuse to engage in gun confiscation because, no doubt, there could be outbreaks of violence and a lot of needless death and bloodshed if that happens.
[00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:06.801]  But thank you for your call, Chris.
[00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:08.142]  That's very concerning.
[00:18:08.974 --> 00:18:10.615]  It was traumatic.
[00:18:10.615 --> 00:18:16.836]  All of a sudden, they were banging on the front door, the side door, and the back door.
[00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:18.537]  And they said, let us in.
[00:18:18.537 --> 00:18:20.338]  I'm saying, look at all my food.
[00:18:20.338 --> 00:18:22.218]  I got plenty of food.
[00:18:22.218 --> 00:18:28.240]  They kept pushing me back, pushing me back, and ended up like this.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.482]  Then, Patty showed them a small revolver she was carefully holding in the palm of her hand.
[00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:37.803]  A camera crew was there to capture what unfolded next.
[00:18:40.914 --> 00:18:43.401]  I said, it's not even loaded!
[00:18:43.401 --> 00:18:46.869]  And I dropped it on the floor.
[00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:48.734]  Well, they punched me in the face.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.701]  Look at my black and blue merch.
[00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:55.302]  Look at... You said guns will be taken.
[00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.322]  No one will... Okay, wow.
[00:18:56.322 --> 00:18:56.722]  There you go.
[00:18:56.722 --> 00:19:07.346]  The footage, a compilation from InfoWars Nightly News, put together from mainstream media sources, plus our interview yesterday with Chris from Oklahoma, who we want to encourage to call back in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.647]  Plus, we're going to be taking calls later during the show.
[00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:10.067]  And by the way,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.902]  I mean, I am just emotionally hit by all this as well.
[00:19:18.902 --> 00:19:37.214]  When you see this going on, that woman that they just showed just had a revolver to protect herself from looters or home invasion and they punch her in the face, they throw her against the wall and take her gun and leave her there defenseless in a situation where the looters are running rampant.
[00:19:37.214 --> 00:19:37.995]  This is America?
[00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:39.556]  I mean, it is!
[00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:52.369]  This is Chicago, this is New York, this is everywhere that the citizens are being left defenseless and the murder rate is soaring even without a natural disaster, even without some kind of a false flag attack going on.
[00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.252]  Imagine what's going to happen when it really hits the fan.
[00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:56.933]  Much more straight ahead.
[00:19:56.933 --> 00:19:58.435]  Stay with us on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.581]  For more than six years, I've talked on the air about creating a social network.

[00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:45.936]  Organize.
[00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:46.696]  Take action.

[00:20:48.357 --> 00:20:49.218]  Contribute.
[00:20:49.218 --> 00:20:49.958]  Resist.
[00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.720]  Because resistance is victory.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.401]  You are victory.

[00:23:25.847 --> 00:23:37.476]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:37.476 --> 00:23:44.561]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:48.484]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:48.644 --> 00:23:49.485]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.485 --> 00:23:50.526]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:50.866]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:50.866 --> 00:23:51.187]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:06.892 --> 00:24:10.295]  Alright, InfoWarriors, start your engines.
[00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:14.398]  We've got a document for you to go out and search if you're not already familiar with it.
[00:24:14.398 --> 00:24:17.841]  It's called the State Department Publication 7277.
[00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:18.522]  You got that?
[00:24:18.522 --> 00:24:18.822]  7277.
[00:24:18.822 --> 00:24:20.904]  Alex talked about that on the Sunday Show.
[00:24:25.968 --> 00:24:32.110]  And this is the complete disarmament of the world, laid out point by point.
[00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:39.252]  This is a strategy, it's called Freedom From War, and it goes back to September of 1961.
[00:24:39.252 --> 00:24:48.155]  And it is upon this document that the current discussions of the United Nations and its treaty for small arms disarmament, registration, confiscation, and so on, is based.
[00:24:48.735 --> 00:24:51.777]  So this has been an agenda going on for a very long time.
[00:24:51.777 --> 00:25:03.323]  The truth is, look, no matter what you think about your neighbor owning a firearm or you owning one, the point is the United States Second Amendment is unique in all the world.
[00:25:03.323 --> 00:25:09.607]  Just like the Bill of Rights, as a sacred, almost a divinely inspired document, is unique in the world.
[00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:12.448]  And they want to destroy it.
[00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:17.391]  The globalists want to destroy the Bill of Rights, and Obama's doing a good job for them.
[00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.173]  Really, really obedient puppet to get that job done.
[00:25:21.161 --> 00:25:29.808]  And of course there are other puppets standing in line to do it for them, but they're trying to destroy every right, every freedom, every liberty that we have in America today.
[00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:40.858]  Now, we opened up the phone lines for callers who were engaged in the military, or even National Guard would also qualify, who were engaged in gun confiscation.
[00:25:41.198 --> 00:25:41.278]  Yeah.
[00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:14.977]  Who was inside, GlaxoSmithKline, who's joining us at the bottom of the next hour, about an hour from now, with incredible details about bribery of physicians, off-label marketing, violations of law, fraud, you name it.
[00:26:14.977 --> 00:26:18.619]  It's a big breaking story right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:22.981]  Now, I want to go to a caller right now because of the video we just played that last segment.
[00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.443]  We've got Charles in Louisiana joining us.
[00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:27.223]  You're on the air, Charles.
[00:26:27.223 --> 00:26:28.184]  Go ahead, welcome to the show.
[00:26:29.485 --> 00:26:31.686]  Yes, I was reporting every day.
[00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:34.787]  I was from New Orleans to Alex on a show.
[00:26:34.787 --> 00:26:34.887]  Yes.
[00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:36.168]  I was down there.
[00:26:36.168 --> 00:26:37.929]  But let me explain something to you.
[00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:43.891]  When they would take the guns away from the people, people, they wouldn't go back to the 9th Ward because they would fight.
[00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:45.852]  And they would run the police out.
[00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:49.694]  Then they would come at night and rape the women and knowing they didn't have guns.
[00:26:49.694 --> 00:26:49.834]  Right.
[00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.535]  Do you understand what I mean?
[00:26:51.535 --> 00:26:51.975]  Exactly.
[00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.011]  And the police, they were busy.
[00:26:55.011 --> 00:26:57.973]  They were busy robbing the jewelry stores.
[00:26:57.973 --> 00:26:58.493]  That's right.
[00:26:58.493 --> 00:26:59.854]  The police was doing that.
[00:26:59.854 --> 00:27:01.455]  I've seen this.
[00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:04.697]  And the men was nothing.
[00:27:04.697 --> 00:27:07.358]  And all these men talk all this bad stuff.
[00:27:07.358 --> 00:27:09.299]  They were shaking when they come there.
[00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:15.383]  But the main thing is after they took them guns, they made themselves victims for the thugs that come up there.
[00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.904]  They would just come into a house and take what they wanted.
[00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:19.285]  Take food, jewelry.
[00:27:19.865 --> 00:27:21.767]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:28.432]  I don't know where the men's are at, but giving these guns up, it's going to be the most awful thing you ever had.
[00:27:28.432 --> 00:27:38.541]  Well, this is the important point, Charles, is that if you, sorry to interrupt you, but if you give up your guns now, you can expect to be, that's going to be followed up by a police department
[00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:42.903]  Or other people, and by the way, I don't want to say, I mean, not all cops are bad.
[00:27:42.903 --> 00:27:48.225]  I know a lot of law enforcement, mostly they're good people, and they wouldn't engage in this kind of behavior.
[00:27:48.225 --> 00:27:56.849]  But in New Orleans, now we're hearing it from so many places again and again, they went back and they raped those women, and they broke into the houses, and they stole the jewelry like you were just saying.
[00:27:56.849 --> 00:28:02.092]  It happened, and it's time to get out of denial and realize what happens when you give up your Second Amendment in this country.
[00:28:02.092 --> 00:28:02.652]  Go ahead, Charles.
[00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:07.397]  ...and people on the bridge just trying to cross the bridge!
[00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:10.362]  I reported that to Alex as soon as that happened!
[00:28:10.362 --> 00:28:12.707]  They just shot it down like dogs, sir!
[00:28:12.707 --> 00:28:13.328]  We were there!
[00:28:14.383 --> 00:28:15.524]  Yeah, I recognize your voice.
[00:28:15.524 --> 00:28:16.864]  I remember you calling in.
[00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:18.205]  I shot a shot around doors.
[00:28:18.205 --> 00:28:23.567]  And that woman in the Irish Channel, they broke her jaw and beat her up.
[00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:26.268]  She just come with a Bible and a revolver.
[00:28:26.268 --> 00:28:32.531]  And I tell you another thing is, the military, I have no respect after the military, what they did to women.
[00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:35.192]  Show me your breasts for some water.
[00:28:35.192 --> 00:28:36.893]  Show me you're not thirsty.
[00:28:36.893 --> 00:28:38.874]  And the police, they were so bad.
[00:28:38.874 --> 00:28:39.754]  But they're going to take off
[00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:43.537]  The military, they're going to take the guns away from them, and the police too.
[00:28:43.537 --> 00:28:44.618]  And I told them that.
[00:28:44.618 --> 00:28:49.782]  They're going to take your guns away, and then you get... Now, what they're going to do when they take their guns away?
[00:28:49.782 --> 00:28:51.144]  They're going to want to be friends with us?
[00:28:52.057 --> 00:28:57.118]  I mean, isn't that the time when citizens and neighborhoods and communities need to have a common, lawful,
[00:29:12.162 --> 00:29:17.145]  Okay, we've got more callers on the line, a lot more straight ahead, but thank you, Charles, for calling in, and stay with us.
[00:29:17.145 --> 00:29:19.146]  We'll be right back with a lot more straight ahead, right here.
[00:29:49.784 --> 00:29:53.717]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.717 --> 00:29:56.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.841]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:07.445]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:12.449]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.449 --> 00:30:18.033]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:18.033 --> 00:30:22.717]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.237 --> 00:30:30.362]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:31.483]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.483 --> 00:30:38.167]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.167 --> 00:30:41.349]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:41.349 --> 00:30:44.451]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:44.671]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.671 --> 00:30:44.952]  Remember,
[00:30:53.297 --> 00:30:57.200]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.062]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:01.062 --> 00:31:16.551]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.551 --> 00:31:20.234]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:25.295]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[00:31:25.908 --> 00:31:33.990]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your Silver Solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:41.953]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:41.953 --> 00:31:51.516]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lung System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lung System works.

[00:32:00.421 --> 00:32:01.662]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:32:01.662 --> 00:32:03.142]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:32:03.142 --> 00:32:04.042]  The freedom to choose?
[00:32:04.042 --> 00:32:05.003]  The freedom to vote?
[00:32:05.003 --> 00:32:06.003]  The freedom to worship?
[00:32:06.003 --> 00:32:08.224]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:05.230]  Big Brother.
[00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.890]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.291]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:08.291 --> 00:33:09.552]  You want answers?
[00:33:09.552 --> 00:33:11.633]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:16.756]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.104 --> 00:33:23.826]  All right, let me lay it out for you here.
[00:33:23.826 --> 00:33:32.872]  The big issues of the day, we're talking about the gun confiscation that really took place, that it's already part of American history, took place in New Orleans.
[00:33:32.872 --> 00:33:33.453]  It's on the record.
[00:33:33.453 --> 00:33:34.753]  We just showed you the video clips.
[00:33:34.753 --> 00:33:38.056]  I mean, some of those were mainstream media video clips.
[00:33:38.056 --> 00:33:40.117]  We've got people, witnesses firsthand.
[00:33:40.117 --> 00:33:47.923]  You just heard a caller, Charles, who called in, who has actually called in many times in the past, telling us firsthand what he witnessed taking place, the most heinous crimes
[00:33:48.763 --> 00:33:51.204]  The big picture here, and by the way, we've got G. Edward Griffin on the line.
[00:33:51.204 --> 00:33:53.265]  We're going to be joining him in just a second.
[00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:55.066]  We've also got callers on the line.
[00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.647]  We're going to get to you, so please stay on the line.
[00:33:56.647 --> 00:34:03.170]  James in Tennessee with law enforcement, Joe from Georgia, and Tango from Georgia also, so please stay on the line.
[00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.231]  We'll get to you.
[00:34:04.231 --> 00:34:13.995]  The big picture here is, look, I know that Alex and myself both would rather be here talking about the spiritual connection with
[00:34:15.677 --> 00:34:28.135]  The great, the creative forces of the universe, the creativity and the beauty of the world and human achievement and, you know, actually positive outcomes for the future of humanity.
[00:34:28.135 --> 00:34:30.478]  We would rather focus on that.
[00:34:30.478 --> 00:34:31.239]  But the truth is...
[00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:49.112]  When you've got gun confiscation taking place, when you've got an oppressive world government that's trying to take away your liberties, then you have to pay attention to that because you are not going to solve that problem by sitting in a room, let's say, and just meditating.
[00:34:49.112 --> 00:34:59.594]  You know, the gun confiscation, the Federal Reserve, the printing of currency, the stealing of your economic prosperity, the taking away of your rights, these things are real.
[00:35:00.134 --> 00:35:06.716]  And even though we don't want to dwell on them, because we don't want to stay in that area, we do have to beat them.
[00:35:06.716 --> 00:35:16.100]  We have to achieve victory as info warriors, as defenders of liberty and life and love and truth and all that is good in the world and even in the universe.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.120]  I mean, we have to
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.200]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.127 --> 00:35:45.589]  After taking the guns away from the family so they were defenseless.
[00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:46.569]  So it's real.
[00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:49.631]  We can't live in denial if we hope to achieve greatness.
[00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:51.252]  We have to beat the tyrants.
[00:35:51.252 --> 00:35:52.653]  We have to restore liberty.
[00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:59.437]  And that's the only way that we can actually achieve greatness as human civilization and protect the future for our own children and grandchildren as well.
[00:36:00.501 --> 00:36:04.224]  Now with more comments on that, big picture view is of course Ed Griffin.
[00:36:04.224 --> 00:36:07.947]  He is really one of the pioneers of the Liberty Movement.
[00:36:07.947 --> 00:36:10.909]  Realityzone.com is one of his websites.
[00:36:10.909 --> 00:36:15.512]  He joins us now by phone with his comments on what's happening in the world today.
[00:36:15.512 --> 00:36:18.795]  Ed, thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:36:18.795 --> 00:36:19.976]  What's on your mind today?
[00:36:20.336 --> 00:36:22.738]  Well, thanks a lot, Mike, for inviting me.
[00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:23.799]  What's on my mind?
[00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:27.442]  Well, I feel rather schizophrenic this morning.
[00:36:27.442 --> 00:36:30.465]  Everything at once is all on my mind, somewhat like you.
[00:36:30.465 --> 00:36:39.552]  I appreciated your comments that we would rather focus on the more pleasant aspects of life, but the reality is in your face, as you said.
[00:36:39.552 --> 00:36:41.454]  Good analogy.
[00:36:41.454 --> 00:36:43.456]  While you were saying that, it reminded me of the
[00:36:44.656 --> 00:36:52.899]  The fellow that was on death row in prison and he was sentenced to be electrocuted in the morning or hung, let's just say hung.
[00:36:52.899 --> 00:36:55.660]  And he wasn't very happy about the idea.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.681]  He was in his cell.
[00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:57.741]  He was dejected.
[00:36:57.741 --> 00:37:00.522]  This was the end of his life and everything.
[00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:04.904]  And the guy in the cell across the way said, what's the matter?
[00:37:04.904 --> 00:37:06.364]  Why are you looking so dejected?
[00:37:06.364 --> 00:37:09.025]  And he said, well, I'm going to die here in a few hours.
[00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:09.866]  They're going to hang me.
[00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.165]  And so the other fellas said, well, look at the bright side.
[00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:15.090]  You still have your health.
[00:37:16.727 --> 00:37:19.228]  Oh my, a little gallows humor there.
[00:37:19.228 --> 00:37:22.688]  That's kind of how I feel because sometimes people say, oh, you're so negative.
[00:37:22.688 --> 00:37:24.269]  You're always talking about these bad things.
[00:37:24.269 --> 00:37:26.769]  Why don't you look at the bright side, you know?
[00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:29.890]  I'm so tired of hearing that from people.
[00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.651]  It's like, what, if your neighbor's house is burning down, you shouldn't tell them?
[00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:34.971]  You shouldn't call 911?
[00:37:34.971 --> 00:37:36.092]  Just let it burn down?
[00:37:36.092 --> 00:37:36.812]  Don't be negative?
[00:37:36.812 --> 00:37:38.852]  Don't tell the truth about something bad happening?
[00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:39.633]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:40.733]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:43.073]  I call it the Jiminy Cricket mentality.
[00:37:43.073 --> 00:37:45.334]  You know the song, if you wish upon a star,
[00:37:46.074 --> 00:37:49.476]  No matter where you are, it'll all come true if you just wish, wish, wish.
[00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:59.942]  And we kind of teach that to kids, that if you're good, and you're pure, and your intentions are correct, and, you know, everything will work out just fine because you're good.
[00:37:59.942 --> 00:38:04.044]  Well, the fact of the matter is, we live in a world where there are a lot of people who are not so good.
[00:38:04.736 --> 00:38:11.826]  And as a matter of fact, the criminal mentality tends to gravitate into positions of power.
[00:38:11.826 --> 00:38:15.390]  Government power in particular, because they figured it out a long time ago.
[00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.732]  Why should you fight the government when you
[00:38:18.345 --> 00:38:18.805]  Absolutely.
[00:38:18.805 --> 00:38:22.508]  And what are you seeing in terms of the trending of criminality?
[00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:38.118]  Because one of the trends that's becoming very obvious to InfoWarriors and all of us who fight for liberty is that in the last even just five years, there seems to be an acceleration of just the outright criminality, thuggishness of government.
[00:38:38.118 --> 00:38:40.960]  Not just federal, but I mean at local levels too.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.401]  Look at California.
[00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:43.302]  Look at Chicago.
[00:38:43.302 --> 00:38:46.944]  Well, I guess Chicago has always been steeped in corruption and criminality.
[00:38:46.944 --> 00:38:48.065]  But is it really getting worse?
[00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:53.288]  Well, yes it is, because I think there's almost a mathematical relationship here.
[00:38:53.288 --> 00:39:07.516]  This is a social event happening, but I think there's a lot of mathematics in it, in the sense that the reason that all governments eventually evolve into criminal syndicates is because we give them power.
[00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:09.257]  And power is a magnet.
[00:39:09.257 --> 00:39:13.560]  Power is a magnet that attracts the criminal mentality, the predator class.
[00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:23.205]  And so the more power we give to government, the more inevitable it becomes that that magnet gets stronger and attracts more and more of the predator class.
[00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:32.088]  And finally, we just have basically a government that we thought was of the people gradually evolved into a criminal syndicate.
[00:39:32.088 --> 00:39:34.489]  So, yes, there's a mathematical relationship.
[00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:39.951]  The more power we give to government, the more we create a criminal environment.
[00:39:40.455 --> 00:39:43.678]  Well yeah, look at the UN, where you have total diplomatic immunity.
[00:39:43.678 --> 00:39:47.842]  So anywhere that you have total immunity, you get complete and utter corruption.
[00:39:47.842 --> 00:39:48.422]  Of course.
[00:39:48.422 --> 00:39:49.543]  Runaway criminality.
[00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:51.045]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:39:51.045 --> 00:39:58.471]  Once people connect the dots and realize that there's a cause for this criminality, it's not just because it happened that way.
[00:39:58.471 --> 00:39:59.392]  There's a cause.
[00:39:59.392 --> 00:40:03.196]  It's that relationship between the power that we tolerate
[00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.258]  Uh, government having.
[00:40:05.258 --> 00:40:19.153]  In fact, we often become, when I say we, I mean the people in general, not you and me, of course, but, uh, in general, the population has been conditioned to think that no matter what problems we have in society, the solution is to give more power to the government.
[00:40:19.153 --> 00:40:20.975]  And so we create this environment.
[00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:25.179]  We are creating ourselves, creating this, uh, this magnet for the criminal class.
[00:40:26.084 --> 00:40:28.745]  Well, what do you think about the gun confiscation issue?
[00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:52.017]  I don't know if you heard the last segment, but it's rising up again because of this UN treaty being negotiated that would potentially, and this was written up right in Forbes magazine in fact, which typically doesn't reveal this much information about what's really going on, but it could potentially result in gun registration, confiscation of legal firearms, basically a total disarmament of the US population.
[00:40:52.937 --> 00:40:58.441]  Of course, they deny that that's what the treaty would do, but if you read between the lines, that's what it actually could do.
[00:40:58.441 --> 00:41:00.703]  What are your thoughts on that issue, Ed Griffin?
[00:41:00.703 --> 00:41:02.404]  Well, that pretty well summarizes it.
[00:41:02.404 --> 00:41:03.224]  They do deny it.
[00:41:03.224 --> 00:41:07.507]  They always deny the negative consequences of their programs.
[00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:12.151]  They like to talk about their measures in glowing terms.
[00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:14.032]  They don't call it gun-free.
[00:41:14.952 --> 00:41:23.592]  Confiscation or gun control, you know, they call it a disarmament, reducing crime and they like put things like, you know, crime reduction programs.
[00:41:25.728 --> 00:41:33.631]  Well of course, but of course the greatest armed criminals, I should say the most severe, the worst armed criminals, are the government themselves.
[00:41:33.631 --> 00:41:37.813]  Just look at history, look at democide figures of death by government.
[00:41:37.813 --> 00:41:53.239]  So, I think what the mainstream people are missing is that it's not gun disarmament, it is a movement of all firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens into the hands of the most centralized, corrupt, power-hungry groups of all, which is government.
[00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:55.640]  That's the message that doesn't get through to people.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:02.083]  Yeah, because the media and the confiscators are always talking about criminals.
[00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:07.886]  They're always talking about taking guns away from criminals and, you know, reducing accidental deaths and injuries.
[00:42:07.886 --> 00:42:09.146]  That's the total focus.
[00:42:09.146 --> 00:42:11.947]  That's the limits of the debate.
[00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:15.529]  No one's allowed to discuss the real purpose of the Second Amendment.
[00:42:15.529 --> 00:42:21.612]  The Second Amendment was not added to the Constitution by our forefathers to protect the citizens against crime.
[00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:26.793]  It was added there for one purpose, and that's to protect them from totalitarian government.
[00:42:26.793 --> 00:42:27.414]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:27.414 --> 00:42:28.255]  Their own government.
[00:42:28.255 --> 00:42:39.286]  They were leery that their own government might someday become tyrannical, and so therefore they said, the people must be armed so that the people will have the ultimate control over their own government.
[00:42:42.281 --> 00:42:45.763]  Well, maybe we should support disarmament of the government.
[00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:47.344]  I mean, we should.
[00:42:47.344 --> 00:42:57.391]  But, you know, hey, I'd be, I'd feel a lot safer with firearms in the hands of sheriffs and sheriff's deputies all across the country and not in the hands of, let's say, some renegade ATF agents.
[00:42:57.391 --> 00:43:01.814]  Not that they're all bad, but there are a lot of renegade ATF agents out there.
[00:43:01.814 --> 00:43:02.294]  But how about this?
[00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:05.216]  Are you willing to take a call from a police officer who's on the line?
[00:43:05.216 --> 00:43:05.877]  Why, sure.
[00:43:05.877 --> 00:43:06.157]  All right.
[00:43:06.157 --> 00:43:08.659]  Let's go to James in Tennessee Law Enforcement.
[00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:11.641]  James, you're on the air here with Mike Adams and Ed Griffin.
[00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:12.041]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:43:13.182 --> 00:43:13.462]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:13.462 --> 00:43:14.443]  How are y'all doing today?
[00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:15.143]  Doing good.
[00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:16.724]  What's on your mind?
[00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:22.148]  Well, you made a statement earlier about the police officers not being bad, and I think that's pretty much common knowledge.
[00:43:22.148 --> 00:43:26.532]  There shouldn't be any way in that you know that I happen to have been in for a while.
[00:43:26.532 --> 00:43:36.099]  I'm not as old as some of the guys that I work with, but most of your younger guys are the ones that are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and coming into the police forces and sheriff's departments.
[00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:41.603]  You know, they have programmed these guys, and not all of them, but I ran into a few in
[00:43:43.802 --> 00:43:50.166]  So what are you saying?
[00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:59.993]  That they come back with a mindset of just do anything and kill and it's like they can't think for themselves?
[00:43:59.993 --> 00:44:00.534]  What exactly?
[00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:02.075]  How does that look to you when you see these guys?
[00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:23.452]  Well, you know, it's really weird because, you know, being raised in a law enforcement slash military family, so to speak, over the years, you see these guys and you think, you know, when I went in, when I got into the business, it was God, family, country, or God, country, family, and that kind of thing.
[00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:29.555]  You want to do good by your fellow citizens and your brothers and sisters, and that seems to be missing.
[00:44:29.555 --> 00:44:32.357]  That seems to be the element that's missing is just a compassion.
[00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:36.205]  You know, they've been desensitized, I guess you might say, to killing.
[00:44:36.205 --> 00:44:37.765]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:44:37.765 --> 00:44:44.286]  And not that they're all wrong in saying that, but you can pick up on those little nuances when you get into certain situations.
[00:44:44.286 --> 00:44:52.628]  You know, they may be a little quicker to shoot than, you know, use the .40 caliber on their hip instead of a Taser or something of that nature.
[00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:56.188]  I've seen it in different places, not just where I'm at.
[00:44:56.188 --> 00:44:58.269]  Okay, good points, James.
[00:44:58.269 --> 00:44:59.289]  Thank you for your call.
[00:44:59.289 --> 00:45:00.789]  Ed, your comments on that caller?
[00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.212]  Well, yes, that's been my observation, too.
[00:45:03.212 --> 00:45:06.314]  Of course, I was in the military.
[00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:12.078]  Fortunately, I was never called upon to go into actual combat, but I was kind of braced for it.
[00:45:12.078 --> 00:45:18.242]  And I can recall at the time that I had actually gone through basic training
[00:45:19.088 --> 00:45:22.851]  To condition my mind to follow orders, not to question anything.
[00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:25.313]  And of course, that's necessary in any military.
[00:45:25.313 --> 00:45:26.554]  I realize that.
[00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:29.577]  But I was prepared that if somebody said, see that group over there?
[00:45:29.577 --> 00:45:30.998]  That's the enemy.
[00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:32.299]  Go kill them.
[00:45:32.299 --> 00:45:35.502]  I was prepared to say, well, my officers said that's the enemy.
[00:45:36.232 --> 00:45:38.033]  My orders are to go kill the enemy.
[00:45:38.033 --> 00:45:43.316]  That's the patriotic thing to do, because I'm fighting for my country and my family and everything.
[00:45:43.316 --> 00:45:45.117]  But I was prepared to actually do that.
[00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:51.000]  Of course, I didn't know nothing, as they say, at the time of what really was going on in the world.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.063]  I was there because I love my country, and that was the patriotic thing to do.
[00:45:57.063 --> 00:46:03.646]  But now, in retrospect, I'm a lot older, and I've seen that there are hidden agendas quite often behind wars.
[00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.884]  And even hidden agendas behind local police action.
[00:46:07.884 --> 00:46:08.104]  Sure.
[00:46:08.104 --> 00:46:10.193]  There are sometimes hidden agendas down at the local...
[00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:13.832]  Well, Ed, let me ask you this question.
[00:46:13.832 --> 00:46:17.073]  What about the pharmaceutical influence on these young minds?
[00:46:17.073 --> 00:46:24.354]  Because this is the first generation of soldiers that is actually deployed with mandatory mind-altering drugs.
[00:46:24.354 --> 00:46:32.396]  And I know you're well-versed on Big Pharma and the cancer cover-ups, the cancer industry, corruption, things like that.
[00:46:32.396 --> 00:46:40.017]  Do you think that their minds are being rewired, literally, with the chemicals that they're now being given on deployment?
[00:46:40.017 --> 00:46:40.637]  Well, I don't think that
[00:46:42.178 --> 00:46:49.203]  I think it's just an extension of the mind conditioning that was done through training.
[00:46:49.203 --> 00:46:57.750]  In the old days, it was just done through exposure, training, repetition, and mental programs, educational programs, whatever you want to call them.
[00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:10.519]  But now, they've added the element of drugs themselves, and gosh, it's a frightening thing, because I know that most of these shootings that we find in schools, they're done
[00:47:11.326 --> 00:47:12.047]  I don't think so.
[00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:46.557]  Well, it's not unusual today for a soldier to be on six different pharmaceuticals during active duty, and you notice sometimes when they go crazy and they kill a bunch of civilians out there in a local village, those people are almost always on psychotropic drugs, and usually sometimes half a dozen, like a chemical cocktail.
[00:47:46.557 --> 00:47:57.365]  But you gotta think, maybe they come back and they are so detached that they can't even see what they're doing to their own brothers and sisters, their own neighbors in their own country anymore.
[00:47:57.365 --> 00:47:57.546]  Right.
[00:47:59.767 --> 00:48:03.570]  They're incapable of coming to independent judgment.
[00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:04.631]  They've been trained to do that.
[00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:05.872]  They've been conditioned to do that.
[00:48:05.872 --> 00:48:10.956]  I fear those people, but I also feel sorry for them.
[00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:18.762]  Nevertheless, if they're ordered to come over and pick you and me up and throw us in the truck and take us out wherever we have to go,
[00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:21.709]  They would absolutely do that.
[00:48:21.709 --> 00:48:24.991]  Let's go to another caller who's on the line, and I'll ask for your comments.
[00:48:24.991 --> 00:48:27.452]  Tango from Georgia.
[00:48:27.452 --> 00:48:27.792]  U.S.
[00:48:27.792 --> 00:48:31.053]  Army is the designation I'm getting here.
[00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:32.834]  Tango, go ahead, please.
[00:48:32.834 --> 00:48:33.614]  You're on the show.
[00:48:33.614 --> 00:48:35.815]  What's on your mind?
[00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:38.496]  Well, thanks for taking my call, first of all.
[00:48:38.496 --> 00:48:41.678]  One thing I did want to touch on real quick is sort of on subject.
[00:48:44.286 --> 00:48:48.570]  When you join any military service in this country, you take an oath.
[00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:52.212]  And it's an oath that I think these kids nowadays need to remember.
[00:48:52.212 --> 00:48:57.757]  You take an oath to protect the people of the United States and the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:48:57.757 --> 00:49:00.939]  And that's something that I take very seriously.
[00:49:00.939 --> 00:49:05.423]  When I was, you know, first in, it really didn't hit me as hard as it did when I was out.
[00:49:07.461 --> 00:49:12.527]  I battled with depression for about a year once I got out from the withdrawal from the drugs you all were just talking about.
[00:49:12.527 --> 00:49:15.730]  I was suicidal for a long time.
[00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.954]  But I'm over that now and I'm trying to get the word out there.
[00:49:18.954 --> 00:49:28.625]  I also worked for a security company just recently and this is to touch on another subject about the TSA outsourcing to private security companies.
[00:49:29.754 --> 00:49:32.317]  Uh, that just happened to the company that I worked for.
[00:49:32.317 --> 00:49:33.839]  I just quit yesterday.
[00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:38.103]  I told my boss outright that it was against my moral compass to do such a thing.
[00:49:38.103 --> 00:49:41.287]  Wow, you're rare then because most people just go along with the tyranny.
[00:49:42.478 --> 00:49:43.298]  Absolutely not.
[00:49:43.298 --> 00:49:48.020]  No, I've been... I'm over it, man.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.681]  I'm ready to take up arms, to be honest with you.
[00:49:50.681 --> 00:50:01.784]  And I hope there are a lot of other ex-soldiers out there just like me who are ready to do the same and fight for this country and for the ideals that the Founding Fathers tried to instill.
[00:50:01.784 --> 00:50:04.305]  But, I mean, I've also been witness... I mean, I was stationed at Fort Benning.
[00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:08.566]  I've been witness to these drills that y'all are talking about, the weapons confiscation drills.
[00:50:08.566 --> 00:50:09.347]  I've been witness to
[00:50:11.104 --> 00:50:18.230]  Well, I haven't had that first-hand experience in the military, but I know it goes on.
[00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:21.853]  And yeah, so the impact is on the young soldier that's being recruited and he's being told that he's
[00:50:38.152 --> 00:50:40.774]  He's serving his country by learning how to do these things.
[00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:42.016]  He's impressed by that.
[00:50:42.016 --> 00:50:44.237]  He gets a paycheck, and he does his job well.
[00:50:44.237 --> 00:50:46.740]  He gets a medal for his, uh, career on his chest.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.141]  All right, we gotta go to break here, Ed.
[00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:49.322]  What else is there?
[00:50:49.322 --> 00:50:50.623]  Stay with us, please.
[00:50:50.623 --> 00:50:59.070]  More continuing straight ahead on here on the Alex Jones Show with Ed Griffin and Pauls of Military and Law Enforcement with knowledge of gun confiscation.
[00:50:59.070 --> 00:50:59.471]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.902 --> 00:51:02.123]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:02.123 --> 00:51:03.625]  What does freedom mean to you?
[00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:04.505]  The freedom to choose?
[00:51:04.505 --> 00:51:05.466]  The freedom to vote?
[00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:06.447]  The freedom to worship?
[00:51:06.447 --> 00:51:08.669]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[00:51:08.669 --> 00:51:14.135]  My friends at eFoodsDirect are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:05.044]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[00:52:05.044 --> 00:52:08.087]  I want you to know some very important information.
[00:52:08.087 --> 00:52:17.055]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[00:52:17.055 --> 00:52:21.959]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:45.934]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[00:52:45.934 --> 00:52:49.536]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[00:52:56.801 --> 00:52:58.082]  Protect your immune system.

[00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:02.986]  Do you fear losing your home and being on the street?
[00:53:02.986 --> 00:53:04.107]  Can't happen to you?
[00:53:04.107 --> 00:53:05.628]  Well, think again.
[00:53:05.628 --> 00:53:10.032]  Millions of honest, hard-working Americans have had their homes stolen by the banks.
[00:53:10.032 --> 00:53:11.413]  There is an answer.
[00:53:11.413 --> 00:53:14.415]  The answer is MortgageEndgame.com.
[00:53:14.415 --> 00:53:18.779]  Yes, MortgageEndgame.com is the only long-term solution.

[00:53:24.523 --> 00:53:27.826]  The banks have created a massive fraud to make you a renter for life.
[00:53:28.226 --> 00:53:29.287]  Paid off your home?
[00:53:29.287 --> 00:53:31.590]  Forget about getting your original paperwork.
[00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.312]  On time every month with your payments?
[00:53:33.312 --> 00:53:34.433]  It doesn't matter.
[00:53:34.433 --> 00:53:38.077]  Your title is likely clouded and nobody knows who owns your home.

[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.862]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:06.862 --> 00:54:11.425]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.425 --> 00:54:16.028]  If you're just joining us, this is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[00:54:16.028 --> 00:54:17.349]  Thanks for continuing with us.
[00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:26.274]  We've got Edward Griffin on the line from RealityZone.com, one of the top freedom fighters and liberty advocates in our world today.
[00:54:26.274 --> 00:54:30.357]  We've had callers who are active duty law enforcement and military.
[00:54:30.837 --> 00:54:31.217]  We're good to go.
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:55:04.337]  The website is LemonadeFreedom.com and this is an attempt to show that selling lemonade from your lemonade stand should not be a crime as it is being increasingly considered by law enforcement all across the country.
[00:55:04.337 --> 00:55:07.057]  Ed Griffin, your thoughts on Lemonade Freedom?
[00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:08.218]  Well, I like the idea.
[00:55:08.218 --> 00:55:13.839]  I like the fact that there's enough indignation out there at the grassroots level for people to even consider that.
[00:55:14.508 --> 00:55:25.475]  But, you know, I have to say that putting yourself out there and saying, come arrest me for selling lemonade, as much as I admire that, I would like to think that people will put in an equal amount of
[00:55:26.599 --> 00:55:50.300]  of effort and time and money to try and re-elect those stupid local politicians that pass ordinances like that and get to the root of the problem, which is it's not that the police are being told to go enforce stupid ordinances, but it's because stupid ordinances have been passed in the first place by collectivists who don't understand what America is all about.
[00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:54.961]  So I always try to go to the source of the problem, not the problem itself.
[00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:57.863]  And the source of the problem is that we're electing the wrong people.
[00:55:57.863 --> 00:55:59.143]  I agree with you, completely agree.
[00:55:59.143 --> 00:56:06.667]  I'm trying to understand, what is the mindset of those who think gun confiscation from citizens is a great idea?
[00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:11.610]  Because let's face it, there's a significant percentage of the country that somehow believes that.
[00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:17.553]  What do they imagine, that when all the people are disarmed, and only the government has all the guns, that they're going to be safer?
[00:56:20.433 --> 00:56:21.094]  They actually do.
[00:56:21.094 --> 00:56:23.475]  I have some personal friends, and I just think the world of them.
[00:56:23.475 --> 00:56:27.258]  They're very nice people, but that's their attitude.
[00:56:27.258 --> 00:56:38.146]  They think every time something happens, there's an accident, a little child gets killed by a gun accidentally, or some shooter goes into a school and kills a bunch of kids.
[00:56:38.146 --> 00:56:42.249]  They focus on that and say, look, you see, the problem there was guns.
[00:56:42.944 --> 00:56:48.785]  If those people didn't have guns, they think, none of these crimes would take place.
[00:56:48.785 --> 00:56:58.127]  They might be right that some crimes might not be committed if there were no guns out there, but there would be more crimes committed if there were no guns out there.
[00:56:58.127 --> 00:57:00.207]  I have a little slogan I've used for years.
[00:57:00.207 --> 00:57:01.707]  You know, guns are dangerous.
[00:57:01.707 --> 00:57:02.968]  People get killed with guns.
[00:57:02.968 --> 00:57:04.648]  You know, guns.
[00:57:04.648 --> 00:57:06.368]  There are accidents with guns.
[00:57:06.368 --> 00:57:07.368]  Guns are very dangerous.
[00:57:07.368 --> 00:57:10.329]  The only thing more dangerous than having guns is not having them.
[00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:20.140]  Well, and also, I love how people who think we should all be disarmed, when they have a problem, when they have an intruder hiding in the bushes outside their house, what do they do?
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:24.902]  They pick up the phone to call men with guns to come solve their problem!
[00:57:24.902 --> 00:57:27.483]  You know, I just say, take out the middle man!
[00:57:27.483 --> 00:57:28.503]  Let's do it ourselves!
[00:57:28.503 --> 00:57:32.664]  We're here in Texas, we can defend our own homes against crazy people and looters.
[00:57:32.664 --> 00:57:34.905]  I mean, that's an American right!
[00:57:34.905 --> 00:57:38.846]  Yeah, well, they like to paint people like you and me as some kind of wild...
[00:57:42.524 --> 00:57:57.381]  Yeah, well I've fired a lot of guns when I was in the military, a little practice since I came out, and they kind of jar me a little bit, but I think they're very important for every family to have.
[00:57:57.381 --> 00:57:59.524]  Just a great equalizer, as they say.
[00:58:00.168 --> 00:58:08.490]  Well, yeah, this is what gives a 110-pound grandma the ability to stand her ground against a 250-pound thug who wants to steal her purse.
[00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:09.131]  That's right.
[00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:10.931]  It is the great equalizer.
[00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:13.392]  Well, Ed Griffin, I really appreciate you being on the show today.
[00:58:13.392 --> 00:58:15.853]  Ed Griffin from realityzone.com.
[00:58:15.853 --> 00:58:20.534]  Check out his website, folks, to learn more about his philosophies and lots of information.
[00:58:20.534 --> 00:58:22.054]  Ed, great to have you on.
[00:58:22.054 --> 00:58:22.615]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:58:22.615 --> 00:58:23.275]  Okay, thanks a lot, Mike.
[00:58:23.275 --> 00:58:23.775]  Talk to you later.
[00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.634]  Yeah, you bet.
[00:58:25.634 --> 00:58:27.895]  Great freedom champion right there, folks.
[00:58:27.895 --> 00:58:29.576]  There goes Ed Griffin.
[00:58:29.576 --> 00:58:36.918]  And we'll be back here on the Alex Jones Show, a lot more straight ahead, including an interview with a big pharma whistleblower in the next hour.
[00:58:36.918 --> 00:58:38.338]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
[00:58:38.338 --> 00:58:47.101]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:56.130]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.551]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:58:58.551 --> 00:59:04.255]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[00:59:04.255 --> 00:59:07.657]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:07.657 --> 00:59:11.099]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:12.780]  There's no priming required.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.062]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:59:15.062 --> 00:59:17.563]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:59:18.604 --> 00:59:20.144]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:59:20.144 --> 00:59:21.565]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:59:21.565 --> 00:59:24.725]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:28.106]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:30.006]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[00:59:30.006 --> 00:59:32.247]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:59:32.247 --> 00:59:34.987]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:59:34.987 --> 00:59:36.567]  It's what my family uses.
[00:59:36.567 --> 00:59:39.868]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:45.169]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:59:45.729 --> 00:59:48.810]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:55.891]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.891 --> 01:00:05.313]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:06.634]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.634 --> 01:00:08.394]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.394 --> 01:00:10.154]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.154 --> 01:00:11.755]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.755 --> 01:00:12.495]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.274 --> 01:00:17.475]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.475 --> 01:00:22.936]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:24.857]  We are into the second hour.
[01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:26.557]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:29.698]  Yet again, this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:31.818]  It's an honor and a pleasure to be here.
[01:00:31.818 --> 01:00:33.438]  And it is Tuesday, July 17, 2012.
[01:00:33.438 --> 01:00:40.040]  Just had a great segment with Ed Griffin there and a lot of talk about the gun confiscation
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.663]  That has already taken place in America, and it could take place in the months ahead if anything goes down out of the ordinary.
[01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:49.764]  We've got callers on the line.
[01:00:49.764 --> 01:01:00.528]  If you'd like to join us, we're taking calls today from military and law enforcement personnel who have first-hand knowledge and experience of gun confiscation, either drills or active missions.
[01:01:00.528 --> 01:01:01.088]  And that 800 number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:01.088 --> 01:01:03.989]  Yes, I finally got that memorized after reading it off the sheet for so many times.
[01:01:11.412 --> 01:01:12.092]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:12.092 --> 01:01:21.855]  Now, for some other news, and by the way, straight ahead, well, at the bottom of this hour, we've got that whistleblower who was a former employee of GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:01:21.855 --> 01:01:30.697]  He and his co-worker were the two people who took information to the government that resulted in Glaxo paying a $3 billion fine.
[01:01:30.697 --> 01:01:35.238]  Yes, $3 billion, the largest in the history of medicine.
[01:01:35.738 --> 01:01:37.920]  But here's some other news that might interest you.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.722]  And by the way, we will go to callers in the next segment.
[01:01:40.722 --> 01:01:42.404]  But first, check this out.
[01:01:42.404 --> 01:01:48.389]  The IRS has no legal basis to collect the Affordable Care Act tax.
[01:01:48.389 --> 01:01:50.231]  Obamacare, in other words.
[01:01:50.231 --> 01:01:51.532]  It's all an act.
[01:01:51.532 --> 01:01:54.094]  This is the headline that we've got.
[01:01:54.094 --> 01:01:56.016]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:59.539]  It's a NaturalNews.com story by Ethan Huff.
[01:01:59.539 --> 01:02:01.540]  And the thrust of it is,
[01:02:02.662 --> 01:02:11.408]  That even though the IRS is now put in charge of collecting this penalty, well now they call it a penalty, but of course it's a tax, right?
[01:02:11.408 --> 01:02:16.492]  The IRS has no legal ability to collect this penalty.
[01:02:16.492 --> 01:02:23.617]  And in fact, all they can do is send you threatening letters and try to intimidate you into voluntarily paying it.
[01:02:23.617 --> 01:02:25.058]  How's that for interesting?
[01:02:25.058 --> 01:02:29.782]  I guess some people would argue that the entire income tax is voluntary, but that's probably a whole different show.
[01:02:30.362 --> 01:02:39.969]  In any case, the only way that the IRS can actually get this money from you legally under current law and regulations is to take it out of your withholdings.
[01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:43.511]  In other words, to not send it back to you.
[01:02:43.511 --> 01:02:45.293]  So this is another great reason
[01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:52.377]  To not have the IRS take as much money out of your paycheck every month and then send you back a refund at the end of the year.
[01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:57.380]  Because that's how they can then have leverage over you for the Obamacare penalty.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:02.423]  Now I'm on the record saying that I refuse to participate in this.
[01:03:02.423 --> 01:03:07.466]  I refuse to buy healthcare in the corrupt mafia medical system.
[01:03:08.246 --> 01:03:17.155]  I refuse to pay the IRS this penalty, but I guess they're just gonna probably take it out of my withholdings and there's nothing that I can do about it.
[01:03:17.155 --> 01:03:26.424]  That's the reality that we're facing in America, but I will not voluntarily participate in this corrupt criminal medical system.
[01:03:26.424 --> 01:03:27.606]  That's bottom line.
[01:03:28.206 --> 01:03:35.513]  If they take it out of my filings because I do file taxes, that's a battle that I don't wish to deal with right now.
[01:03:35.513 --> 01:03:38.356]  You know, I'm not a tax protester person.
[01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.397]  So I do pay taxes.
[01:03:39.397 --> 01:03:47.125]  If they take it out, then I guess I just have to write it off as another loss to the corrupt police state for a service that I will never use.
[01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:50.269]  Because I don't go visit doctors.
[01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:52.310]  I'm in perfect health.
[01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:55.151]  Here's my medicine right here.
[01:03:55.151 --> 01:03:55.711]  You see this.
[01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:59.172]  I'm famous for bringing these jars onto the show.
[01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:00.353]  This is my superfood.
[01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:01.933]  This is what I eat.
[01:04:01.933 --> 01:04:06.855]  It's high mineral nutrition, phytonutrients, plant-based nutrition, man.
[01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:08.156]  This is what keeps me going.
[01:04:08.896 --> 01:04:11.958]  This is why I'm healthy, why I don't have diabetes.
[01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:16.421]  Just for those of you who may not know me that well, I used to be borderline diabetic.
[01:04:16.421 --> 01:04:18.382]  Type 2, right on the edge of it.
[01:04:18.382 --> 01:04:20.383]  I used to be borderline obese.
[01:04:20.383 --> 01:04:21.724]  I used to have chronic pain.
[01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:25.066]  I used to have depression and high cholesterol, all those things.
[01:04:25.066 --> 01:04:27.088]  That was like, I don't know, 12 years ago now.
[01:04:27.808 --> 01:04:29.089]  And how did I get healthy and stayed healthy?
[01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:30.250]  It's nutrition.
[01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:31.451]  It wasn't doctors.
[01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.512]  It wasn't Obama's health care system.
[01:04:33.512 --> 01:04:34.533]  It wasn't vaccines.
[01:04:34.533 --> 01:04:38.857]  I haven't been vaccinated in, well, over 20 years maybe now.
[01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:40.618]  I don't know the exact number.
[01:04:40.618 --> 01:04:42.980]  And I wish I was never vaccinated, frankly.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:48.584]  But, you know, if God wanted us to have vaccines, he wouldn't have given us an immune system.
[01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:49.585]  Right?
[01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:49.945]  Right.
[01:04:49.945 --> 01:04:50.445]  A lot more.

[01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.591]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:07:01.591 --> 01:07:03.092]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:07:03.092 --> 01:07:03.992]  The freedom to choose?
[01:07:03.992 --> 01:07:04.953]  The freedom to vote?
[01:07:04.953 --> 01:07:05.954]  The freedom to worship?
[01:07:05.954 --> 01:07:08.175]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[01:07:08.175 --> 01:07:13.659]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[01:08:03.892 --> 01:08:06.654]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.542]  We are well into the second hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:17.664]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, editor of NaturalNews.com filling in today.
[01:08:17.664 --> 01:08:22.386]  And of course, we're at the InfoWars.com studios here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:22.386 --> 01:08:23.766]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:27.988]  It's always great to be here and to reach out to you with all this incredible information.
[01:08:27.988 --> 01:08:29.729]  I always love InfoWars callers, too.
[01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:31.190]  They're so well-informed.
[01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:38.616]  You know, if there's anywhere that I would want to just hang out with really cool people, it would be at an InfoWars event.
[01:08:38.616 --> 01:08:41.559]  Because I know you could just talk to people about reality.
[01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:46.403]  You know, you don't have to deal with delusions, you don't have to deal with people who are uninformed.
[01:08:46.403 --> 01:08:48.265]  It's just talking about reality.
[01:08:48.265 --> 01:08:54.991]  And that's sort of what I left off with there in the last segment, is this quote that I'm fond of saying.
[01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:56.392]  You know, again, if
[01:08:57.393 --> 01:09:01.975]  If God wanted us to take vaccines, he wouldn't have given us an immune system.
[01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:05.036]  A lot of people find that funny, but it's true.
[01:09:05.036 --> 01:09:08.057]  Why do you have an immune system?
[01:09:08.057 --> 01:09:10.638]  Because you're supposed to survive.
[01:09:10.638 --> 01:09:14.940]  You're supposed to have that blueprint for health and vitality.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:21.643]  And you're supposed to feed it right with nutrition, with minerals, with vitamins and nutrients and real food.
[01:09:21.643 --> 01:09:26.565]  Not with GMOs and vaccines and chemicals and hormones and antibiotics and all those things.
[01:09:27.045 --> 01:09:31.450]  I don't mean to segue into health too much, because we've got so much other news here, but it is important.
[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:37.276]  And, by the way, I prepared another quote, and see if we can show that on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:09:37.276 --> 01:09:41.061]  Another quote, because I believe in divine truth, divine rights.
[01:09:41.061 --> 01:09:42.883]  Here's another quote I put together.
[01:09:42.883 --> 01:09:48.168]  If our Creator did not want us to be free, He would not have given us free will.
[01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:55.832]  Now think about that for a minute, and think about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the divine inspiration of those documents.
[01:09:55.832 --> 01:09:59.673]  Why is the First Amendment a divine right?
[01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:03.275]  Why is the Second Amendment a divine right?
[01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:06.076]  You might be asking, whoa, how can that be a divine right?
[01:10:06.496 --> 01:10:07.317]  Well, look around you.
[01:10:07.317 --> 01:10:08.678]  Look around you in nature.
[01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:14.525]  If you go see a cactus plant, for example, that cactus plant has its own Second Amendment rights.
[01:10:14.525 --> 01:10:16.867]  The right to keep and bear spines.
[01:10:16.867 --> 01:10:20.912]  And the spines protect the little cactus plant from predators.
[01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:23.715]  And the spines are nature's way of saying,
[01:10:24.355 --> 01:10:25.716]  Leave me alone.
[01:10:25.716 --> 01:10:30.200]  Let me just grow here in my own space and mind my own business.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.841]  And that is common throughout nature.
[01:10:31.841 --> 01:10:36.104]  You see defenses in plants and animals and so on.
[01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:44.150]  It is a divine truth to have the right to defend yourself, to protect yourself, your family, your children, your community, your neighborhood.
[01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:45.572]  That is a divine right.
[01:10:46.272 --> 01:10:48.955]  It is granted to us by our creator.
[01:10:48.955 --> 01:10:57.945]  It is not something that we have to go begging the king to give us because he feels like we should have it for that day or that week or that year.
[01:10:57.945 --> 01:11:01.108]  It is a divine right and it cannot be taken away from us.
[01:11:01.108 --> 01:11:02.870]  And free speech is the same way.
[01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:05.272]  It's a divine right to have that freedom of expression.
[01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:13.862]  You see that again reflected throughout nature in plants and animals and in just patterns of nature throughout the cosmos.
[01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:19.248]  Freedom of expression is really a reflection of the intent of God and the Creator.
[01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:20.990]  I'm not going to get preachy on you here.
[01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:22.171]  I just want to share that, you know.
[01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:26.336]  There is a divine element behind everything that we do here.
[01:11:26.676 --> 01:11:36.279]  When we talk about freedom of speech, when we talk about the right to defend yourself against aggressors and against violent criminals, those are divine rights.
[01:11:36.279 --> 01:11:39.840]  And we will not give them up, not under any circumstances.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.141]  If you're an info warrior out there and you enjoy the show, remember, we do not give up these rights.
[01:11:45.141 --> 01:11:48.502]  We do not surrender what is divine in our lives.
[01:11:48.502 --> 01:11:50.743]  Oh, they're showing some cactus right there on the screen.
[01:11:50.743 --> 01:11:52.203]  Yes, some succulents.
[01:11:53.164 --> 01:11:53.964]  On screen.
[01:11:53.964 --> 01:11:57.047]  Thank you for that, for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:58.588]  Alright, I want to go to some more callers right now.
[01:11:58.588 --> 01:12:03.512]  I've got tons of other news, but I actually think the callers are more important than this other news right now.
[01:12:03.512 --> 01:12:07.075]  So, the phones are all, wow, okay.
[01:12:07.075 --> 01:12:09.877]  Let's go to Chad in Long Island, former Army.
[01:12:09.877 --> 01:12:13.841]  Chad, thank you for your call, and you're on the show, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:12:13.841 --> 01:12:14.361]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:12:14.361 --> 01:12:15.842]  What's on your mind?
[01:12:15.842 --> 01:12:18.565]  How you doing, Mr. Adams?
[01:12:18.565 --> 01:12:19.545]  I'm doing great.
[01:12:19.545 --> 01:12:20.446]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:12:20.446 --> 01:12:21.167]  Great to hear your voice.
[01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:23.834]  Uh, great to hear you, sir.
[01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:31.198]  One, I just want to say to all the veterans, and all the police, and all the first responders, remember your oath.
[01:12:31.198 --> 01:12:32.659]  That's number one.
[01:12:32.659 --> 01:12:35.220]  Number two, how can you vilify a tool?
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.142]  That's like a carpenter saying a hammer's bad because he hit his hand.
[01:12:39.142 --> 01:12:41.724]  A gun is nothing more than a tool.
[01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:45.066]  It's the person that uses it is evil.
[01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:46.867]  Not the tool itself.
[01:12:46.867 --> 01:12:51.009]  And that's what we need to remember, and we need to instill that in our children, is that
[01:12:51.673 --> 01:12:54.437]  You can't blame tools for all the problems in the world.
[01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.580]  You have to blame the individuals.
[01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:57.317]  That's right.
[01:12:57.317 --> 01:12:58.298]  We've got to have the ethics.
[01:12:58.298 --> 01:12:59.418]  We've got to have the morals.
[01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:05.921]  We have to have that personal responsibility, which is, again, taught in many religions.
[01:13:05.921 --> 01:13:09.423]  It's a code of ethics that makes society more peaceful.
[01:13:09.423 --> 01:13:14.065]  And you're right, that tool can be used to protect life, to defend life.
[01:13:14.065 --> 01:13:16.526]  Why do people think cops carry guns?
[01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.127]  To stop violence.
[01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:25.010]  I mean, that's the way they're trained, to stop the violence, using the threat of force against someone who doesn't have those ethics.
[01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.670]  Would you agree with that?
[01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:40.938]  Oh yes, I definitely would agree with that, and I think that also, we as citizens need to weed out the people that are in authority, that have those guns and use the authority to brutalize and step on the necks of the poor people of this world.
[01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:42.318]  Oh, of course!
[01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:46.539]  Of course, we can't tolerate corruption, we can't tolerate bad cops, absolutely.
[01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:47.219]  Exactly!
[01:13:47.219 --> 01:13:54.180]  I mean, my thing is, I personally believe Mr. Adams, and this is just my personal belief, I think there should be, all across this country,
[01:13:54.815 --> 01:13:55.536]  We're good to go.
[01:14:04.463 --> 01:14:07.325]  It is corruption like you would not believe.
[01:14:07.325 --> 01:14:10.668]  I mean, they have illegal roadblocks all the time.
[01:14:10.668 --> 01:14:16.812]  Meanwhile, you got prostitutes down the street, you got drug dealers down the street, and they do nothing to these people.
[01:14:16.812 --> 01:14:21.316]  But yet, they want to check people's registrations, make sure you got your seatbelt on.
[01:14:21.316 --> 01:14:22.336]  Oh, I know!
[01:14:22.336 --> 01:14:25.579]  Mr. Nanny, Mr. Nanny guards me all the time.
[01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:26.779]  No, think about it.
[01:14:26.779 --> 01:14:28.019]  Like in L.A.
[01:14:28.019 --> 01:14:35.421]  County or Ventura County in California, they use the sheriff's deputies to go out and raid, at gunpoint, the raw milk sellers.
[01:14:35.421 --> 01:14:43.483]  Meanwhile, the drug dealers and the violent criminals down the street are completely unmolested, oftentimes, because there's such a shortage of law enforcement.
[01:14:43.483 --> 01:14:44.323]  Great call, Chad.
[01:14:44.323 --> 01:14:45.643]  Really appreciate your thoughts.
[01:14:45.643 --> 01:14:47.724]  Let's go to Ray in Virginia.
[01:14:47.724 --> 01:14:50.164]  Former Army, is that correct, Ray?
[01:14:50.164 --> 01:14:51.504]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:51.504 --> 01:14:52.245]  Go ahead, please.
[01:14:52.245 --> 01:14:53.045]  What's on your mind?
[01:14:54.682 --> 01:14:56.782]  Okay, Mike, is it?
[01:14:56.782 --> 01:14:59.103]  Yes, yes sir, Mike Adams.
[01:14:59.103 --> 01:15:21.688]  Okay, Mike, I want to kind of chastise you for some of the terminology you use when you're talking about military and police and all that, in the sense that I hear patriots all the time saying that all the cops, military, are not bad, okay?
[01:15:21.688 --> 01:15:23.548]  Yeah, I hear you, go ahead.
[01:15:25.552 --> 01:15:27.914]  Understand something.
[01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:33.038]  The global corporation is here, okay?
[01:15:33.038 --> 01:15:41.484]  And we're simply working for a corporation in any status we have in it, okay, as we live, alright?
[01:15:41.484 --> 01:15:46.929]  And I tell you, there ain't no way you can quit your job.
[01:15:46.929 --> 01:15:53.634]  Like, if you work for IBM and you do a lot of company policy, uh, theoretically you can quit, okay?
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:16:05.385]  But this global corporation, IBM and all these other small companies, you know, whatever, they're just subsidiaries of a global corporation.
[01:16:05.385 --> 01:16:14.350]  What I mean is that I know a lot of law enforcement, I know sheriffs, sheriff's deputies, for example, they have said they will not participate in, for example, gun confiscation.
[01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:19.132]  They have boundaries that are based on their own ethics, their own respect for life and liberty.
[01:16:19.132 --> 01:16:21.293]  I'm not saying, you know, some of them
[01:16:21.613 --> 01:16:23.034]  Okay, let me deal with the word cop or police.
[01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:25.035]  When I was a child, they were still called the peace officers.
[01:16:51.624 --> 01:17:03.250]  Alright, now what would a peace officer, what would you expect from a peace officer if, uh, if you've seen where a situation might get out of control, where some damage could take place, you would expect him to come and restore peace, okay?
[01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.091]  Keep the peace, that's it.
[01:17:05.074 --> 01:17:09.615]  Alright, now, what do you think is, why did they move this thing over into common?
[01:17:09.615 --> 01:17:12.196]  Policemen, they're going to police you, man.
[01:17:12.196 --> 01:17:13.076]  You know?
[01:17:13.076 --> 01:17:14.176]  You know, you're right about that.
[01:17:14.176 --> 01:17:16.617]  We should say police officer, or peace officer.
[01:17:16.617 --> 01:17:17.917]  See, I did it again.
[01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:23.398]  We should say peace officer, and in fact, Alex is good at this, reminding us that they are the servants.
[01:17:23.398 --> 01:17:25.219]  That they serve the people.
[01:17:25.819 --> 01:17:27.640]  You're absolutely right about that point.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.561]  I really appreciate that.
[01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.782]  Peace, officer.
[01:17:29.782 --> 01:17:30.662]  We will keep that in mind.
[01:17:30.662 --> 01:17:31.783]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:31.783 --> 01:17:35.826]  It can be an interesting conversation, but I want to give room to other callers.
[01:17:35.826 --> 01:17:36.847]  But I will keep that in mind.
[01:17:36.847 --> 01:17:37.587]  Peace, officer.
[01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:38.588]  Yes, got it.
[01:17:38.588 --> 01:17:41.450]  Sam in California from the Air Force.
[01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:42.611]  Go ahead, Sam, you're on the air.
[01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:45.093]  Hey, Mike, can you hear me good?
[01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.214]  Yeah, you're coming through just fine.
[01:17:46.214 --> 01:17:46.534]  Go ahead.
[01:17:47.592 --> 01:17:49.313]  Awesome, okay.
[01:17:49.313 --> 01:17:51.794]  One quick comment, and then a very short story.
[01:17:51.794 --> 01:17:53.995]  Hopefully fairly short.
[01:17:53.995 --> 01:17:59.977]  Anyway, if guns kill people, then pencils misspell words, and we should confiscate all the pencils.
[01:17:59.977 --> 01:18:02.258]  Well, pencils can stab people too, so I think you're right.
[01:18:02.258 --> 01:18:03.938]  We should confiscate all pencils.
[01:18:03.938 --> 01:18:05.719]  Especially the sharp ones.
[01:18:05.719 --> 01:18:08.780]  Those are the dangerous ones.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:15.243]  So in 2007, I re-read George Orwell's 1984, because I was seeing things happening that
[01:18:16.378 --> 01:18:20.383]  Reminded me of it, so I figured I should read it again.
[01:18:20.383 --> 01:18:27.211]  Well, it chilled me to the bone because of the parallels I saw with what's going on in our society today.
[01:18:27.211 --> 01:18:34.120]  And then now, since then, it seems like I can't go through a day without listening to some
[01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:40.728]  Radio Show and not hear other people saying the same thing that I saw.
[01:18:40.728 --> 01:18:43.870]  That we are now living in George Orwell's 1984.
[01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:44.070]  Yes.
[01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:47.653]  It's not worse.
[01:18:47.653 --> 01:18:49.835]  It's chilling to the bone.
[01:18:49.835 --> 01:18:51.076]  It truly is.
[01:18:51.076 --> 01:18:56.560]  And four years now I've had a feeling in my stomach a lot like Alex says.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.082]  That the worst is yet to come.
[01:18:59.005 --> 01:19:01.567]  Well, you and me both, brother, I feel the same thing.
[01:19:01.567 --> 01:19:11.674]  And, you know, we, being beings who have compassion for other humans, for other, our brothers and sisters all across the planet, we don't want to see bloodshed.
[01:19:11.674 --> 01:19:12.555]  We don't want to see suffering.
[01:19:12.555 --> 01:19:14.856]  We don't want to see loss of freedom.
[01:19:14.856 --> 01:19:15.957]  That's why we're here, man.
[01:19:15.957 --> 01:19:18.439]  That's why we want to see liberty.
[01:19:18.439 --> 01:19:19.380]  We want to see peace.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.601]  We want to see achievement by humanity.
[01:19:21.601 --> 01:19:24.363]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:19:24.363 --> 01:19:24.883]  Yes, we do.
[01:19:24.883 --> 01:19:26.825]  And when I see what's going on in Syria,
[01:19:28.089 --> 01:19:29.451]  And they're doing that in our name?
[01:19:29.451 --> 01:19:32.855]  Makes me sick.
[01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:35.138]  It makes me truly sick.
[01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:35.479]  I cry.
[01:19:36.363 --> 01:19:37.643]  Yeah, it makes me sick, too.
[01:19:37.643 --> 01:19:39.124]  I mean, war is sick.
[01:19:39.124 --> 01:19:40.664]  It is a sickness.
[01:19:40.664 --> 01:19:45.205]  It is a psychosis of power-hungry tyrants who run the world governments.
[01:19:45.205 --> 01:19:45.925]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:19:45.925 --> 01:19:47.186]  We've got to go to break here.
[01:19:47.186 --> 01:19:47.846]  But you're right.
[01:19:47.846 --> 01:19:53.987]  War is the desire to have power and dominion over others is a kind of mental disorder.
[01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:57.248]  Maybe we should have a new FDA pharmaceutical treat that.
[01:19:57.248 --> 01:19:58.048]  I'm joking.
[01:19:58.048 --> 01:19:58.869]  But we'll be right back.
[01:19:58.869 --> 01:20:00.209]  Stay with us, OK?
[01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:00.969]  Right back.
[01:20:00.969 --> 01:20:04.550]  For more than six years, I've talked on the air about creating a social network.
[01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:07.792]  PlanetinfoWars.com is in its beta phase.
[01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:08.833]  We're just launching it.
[01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:13.016]  And I want to invite all of you out there to be in on the ground level.
[01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:22.862]  PlanetinfoWars is about people coming together, forming activist organizations, getting involved politically, hunting and fishing, gardening, dating.

[01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:31.368]  And I give you this pledge.

[01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:45.276]  Be active.
[01:20:45.276 --> 01:20:46.216]  Organize.
[01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:46.997]  Take action.
[01:20:46.997 --> 01:20:47.957]  Go viral.
[01:20:47.957 --> 01:20:48.638]  Create.
[01:20:48.638 --> 01:20:49.498]  Contribute.
[01:20:49.498 --> 01:20:50.259]  Resist.
[01:20:50.259 --> 01:20:52.980]  Because resistance is victory.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.681]  You are victory.
[01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:57.323]  It's waiting for you to breathe power into it.

[01:23:33.097 --> 01:23:34.958]  That something is Atwood Rope.

[01:23:55.248 --> 01:23:56.129]  Atwood Rope.
[01:23:56.129 --> 01:23:57.990]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:11.140]  They railed against the crown.
[01:24:11.852 --> 01:24:17.737]  You know, I was really struck by the linguistic reminder of one of the previous callers.
[01:24:17.737 --> 01:24:19.098]  He's exactly right.
[01:24:19.098 --> 01:24:26.483]  We've got to be careful about what language we use because that language goes right into your brain and becomes a kind of truth.
[01:24:26.483 --> 01:24:29.826]  Your brain interprets language and makes it real, even when it's not real.
[01:24:29.826 --> 01:24:31.287]  And this is why we get phrases.
[01:24:31.287 --> 01:24:33.188]  I wrote down some notes during the break.
[01:24:33.188 --> 01:24:34.449]  This is why we get phrases.
[01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:37.472]  Oh, and by the way, for just joining us, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:40.014]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today.
[01:24:40.014 --> 01:24:41.054]  He'll be back tomorrow, by the way.
[01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:47.379]  But one of the phrases we often hear in the mainstream media is, of course, gun violence.
[01:24:47.379 --> 01:24:49.121]  This is a linguistic trick.
[01:24:49.121 --> 01:24:52.723]  It's trying to link guns with the word violence.
[01:24:52.723 --> 01:24:54.925]  But was there actually gun violence?
[01:24:54.925 --> 01:24:55.746]  Is there such a thing?
[01:24:55.746 --> 01:24:58.628]  Violence has to be an act with an intent.
[01:24:58.628 --> 01:25:01.270]  And a gun can't have any intent because it has no free will.
[01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:14.322]  So you don't see, for example, if there's a machete type of massacre somewhere in some other developing nation, you don't hear them come on the air and say, wow, these people were victims of machete violence.
[01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:18.787]  Or if somebody gets stabbed with a knife, you don't hear on the news, oh, there's knife violence.
[01:25:18.787 --> 01:25:19.467]  You don't hear that.
[01:25:19.467 --> 01:25:21.549]  They only use that phrase for guns.
[01:25:22.665 --> 01:25:28.168]  But they don't report all the people that were protected by them, so what about the phrase gun protection?
[01:25:28.168 --> 01:25:45.418]  So instead of, what about, let's say, an elderly person, Mrs. Parkerson, whose break-in to her house was prevented by a neighbor with a concealed carry permit, and Mrs. Parker was therefore a beneficiary of gun protection.
[01:25:45.418 --> 01:25:47.059]  You never hear that on the news.
[01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:47.899]  That's not news.
[01:25:47.899 --> 01:25:48.820]  They won't report that.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:58.874]  Even though that happens maybe, who knows, hundreds of times more often than somebody actually becoming a, quote, victim of being shot by somebody with bad intent.
[01:25:58.874 --> 01:26:00.316]  So we gotta watch these words.
[01:26:00.316 --> 01:26:03.441]  So, gun violence is a brain trick.
[01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:04.763]  That phrase is a trick.
[01:26:05.663 --> 01:26:06.784]  I don't know.
[01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:29.176]  So you got that?
[01:26:29.176 --> 01:26:33.839]  These are the three phrases that I want to encourage us all to use, all of you listening out there.
[01:26:33.839 --> 01:26:38.021]  We want to be informed and tell the truth using accurate language.
[01:26:38.021 --> 01:26:45.785]  We have gun protection when firearms are used in the protection of life and property, and that happens very often.
[01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:51.628]  We want to use the phrase peace officer to refer to cops, police, law enforcement, and so on.
[01:26:51.628 --> 01:26:52.549]  Peace officer.
[01:26:52.549 --> 01:26:55.851]  And then we want to use the phrase public servants when we're talking about
[01:26:56.872 --> 01:27:02.369]  Bureaucrats, authorities, you know, enforcers of codes and things like that.
[01:27:03.314 --> 01:27:07.037]  But of course, again, on the mainstream media, you're going to get the spin of all this.
[01:27:07.037 --> 01:27:18.145]  You're going to get gun violence, you're going to get police officers like they're supposed to police you, and then you're going to get government authorities as if they are the authorities over you and your life.
[01:27:18.145 --> 01:27:19.706]  It's all an act, okay?
[01:27:19.706 --> 01:27:27.532]  It's all just a facade, a linguistic little mind trick that they use to try to convince you that something is real when it isn't.
[01:27:28.032 --> 01:27:32.394]  The truth is that your rights are granted to you by the Creator.
[01:27:32.394 --> 01:27:35.316]  They are described by the Bill of Rights.
[01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:44.320]  They are then selected powers are delegated to a government for the sole purpose of serving the interests and the protection of life and liberty of the people.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.781]  That's the way it works.
[01:27:45.781 --> 01:27:47.342]  And anybody who tells you otherwise
[01:27:48.082 --> 01:27:56.913]  Is psychotic, insane, crazy, evil, deceptive, trying to trick you, trying to take your power, trying to take your money.
[01:27:56.913 --> 01:28:02.220]  Anybody who says the government is the powerful entity and then they grant you the people rights.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:06.145]  That person is a dangerous person and doesn't belong in America period.
[01:28:06.605 --> 01:28:11.467]  They should leave the country, go to some communist regime, go join North Korea for all I care.
[01:28:11.467 --> 01:28:14.429]  You can give up your guns, give up your free speech, give up your rights.
[01:28:14.429 --> 01:28:19.691]  You can go to North Korea and live in a country where the barbed wire keeps you in.
[01:28:19.691 --> 01:28:25.894]  And you can worship the latest version of Kim Jong-il, whoever that happens to be, generation after generation.
[01:28:25.894 --> 01:28:33.178]  Yeah, just bow down on the ground, lick their boots, and do your little fake cry for how much you love living under total tyranny.
[01:28:33.178 --> 01:28:34.599]  Otherwise, if you want to live in America,
[01:28:35.279 --> 01:28:42.220]  You should honor American rights and values and that sacred freedom and liberty that makes America great.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.941]  And there's no more excuses for any of it.
[01:28:43.941 --> 01:28:46.361]  I'm tired of the linguistic mind games.
[01:28:46.361 --> 01:28:50.722]  I'm tired of the double speak from Obama and Romney the same.
[01:28:50.722 --> 01:28:54.363]  I'm tired of just the lies that keep coming out of Washington.
[01:28:54.363 --> 01:28:56.263]  It's just too much.
[01:28:56.263 --> 01:28:57.383]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:28:57.383 --> 01:28:58.564]  So let's tell the truth.
[01:28:58.564 --> 01:29:02.044]  And that's what we practice doing right here on InfoWars.com.
[01:29:02.044 --> 01:29:04.585]  And of course, I'm happy to be here and be part of that.
[01:29:06.176 --> 01:29:22.241]  Coming up, coming up, after the coming break, we've got a great truth teller, a whistleblower, a former employee of GlaxoSmithKline, the company that just pleaded guilty to criminal fraud and ended up paying a $3 billion fine.
[01:29:22.241 --> 01:29:25.362]  Yeah, a billion to the US government.
[01:29:25.362 --> 01:29:27.723]  Kind of wonder where that money goes, by the way.
[01:29:27.723 --> 01:29:29.683]  Who gets the $3 billion?
[01:29:29.683 --> 01:29:30.984]  Whose budget does that go into?
[01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:32.765]  They don't tell you that.
[01:29:32.765 --> 01:29:36.867]  But anyway, we're going to have an interview with him, Blair Hamrick, coming up right after this break.
[01:29:36.867 --> 01:29:41.430]  Lots of incredible details about the bribery of doctors and much more.
[01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:42.911]  It'll blow your mind.
[01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:43.611]  But don't go anywhere.
[01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:44.392]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.392 --> 01:29:50.095]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.095 --> 01:29:51.476]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.476 --> 01:29:54.017]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.017 --> 01:29:56.679]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.218 --> 01:30:05.863]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.863 --> 01:30:10.207]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:10.207 --> 01:30:15.953]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.953 --> 01:30:21.259]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.559 --> 01:30:22.380]  Number 3.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.963]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.963 --> 01:30:29.887]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.887 --> 01:30:30.687]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.687 --> 01:30:33.450]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:37.133]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:37.133 --> 01:30:37.914]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.914 --> 01:30:42.058]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:42.058 --> 01:30:46.822]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:47.102 --> 01:30:51.265]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:51.265 --> 01:30:53.067]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:53.067 --> 01:30:55.309]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:55.309 --> 01:30:57.650]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:02.981 --> 01:31:06.942]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.942 --> 01:31:15.803]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:20.444]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:20.444 --> 01:31:31.246]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:41.395]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:46.840]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:54.326]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:54.326 --> 01:31:57.089]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.934 --> 01:32:06.439]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:32:06.439 --> 01:32:08.842]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:08.842 --> 01:32:17.950]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:21.394]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:21.394 --> 01:32:23.075]  There's no priming required.
[01:32:23.075 --> 01:32:23.636]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:32:25.337 --> 01:32:28.619]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:32:28.619 --> 01:32:30.441]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:32:30.441 --> 01:32:31.862]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:31.862 --> 01:32:35.024]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:35.024 --> 01:32:38.406]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:38.406 --> 01:32:40.307]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:42.549]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:32:42.549 --> 01:32:45.290]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:46.872]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:46.872 --> 01:32:50.174]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure.
[01:32:50.174 --> 01:32:54.136]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[01:32:55.117 --> 01:32:56.760]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[01:33:12.384 --> 01:33:14.606]  All right, we're continuing here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.606 --> 01:33:17.147]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:33:17.147 --> 01:33:19.209]  Thanks for continuing with us.
[01:33:19.209 --> 01:33:25.673]  We have a worldwide exclusive for National Radio interview coming up for you right now.
[01:33:25.673 --> 01:33:28.515]  The interview is with Blair Hemrick.
[01:33:28.515 --> 01:33:35.159]  He is one of the two people, the other is Gregory Thorpe, who were former employees of GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:33:35.159 --> 01:33:38.342]  And Blair, in particular, was a drug rep.
[01:33:39.062 --> 01:33:48.886]  And as he began to see some, I'll say, not quite so above the board activities going on inside the company, he raised the alarm.
[01:33:48.886 --> 01:33:54.007]  And he ended up losing his job and has been out of work for many, many years.
[01:33:54.007 --> 01:33:55.408]  We'll talk about that.
[01:33:55.408 --> 01:34:03.331]  And ended up turning information over to the Department of Justice, which then reached a $3 billion settlement with GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:34:03.331 --> 01:34:03.571]  That was
[01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:09.833]  Widely distributed or widely publicized in the last week or so.
[01:34:09.833 --> 01:34:12.233]  And it's the largest settlement in the history of Big Pharma.
[01:34:12.233 --> 01:34:19.516]  Now Blair joins us now here on the Alex Jones Show to give us details about what he saw going on inside the company.
[01:34:19.516 --> 01:34:27.578]  This will give you a clue about the runaway criminality that exists today in what I call mafia medicine.
[01:34:27.578 --> 01:34:30.639]  And Blair Hamrick joins us by Skype video to give us the details.
[01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:32.880]  Blair, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.342]  Hey, Mike.
[01:34:34.342 --> 01:34:34.942]  Nice to be here.
[01:34:34.942 --> 01:34:36.284]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[01:34:36.284 --> 01:34:36.625]  You bet.
[01:34:36.625 --> 01:34:37.746]  It's great to have you on.
[01:34:37.746 --> 01:34:47.439]  Now, give us just a quick background for the many listeners across the country and around the world about your... How did you start out with Glaxo?
[01:34:47.439 --> 01:34:48.901]  I mean, what position did you have there?
[01:34:49.604 --> 01:34:56.169]  I started out with Glaxo as a sales rep, just a sales rep calling on primary care physicians.
[01:34:56.169 --> 01:35:03.213]  After a couple of years with the company, I was promoted to what was called a therapeutic area specialist.
[01:35:03.213 --> 01:35:11.499]  And what that is, is basically you call on specialists, more specifically neurologists,
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:24.566]  Doctors who are, you know, who have, you know, not your primary care guys, but your specialists.
[01:35:24.566 --> 01:35:35.593]  And my job, essentially, was recruiting these specialists to speak to other physicians about Glaxo products.
[01:35:35.993 --> 01:35:42.296]  Now I know that we spoke before and I asked you about the kickbacks and the bribery to doctors.
[01:35:42.296 --> 01:35:52.221]  I know that in that position as a specialist, one of your jobs was to recruit doctors and make sure they were paid very well to go on speaking gigs.
[01:35:52.221 --> 01:35:58.844]  You told me they could make as much as $2,000 for a 30 minute speech promoting a drug to other physicians.
[01:35:58.844 --> 01:35:59.885]  Tell us about how that worked.
[01:36:00.903 --> 01:36:06.946]  Well, how that works is depending on how desirable the physician is.
[01:36:06.946 --> 01:36:14.329]  Interestingly enough, there's a website where people can look and see if your personal physician is in the pocket of Big Pharma.
[01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:16.830]  It's called ProPublica.com.
[01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:23.053]  It not only goes back for about a year.
[01:36:23.053 --> 01:36:27.996]  Of course, Pharma doesn't want to disclose what they've been paying the physicians before that.
[01:36:29.176 --> 01:36:45.292]  Anyway, it's based upon how desirable the speaker is, meaning how well thought of he was, or if they were a high rider, if they wrote a lot of prescriptions, if they had a lot of business.
[01:36:45.292 --> 01:36:49.596]  And it could be anywhere from $500 a talk to $2,500 was one of the most that one of my physicians got.
[01:36:54.790 --> 01:37:10.229]  But they could stack these, they could have multiple talks in one day, I remember you saying, so they could rack up, let's say $6,000 in one day, and it was so lucrative for some doctors, these kickbacks, that they actually stopped seeing patients in their own practice and just became sort of professional speakers.
[01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:12.872]  Making all this money, right?
[01:37:12.872 --> 01:37:21.098]  Well, I mean as I told you before I mean I some of these offices I would go I'm sorry about the dog barking He's enthusiastic about this.
[01:37:21.098 --> 01:37:22.039]  Yeah.
[01:37:22.039 --> 01:37:33.528]  Yeah, she sure is Anyway, um a lot of these, you know many times I'd walk into offices and doctor like oh, you're the you're the guy who sets up the programs Can you give me a gig?
[01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:37.612]  You know and and so You know these talks
[01:37:38.412 --> 01:37:42.057]  Uh, you know, they, they would, they would, all their travel was paid for.
[01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:49.005]  Um, they would, you know, they would schedule them for sometimes a breakfast meeting, a lunch meeting, and a dinner meeting all in one day.
[01:37:49.005 --> 01:37:52.088]  And so they get three honorariums is what they call it.
[01:37:52.088 --> 01:37:54.251]  And so they get three of their speaking fees.
[01:37:54.611 --> 01:38:02.513]  So this was characterized by the Department of Justice as a system of kickbacks and it really is generally just called bribery.
[01:38:02.513 --> 01:38:23.318]  It seems like these doctors were being financially incentivized or sort of paid as a quote speaking gig when they would write higher prescriptions for the GlaxoSmithKline drugs, but a lot of these doctors really in the open market wouldn't command those kinds of speaking fees and often they would just speak to just maybe six people at a time or things like that.
[01:38:23.318 --> 01:38:23.918]  Is that correct?
[01:38:24.278 --> 01:38:24.819]  That's correct.
[01:38:24.819 --> 01:38:27.101]  I even had one physician.
[01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:33.548]  We flew to Louisiana and he wanted me to go with him and he spoke to one physician.
[01:38:33.548 --> 01:38:42.397]  So there was five drug reps, one physician, the doctor that I brought in, and we went to a fish camp in Louisiana.
[01:38:44.019 --> 01:38:52.863]  I don't recall what his honorarium was at the time, but it was a nice weekend for him to go home to his hometown.
[01:38:52.863 --> 01:38:55.765]  It's a pretty nasty business.
[01:39:04.489 --> 01:39:10.874]  If you read ProPublica, you can see that there's guys still making a lot of money doing this.
[01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:37.737]  It also came out that another celebrity radio doctor had received, I think, $275,000 that was reported in the Wall Street Journal, and that he then went on the air and discussed, I think, intimacy or depression during intimacy, but failed to disclose to his audience that he was taking money from the drug company.
[01:39:38.177 --> 01:39:39.538]  That's right.
[01:39:39.538 --> 01:39:41.199]  Yeah, I think that was Dr. Drew.
[01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:42.320]  Yeah, right.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.120]  Dr. Drew.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.021]  Dr. Drew.
[01:39:44.021 --> 01:39:54.607]  And, you know, and yeah, he was discussing intimacy and depression because many of the SSRIs have sexual side effects.
[01:39:54.867 --> 01:40:00.329]  I mean, these are chemical compounds that are very dangerous and they're not toys.
[01:40:24.758 --> 01:40:34.950]  You told me in a previous conversation, and folks you can check out some of these quotes on naturalnews.com, also on infowars.com, I'm sure these quotes will be there, remind the guys to post that from our site.
[01:40:45.982 --> 01:40:59.254]  That most of the slideshows that these physicians used during their speeches for which they were receiving pretty big dollars, some of them or most of them actually came from the company marketing departments.
[01:40:59.254 --> 01:41:00.215]  That's correct.
[01:41:00.215 --> 01:41:06.861]  So essentially the company would hand them money, pay their airfare, set up the hotel and then give them a PowerPoint presentation to go out and speak?
[01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:07.882]  That's correct.
[01:41:07.882 --> 01:41:09.684]  Give them a PowerPoint presentation.
[01:41:09.684 --> 01:41:22.178]  And then, you know, it was one of the jobs of the representative, you know, because there would always be a representative or manager at these conferences or these, you know,
[01:41:22.278 --> 01:41:25.820]  Continuing medical education.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:28.742]  Full tongue-in-cheek there.
[01:41:28.742 --> 01:41:37.448]  But just along those lines, this kind of quote education is required by state medical licensing boards for doctors to keep their licenses.
[01:41:37.448 --> 01:41:40.590]  They have to go and submit themselves to this kind of propaganda, right?
[01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:42.051]  That's correct.
[01:41:42.051 --> 01:41:42.691]  That's correct.
[01:41:42.691 --> 01:41:43.652]  It's incredible.
[01:41:43.652 --> 01:41:46.574]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's a big facade.
[01:41:46.574 --> 01:41:56.300]  It's, you know, it's absolutely a facade and, you know, at some point in time, you know, myself and Greg Thorpe
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:10.888]  Just said, you know, this is wrong and and what would if a child has you know a seizure because of the drug that that we're promoting Is given to a child when it's not even indicated.
[01:42:10.888 --> 01:42:14.870]  It's for 18 and above it's Clearly stated in the package insert.
[01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:19.413]  It's not for children You know who's at fault there and and where does the buck stop?
[01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:21.571]  Right.
[01:42:21.571 --> 01:42:23.251]  I have that question for you.
[01:42:23.251 --> 01:42:28.614]  What caused you to stand up and speak out when most people would be happy to have a cushy job?
[01:42:28.614 --> 01:42:30.475]  I mean, you've been out of work.
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:32.836]  I think you were blackballed by the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:42:32.836 --> 01:42:36.177]  I know you're not claiming that, but that's just what it looks like to me.
[01:42:36.177 --> 01:42:39.319]  You've been out of work for now, what, 10 years during this battle?
[01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:49.539]  I've had some odd jobs since then, but on all intents and purposes, I have never financially recovered.
[01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:56.706]  When I left the company, I was making about $140,000 a year.
[01:42:56.706 --> 01:43:02.712]  Because of pending litigation, I can't discuss the circumstances that led to my dismissal.
[01:43:02.952 --> 01:43:03.572]  Sure.
[01:43:03.572 --> 01:43:08.716]  And by the way, the law firm, I want to give a shout out to Kenny and McCafferty out of Philadelphia.
[01:43:08.716 --> 01:43:16.802]  That law firm specializes in whistleblower cases and they took on your case and they achieved quite an amazing victory.
[01:43:16.802 --> 01:43:18.343]  The largest settlement in the history.
[01:43:18.343 --> 01:43:26.229]  And that law firm specializes in fraud cases, medical fraud, sometimes tax fraud.
[01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:29.051]  I see your dog very much approves of that as well.
[01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:35.474]  I wish I could, you know, I know we're under time constraints, so I'd go in and try to get her to stifle.
[01:43:35.474 --> 01:43:36.194]  I apologize.
[01:43:36.194 --> 01:43:36.814]  Izzy!
[01:43:36.814 --> 01:43:40.496]  That's right, let me throw in a comment here.
[01:43:40.496 --> 01:43:41.856]  Yeah, go, if you want to do that.
[01:43:41.856 --> 01:43:43.137]  Let me grab the dog, I'm sorry.
[01:43:43.137 --> 01:43:45.198]  Let me throw in some comments here while you're doing that.
[01:43:45.198 --> 01:43:47.439]  We'll have better audio clarity for everybody.
[01:43:47.439 --> 01:43:48.879]  But you know, folks, this is real radio.
[01:43:48.879 --> 01:43:50.140]  This is live radio.
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.881]  And Blair Hamrick, you know, that's where he lives.
[01:43:52.881 --> 01:43:54.422]  He gave up a cushy job.
[01:43:54.422 --> 01:43:56.563]  It could have been a very wealthy situation for him.
[01:43:57.363 --> 01:44:04.690]  He gave that up to tell the truth, to blow the whistle, so that he could then help protect other people from this kind of thing going on.
[01:44:04.690 --> 01:44:13.718]  And by the way, he told me in a previous interview that at the time he left GlaxoSmithKline, they had over 40,000 speakers on their Speakers Bureau.
[01:44:13.718 --> 01:44:20.544]  So just as we were talking about this, you know, $2,000 for 30 minutes that the doctors were getting paid as, quote, kickbacks.
[01:44:21.084 --> 01:44:21.324]  I don't
[01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:40.359]  That Glaxo has pleaded guilty to conducting.
[01:44:40.359 --> 01:44:42.500]  This is not a debate.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.501]  It's not like Glaxo is denying this.
[01:44:44.501 --> 01:44:49.464]  They have pleaded guilty to this and they said we're going to make some changes, we're going to do better.
[01:44:49.464 --> 01:44:53.387]  But they pleaded guilty to criminal fraud.
[01:44:56.930 --> 01:45:09.004]  I mean, I'm not with the company anymore, and I've been away for a while, so I can't attest to what's going on currently, but you're talking about compounds
[01:45:09.284 --> 01:45:22.854]  You know, right now in the newspaper, they made a big to-do about stopping paying their reps on market share and going to educating physicians and that's how they're going to start paying their reps.
[01:45:22.854 --> 01:45:26.477]  But how much can you educate a physician on a compound that's
[01:45:27.237 --> 01:45:29.840]  30 years old or 25 years old.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:39.448]  I mean, you know, you've got, you know, you've got a drug like for instance, Advair that is a new compound, but it's basically two very old compounds together.
[01:45:39.448 --> 01:45:40.529]  That's right.
[01:45:40.529 --> 01:45:51.358]  So how much, how much more education is a person with a business degree going to give a physician that did 10 years of school on, on a, on a compound that's 25 years old?
[01:45:52.099 --> 01:46:03.985]  Well that's a really good point and you know the drug companies are desperate to try to come up with new combinations that they then spin as being breakthrough drugs when, like you described, they're really the same old chemicals just sort of repackaged.
[01:46:03.985 --> 01:46:10.748]  But let's talk about off-label marketing and marketing to children because this is something else that Glaxo pleaded guilty to.
[01:46:11.288 --> 01:46:11.768]  That's right.
[01:46:11.768 --> 01:46:26.537]  They admitted that they were illegally or in violation of FDA regulations, I should say, marketing these drugs to children that were never approved for children, never even tested for children, no safety record for children.
[01:46:26.537 --> 01:46:29.779]  Give us the load out on that, Blair, as the insider who saw it firsthand.
[01:46:30.379 --> 01:46:31.080]  Well, sure.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:38.465]  I mean, you're talking about drugs where just a percent market share can mean a huge sum of money.
[01:46:38.465 --> 01:46:47.691]  So, you know, the company was very concerned about patent expirations on these compounds, and they were trying to squeeze every penny they could.
[01:46:47.691 --> 01:46:57.238]  So, you know, they would, you know, they would, you know, say with like Wellbutrin or Paxil, you know, they were trying to squeeze every penny they could.
[01:46:57.238 --> 01:46:58.419]  So they were trying to find
[01:46:59.159 --> 01:47:02.764]  New avenues to create, to generate more money.
[01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:11.556]  And you know, one of the things that you got to ask yourself is like when you are selling off label to a child, you know, the package insert has dosing and administration.
[01:47:11.556 --> 01:47:14.720]  Well, what do you tell a doctor, you know, who's going to use it on a 12 year old?
[01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:17.222]  I mean, how do you tell them to dose it?
[01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:19.563]  I mean, there's some inherent dangers with that.
[01:47:19.563 --> 01:47:33.908]  But just to be clear, Blair, so when you were in meetings with your managers being trained on how to approach doctors and what to say, I just want to be clear, were they telling you specifically, you push this drug for children, you know, wink, wink?
[01:47:33.908 --> 01:47:34.869]  How did that go down?
[01:47:34.869 --> 01:47:35.829]  What actually took place?
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:37.361]  Well, sure.
[01:47:37.361 --> 01:47:39.622]  Well, there was, absolutely.
[01:47:39.622 --> 01:47:55.110]  In fact, you can look in some of the court documents, there's some documents about, to the effect, that show that they were wanting to promote Wellbutrin for children in a diseased state.
[01:47:55.910 --> 01:48:04.878]  And, you know, I don't want to say too much, but the allegations in the document are for ADHD in children.
[01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:07.641]  So, you know, it was a nod, nod, wink, wink.
[01:48:07.641 --> 01:48:12.545]  We all, you know, there was a written set of rules, and then there were the real rules.
[01:48:12.545 --> 01:48:19.872]  And the real rules were basically, if you didn't sell off-label, you weren't going to get the market shares.
[01:48:19.872 --> 01:48:22.474]  And if you didn't get the market shares, you wouldn't be employed very long.
[01:48:22.534 --> 01:48:32.680]  So there was this really aggressive push and obviously your salary was tied into probably bonuses for how many prescriptions were written by doctors off-label and on-label both.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.561]  Is that how it worked?
[01:48:33.561 --> 01:48:34.921]  That's correct.
[01:48:34.921 --> 01:48:42.106]  And you know, they couldn't, you know, with the way that they were tracking the prescriptions, they couldn't distinguish what was on-label or what was off-label.
[01:48:42.786 --> 01:48:42.886]  Wow.
[01:49:00.291 --> 01:49:14.717]  To start pulling your numbers up and so the way to get numbers up was to do speaking programs, bringing these thought leaders in to engage with your physicians, whether it was just bringing a doctor in for a lunch,
[01:49:15.717 --> 01:49:17.918]  Or having a dinner program.
[01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:34.763]  And, you know, many times, I mean, so often they would talk off-label whether, you know, whether it was for, you know, Wellbutrin for weight loss, or for, you know, ADHD, for sexual dysfunction, or, you know, or, you know, just children.
[01:49:34.763 --> 01:49:36.143]  And the whole gamut.
[01:49:36.143 --> 01:49:40.325]  I mean, it was, it was just, you know, you would have thought that the drug should have been in the water.
[01:49:41.985 --> 01:49:44.647]  Well, they're trying to do that too!
[01:49:44.647 --> 01:49:47.648]  Don't say that to too many people, they're going to try that!
[01:49:47.648 --> 01:49:52.251]  They want to put cholesterol drugs in the water supply, that's how crazy they are.
[01:49:52.251 --> 01:50:00.996]  But you mentioned Wellbutrid in particular, that the catchphrase that you would repeat to doctors if you only had a minute to talk to them was the quote, happy, horny, skinny drug.
[01:50:00.996 --> 01:50:09.881]  And yet, there was no data, there was no clinical trial data whatsoever on the treating sexual dysfunction or weight loss
[01:50:10.581 --> 01:50:11.262]  At all, right?
[01:50:27.122 --> 01:50:27.463]  All right Blair.
[01:50:47.085 --> 01:50:48.827]  We got to go to a break here.
[01:50:48.827 --> 01:50:49.387]  Stay with us.
[01:50:49.387 --> 01:50:51.970]  We'll continue with you on the other side of this break.
[01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:57.195]  Incredible information here from an insider previously with GlaxoSmithKline.

[01:50:57.696 --> 01:50:59.498]  We'll be right back with much more straight ahead.
[01:51:01.175 --> 01:51:02.396]  Let me ask you a question.

[01:54:01.254 --> 01:54:03.755]  No matter how hard you try, you can't
[01:54:15.293 --> 01:54:18.115]  All right, thanks for continuing with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:18.115 --> 01:54:19.956]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in.
[01:54:19.956 --> 01:54:36.306]  And we are talking with former Glaxo employee and now whistleblower Blair Hamrick, who's one of the top two key people responsible for taking evidence to the Department of Justice that resulted in the $3 billion settlement, the largest in the history of medicine.
[01:54:37.304 --> 01:54:38.205]  Wow, incredible.
[01:54:38.205 --> 01:54:40.068]  Hey Blair, let me ask you this.
[01:54:40.068 --> 01:54:51.423]  The typical uninformed consumer out there, let's say just a mainstream news watching, someone who's not really informed, doesn't, for example, listen to the Alex Jones Show so that they're not really awakened that much.
[01:54:52.304 --> 01:54:52.464]  That
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.341]  So what's wrong with that view of medicine today?
[01:55:42.512 --> 01:55:54.736]  When they start testing it for approval, according to the FDA, a new drug only needs to show that it's better than placebo, that it works better than placebo.
[01:55:54.736 --> 01:56:09.181]  So there's many compounds out there that have been available for years and years and years, that are available generically, that are pennies on the dollar, and these drug companies would never put these products up against
[01:56:09.941 --> 01:56:15.285]  Those products sometimes, head-to-head, they only put it through against placebo.
[01:56:15.285 --> 01:56:19.368]  Because if it's better than placebo, then they get the approval.
[01:56:19.368 --> 01:56:39.163]  And then, whereas if they put it head-to-head against something that is already approved, and is cheap, and is efficacious and safe, and they show inferiority to that product, well then, you're taking a drug that may be eight, nine dollars a pill, and something that may take three cents
[01:56:39.883 --> 01:57:01.923]  Yeah, just to rephrase what you're saying, a lot of the new drugs that are hyped up that are expensive, like you say $8, $9, $10 a pill, some are even a lot more than that, $50 a pill in some areas, it may be an old nickel a pill drug actually works better, but they never run the head-to-head test because that would show that the new drug isn't worth the extra $10.
[01:57:03.171 --> 01:57:03.571]  Right.
[01:57:03.571 --> 01:57:04.792]  That's correct.
[01:57:04.792 --> 01:57:07.393]  You know, and maybe safer.
[01:57:07.393 --> 01:57:09.555]  You know, I mean, there's many compounds out there.
[01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:19.580]  For instance, they've got, Glaxo has a new product called Treximid, which is a combination of an older product of Emetrex and Naproxen.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:22.482]  Naproxen, I think it's either Naproxen or... It's like a common painkiller, yeah.
[01:57:22.982 --> 01:57:28.729]  Right, and naproxen has been, you know, that drug is like 45 years old.
[01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:35.097]  And Imitrex came out in 19, I want to say 1991, I think is when that drug was launched.
[01:57:35.097 --> 01:57:39.562]  So there you have, you've got a 20-year-old drug and a 40-year-old drug.
[01:57:39.562 --> 01:57:41.885]  They mix them together and they call it a new drug.
[01:57:42.065 --> 01:57:50.428]  Well, and then at the same time you've got the drug companies actively interfering with the generic drug manufacturers trying to bring drugs to market for cheaper prices.
[01:57:50.428 --> 01:57:55.610]  I saw, for example, I think AstraZeneca just got slapped by the court for trying to engage in that.
[01:57:55.610 --> 01:58:05.913]  Pfizer's being sued under allegations of price fixing and monopolization to prevent a competing generic cholesterol drug from entering the market that would potentially reduce their sales of, I believe, Lipitor.
[01:58:05.913 --> 01:58:09.755]  So you've got these drug companies actually working against the interests of consumers.
[01:58:10.575 --> 01:58:16.198]  You know, why doesn't the FTC get involved in anti-competitive practices with these companies?
[01:58:16.198 --> 01:58:16.819]  I don't know.
[01:58:16.819 --> 01:58:18.039]  I can't answer that question.
[01:58:18.039 --> 01:58:29.906]  But, you know, what I can say is that for every day that a generic stays off the market, they make tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars a day.
[01:58:29.906 --> 01:58:31.407]  Yeah, they're making money every minute.
[01:58:31.407 --> 01:58:32.828]  Stay with us, Blair.
[01:58:32.828 --> 01:58:33.448]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:33.448 --> 01:58:36.830]  We're going to continue in just a minute with much more from Blair Hamrick.

[01:58:50.925 --> 01:58:52.225]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.225 --> 01:58:57.826]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:57.826 --> 01:59:02.847]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:02.847 --> 01:59:03.307]  It's true.
[01:59:03.307 --> 01:59:07.868]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:59:08.408 --> 01:59:13.632]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.632 --> 01:59:20.757]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.757 --> 01:59:21.877]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.877 --> 01:59:28.222]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.542 --> 01:59:31.724]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:31.724 --> 01:59:33.945]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:59:34.905 --> 01:59:35.145]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:35.145 --> 01:59:38.527]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:38.527 --> 01:59:40.268]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:53.852 --> 01:59:56.254]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.254 --> 02:00:05.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:06.840]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.601]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:10.363]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.363 --> 02:00:11.944]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.944 --> 02:00:13.505]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.505 --> 02:00:17.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.687 --> 02:00:21.750]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.377 --> 02:00:27.258]  All right, welcome to the third hour.
[02:00:27.258 --> 02:00:29.958]  Is it already the third hour of the Alex Jones Show?
[02:00:29.958 --> 02:00:33.819]  Wow, time flies when you're telling the truth, doesn't it?
[02:00:33.819 --> 02:00:42.781]  We're joined in this segment, continuing with Blair Hamrick, the whistleblower, former employee of GlaxoSmithKline, one of the key informants that went to the U.S.
[02:00:42.781 --> 02:00:48.162]  government that then took action and got a $3 billion settlement out of Glaxo.
[02:00:49.022 --> 02:00:54.290]  Now, we're going to continue with Blair for this segment, and in fact for the next half hour or so.
[02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:56.012]  I hope you can stay with us, Blair.
[02:00:56.012 --> 02:00:59.297]  But here's some of the stories we just spoke about.
[02:00:59.297 --> 02:01:04.644]  AstraZeneca tries to block generic drug approvals, gets slapped by the court.
[02:01:05.405 --> 02:01:12.993]  And there's just another case of pharmaceutical companies trying to interfere with free market practices that would actually benefit consumers.
[02:01:12.993 --> 02:01:15.175]  And this is routine.
[02:01:15.175 --> 02:01:24.105]  You probably weren't in that area of the company, Blair, but do you have any other knowledge about drug companies blocking generic drugs that would benefit consumers?
[02:01:25.063 --> 02:01:35.073]  Well, you know, if they don't block, they can also do things like manufacture the compound for the generic companies.
[02:01:35.073 --> 02:01:43.022]  Many times after the drug is made, it gets the approval generically, and they were unsuccessful
[02:01:43.482 --> 02:02:04.653]  You know, usually successful at making that time a lot longer, but then when the generic finally comes out, then they'll cut a deal with the generic house to manufacture either the raw compound for them to press it into a pill, or maybe even manufacture it themselves.
[02:02:04.653 --> 02:02:06.154]  Sometimes they'll have two
[02:02:11.397 --> 02:02:15.159]  There's two lines running at the same time, the exact same pill on each line.
[02:02:15.159 --> 02:02:19.181]  One's going in a generic bottle, one's going in a brand-name bottle.
[02:02:19.181 --> 02:02:22.543]  So, I mean, there's a lot of malfeasance going on here.
[02:02:22.543 --> 02:02:30.908]  Well, I mean, there's nothing, let's say, technically illegal about having a generic line, but where I have issues is, where are these drugs manufactured?
[02:02:30.908 --> 02:02:39.513]  Because I remember reading a lot of stories talking about manufacturing facilities, for example, in Puerto Rico and in India, where they would find
[02:02:40.393 --> 02:02:46.498]  Machine parts in the pills and they would find aspects of paint from the machines.
[02:02:46.498 --> 02:03:05.475]  You know, Cheryl Eckert was the whistleblower in another Glaxo case about a year ago where she was reporting malfeasance going on in Puerto Rico where the drugs were mislabeled, you know, I mean all kinds of all kinds of things and even having the reports of
[02:03:05.675 --> 02:03:11.600]  Written to North Carolina in Spanish so that the people at the main office couldn't read the reports.
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:27.174]  So I mean, you know, I mean, and you know, unfortunately, Cheryl, you know, because I was in sales, I was, I'm a pretty good communicator, where Cheryl was on 60 Minutes and she, you know, her specialty was something else.
[02:03:27.174 --> 02:03:28.935]  And so she wasn't a communicator.
[02:03:28.935 --> 02:03:31.017]  And so she was dismissed very quickly.
[02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:36.820]  But her story is significant in itself.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:43.823]  And so what these companies are doing, it's a very filthy business.
[02:03:43.823 --> 02:03:47.865]  And like I said to you in our last interview, what are they?
[02:03:47.865 --> 02:03:49.106]  They're a corporate defendant.
[02:03:49.106 --> 02:03:50.587]  And what's a corporate defendant?
[02:03:50.587 --> 02:03:56.650]  It's nothing but a table full of attorneys justifying behaviors and making it up.
[02:03:56.650 --> 02:04:00.832]  When they can't justify a behavior, they just make a story up.
[02:04:01.465 --> 02:04:03.906]  Yeah, I want to talk to you about that in more detail.
[02:04:03.906 --> 02:04:19.713]  This segment is not carried by all of the radio affiliates, so when we get into the next segment, I want to ask you about CEOs being held criminally responsible, which hasn't happened yet, but I believe that should happen, and I want to get your views on that, Blair.
[02:04:19.713 --> 02:04:20.553]  Sure.
[02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:30.798]  How come these companies can simply admit to felony crimes, admit to fraud, admit to violating federal law, pay a fine, get away with it, nobody gets
[02:04:31.378 --> 02:04:36.120]  Arrested, nobody goes to jail, nobody goes to prison, and they just keep doing it over and over again.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:42.343]  In this case, for example, Glaxo paid its $3 billion fine out of, quote, cash reserves.
[02:04:42.343 --> 02:04:46.906]  Yeah, this company's so big, they have $3 billion sitting around.
[02:04:46.906 --> 02:04:47.606]  Can you imagine?
[02:04:47.606 --> 02:04:50.787]  Hey, is there $3 billion under this table anywhere?
[02:04:50.787 --> 02:04:53.108]  They just pull it out, pay it to the government, and keep doing business.
[02:04:53.108 --> 02:04:54.009]  It's incredible.
[02:04:54.009 --> 02:04:55.109]  But stay with us, Blair.
[02:04:55.109 --> 02:05:00.112]  We've got to go to a quick break, and then we'll be right back on the other side with more insider details.
[02:05:01.291 --> 02:05:02.532]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:05:02.532 --> 02:05:04.033]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:05:04.033 --> 02:05:04.914]  The freedom to choose?
[02:05:04.914 --> 02:05:05.874]  The freedom to vote?
[02:05:05.874 --> 02:05:06.875]  The freedom to worship?
[02:05:06.875 --> 02:05:09.096]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?

[02:08:06.338 --> 02:08:08.640]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:17.793 --> 02:08:23.194]  Alright, we're continuing our interview with Blair Hamrick, the insider with GlaxoSmithKline.
[02:08:23.194 --> 02:08:27.076]  Thank you for joining us, continuing with us on the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.076 --> 02:08:31.397]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, the editor of NaturalNews.com filling in.
[02:08:31.397 --> 02:08:39.179]  And if you want to find some documents related to this story, they're on the front page of NaturalNews.com right now, by the way, a PDF that you can check out, some of the core documents.
[02:08:39.179 --> 02:08:41.980]  I also want to apologize to the callers.
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.040]  We need to clear the board.
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:44.200]  I don't
[02:09:02.268 --> 02:09:04.930]  Maybe we'll bring that up later in the show again, get back to that.
[02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:06.151]  The number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:09:06.151 --> 02:09:14.916]  So go ahead and call in if you've got questions or comments about Big Pharma in general.
[02:09:14.916 --> 02:09:19.239]  Just remember, Blair can't answer your health questions and I cannot either.
[02:09:19.239 --> 02:09:22.421]  We're not doctors, so please don't ask us health questions.
[02:09:23.261 --> 02:09:32.089]  But Blair, getting back to you, we spoke about the importance of having some corporate responsibility for these kinds of actions.
[02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:35.332]  Why is it that nobody's going to jail?
[02:09:35.332 --> 02:09:36.793]  Nobody's being arrested.
[02:09:36.793 --> 02:09:45.841]  The CEO of Glaxo is not being investigated or prosecuted for these crimes that his company has admitted to committing.
[02:09:46.622 --> 02:09:47.303]  Why is that?
[02:09:47.303 --> 02:09:48.245]  How does that make you feel?
[02:09:48.245 --> 02:09:52.150]  I mean, it's the veil of the corporation.
[02:09:52.150 --> 02:10:00.382]  I mean, you know, a corporation is basically a sociopath, and they have so many veils of protection that...
[02:10:01.904 --> 02:10:06.285]  You know, and so many attorneys, you know, nobody's going to face the music.
[02:10:06.285 --> 02:10:10.666]  And, you know, unfortunately, maybe somebody in the UK will wake up.
[02:10:10.666 --> 02:10:20.428]  I mean, I've already heard that some prime ministers in the UK are calling for an investigation of Glaxo to see if they really have changed like they say they have.
[02:10:20.428 --> 02:10:28.550]  And, you know, quite frankly, if they are a changed company, then why doesn't GlaxoHR give me a call and try to hire me back in their
[02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:31.351]  Uh, in their compliance department.
[02:10:31.351 --> 02:10:34.073]  I'd gladly go back to work for them in their compliance department.
[02:10:34.073 --> 02:10:35.994]  Oh yeah, I bet they would love that.
[02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:38.116]  You in their compliance department.
[02:10:38.116 --> 02:10:38.596]  Yeah.
[02:10:38.596 --> 02:10:39.737]  But hey, who knows?
[02:10:39.737 --> 02:10:44.140]  Maybe that's some way they could actually show that they're serious about reforms.
[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:45.241]  But here's something interesting.
[02:10:45.241 --> 02:10:52.847]  In the natural products industry, if a, let's say a provider of cherry supplements is investigated by the FTC,
[02:10:53.487 --> 02:10:58.808]  For what is essentially the same as off-label marketing or making invalid marketing claims.
[02:10:58.808 --> 02:11:08.751]  The FTC will often go in and seize all their inventory, shut down their entire company, seize the entire customer email list, seize all the computers, all the literature, everything.
[02:11:08.751 --> 02:11:13.112]  This happened to the Life Extension Foundation many years ago, by the way, in an FDA raid.
[02:11:13.772 --> 02:11:20.257]  And then they will require the company to refund the money to every customer in the history of that company.
[02:11:20.257 --> 02:11:38.551]  So my question is, as someone who's covered this journalistically, why doesn't the FTC or the FDA go in and require Glaxo to refund all the money from all the sales of these drugs that they admitted to off-label fraudulent criminal marketing?
[02:11:38.551 --> 02:11:39.692]  Wouldn't that make sense?
[02:11:39.692 --> 02:11:40.573]  Refund everybody!
[02:11:40.973 --> 02:11:42.274]  Well, absolutely.
[02:11:42.274 --> 02:11:59.867]  I mean, you know, listen, one of the things, I mean, I've suffered, my family and I have suffered for me blowing the whistle, no question, but I haven't suffered nearly as much as, say, some mother or father whose child committed suicide because their child's doctor was marketed
[02:12:00.447 --> 02:12:00.687]  Yeah.
[02:12:00.687 --> 02:12:01.128]  Exactly.
[02:12:18.688 --> 02:12:19.268]  That's the issue.
[02:12:19.268 --> 02:12:20.730]  You just nailed it right there, Blair.
[02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:21.431]  It's a disincentive.
[02:12:21.431 --> 02:12:28.138]  Because right now, let's say Glaxo might have made, I'm just guessing, $30 billion off of selling these drugs.
[02:12:28.138 --> 02:12:29.619]  So, okay, $30 billion.
[02:12:29.619 --> 02:12:34.164]  They set aside $3 billion and have a stack of cash in the CEO's office, let's say.
[02:12:34.164 --> 02:12:35.085]  That'd be a pretty big stack.
[02:12:36.126 --> 02:12:37.988]  Even in fiat currency.
[02:12:37.988 --> 02:12:46.097]  But they take the $3 billion, when they get caught, they take the $3 billion, hand it to the feds and say, we're going to keep doing business.
[02:12:46.097 --> 02:12:52.244]  And they never have to pay back their profits that they made illegitimately in the first place.
[02:12:52.244 --> 02:12:53.686]  So they just keep doing business.
[02:12:53.686 --> 02:12:55.188]  It's just a cost of business.
[02:12:55.188 --> 02:12:55.809]  It never ends.
[02:12:56.269 --> 02:13:06.131]  And the way the law reads, the way the False Claims Act reads, it's supposed to be $10,000 per violation.
[02:13:06.131 --> 02:13:19.254]  So when you start thinking about every prescription, a $10,000 fine per violation, you know, the company, and the company's not allowed to do business with the, if convicted, the company's not allowed to do business with the federal government at all.
[02:13:19.574 --> 02:13:20.795]  Well, that's the other thing.
[02:13:20.795 --> 02:13:28.219]  Pfizer setting up the dummy corporation to take the fall, you know, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:13:28.219 --> 02:13:34.522]  Why does Medicare and Medicaid keep doing business with these companies that admit to felony crimes?
[02:13:34.522 --> 02:13:43.507]  Why does Obamacare force us to do business with these companies by forcing us to buy into a health insurance system?
[02:13:43.507 --> 02:13:45.408]  And I know your thoughts on
[02:13:46.428 --> 02:13:49.871]  You like the fact that everybody needs some kind of healthcare safety net.
[02:13:49.871 --> 02:13:51.291]  I understand that.
[02:13:51.291 --> 02:13:58.136]  But shouldn't we have a choice and not be forced to do business with criminal companies?
[02:13:58.136 --> 02:13:59.717]  I concur with that completely.
[02:14:03.533 --> 02:14:08.696]  That, you know, like our education system, everyone has a right to a basic high school education.
[02:14:08.696 --> 02:14:09.636]  Right.
[02:14:09.636 --> 02:14:19.742]  You know, I think that, you know, we should, everyone should be able to get, you know, health care, but I don't think, you know, the way, what's been proposed is the right way to go about it.
[02:14:19.742 --> 02:14:27.667]  No, look, I used to live in Taiwan, and that's why I went out of college, because we're in an economic recession at that time.
[02:14:28.647 --> 02:14:34.453]  And there they have a health care system that is kind of a government-run system, but it's dirt cheap.
[02:14:34.453 --> 02:14:41.180]  An employer at that time literally they were paying about four dollars a month per employee for full coverage.
[02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:42.301]  Four bucks a month!
[02:14:42.301 --> 02:14:46.966]  Now today that might be twenty bucks a month, but imagine if US employers only had to pay
[02:14:47.426 --> 02:14:49.928]  Twenty bucks a month for each employee.
[02:14:49.928 --> 02:14:52.130]  I don't think there would be much debate about that.
[02:14:52.130 --> 02:14:56.695]  Part of the problem with Obamacare is that it's so expensive it bankrupts the companies.
[02:14:56.695 --> 02:15:00.058]  It bankrupts families, and now it's going to be hit with a tax.
[02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:02.180]  I mean, I didn't mean to get you into the political issue, Blair.
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:02.540]  Sure.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:08.846]  But, you know, the criminality of the drug companies becomes an issue when we're forced to do business with those companies.
[02:15:09.437 --> 02:15:09.777]  Right.
[02:15:09.777 --> 02:15:15.222]  I mean, you wouldn't do business with a known criminal if you could help it.
[02:15:15.222 --> 02:15:16.923]  Absolutely not.
[02:15:16.923 --> 02:15:24.208]  And you know, one of the things that's interesting you brought up is the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States is medical bills.
[02:15:24.208 --> 02:15:24.609]  That's right.
[02:15:25.009 --> 02:15:25.609]  Well said, Blair.
[02:15:25.609 --> 02:15:26.710]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:15:26.710 --> 02:15:27.850]  We've got callers on the line.
[02:15:27.850 --> 02:15:29.211]  And let's go to Cindy in Iowa first.
[02:15:29.211 --> 02:15:30.051]  Cindy, you're on the air.
[02:15:30.051 --> 02:15:30.311]  Go ahead.
[02:15:30.311 --> 02:15:30.972]  What's your question?
[02:15:50.068 --> 02:15:52.831]  Thank you so much for having this guest.
[02:15:52.831 --> 02:15:57.156]  I work at a research facility that has all the companies that y'all named.
[02:15:57.156 --> 02:16:10.731]  I wanted to say that I don't think the efficacy of a lot of the drugs can be, you know, pure as they're reporting to the FDA when we perform procedures on subjects
[02:16:11.343 --> 02:16:19.007]  That they do these studies for a living and you're supposed to have a 30-day washout, but yet they do.
[02:16:19.007 --> 02:16:25.290]  Because there's not like a main database to show all the research places who have done a study.
[02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:34.475]  People will do it with those drugs in their system because of money and the financial benefit way before 30 days.
[02:16:34.475 --> 02:16:40.918]  And I know this because I've been working at this facility over 10 years and I've heard, you know, subjects talk.
[02:16:41.617 --> 02:16:48.740]  And so that is so, to me, how in this age of, you know, technology, how can that be going on?
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:54.063]  Because that's the efficacy and what y'all were talking about, the safetiness of these drugs.
[02:16:54.063 --> 02:17:06.208]  So you're saying that about the 30-day washout, you're saying that then they decide, they eliminate people from the trial that are having bad results to make the, to shape the data to look better, that kind of thing?
[02:17:06.918 --> 02:17:12.526]  No, what I'm saying are the subjects, there's no regulation because the subjects are lying.
[02:17:12.526 --> 02:17:18.976]  They're going to other facilities before that washout and doing studies and there's no database in the research industry.
[02:17:18.976 --> 02:17:19.276]  Oh, okay.
[02:17:21.143 --> 02:17:24.605]  And so how can the efficacy of the drug, you know what I'm saying?
[02:17:24.605 --> 02:17:31.889]  Yeah, so they're actually involved in multiple clinical trials at the same time and stacking drugs and things like that.
[02:17:31.889 --> 02:17:32.909]  Good question.
[02:17:32.909 --> 02:17:33.570]  Good question, Cindy.
[02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:35.111]  Thanks for your call.
[02:17:35.111 --> 02:17:36.391]  Blair, your comments on that.
[02:17:36.391 --> 02:17:42.414]  I know you weren't in the research side of the company, so your comments may be limited, but does that ring a bell to anything?
[02:17:42.414 --> 02:17:43.315]  What are your thoughts?
[02:17:43.775 --> 02:17:49.678]  Well, I mean, I do know how to read the studies, and I can pick apart a good study and a bad study.
[02:17:49.678 --> 02:17:58.021]  And unfortunately, many of the people that are in these studies, they're doing it for financial reasons.
[02:17:58.021 --> 02:18:07.486]  They're not doing it because they just coincidentally happen to be in a doctor's office and have this disease state.
[02:18:08.246 --> 02:18:16.153]  You know, if you have people in multiple studies taking multiple products, then you're going to have, you know, you're going to have skewed results.
[02:18:16.153 --> 02:18:23.439]  Whether it's going to be, you know, skewed positive or skewed negative, you're not going to have the, you're going to have inappropriate results.
[02:18:23.439 --> 02:18:24.079]  You know, the results...
[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:31.066]  What kind of person would... I mean, I guess, you know, the economy is being destroyed by Obama policies.
[02:18:31.066 --> 02:18:38.413]  Well, virtually every president has been destroying the economy lately, but people are desperate for work and income.
[02:18:38.413 --> 02:18:44.619]  So, I mean, are they literally just selling their bodies into multiple clinical trials to get drugged up and paid something?
[02:18:44.619 --> 02:18:46.221]  I mean, that sounds like suicide to me.
[02:18:47.284 --> 02:18:48.405]  Yeah, I wouldn't do it.
[02:18:48.405 --> 02:18:52.368]  I mean, as desperate as I've been in the past 10 years, I wouldn't do it either.
[02:18:52.368 --> 02:18:54.809]  But you see it in the newspaper all the time, you know.
[02:18:54.809 --> 02:18:57.451]  Drug study will pay you for your time.
[02:18:57.451 --> 02:19:00.353]  And so, you know, you get to see the doctor for free.
[02:19:00.353 --> 02:19:03.955]  And so, you know, they coerce you into this.
[02:19:03.955 --> 02:19:05.676]  And yeah, you become a human guinea pig.
[02:19:05.876 --> 02:19:06.697]  Wow.
[02:19:06.697 --> 02:19:06.997]  Wow.
[02:19:06.997 --> 02:19:10.681]  And then, of course, well, I remember the quote.
[02:19:10.681 --> 02:19:12.563]  This was a pharma discussion behind the scenes.
[02:19:12.563 --> 02:19:14.685]  Why do you use human guinea pigs?
[02:19:14.685 --> 02:19:17.488]  The answer is they're cheaper than monkeys.
[02:19:17.488 --> 02:19:23.854]  I mean, lab monkeys cost more money than paying a human down the street to do it.
[02:19:23.854 --> 02:19:24.395]  It's incredible.
[02:19:24.935 --> 02:19:40.967]  And, and, you know, the animal rights folks, you know, would be offended if they, you know, if, you know, what they do to the rats and the rabbits, but with what they do to humans, it's, you know, hey, we got to get rid of all the human beings.
[02:19:41.567 --> 02:19:44.970]  Then there's experiments like in Nigeria on children.
[02:19:44.970 --> 02:19:47.873]  There's experiments in Guatemala on the prisoners that took place.
[02:19:47.873 --> 02:19:48.554]  The whole history.
[02:19:48.554 --> 02:19:51.176]  Jonas Salk and his experiment.
[02:19:51.176 --> 02:19:54.700]  Experiments on antibiotics and prisoners and all kinds of things.
[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.061]  Mental asylums.
[02:19:56.061 --> 02:19:56.762]  Incredible.
[02:19:56.762 --> 02:19:57.663]  A lot more straight ahead.
[02:19:57.663 --> 02:19:59.184]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:59.184 --> 02:19:59.825]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.209 --> 02:20:02.510]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:08.094]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.094 --> 02:20:13.117]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.117 --> 02:20:18.701]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:08.161]  I want you to know some very important information.

[02:24:19.722 --> 02:24:26.529]  We've got Blair Hamrick for just about five more minutes, and thank you for continuing to stay with us, Blair.
[02:24:26.529 --> 02:24:27.089]  Wow.
[02:24:27.089 --> 02:24:29.512]  A lot of great information you've already shared with us.
[02:24:29.512 --> 02:24:31.173]  We've also got callers on the line.
[02:24:31.173 --> 02:24:33.756]  Are you okay to take another call, Blair?
[02:24:33.756 --> 02:24:34.237]  Sure.
[02:24:34.237 --> 02:24:35.198]  All right, here we go.
[02:24:35.198 --> 02:24:37.019]  Roger from Minnesota calling in.
[02:24:37.019 --> 02:24:38.020]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:38.781]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:24:38.781 --> 02:24:39.342]  What's on your mind?
[02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:45.508]  Yes, first of all, I want to congratulate Blair for being a whistleblower because it takes a lot of guts, a lot of courage to do that.
[02:24:45.508 --> 02:24:54.613]  But what's on my mind, and Blair might be able to respond to this too, I just had my first granddaughter about a year or so ago, and I've been able to convince my daughter and son-in-law of the evils of vaccination.
[02:24:54.613 --> 02:25:06.820]  I'm totally anti-vaccination, anti-Big Pharma, but my daughter has supposedly done some reading herself also, and she just thinks at a minimum my daughter should have, uh, granddaughter should have two shots, the pertussis and the polio vaccine.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:08.021]  Of course, I read about the polio vaccine,
[02:25:09.970 --> 02:25:16.340]  And the reason my daughter thinks she ought to get the polio vaccine, they plan to travel, go to Europe, and of course India has high incidence of polio.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:20.006]  And I know it's caused by the vaccinations they're receiving over there.
[02:25:20.006 --> 02:25:22.710]  So my daughter is very intelligent, my son-in-law is very intelligent.
[02:25:23.288 --> 02:25:31.075]  And they respect me, they respect my knowledge, but I just can't get them to convince them, hey, don't give my granddaughter any vaccination.
[02:25:31.075 --> 02:25:32.396]  None of them are any good.
[02:25:32.396 --> 02:25:36.259]  Well, you know, the polio vaccine, I mean, we've run those right here on InfoWars.
[02:25:36.259 --> 02:25:38.201]  I'll ask you, Blair, for your comments in a second.
[02:25:38.201 --> 02:25:43.185]  I know you weren't involved in the vaccine division there, but the polio vaccine has had stealth viruses, SV40 in it.
[02:25:44.526 --> 02:25:44.666]  Well, I
[02:26:05.825 --> 02:26:16.456]  I tell you what, I was watching Alex's show a couple of weeks ago and he had the, I forgot the lady's name, who has that movie that's on Alex's website, The Common Good.
[02:26:16.456 --> 02:26:17.337]  Oh yes, right.
[02:26:19.206 --> 02:26:21.827]  Yeah, I don't recall her name at the moment either.
[02:26:21.827 --> 02:26:23.328]  Manoukian, right?
[02:26:23.328 --> 02:26:24.248]  Right, right, right.
[02:26:24.248 --> 02:26:31.251]  And, you know, I haven't seen the film, but I did see her interview and I found her interview captivating.
[02:26:31.251 --> 02:26:36.573]  I like the fact that, you know, she's not so skewed one way or the other.
[02:26:36.573 --> 02:26:39.314]  She's trying to bring both sides of the issue.
[02:26:39.614 --> 02:26:39.734]  Yeah.
[02:26:56.263 --> 02:26:57.404]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:57.404 --> 02:26:58.245]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:58.245 --> 02:27:03.530]  And I'm not sitting here trying to tempt one of your products.
[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:08.675]  But at the same time, information is power.
[02:27:08.675 --> 02:27:12.078]  Well, yeah, and I think it's important to hear both sides of the story.
[02:27:12.078 --> 02:27:15.501]  First, there's the deceptive, evil, lying pharma side.
[02:27:15.501 --> 02:27:17.143]  And then there's the truth side.
[02:27:17.683 --> 02:27:18.404]  To the story.
[02:27:18.404 --> 02:27:19.765]  So yeah, hear both sides.
[02:27:19.765 --> 02:27:29.054]  I mean, hey, if you want to believe folks out there, if you want to, you know, be injected with the DNA and RNA fragments from diseased animals, go ahead, get vaccinated.
[02:27:29.054 --> 02:27:32.337]  Bill Gates wants you to be a lower population.
[02:27:33.038 --> 02:27:35.900]  Infertility, reduce human population, you can be part of that.
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.841]  You win the Darwin Award.
[02:27:37.841 --> 02:27:41.183]  You can give yourself the Darwin Award by getting vaccinated.
[02:27:41.183 --> 02:27:42.123]  That's my answer to that.
[02:27:42.123 --> 02:27:44.264]  Let's take another call, Blair, because I love those calls.
[02:27:44.264 --> 02:27:46.485]  We've got Ed in Arizona now joining us.
[02:27:46.485 --> 02:27:48.226]  Ed, you're on the air with Blair Hamrick.
[02:27:48.226 --> 02:27:49.367]  Go ahead.
[02:27:49.367 --> 02:27:50.968]  Hey, great to talk to both of you guys.
[02:27:50.968 --> 02:27:55.971]  I just wanted to get your take on the massive drugging of the youth we have going on in America right now.
[02:27:55.971 --> 02:28:00.133]  I, as a teenager, was kind of rebellious, kind of questioning the system.
[02:28:00.782 --> 02:28:01.443]  I don't know.
[02:28:16.613 --> 02:28:22.539]  I mean, there's no way you can wake up if you're taking those drugs, so I just wanted to get your guys' take on that.
[02:28:22.539 --> 02:28:22.980]  Good point.
[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:24.081]  Go ahead, Blair.
[02:28:24.081 --> 02:28:32.791]  Well, I tell you what, you know, I mean, unfortunately, you know, what pharmaceutical companies have done to bastardize the research.
[02:28:33.451 --> 02:28:33.891]  I don't know.
[02:28:52.662 --> 02:28:55.644]  Whether it was a psychiatrist that did so.
[02:28:55.644 --> 02:29:02.489]  I mean, you know, unfortunately, these compounds have side effects and they're dangerous.
[02:29:02.489 --> 02:29:08.394]  So, you know, to cavalierly, I mean, I'm sure your parents were just trying to help you out.
[02:29:08.394 --> 02:29:15.019]  And because, you know, going through, you know, the problems of adolescence.
[02:29:15.019 --> 02:29:16.340]  But, you know, I mean,
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:21.823]  Yeah, because childhood is a disease, I guess.
[02:29:21.823 --> 02:29:23.964]  It's called the human condition.
[02:29:23.964 --> 02:29:26.366]  People get sad.
[02:29:26.366 --> 02:29:29.468]  Blair, we're out of time, but I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:29:29.468 --> 02:29:32.309]  It's been an inspiration to hear you telling the truth.
[02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:33.350]  You're awesome.
[02:29:33.350 --> 02:29:36.472]  Please keep us posted about the outcome with the Department of Justice.
[02:29:36.909 --> 02:29:37.349]  Will do.
[02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:38.790]  I really appreciate you having me.
[02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:39.130]  All right.
[02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:39.890]  Great to have you on.
[02:29:39.890 --> 02:29:41.811]  That was Blair Hamrick, everybody.
[02:29:41.811 --> 02:29:43.112]  And I'll talk to you after the show, Blair.
[02:29:43.112 --> 02:29:44.692]  Just touch base with you.
[02:29:44.692 --> 02:29:46.893]  A great guy just willing to tell the truth.
[02:29:46.893 --> 02:29:47.374]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.374 --> 02:29:50.415]  A lot more straight ahead.
[02:29:50.415 --> 02:29:51.816]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:54.337]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.337 --> 02:29:57.018]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.183 --> 02:30:11.286]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal-Ben Soap Company.

[02:30:57.036 --> 02:30:57.261]  Yeah.
[02:31:00.762 --> 02:31:05.305]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.305 --> 02:31:06.226]  Number one.
[02:31:06.226 --> 02:31:09.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.648 --> 02:31:10.509]  Number two.
[02:31:10.509 --> 02:31:15.392]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.392 --> 02:31:16.152]  It's true.
[02:31:16.152 --> 02:31:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.016 --> 02:31:21.836]  Number three.
[02:31:21.836 --> 02:31:25.418]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.418 --> 02:31:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.321 --> 02:31:30.122]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.122 --> 02:31:32.885]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.885 --> 02:31:36.569]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.569 --> 02:31:37.349]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:41.514]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.514 --> 02:31:46.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.539 --> 02:31:50.726]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.726 --> 02:31:52.509]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:01.087 --> 02:32:02.308]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:32:02.308 --> 02:32:03.809]  What does freedom mean to you?
[02:32:03.809 --> 02:32:04.710]  The freedom to choose?
[02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:05.671]  The freedom to vote?
[02:32:05.671 --> 02:32:06.671]  The freedom to worship?
[02:32:06.671 --> 02:32:08.873]  How about the freedom to take control of your own future?
[02:32:08.873 --> 02:32:14.377]  My friends at eFoods Direct are celebrating freedom this month while helping you take control of your greatest dependency, food.

[02:33:01.471 --> 02:33:06.514]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.123 --> 02:33:14.704]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.704 --> 02:33:15.564]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:33:15.564 --> 02:33:18.546]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filming in here.
[02:33:18.546 --> 02:33:23.888]  And by the way, you know, I heard an ad on GCN during the previous segment.
[02:33:23.888 --> 02:33:26.849]  I just want to give a shout out to the stuff that I know works.
[02:33:26.849 --> 02:33:29.391]  That was an ad from Ty Bollinger with Carnivora.
[02:33:30.231 --> 02:33:31.192]  That's the real deal.
[02:33:31.192 --> 02:33:39.100]  You know, a lot of the products actually that get promoted on InfoWars are things that I've done research on previously, sometimes years ago.
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:41.843]  For example, the Mahdi Phylan.
[02:33:41.843 --> 02:33:47.810]  I interviewed the founder of that company years ago and talked about it and really researched it.
[02:33:47.810 --> 02:33:49.031]  It's the real deal too.
[02:33:49.031 --> 02:33:51.934]  Brown seaweed extract and the carnivora.
[02:33:52.975 --> 02:33:53.596]  These are powerful.
[02:33:53.596 --> 02:33:59.241]  They can't even tell you in the ad everything it does because of FDA regulations, but really good stuff.
[02:33:59.241 --> 02:34:01.543]  So here's what we're going to do for this segment for the rest of the show.
[02:34:02.639 --> 02:34:06.342]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls, and at this point, it's a free-for-all.
[02:34:06.342 --> 02:34:11.086]  You can talk about the issues from the first hour, the gun confiscation.
[02:34:11.086 --> 02:34:13.628]  You can talk about healthcare and medicine, anything you want.
[02:34:13.628 --> 02:34:17.711]  You can ask me a question, and then I'm going to intersperse that with some additional breaking news.
[02:34:17.711 --> 02:34:22.235]  But just very quickly, LemonadeFreedom.com is something you need to check out.
[02:34:22.235 --> 02:34:23.276]  That's coming up August 18th.
[02:34:24.617 --> 02:34:31.983]  A protest about being able to sell lemonade in a lemonade stand without being harassed by local police.
[02:34:31.983 --> 02:34:36.087]  I've also got news about BPA, but not what you think.
[02:34:36.087 --> 02:34:43.252]  It turns out that all these BPA-free bottles now, many of them are using something worse, BPS.
[02:34:44.284 --> 02:34:47.105]  Yeah, it's a different chemical.
[02:34:47.105 --> 02:34:55.668]  And by some studies, it is, what, 15 or 19 times more absorbable in the skin than BPA, and it may be just as toxic.
[02:34:55.668 --> 02:34:57.929]  It's another hormone mimicking chemical.
[02:34:57.929 --> 02:35:10.814]  So now, when BPA got a bad rep, then a lot of these companies said they reformulated with BPS and then started claiming BPA-free on their products or their grocery receipts.
[02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:13.521]  And that's another big source, by the way.
[02:35:13.521 --> 02:35:22.103]  If you go to the grocery store or anywhere that you get one of those receipts that's kind of slick, that is loaded with toxic BPA or BPS.
[02:35:22.103 --> 02:35:27.205]  So if you handle those receipts, wash your hands before eating anything.
[02:35:27.205 --> 02:35:29.326]  Do not touch food after touching those receipts.
[02:35:30.226 --> 02:35:33.408]  Or, you might.
[02:35:33.408 --> 02:35:39.792]  You might become, well, if you're a male, you might get literally, chemically, hormonally feminized.
[02:35:39.792 --> 02:35:42.074]  That's what the chemicals do.
[02:35:42.074 --> 02:35:44.695]  You know, say what you want, but that's what the chemicals do.
[02:35:44.695 --> 02:35:51.860]  It's cause and effect in basic biochemistry, but now let's go to the first caller that we've got in the queue here.
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:56.723]  Sky in North Carolina is, now you're on the line with Mike Adams here.
[02:35:56.723 --> 02:35:57.684]  Hello Sky, how you doing?
[02:35:58.550 --> 02:36:00.051]  Hey Mike, good to talk to you.
[02:36:00.051 --> 02:36:03.293]  My question was for Blair, but you probably can answer it.
[02:36:03.293 --> 02:36:10.498]  I'm calling to get like an information download on the drug Cymbalta or the drug maker that makes Cymbalta.
[02:36:10.498 --> 02:36:12.319]  My grandma just recently fell ill.
[02:36:12.319 --> 02:36:13.901]  She's been to three major hospitals.
[02:36:13.901 --> 02:36:16.002]  Nobody, no doctor can tell what's wrong with her.
[02:36:16.002 --> 02:36:18.123]  They just, they can't figure it out.
[02:36:18.123 --> 02:36:23.367]  And I'm looking at her medical records and I'm seeing where they prescribed Cymbalta to her for no real reason.
[02:36:23.367 --> 02:36:25.949]  And then right then when she started taking that drug,
[02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:29.270]  She just went into a zombie coma state.
[02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:31.450]  I was wondering if you knew anything about that.
[02:36:31.450 --> 02:36:38.512]  I'm not going to comment specifically on a brand name drug like that, but you can do your own research and that's what I encourage you to do.
[02:36:38.512 --> 02:36:44.093]  Search for Cymbalta side effects or Cymbalta clinical trials.
[02:36:44.093 --> 02:36:46.154]  You sound like a very well informed, intelligent guy.
[02:36:46.154 --> 02:36:47.734]  You'll be able to do some research and find out.
[02:36:48.334 --> 02:36:54.297]  And then, hey, ask for the package insert from the physician, and read the side effects right in the package insert.
[02:36:54.297 --> 02:36:58.279]  Most physicians haven't even read that insert, so that'll give you a wealth of information.
[02:36:58.279 --> 02:37:05.783]  You might be able to find that that insert states the side effect that your, was it your mother experiencing, or your grandmother?
[02:37:05.783 --> 02:37:16.068]  Talking about on the show, we can't really trust those inserts, or we can't trust what I can look up and find, because the studies and tests were all BS, basically.
[02:37:16.556 --> 02:37:18.377]  But the inserts will list the side effects.
[02:37:18.377 --> 02:37:21.638]  They are required to list the side effects that normally aren't talked about in the advertising.
[02:37:21.638 --> 02:37:26.039]  So go ahead and do that job, and I think you're correct to be skeptical.
[02:37:26.039 --> 02:37:27.699]  Let me just, I'll leave it at that.
[02:37:27.699 --> 02:37:37.783]  I wouldn't take that drug myself, and if I had a family member that was on that drug, or basically almost any pharmaceutical, I would encourage them to find safer alternatives to get off of those drugs.
[02:37:37.783 --> 02:37:42.624]  Let's go to another caller, and thank you for your call, Skye, but let's go to Sheldon in Wisconsin.
[02:37:42.624 --> 02:37:44.885]  Sheldon, you're on the air on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:44.885 --> 02:37:45.405]  Go ahead, please.
[02:37:46.502 --> 02:37:48.524]  Hi, I have a question for you.
[02:37:48.524 --> 02:38:00.155]  I work in an inner city clinic, and I've noticed that a lot of our kids are over-vaccinated, their mammograms are off the chain and everything like that.
[02:38:00.155 --> 02:38:01.136]  But here's my question.
[02:38:02.017 --> 02:38:05.640]  I was telling a bunch of my friends about apricot seeds.
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.463]  How I would eat, I would crack open the core of the apricot and eat the seeds out of it.
[02:38:09.463 --> 02:38:10.584]  Yep.
[02:38:10.584 --> 02:38:18.731]  And a friend of mine was telling me about a physician who overdosed off the cyanide poisoning of apricot seeds.
[02:38:19.483 --> 02:38:21.924]  Is there anything to that?
[02:38:21.924 --> 02:38:24.105]  I don't know.
[02:38:24.105 --> 02:38:26.966]  You know, it sounds like a scare tactic.
[02:38:26.966 --> 02:38:33.528]  I've eaten lots of apricot seeds in the past and they do contain what's sometimes called vitamin B-17 or laetrile.
[02:38:33.528 --> 02:38:37.049]  In fact, our earlier guest, Ed Griffin, has an entire book on that.
[02:38:37.049 --> 02:38:39.510]  I think it's called The War on Cancer.
[02:38:41.811 --> 02:38:45.512]  I forgot the exact title of it, but you can check that information out by Ed Griffin.
[02:38:45.512 --> 02:38:49.953]  It is basically a natural chemotherapy agent.
[02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:53.454]  Now, has somebody ever been harmed by it?
[02:38:53.454 --> 02:38:57.575]  I don't know, but they try to tell these scare stories about colloidal silver.
[02:38:57.575 --> 02:39:03.337]  They try to scare people away from colloidal silver with these myths that it'll do weird things to you.
[02:39:03.797 --> 02:39:05.458]  That's complete disinfo.
[02:39:05.458 --> 02:39:08.479]  The real threat is the pharmaceuticals and the vaccines.
[02:39:08.479 --> 02:39:13.360]  And you get things from nature, they tend to be orders of magnitude safer and more effective.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.182]  So I've eaten many of those apricot seeds myself.
[02:39:17.182 --> 02:39:18.282]  Hey, I'm still here.
[02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:22.083]  I have no cancer, I have no health insurance, and I don't have a doctor.
[02:39:22.083 --> 02:39:24.144]  Not looking to get one anytime soon either.
[02:39:24.144 --> 02:39:27.225]  I'd rather eat something out of nature than out of a pharmaceutical lab.
[02:39:27.225 --> 02:39:28.385]  So that's a good question from you.
[02:39:28.385 --> 02:39:29.466]  Thanks for bringing that up.
[02:39:29.466 --> 02:39:32.227]  Craig in Oklahoma, you are on the air.
[02:39:32.227 --> 02:39:32.987]  Craig, go ahead please.
[02:39:34.252 --> 02:39:38.294]  Mike, howdy from above the Red River from you.
[02:39:38.294 --> 02:39:49.941]  I wanted to comment on, I'm a recently disabled peer support specialist for the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services in Oklahoma.
[02:39:49.941 --> 02:39:50.421]  Yes.
[02:39:50.421 --> 02:40:00.187]  So I'm no longer employed there and I'm so glad to get a hold of you because with Big Pharma coming under the microscope like they are,
[02:40:01.576 --> 02:40:05.558]  I'm kind of tying in something as far as a conspiracy.
[02:40:05.558 --> 02:40:13.480]  Mike, in 1963, the State Memorial Hospital in Oklahoma had over 2,000 beds.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:19.723]  Today, there are only a little over 100 beds at the State Mental Hospital.
[02:40:19.723 --> 02:40:24.344]  Now, let me tell you something that's wrong with this picture.
[02:40:24.344 --> 02:40:26.145]  The state's number one
[02:40:26.909 --> 02:40:39.292]  Number one expenditure compared to any and all expenditures combined in the state of Oklahoma for psychotropic medications is the Oklahoma County Jail.
[02:40:39.292 --> 02:40:46.854]  And I've written Senator Coburn, I've written Senator Sparks, Coburn's a U.S.
[02:40:46.854 --> 02:40:52.415]  Senator Sparks, and I always get this really good feedback from them, but nobody seems to want to
[02:40:53.379 --> 02:40:56.862]  You know, to get this information published.
[02:40:56.862 --> 02:40:58.523]  Wait, what's the thrust of it?
[02:40:58.523 --> 02:41:02.586]  You're saying that the top two expenditures are jails and mind-altering drugs?
[02:41:02.586 --> 02:41:05.308]  Is that the thrust of your call?
[02:41:05.308 --> 02:41:06.148]  No, pharma.
[02:41:06.148 --> 02:41:08.250]  Pharma, psychotropic medications.
[02:41:08.250 --> 02:41:09.831]  Yeah, yeah, pharma.
[02:41:09.831 --> 02:41:16.276]  The state of Oklahoma's number one expenditure force for psychotropic medications.
[02:41:17.717 --> 02:41:21.261]  It's not the mental health service combined or anything.
[02:41:21.261 --> 02:41:24.565]  The number one expenditure is the drugs.
[02:41:24.565 --> 02:41:28.410]  Oklahoma and Tulsa County jails.
[02:41:28.410 --> 02:41:32.015]  Well, okay, I think you're right on, but the point is...
[02:41:32.876 --> 02:41:44.108]  These states, these states are going broke under the corrupt, the collapsing society that they're building, which is going to be prison run.
[02:41:44.108 --> 02:41:45.630]  You know, everybody's going to be thrown in prison.
[02:41:45.630 --> 02:41:49.274]  And if you don't go along with the system, you've got to be on your psychotropic drugs.
[02:41:49.274 --> 02:41:52.257]  You're going to be considered mentally unhealthy.
[02:41:52.777 --> 02:41:56.160]  Or mentally impaired if you oppose authority.
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:56.921]  That's another thing.
[02:41:56.921 --> 02:42:05.528]  In fact, the DSM, for the psychiatry industry, has a disorder called oppositional defiance disorder, or ODD.
[02:42:05.528 --> 02:42:12.194]  That means if you are against authority in any way, for example, the government says you gotta
[02:42:13.315 --> 02:42:24.019]  You gotta start recycling your plastic bottles, and you say, no I don't, then you get diagnosed with an oppositional defiance disorder, put on psychiatric drugs, and perhaps thrown in one of these jails.
[02:42:24.019 --> 02:42:25.040]  Thank you for your call, by the way.
[02:42:26.149 --> 02:42:35.412]  It's a good point on what the priorities are in society now and why we've got to change that and get back to liberty, to freedom, to health, to raising healthy children and keeping them informed.
[02:42:35.412 --> 02:42:39.493]  I'm going to go to another call in just a second, but first let me read you a news story.
[02:42:39.493 --> 02:42:45.855]  The FDA has been caught spying on emails of its own scientists in a huge surveillance operation.
[02:42:45.855 --> 02:42:48.296]  That's up now on the web.
[02:42:48.296 --> 02:42:52.957]  Infowars.com, naturalnews.com is carrying that story.
[02:42:52.957 --> 02:42:54.018]  Also, check this out.
[02:42:54.978 --> 02:43:01.404]  The USDA has published a graph that is the adoption of genetically engineered crops in the US.
[02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:05.127]  Let me give you some light here in the studio in case you want to get a shot of that.
[02:43:05.127 --> 02:43:11.193]  It shows that these three main crops, soybeans, cotton, and corn, are headed toward 100%
[02:43:13.575 --> 02:43:13.655]  I'm
[02:43:31.024 --> 02:43:34.505]  Herbicide tolerant crops others are insect resistant crops.
[02:43:34.505 --> 02:43:59.395]  They're all genetically modified now We're showing the graph on screen for you right there This is right out of the USDA and you see all these all these lines going straight up into the hundred percent or approaching 100% range that means very soon if we don't stop this thing guys and gals everybody listening if we don't stop this genetic pollution and this this agricultural intellectual imperialism this this
[02:44:00.235 --> 02:44:03.578]  Destructive genetic approach to agriculture.
[02:44:03.578 --> 02:44:10.364]  We're going to end up with a hundred percent of the soybeans, corns, corn and cotton all being genetically modified.
[02:44:10.364 --> 02:44:11.665]  Let's go to another caller.
[02:44:11.665 --> 02:44:12.926]  Allie in Illinois.
[02:44:12.926 --> 02:44:13.806]  You're on the air.
[02:44:13.806 --> 02:44:14.287]  Go ahead, Allie.
[02:44:15.663 --> 02:44:16.283]  Hi, Mike.
[02:44:16.283 --> 02:44:17.644]  It's so nice to talk to you.
[02:44:17.644 --> 02:44:29.011]  I listen to the show every day and I've never called in before, but when I heard Blair's story, I had to call in because I used to work for a company that managed that speaker bureau program.
[02:44:29.011 --> 02:44:29.491]  Really?
[02:44:29.491 --> 02:44:30.231]  Tell us more.
[02:44:30.231 --> 02:44:31.012]  Yes.
[02:44:31.012 --> 02:44:39.877]  Well, they paid out, we paid out those honorariums, quote unquote, to speakers to go around and tell other doctors to prescribe.
[02:44:39.877 --> 02:44:44.400]  And get this, the company's name that I worked for was called Scientific Voice.
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:47.721]  That's some Orwellian speak right there.
[02:44:47.721 --> 02:44:57.643]  But we would pay them up to $3,200 for an hour's worth of work, and these doctors got to think that they were rock stars.
[02:44:57.643 --> 02:45:04.145]  They would go around thinking that they were so cool, and I mean, making a living off of talking to other doctors.
[02:45:04.145 --> 02:45:07.866]  And honestly, the only thing bigger than their heads was their wallets.
[02:45:08.266 --> 02:45:11.389]  They were so egotistical and so rich from it.
[02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:12.189]  It was insane.
[02:45:12.189 --> 02:45:13.771]  Well, this is awesome that you called, Allie.
[02:45:13.771 --> 02:45:15.352]  Let me ask you some more questions then.
[02:45:15.352 --> 02:45:25.200]  So your company was the in-between, like a pharma company would hire your company to sign up a lot of doctors to be speakers and would manage that relationship?
[02:45:26.184 --> 02:45:30.650]  Exactly, and we would try to manage all of the little regulations in between.
[02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:38.941]  What Blair was saying earlier also about the slide presentations that the doctors would use, absolutely those were written by the marketing people.
[02:45:38.941 --> 02:45:43.887]  My direct clients were the marketing people at Sanofi Aventis, AstraZeneca, Wyeth.
[02:45:45.929 --> 02:45:46.549]  Absolutely.
[02:45:46.549 --> 02:45:49.090]  The doctors were paid to prescribe.
[02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:50.871]  Wow.
[02:45:50.871 --> 02:45:52.472]  What was the behavior of the doctors?
[02:45:52.472 --> 02:45:55.554]  Were they willing to sell out to get this money?
[02:45:55.554 --> 02:45:56.955]  What was their attitude about all this?
[02:45:57.904 --> 02:45:58.644]  Are you kidding me?
[02:45:58.644 --> 02:45:59.705]  They loved it!
[02:45:59.705 --> 02:46:05.427]  They would, like, tack on these speeches into a vacation!
[02:46:05.427 --> 02:46:17.071]  They would go off, they would have dinner, lunch, breakfast with other doctors, and then get the hotel paid for them, get their airfare paid, and they would take a couple of days also extra and just go on vacation!
[02:46:18.090 --> 02:46:21.895]  And these are the people responsible for your health, many people believe.
[02:46:21.895 --> 02:46:22.615]  Remember that, folks.
[02:46:22.615 --> 02:46:27.060]  When you go see your doctor, you're probably dealing with a criminal who accepted bribes.
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:27.641]  That's what these are.
[02:46:27.641 --> 02:46:28.182]  These are bribes.
[02:46:28.182 --> 02:46:29.343]  These are kickbacks.
[02:46:29.343 --> 02:46:31.285]  But they were never talked about that way, right, Ali?
[02:46:31.285 --> 02:46:33.568]  They were just sort of honorariums, that kind of language.
[02:46:34.608 --> 02:46:39.769]  Absolutely, and it's so funny because I'm sure all of the listeners right now are shocked by this.
[02:46:39.769 --> 02:46:42.650]  This was every day obvious for us.
[02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:44.550]  I knew it was wrong in my heart and my soul.
[02:46:44.550 --> 02:46:57.413]  I knew that this was wrong, which is why I had to get out of it, but it was so blatantly obvious what was going on, but everybody just like, she kept walking toward the edge of the cliff, just kept doing it, just didn't care.
[02:46:57.413 --> 02:46:59.814]  I mean, the doctors wanted the money, the rep,
[02:47:00.334 --> 02:47:00.715]  We're good to go.
[02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:18.914]  So Ali, we're not going to break yet, but when we do, could you stay on the line?
[02:47:18.914 --> 02:47:22.776]  We want to get your number and talk to you off the air.
[02:47:22.776 --> 02:47:26.879]  You know, you don't have to share your name or make it public or anything, but I'd like to talk to you more.
[02:47:26.879 --> 02:47:30.982]  It sounds like you know some other inside details that the public needs to know about this.
[02:47:30.982 --> 02:47:33.204]  Would you be willing to give our producers your phone number?
[02:47:34.065 --> 02:47:35.625]  Sure, I'd love to talk to you guys.
[02:47:35.625 --> 02:47:36.906]  Okay, okay, great.
[02:47:36.906 --> 02:47:38.446]  Just don't give it live on the air.
[02:47:38.446 --> 02:47:39.806]  You get a million calls.
[02:47:39.806 --> 02:47:41.747]  But, so let me ask you some other questions.
[02:47:41.747 --> 02:47:47.528]  So how many doctors overall did your company deal with in your estimation?
[02:47:47.528 --> 02:47:51.389]  I mean, per, it was doctors for each and every single drug.
[02:47:51.389 --> 02:48:00.331]  So it was the, you know, for instance, Sanofi Aventis had their overall list of quote-unquote speakers, and then each individual drug had their speakers.
[02:48:00.331 --> 02:48:02.152]  It had to be thousands.
[02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:04.473]  How?
[02:48:04.473 --> 02:48:10.144]  And what was the highest amount that you saw paid to doctors for these speaking gigs?
[02:48:12.033 --> 02:48:14.915]  3200 was the highest I ever saw.
[02:48:14.915 --> 02:48:34.252]  Well it was for, usually that was for a day's work, but I mean they could very easily, there were some times where they would make up to maybe $1500-$1800 for an hour for a visit, a lunch, breakfast or dinner, but they could go do a breakfast and then a lunch and then a dinner, stack it up and all of a sudden they're racking up
[02:48:34.452 --> 02:48:37.895]  Yeah, that's what Blair was telling us, exactly that.
[02:48:37.895 --> 02:49:00.951]  They would do a breakfast speech, a lunch speech, a dinner speech, and of course all the meals are paid for by the drug company, the travel was paid for, the hotel was paid for, even other things, you know, like tickets to concerts and baseball games and Disneyland and places like that were paid for by the drug companies, and then the doctor would walk home from this vacation with an extra, you know, 12 grand in their pocket for two days of giving speeches while they eat.
[02:49:02.185 --> 02:49:03.066]  Absolutely.
[02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:06.129]  There were so many little things that they could get reimbursed for.
[02:49:06.129 --> 02:49:13.596]  Dry cleaning, meals at the airport, just anything that was incidental toward the trip they got picked up to.
[02:49:13.596 --> 02:49:15.658]  So what was your position then?
[02:49:15.658 --> 02:49:19.902]  Were you recruiting doctors or what exactly did you do?
[02:49:20.854 --> 02:49:27.516]  Yes, I would recruit the doctors based on the pharmaceutical reps' suggestions.
[02:49:27.516 --> 02:49:39.180]  So they might find a doctor who they thought was in on the deal, so they'd submit their paperwork to get this doctor signed up to be on the Speakers Bureau, and then I would just physically coordinate the meetings and cut the checks.
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:43.642]  So I would set up to get the Speakers airfare, hotel,
[02:49:44.442 --> 02:49:49.427]  Um, and get him the slide presentation, everything he needed to do to go to this meeting.
[02:49:49.427 --> 02:49:53.170]  I would set up the on-site meeting, um, you know, all of the little details.
[02:49:53.170 --> 02:49:56.132]  I mean, it might be a meeting that had 50, 60 people.
[02:49:56.132 --> 02:49:58.654]  It might be one doctor, like Blair was saying.
[02:49:58.654 --> 02:50:02.338]  There were times where the doctor would get paid two grand to go talk to one guy.
[02:50:05.003 --> 02:50:09.704]  Wow, that's funny because I volunteer here to talk to two million people.
[02:50:09.704 --> 02:50:15.085]  I do it because I believe in liberty, but these doctors are just pocketing money to tell lies about pharma.
[02:50:15.085 --> 02:50:16.606]  It's all propaganda education.
[02:50:16.606 --> 02:50:17.046]  Amazing.
[02:50:17.046 --> 02:50:19.846]  Absolutely.
[02:50:19.846 --> 02:50:20.286]  Unbelievable.
[02:50:20.286 --> 02:50:21.387]  I'm really glad you called.
[02:50:21.387 --> 02:50:26.788]  So, you said in your heart you felt you knew this was wrong.
[02:50:26.788 --> 02:50:28.908]  Did you eventually leave because of that?
[02:50:28.908 --> 02:50:31.109]  Obviously you're not working with that organization anymore.
[02:50:31.109 --> 02:50:31.529]  What happened?
[02:50:33.735 --> 02:50:34.215]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.209 --> 02:51:05.773]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:51:05.773 --> 02:51:10.096]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:51:10.096 --> 02:51:14.940]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:51:16.647 --> 02:51:22.228]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:22.228 --> 02:51:25.829]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:51:25.829 --> 02:51:30.530]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:33.290]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:51:33.290 --> 02:51:37.751]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:51:37.751 --> 02:51:41.612]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:51:41.892 --> 02:51:46.894]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:53:00.461 --> 02:53:08.807]  We all know there are secrets behind closed doors in every relationship, and one of the biggest is that men are losing libido, or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40.
[02:53:08.807 --> 02:53:11.389]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.
[02:53:11.389 --> 02:53:14.611]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every way.
[02:53:14.611 --> 02:53:16.153]  That's why we created TGen.
[02:53:16.153 --> 02:53:20.676]  TGen is an all-natural formula with ingredients proven to boost your own testosterone.
[02:53:20.916 --> 02:53:25.418]  Optimum testosterone levels mean better mood, energy, and of course, better sex life.

[02:53:54.819 --> 02:53:54.859]  800-577-8644.
[02:54:14.707 --> 02:54:25.755]  Alright, continuing here with our caller, Ali, who helped coordinate these kickbacks, these what have been called bribes to doctors, these so-called speaking fees.
[02:54:25.755 --> 02:54:31.099]  You know, here's what's going on here, folks, and you're getting this here first on InfoWars.com, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:34.823]  There is a revolution taking place in medicine.
[02:54:34.823 --> 02:54:41.290]  The exposing of the pharma crimes, the mafia, the corruption, it's all coming out.
[02:54:41.290 --> 02:54:54.444]  The whole thing is a facade of just disinformation, falsified clinical trials, doctors getting kickbacks, FDA bureaucrats getting paid off, CDC officials getting lucrative multi-million dollar jobs with the vaccine manufacturers.
[02:54:54.904 --> 02:54:58.967]  It is a giant orgy of corruption that's called medicine.
[02:54:58.967 --> 02:55:12.037]  And if you take that medicine out there, folks, if you take these drugs, if you take these vaccines, you are a sucker of these industries who are using your body to make profits for their own rich, filthy rich executives.
[02:55:12.037 --> 02:55:14.298]  You are a sucker if you fall for that.
[02:55:14.298 --> 02:55:20.323]  And the doctors are going to line you up for it, too, because they're making money under the table at the same time.
[02:55:20.323 --> 02:55:21.423]  You trust your doctor?
[02:55:21.423 --> 02:55:22.004]  You're a fool.
[02:55:22.304 --> 02:55:23.925]  Let me tell you, you trust your doctor?
[02:55:23.925 --> 02:55:29.467]  Unless that doctor is into holistic health and alternative complementary medicine and understands nutrition.
[02:55:29.467 --> 02:55:34.609]  If you trust a mainstream drug-taking, drug-pimping doctor, you're a fool.
[02:55:34.609 --> 02:55:35.690]  And yeah, you can quote me on that.
[02:55:35.690 --> 02:55:38.371]  And we're going to continue with Allie right here, who's on the phone.
[02:55:38.371 --> 02:55:42.072]  Allie, amazing information that you were bringing to us.
[02:55:42.072 --> 02:55:49.555]  It just backs up everything else that we've been talking about here with Blair Hamrick, the Glaxo whistleblower, all the other information that's coming out.
[02:55:49.555 --> 02:55:51.076]  What do you think about the big picture, Allie?
[02:55:52.401 --> 02:55:58.643]  Well, I think, as you said, don't let them use your body, but more importantly, don't let them use your mind either.
[02:55:58.643 --> 02:56:09.706]  As I was saying before we broke, I was just a young kid doing this job, and I just needed the money, and as I got deeper and deeper into it, I worked for the company for three to four years.
[02:56:09.706 --> 02:56:10.466]  I knew it was wrong.
[02:56:10.466 --> 02:56:12.086]  I was unhappy every day.
[02:56:12.086 --> 02:56:15.707]  I just felt bad and icky in my soul, so I got out.
[02:56:15.707 --> 02:56:16.867]  I started my own business.
[02:56:18.848 --> 02:56:20.629]  I bet you made less money, but your soul felt better for it.
[02:56:20.629 --> 02:56:21.649]  Is that accurate?
[02:56:21.649 --> 02:56:21.829]  Yeah.
[02:56:44.685 --> 02:56:47.210]  What do your family and friends say about all this?
[02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:49.435]  Are they aware of what you just shared with us?
[02:56:49.435 --> 02:56:50.317]  That all this is going on?
[02:56:50.317 --> 02:56:52.161]  Or is it just this big secret that nobody talks about?
[02:56:53.146 --> 02:56:57.929]  I think my, you know, I only really have my parents, and they're very skeptical as well.
[02:56:57.929 --> 02:57:00.691]  So, to them, it's, yeah, they kind of get it.
[02:57:00.691 --> 02:57:01.872]  It's no big surprise.
[02:57:01.872 --> 02:57:06.475]  I mean, here in the Midwest, it's the secret that everybody knows, but nobody talks about.
[02:57:06.475 --> 02:57:08.097]  Everybody knows.
[02:57:08.097 --> 02:57:09.337]  It's the Leonard Cohen song.
[02:57:09.337 --> 02:57:14.181]  Everybody knows that ICE are loaded, and it's just time to start talking out about it.
[02:57:14.181 --> 02:57:17.163]  It's time to start making life changes about it.
[02:57:17.777 --> 02:57:18.318]  Absolutely.
[02:57:18.318 --> 02:57:21.040]  It's time to catalyze the whistleblowers.
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:23.942]  It's time to unleash that truth-telling everywhere.
[02:57:23.942 --> 02:57:27.584]  Why, you know, why bury your head in the sand out there, folks?
[02:57:27.584 --> 02:57:29.266]  There's no more need for that.
[02:57:29.266 --> 02:57:36.791]  If everybody just told the truth, we could eliminate the corruption, eliminate the fraud, eliminate the suffering, bring back liberty, bring back honesty, honest medicine.
[02:57:36.791 --> 02:57:40.194]  Hey, what about free market medicine, you know, so people have a real choice?
[02:57:40.194 --> 02:57:41.515]  That's what we need to bring back.
[02:57:41.515 --> 02:57:45.498]  Ali, you sound like a very credible whistleblower.
[02:57:45.498 --> 02:57:46.879]  I really appreciate you bringing your
[02:57:47.499 --> 02:57:54.801]  Just thank you for letting me talk.
[02:57:54.801 --> 02:57:55.762]  I love Alex.
[02:57:55.762 --> 02:57:56.282]  I love you.
[02:57:56.282 --> 02:57:57.682]  I listen to the show every day.
[02:57:57.682 --> 02:57:58.643]  I never call in.
[02:57:58.643 --> 02:58:04.445]  I'm a little shy, but I finally heard Blair talking today and I thought, if there's any day to call, it's today.
[02:58:04.445 --> 02:58:10.026]  So I hope that the information has been helpful to you guys and best of luck, best wishes.
[02:58:10.026 --> 02:58:11.347]  God bless you for everything you've done.
[02:58:11.823 --> 02:58:12.683]  Thank you, Ali.
[02:58:12.683 --> 02:58:13.944]  And you don't sound shy at all.
[02:58:13.944 --> 02:58:18.947]  You sound like you should have been in the InfoWars reporter contest video or something, actually.
[02:58:18.947 --> 02:58:19.887]  So you're doing a great job.
[02:58:19.887 --> 02:58:21.088]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:58:21.088 --> 02:58:23.569]  And everybody out there listening, thank you for watching.
[02:58:23.569 --> 02:58:30.853]  We're going to continue, by the way, with just five minutes of OverDrive today, just to finish up some of the news we didn't have a chance to get to.
[02:58:30.853 --> 02:58:33.874]  But for everybody else, retransmission begins now.

[02:59:52.162 --> 02:59:55.744]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.744 --> 02:59:58.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.844 --> 03:00:18.246]  All right, continuing here with just a few minutes of overdrive.
[03:00:18.246 --> 03:00:21.488]  This is Mike Adams filling in today for Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.488 --> 03:00:27.232]  I wanted to just take a little bit of time here because there's so many issues we did not have a chance to cover.
[03:00:27.232 --> 03:00:28.712]  But wow, what a show!
[03:00:28.712 --> 03:00:30.213]  What a show today!
[03:00:30.213 --> 03:00:35.717]  I don't know what you think about it, but I thought we had some great guests, some great information that got shared out there with the public.
[03:00:36.317 --> 03:00:38.238]  You know, look, things are changing.
[03:00:38.238 --> 03:00:40.400]  The transformation is upon us.
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:48.405]  The global police state is getting desperate to try to shut down free speech precisely because this kind of information is coming out.
[03:00:48.405 --> 03:00:50.967]  The truth about the drug industry is coming out.
[03:00:50.967 --> 03:00:52.608]  It's complete fraud.
[03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:58.172]  It is just a system of kickbacks and payoffs and corruption with everybody on the take.
[03:00:58.172 --> 03:01:05.537]  As long as they make their money, they're willing to sacrifice the health of some child who's going to go into a seizure and be paralyzed or dead from a vaccine.
[03:01:05.537 --> 03:01:06.097]  They don't care.
[03:01:06.817 --> 03:01:14.742]  As long as they make their money and they can buy their Mercedes and they can get their fancy house, they don't care what happens to you and your children, alright?
[03:01:14.742 --> 03:01:15.842]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[03:01:15.842 --> 03:01:24.247]  It is an evil, kind of destructive, almost an infestation of the human spirit that has happened with these people.
[03:01:24.247 --> 03:01:29.270]  They've been taken over by, I mean, almost literally demonic forces of some kind.
[03:01:29.270 --> 03:01:29.950]  It's that bad.
[03:01:29.950 --> 03:01:32.212]  I mean, who on earth
[03:01:33.072 --> 03:01:42.039]  Would sacrifice the health of children or senior citizens just so they can make an extra buck selling another few billion dollars worth of pharmaceuticals and vaccines?
[03:01:42.039 --> 03:01:42.620]  Who would do that?
[03:01:43.644 --> 03:01:44.945]  I hope you wouldn't do that.
[03:01:44.945 --> 03:01:46.086]  I would never do that.
[03:01:46.086 --> 03:01:50.389]  I think most listeners to the Alex Jones Show would not do that.
[03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:51.470]  Because you have ethics.
[03:01:51.470 --> 03:01:52.911]  Because you have a heart.
[03:01:52.911 --> 03:01:58.455]  Because you know there is eternal judgment on your actions in this life, right?
[03:01:58.455 --> 03:01:59.716]  You know there's going to be a record.
[03:01:59.716 --> 03:02:04.620]  A record is kept of everything you do, and you will be held to account for it.
[03:02:05.626 --> 03:02:07.247]  Let's get to some other stories here.
[03:02:07.247 --> 03:02:09.870]  This is by Kurt Nimmo up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:02:09.870 --> 03:02:13.954]  Iran accuses US of using weather weapons.
[03:02:13.954 --> 03:02:18.137]  I wanted to get to this during the show, but this is fascinating.
[03:02:18.137 --> 03:02:20.900]  And Iran is right now experiencing its worst drought since 1964.
[03:02:22.421 --> 03:02:23.981]  Now here's the other thought on this.
[03:02:23.981 --> 03:02:24.542]  If the U.S.
[03:02:24.542 --> 03:02:28.763]  has these weather weapons, is it using them against the U.S.
[03:02:28.763 --> 03:02:33.664]  heartland right now to destroy the corn supply, the food supply?
[03:02:33.664 --> 03:02:36.705]  It's being crushed by about 60%, maybe 70%.
[03:02:36.705 --> 03:02:39.306]  Could be even worse before this is over.
[03:02:39.306 --> 03:02:45.908]  So are they being used against the domestic population and the farmers in America today?
[03:02:45.908 --> 03:02:46.728]  Maybe so.
[03:02:46.728 --> 03:02:47.028]  I don't know.
[03:02:47.028 --> 03:02:48.929]  Maybe that's another show.
[03:02:48.929 --> 03:02:49.469]  Let me go to this one.
[03:02:51.085 --> 03:02:56.974]  A business leader is hit back at Obama after he says the wealthy aren't responsible for their own success.
[03:02:56.974 --> 03:02:57.875]  Remember this?
[03:02:57.875 --> 03:03:01.280]  Remember this quote from just yesterday or two days ago?
[03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:05.205]  Obama said during his speech, if you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[03:03:05.205 --> 03:03:06.447]  Somebody else made that happen.
[03:03:07.168 --> 03:03:17.880]  I can't tell you how offensive this statement is, how detached from reality it is, how ignorant of basic economic fundamentals this is.
[03:03:17.880 --> 03:03:21.424]  To claim that business owners and innovators and the people that put in the hours...
[03:03:22.505 --> 03:03:23.465]  The long hours.
[03:03:23.465 --> 03:03:25.786]  I see people putting in hours around here.
[03:03:25.786 --> 03:03:27.927]  Alex Jones built this network.
[03:03:27.927 --> 03:03:30.427]  I built up Natural News.
[03:03:30.427 --> 03:03:31.808]  Alex Jones built up Infowars.
[03:03:31.808 --> 03:03:35.188]  All the other innovators out there have built up their businesses.
[03:03:35.188 --> 03:03:38.029]  For Obama to come along and say that we didn't do that?
[03:03:38.029 --> 03:03:40.650]  That's absurd!
[03:03:40.650 --> 03:03:41.710]  It's offensive!
[03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:42.790]  It is ignorant!
[03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:46.131]  It is detached from reality.
[03:03:46.131 --> 03:03:48.592]  I just can't tell you how offensive
[03:03:49.292 --> 03:03:50.013]  That is.
[03:03:50.013 --> 03:03:55.659]  And even Rush Limbaugh then accused the president of, quote, destroying the American dream.
[03:03:55.659 --> 03:03:59.743]  I don't agree with Rush Limbaugh on a lot of things, but on this one, he's right.
[03:03:59.743 --> 03:04:02.226]  This is Obama destroying the American dream.
[03:04:02.226 --> 03:04:03.627]  What is this?
[03:04:03.627 --> 03:04:10.755]  This weird sickness, this psychosis among the communists who think that society gives you everything.
[03:04:11.215 --> 03:04:17.316]  That the individual isn't responsible for your own outcome, your own success or failure.
[03:04:17.316 --> 03:04:22.097]  That is a communist manifesto type of belief system and it is un-American.
[03:04:22.097 --> 03:04:28.418]  It is anti-American to say that business leaders aren't responsible for their own success.
[03:04:28.418 --> 03:04:30.298]  That is so offensive.
[03:04:30.298 --> 03:04:36.079]  It's the small business owners that generate, that create the jobs for 90% of Americans.
[03:04:36.079 --> 03:04:39.460]  That's a fact you can't argue with, even if you're the president.
[03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:42.662]  In any case, I enjoyed sharing this info with you today.
[03:04:42.662 --> 03:04:44.743]  Thanks for your support.
[03:04:44.743 --> 03:04:48.866]  Thanks for allowing me to come on and just basically be part of the InfoWar.
[03:04:48.866 --> 03:04:53.149]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, sharing my thoughts with you today.
[03:04:53.149 --> 03:04:54.249]  Hope to be back in the future.
[03:04:54.249 --> 03:04:57.652]  Until then, take care and keep fighting the InfoWar!
