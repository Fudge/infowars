[00:00.000 --> 00:21.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.560]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, it's May Day 2016.
[00:25.560 --> 00:26.560]  I'm David Knight.
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.560]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.680]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to have our reporters Rob Dew and Josh Owens who
[00:32.680 --> 00:34.000]  just got back from California.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.800]  They were there during the Dreamer riots, I think that's what we need to start calling
[00:37.800 --> 00:38.800]  them.
[00:38.800 --> 00:42.760]  You know, these people who have a dream, they want to destroy this country and they want
[00:42.760 --> 00:47.800]  to establish Aslan is what they've got, they're waving the Mexican flags, look.
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.440]  May Day is a day of celebration for the communists worldwide, has been for the Marxists and now
[00:53.440 --> 00:56.680]  for the illegal immigrants who have thrown in their lot with them.
[00:56.680 --> 00:59.880]  For the rest of us, it's a distress signal, isn't it?
[00:59.880 --> 01:05.000]  You know, it's like SOS didn't come across too well on the radios, they'd selected SOS
[01:05.000 --> 01:12.000]  because of the pattern that they could get with the dot dashes, but when they started
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.040]  talking on radio, the S's were not very intelligible in those early days, so they came up with
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.440]  something else.
[01:18.440 --> 01:24.560]  They kind of did a rough translation of a French phrase that said, come help us, that's
[01:24.560 --> 01:25.560]  how we got May Day.
[01:25.560 --> 01:28.960]  But now we've got May Day where they're celebrating this, Alex has broken that down, you can
[01:28.960 --> 01:34.720]  see that report on Infowars.com also has some occultic connections to it as well.
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.440]  We're going to be talking about encryption, we're going to be talking about addiction,
[01:38.440 --> 01:44.800]  we're going to be talking about Cruz's continuing quest to take the election from the voters
[01:44.800 --> 01:45.960]  and it just keeps going.
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.680]  We've got some new news here from Governor Jan Brewer who says, I got cheated.
[01:50.680 --> 01:56.200]  Okay, this is a former governor of Arizona who goes to the Arizona convention after Donald
[01:56.200 --> 02:03.920]  Trump had won with 47% of the popular vote, had gotten all 58 delegates in Arizona.
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.120]  She goes to the convention where they're going to actually name who these delegates are and
[02:09.120 --> 02:15.480]  she says, I've been elected to five straight national conventions but today I got cheated.
[02:15.480 --> 02:18.240]  She didn't get sent because why?
[02:18.240 --> 02:19.960]  Because she supported Donald Trump.
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.320]  So that brings up what I've said before, when we talk about Trump winning the delegates
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.920]  in Arizona, what does that mean?
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.280]  Doesn't it mean when we say that these people are now Cruz delegates, that they are loyal
[02:30.280 --> 02:32.040]  to Ted Cruz at the convention?
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.720]  Yes, that's what it means.
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.120]  But it means that even though the voters said they wanted people to go to the convention
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.480]  that were loyal to Donald Trump, that's not what's going to happen.
[02:42.480 --> 02:44.000]  That's where the problem is, folks.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.400]  And you can play all the kind of lawyerly parsing around that Ted Cruz likes to do and
[02:49.400 --> 02:52.800]  his supporters like to do, but the bottom line is a theft, okay?
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.240]  It's not a complicated situation.
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.160]  These should be delegates who are loyal to Donald Trump if there is an impasse, there
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.440]  needs to be negotiations after several rounds of voting.
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.840]  Then you still want to have people who were loyal to the voters' original choice.
[03:06.840 --> 03:08.400]  That's the way that it should be done.
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.800]  We're seeing that subverted over and over and over again.
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.600]  Now, when we look at what's happening coming up to Indiana, again, Ted Cruz seems to be
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.120]  very confident that he's going to win Indiana, but not his candidates, not his campaign.
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.480]  Many of them are concerned that this is going to be the end of the line.
[03:26.480 --> 03:32.520]  But when we joined with Rob Do and with Josh Owens at the bottom of the hour, we're going
[03:32.520 --> 03:35.800]  to talk to them about what really happened at the riots.
[03:35.800 --> 03:42.040]  Because now we've had Ted Cruz come back again and make another oblique accusation that Donald
[03:42.040 --> 03:48.200]  Trump is responsible for these riots that Rob Do and Josh Owens saw.
[03:48.200 --> 03:49.800]  Remember when he did that in Chicago?
[03:49.800 --> 03:52.840]  Remember when he came out and implied that it was Donald Trump?
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.880]  We weren't there in Chicago, but we were there filming this as it happened.
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.680]  Rob Do and Josh Owens were there filming it, and so it didn't take a couple of days for
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.080]  us to get the information from the police who were there to tell us what really happened.
[04:06.080 --> 04:07.760]  We saw it as it happened.
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.320]  That's what happened in Chicago, though, in Chicago, immediately Ted Cruz holds a press
[04:12.320 --> 04:15.000]  conference and says, you know, Donald Trump is responsible for this.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.280]  It's the tenor in the tone of his campaign that is responsible for all this.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.360]  Move on.org funded by George Soros at the time.
[04:22.360 --> 04:24.520]  This is just back in March, March the 12th, okay?
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.320]  It's not even two months ago that he was doing all this, coming out and saying that it was
[04:28.320 --> 04:30.440]  Donald Trump that was responsible for this.
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.200]  And he had law enforcement people come out and say, no, blocking ambulances, assaulting
[04:34.200 --> 04:39.000]  police officers is not protected First Amendment speech at the time, okay?
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.440]  He lost a lot of support with law enforcement, and yet he's continuing to do it again.
[04:43.440 --> 04:48.000]  So they're going to break down for us exactly what happened there, as these people flew
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.560]  Mexican flags, smashed police cars, attacked and bloodied individuals there on the site.
[04:53.560 --> 04:56.960]  No, that's just their free speech, and Ted Cruz supports that.
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.400]  Yeah, that's the identity politics.
[04:58.400 --> 04:59.400]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[04:59.400 --> 05:04.680]  If you're toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[05:04.680 --> 05:07.400]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[05:07.400 --> 05:10.600]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.880]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[05:15.880 --> 05:18.400]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[06:22.880 --> 06:30.520]  On this Sunday edition of the Worldwide Broadcast, David Knight, Rob Dude, Josh Owens, and others
[06:30.520 --> 06:36.520]  will be presenting to you definitive proof and evidence of the accelerated globalist
[06:36.520 --> 06:39.440]  takeover of this country.
[06:39.440 --> 06:46.680]  Red flags are waving at anti-American demonstrations across the United States.
[06:46.680 --> 06:53.960]  The foundation-funded radicals of liberation theology are preparing to descend this nation
[06:53.960 --> 07:03.040]  into fire to intimidate what's left of the Republic into submitting to globalist domination.
[07:03.040 --> 07:07.560]  We're going to present some videos today that, quite frankly, we've had to edit and
[07:07.560 --> 07:14.400]  censor because of the cussing, the screaming, and just other bizarre behavior that Rob Dude,
[07:14.400 --> 07:17.360]  Josh Owens, and others got out in California.
[07:17.360 --> 07:20.720]  The videos have been all over Fox News, CNN, of course, they didn't give us any credit.
[07:20.720 --> 07:21.720]  That doesn't matter.
[07:21.720 --> 07:23.600]  The point is, the information got out.
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.960]  People trying to run folks over with cars, people waving Mexican flags, screaming Viva
[07:27.960 --> 07:30.520]  la Raza up with the race.
[07:30.520 --> 07:35.880]  This is the total destruction of this Republic that we are all now witnessing.
[07:35.880 --> 07:41.520]  And it's only the beginning of the balkanization that is planned in this country.
[07:41.520 --> 07:47.160]  But when you look at the dumbed-down people, the social justice warriors, the Black Lives
[07:47.160 --> 07:55.880]  Matter people, the Mecha la Raza Ford Foundation, CIA created la Raza movements, these are true
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.360]  mind-control victims.
[07:57.360 --> 08:03.880]  And I actually pity them when you see the soullessness of these poor, pathetic people
[08:03.880 --> 08:06.960]  who are saying they want to turn the United States into Mexico.
[08:06.960 --> 08:08.200]  Well, you know what?
[08:08.200 --> 08:11.520]  At least Mexico has, I guess, some type of nationalism and culture.
[08:11.520 --> 08:13.640]  Ours has been completely removed.
[08:13.640 --> 08:19.120]  The idea of liberty and freedom and free market and family that could unify all races groups
[08:19.120 --> 08:23.640]  together under the collective of the Republic, but a collective based on the individual,
[08:23.640 --> 08:30.120]  the only true collective that is real, lasting, and that transcends time and space and human
[08:30.120 --> 08:31.520]  existence on this planet.
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.160]  But I wanted to just have Rob Duke come in today with David Knight and with Josh Owens
[08:36.160 --> 08:40.360]  to really talk about what they experienced, what they saw as a very powerful short interview
[08:40.360 --> 08:46.080]  that Rob Duke did with a man, I don't want to call him a black man or a white man, but
[08:46.080 --> 08:53.640]  he was a mixed-race, black, white, human who eloquently laid out exactly what we're facing
[08:53.640 --> 08:58.160]  and what he witnessed from the social justice warriors out at these anti-Trump events.
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.560]  And he said after he saw folks beating people up for their free speech, he had to come out
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.200]  and had to witness it for himself, and then he had whites, blacks, and Hispanics all saying
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.840]  he was a racist because he was out there in support of free speech.
[09:12.840 --> 09:16.800]  Even though he doesn't agree with a lot of what Donald Trump says, he's very clear he's
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.640]  there to defend free speech, and there they were with all this dumbed-down vitriol screaming
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.480]  at him like it was a trick that the dog had learned.
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.000]  This is all these young people know.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.400]  They're not being taught how to get jobs, how to be charming, how to dress nice, how
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.680]  to have a future.
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.520]  They're not going to tell us the masters.
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.160]  No, they just sit there rotting watching popular television, popular culture run by the globalist
[09:40.160 --> 09:44.720]  and Beyonce at the Super Bowl, telling them how to behave and what to do, and now is the
[09:44.720 --> 09:45.960]  time to activate.
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.920]  Well, if you study Mayday, it's a high-ecultic day in Northern and Western Europe.
[09:50.920 --> 09:54.120]  It's a day of human sacrifice.
[09:54.120 --> 09:58.120]  And if you look at the symbol that you'll see all over the country and the world today
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.960]  of the peace sign, it is the Death Rune, the Norse Death Rune, also the Death Rune in German
[10:04.960 --> 10:08.960]  runes, and the same rune in other Gaelic groups.
[10:08.960 --> 10:12.840]  One of the oldest runes out there is, again, a tree.
[10:12.840 --> 10:17.440]  It's like a cross with its arms up for life, but when the tree branches have fallen down
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.080]  to its sides, that's the symbol of death.
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.160]  Everything these people push is the opposite of what they're really doing.
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.280]  Now, this is how the globalists control things, because the anti-war people are great folks
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.360]  on average.
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.440]  They have real ideas that there has been a lot of racism and classism and sexism, so
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.600]  the Foundation sees on that to control it, but then to create chips on everyone's shoulders.
[10:38.600 --> 10:42.800]  So as we move into the future, people aren't upset about collectively being signed onto
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.000]  trillions of foreign debt and derivatives.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.320]  People don't get upset about collectively having medical tyranny foisted on them and
[10:48.320 --> 10:49.480]  forced vaccines.
[10:49.480 --> 10:55.280]  People don't get upset about suicide record levels in the troops and death panels to not
[10:55.280 --> 10:58.600]  give them treatment until they just go and blow their heads off, and that's people of
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.600]  every race, color, and creed that's happening to.
[11:00.600 --> 11:05.760]  So as we all lose our humanity as thousands of laboratories across the world, hundreds
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.820]  in the U.S. now have chimera, part animal, part human creatures living on them, chest
[11:10.820 --> 11:17.400]  stating humanoids, four body part harvesting, and this is in the MIT magazine, it's everywhere.
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.640]  No one cares about that dehumanization.
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.360]  The little bunny groups say, don't worry, animals weren't tested on, and the human
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.120]  groups, well that can't be going on, even though it's admitted X2Ci5, you see these
[11:27.120 --> 11:33.200]  humanoid creatures don't have any rights because they're neither cow or human.
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.400]  And again, I keep going back to this because this is the Buck Rogers nightmare stuff going
[11:37.400 --> 11:45.520]  on while we're debating idiocy about how folks should shut down Donald Trump and his speeches
[11:45.520 --> 11:50.760]  because the media said he was racist, I mean give me a break, Mexico teaches that the Southwest
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.080]  belongs to Mexico, Mexico teaches that the U.S. will be brought down, Mexico teaches
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.920]  that the gringos are evil and you need to be killed, malice garbage, it's well known.
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.240]  So you have this super aggressive false culture with the Mexican government and the CIA and
[12:05.240 --> 12:10.960]  the Ford Foundation on record weaponizing the last 60 years to try to merge our countries
[12:10.960 --> 12:15.400]  together and then control us by turning us against each other, it is pathetic, it is
[12:15.400 --> 12:22.600]  absolutely disgusting, and it is anathema to everything that we see in a free society
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.120]  to sit here and put up with this garbage.
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.720]  But I'm telling you, on this May day, you notice they are launching their operations
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.400]  everywhere and they are gearing up and we're going into this election season one of the
[12:33.400 --> 12:37.880]  most important, not just in my lifetime or your lifetime, but the last really 240 years.
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.640]  This is one of those pivotal times where the future of the republic is being decided and
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.960]  Trump simply stands as a nationalist and a populist and in his office he stands for
[12:48.960 --> 12:51.600]  the people whether he's real or not.
[12:51.600 --> 12:57.440]  So this is a battle of nationalism against the globalist and notice the globalists tell
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.880]  us we can't have a nationalism but then they'll use the communist Chinese nationalism against
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.400]  us saying we can't have Trump or Mexico's nationalism saying we can't have Trump or
[13:06.400 --> 13:09.040]  the pope coming out saying, you know, we can't have borders.
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.720]  This is the world ganging up on America and telling us what to do because somebody like
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.480]  Donald Trump says, hey, China has a 35 to 40% tariff on us on their currency.
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.480]  That's not fair.
[13:19.480 --> 13:20.480]  Oh my God, he's racist.
[13:20.480 --> 13:21.480]  Oh my God, he's evil.
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.840]  No, the criminal elements that have hijacked this nation think that they have broken this
[13:25.840 --> 13:27.520]  country's back.
[13:27.520 --> 13:29.520]  These criminal interests think they're invincible.
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.800]  They think they're unstoppable and they think that you're going to just sit there and submit
[13:33.800 --> 13:34.800]  to them.
[13:34.800 --> 13:39.000]  So we're going to come back in the next segment with David Knight, Rob Do, Josh Owens, Institute
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  Video, and they're first going to play excerpt of the interview with the, quote, black Trump
[13:46.000 --> 13:47.000]  supporter.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's the name of the video.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.680]  Speaks out against the hateful anti-Trump people, and then we're going to play some
[13:52.680 --> 13:53.680]  of the other excerpts.
[13:53.680 --> 13:55.720]  We can't play much of these videos because of the cussing.
[13:55.720 --> 14:01.320]  You got to go to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and you can find the raw videos, the boil
[14:01.320 --> 14:02.320]  downs.
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.320]  It's pretty powerful stuff.
[14:03.320 --> 14:08.200]  We've got some on the Facebook mentions that have gotten 3 million views just in one video,
[14:08.200 --> 14:09.200]  tens of millions of views total.
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.080]  Folks, you need to see these videos and just see what the globalists have been breeding
[14:13.080 --> 14:19.720]  in our bosom with a gangbanger culture that MTV has been pushing since the 80s, mixing
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.640]  it with weird nationalism against the United States and bringing in giant Latin American
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.160]  groups that will then be used as the detonator for further societal collapse, and let me
[14:29.160 --> 14:30.160]  explain something.
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.320]  I'm not against the Latin Americans.
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.800]  They've been run over by the globalists worse than anybody, and most people in Mexico, by
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.120]  the way, just want jobs and freedom and the right to have a better future.
[14:41.120 --> 14:42.520]  I know that.
[14:42.520 --> 14:46.640]  But the people that the Ford Foundation and the high schools and the colleges have been
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.360]  fomenting are really just some of the trashiest scum I've ever seen.
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.680]  I mean, you go out and see a Ku Klux Klan rally, it's a bunch of scum who are dumbed
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.160]  down when they blame people for their problems.
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.160]  Well, let me tell you something.
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.080]  They've found their kindred spirits in the Black Lives Matter groups and in all these
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.080]  other organizations.
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.640]  They have found their kindred spirits because you look at the people in these videos.
[15:06.640 --> 15:11.040]  I don't care if they're white social justice warriors, white knights, Hispanic, Mexican
[15:11.040 --> 15:16.960]  nationalist, racist, scum, or the Black Lives Matter crazies.
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.760]  They are absolutely foaming at the mouth, screaming and yelling and attacking people
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.080]  in their cars and beating people up and attacking folks for absolutely no reason, and then not
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.720]  even getting in trouble for it.
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.920]  This is how the globalists plan to bring down our country.
[15:28.920 --> 15:32.200]  That's why Infowars.com is more important than ever.
[15:32.200 --> 15:35.640]  People realize that Infowars.com is the tip of the spear, and we need your support and

[15:38.960 --> 15:39.960]  already doing.
[15:39.960 --> 15:42.880]  We've got to redouble our efforts right now because we're in such a critical time.
[15:42.880 --> 15:46.280]  Infowars.com forward slash show, send that link out, support the broadcast, we've got
[15:46.280 --> 15:49.800]  a bunch of specials at InfowarsStore.com that are ending today.

[15:54.240 --> 15:57.680]  the Republic from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.920]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.360]  Deep Cleanse by InfowarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.480]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[16:57.720 --> 17:01.960]  Secret 12, InfowarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[17:01.960 --> 17:07.280]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed
[17:07.280 --> 17:08.280]  by the body.
[17:08.280 --> 17:12.960]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[17:12.960 --> 17:15.280]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.520]  InfowarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.720]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.

[17:31.400 --> 17:35.640]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.800]  No needles, no injections.

[17:55.200 --> 17:56.200]  Secret 12.
[17:56.200 --> 17:57.200]  Hey, how are you doing?
[17:57.200 --> 17:58.200]  Good, brother.
[17:58.200 --> 17:59.200]  Just recently started using your products.
[17:59.200 --> 18:00.200]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[18:00.200 --> 18:01.200]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[18:01.200 --> 18:02.200]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know
[18:02.200 --> 18:03.200]  I've got to have the highest quality.
[18:03.200 --> 18:19.160]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.160]  using synthetic chemicals.
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.760]  We do the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[18:25.760 --> 18:29.840]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money
[18:29.840 --> 18:30.840]  there.
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.440]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[18:36.440 --> 18:37.840]  or maximum potency.
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.120]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a
[18:42.120 --> 18:46.520]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[18:46.520 --> 18:50.400]  going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[18:50.400 --> 18:56.320]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.320]  from InfoWarsLife.
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.320]  Hi, yeah.
[18:58.320 --> 19:04.520]  First of all, I want to say, secret 12, active 2, super male, brain force, prostagard, silver
[19:04.520 --> 19:05.520]  bullet.
[19:05.520 --> 19:06.520]  I use them all.
[19:06.520 --> 19:07.520]  They're phenomenal.
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.520]  They work.
[19:08.520 --> 19:09.520]  Buy them, folks.
[19:09.520 --> 19:10.520]  Thank you, brother.
[19:10.520 --> 19:11.520]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[19:11.520 --> 19:16.800]  They're a relatively short time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[19:16.800 --> 19:17.800]  products.
[19:17.800 --> 19:18.800]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.840]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWars
[19:23.840 --> 19:24.840]  at the same time.
[19:24.840 --> 19:25.840]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[19:25.840 --> 19:28.840]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, CascioFX, Nacinide, and I.
[19:28.840 --> 19:29.840]  Why?
[19:29.840 --> 19:30.840]  God, let me ask you a question.
[19:30.840 --> 19:31.840]  Have they worked for you?
[19:31.840 --> 19:34.360]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[19:34.360 --> 19:35.360]  What products are you taking?
[19:35.360 --> 19:36.360]  Are you taking?
[19:36.360 --> 19:43.920]  I'm super male, to brain force, to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force, so when
[19:43.920 --> 19:47.360]  I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[19:47.360 --> 19:52.440]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[19:52.440 --> 20:10.040]  Go to infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[20:10.040 --> 20:18.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.200 --> 20:19.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:19.200 --> 20:22.560]  I'm David Knight here live in Austin, and we're going to be joined in the next segment
[20:22.560 --> 20:28.240]  by Rob Do and Josh Owens, our reporters who were in California at the Dreamer Riots.
[20:28.240 --> 20:33.200]  They're going to give us their first-hand impressions of what they saw there, as well
[20:33.200 --> 20:35.360]  as show us the video that they shot.
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.800]  We've got some new video that has not been aired, and we're also going to be taking your
[20:39.800 --> 20:44.160]  calls if you want to ask them what they saw, some questions of them after we talk about
[20:44.160 --> 20:45.800]  it here a while, or if you've got some comments.
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.800]  Perhaps you were there.
[20:46.800 --> 20:51.400]  I want to talk about encryption before we get into the election here, but before we
[20:51.400 --> 20:57.800]  do, just to remind you that we have extended the sale for InfoWars Select Storeable Food
[20:57.800 --> 20:58.800]  to tonight.
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.240]  We extended it through the weekend as a thank you in order to help our listeners to prepare
[21:03.240 --> 21:06.880]  for possible unrest or food shortages that might come through.
[21:06.880 --> 21:08.040]  This is a mega sale.
[21:08.040 --> 21:16.120]  This is the most we've ever discounted Select Storeable Food, 30% to 40% off that ends tonight.
[21:16.120 --> 21:17.840]  So act right now.
[21:17.840 --> 21:23.000]  This, of course, is food that has a shelf life of 25 years, all made in the USA.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  High-quality stuff, high-quality packaging, and you can get it right now, 30% to 40% off.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.760]  Also, Supermail Vitality is about to sell out.
[21:30.760 --> 21:34.720]  So if you're not signed up for AutoShip, which you really should, you can save 10%.
[21:34.720 --> 21:38.640]  You can also make sure that you always get the products that you want and the quantities
[21:38.640 --> 21:39.720]  you want when you want.
[21:39.720 --> 21:43.560]  You can set the interval and the quantity that you want to get, and then get a 10% discount
[21:43.560 --> 21:44.560]  for doing that.
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.520]  But on AutoShip, we're about to sell out of Supermail Vitality as well.
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.720]  So a secure supply of that and the mega sale on InfoWare Select Storeable Food, 30% to
[21:54.720 --> 21:57.000]  40% off ends tonight.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  We extended it through the weekend, but it will definitely end tonight.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.360]  Now, as I said, before we get to the election, we're going to be talking about the Dreamer
[22:03.360 --> 22:08.680]  Riots, possibly what's happening with May Day as well, some election news with Rob and
[22:08.680 --> 22:09.920]  Josh in the next segment.
[22:09.920 --> 22:12.400]  I want to talk a little bit about encryption.
[22:12.400 --> 22:15.400]  Ed Snowden was on CNN today, and he had some interesting statements.
[22:15.400 --> 22:18.120]  He said, encryption saves lives.
[22:18.120 --> 22:19.720]  Encryption protects property.
[22:19.720 --> 22:21.520]  Without encryption, our economy stops.
[22:21.520 --> 22:23.200]  Our government stops.
[22:23.200 --> 22:24.200]  Everything stops.
[22:24.200 --> 22:28.640]  Just think about the fact, folks, that our government, that we're supposed to entrust
[22:28.640 --> 22:34.120]  all of our information to, was just hacked and lost all of their personnel records.
[22:34.120 --> 22:37.320]  All government personnel records were hacked.
[22:37.320 --> 22:38.320]  Okay?
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.120]  Yet, we're supposed to give everything to them.
[22:40.120 --> 22:46.360]  And as he goes on to point out, as Snowden says today on CNN, our intelligence agencies
[22:46.360 --> 22:50.240]  say computer security is a bigger problem than terrorism, a bigger problem than crime,
[22:50.240 --> 22:51.880]  a bigger problem than anything else.
[22:51.880 --> 22:57.320]  And he says, we can pass a law that requires a key under every doormat in order to make
[22:57.320 --> 22:59.400]  things easier for police to get into your house.
[22:59.400 --> 23:03.000]  But the problem is that every other person in the world can find that key, and they can
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  use it too.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.280]  And they can also get into your personal effects, all of your information.
[23:08.280 --> 23:13.120]  I was looking at a story that came out this weekend about the internal dispute, and you
[23:13.120 --> 23:17.840]  can see the stories up on the dredge report between the leader of Scientology and his
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.840]  father.
[23:18.840 --> 23:23.680]  There's this back and forth going on between them as to what they've been doing, the cult
[23:23.680 --> 23:24.680]  of Scientology.
[23:24.680 --> 23:29.920]  And I thought about the cult of the omnipotent state and how we're willing to sacrifice our
[23:29.920 --> 23:30.920]  freedoms to that.
[23:30.920 --> 23:32.480]  Because listen to what he said.
[23:32.480 --> 23:37.920]  He's talking about, this is the father saying, this is what it was like, the horrible situation
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.360]  of being in this Scientology cult.
[23:40.360 --> 23:45.040]  He said, I was living on a compound where your mail going out is read before it's sealed
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.160]  and sent out.
[23:46.160 --> 23:49.840]  Where before you get your mail, it's opened and read before you get it.
[23:49.840 --> 23:50.840]  The phone calls.
[23:50.840 --> 23:51.840]  He says, you're on the phone.
[23:51.840 --> 23:53.480]  Somebody else is listening in.
[23:53.480 --> 23:57.440]  And then you've got Gary Moorhead, a former Scientologist who's now a critic, says he
[23:57.440 --> 23:58.800]  was once a director of security.
[23:58.800 --> 24:03.280]  He said, I would go through people's personal belongings out of their birthing where they
[24:03.280 --> 24:04.280]  slept.
[24:04.280 --> 24:07.720]  I would get their bank records, their date of birth, their passwords, any personal information
[24:07.720 --> 24:09.760]  where their family addresses were, et cetera, et cetera.
[24:09.760 --> 24:13.880]  And I'm listening to this and I'm thinking, yeah, they're painting a pretty creepy image,
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.120]  aren't they?
[24:15.120 --> 24:16.840]  What about the church of Scientology?
[24:16.840 --> 24:20.560]  But what if you live in America?
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.040]  Doesn't our government do the same thing?
[24:24.040 --> 24:27.080]  What is so great about the cult of the omnipotent state?
[24:27.080 --> 24:29.000]  I mean, I don't want to be part of any cult.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.080]  I don't want the Scientologists going through all my personal effects.
[24:32.080 --> 24:34.520]  And I don't want the government doing it either.
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.240]  And yet you may not have realized this.
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.800]  But we had a Supreme Court decision on Thursday, a ruling from the Supreme Court where they
[24:42.800 --> 24:48.080]  approved changes that would make it easier for the FBI to hack into your computers, including
[24:48.080 --> 24:51.880]  those belonging to victims, victims of cybercrime.
[24:51.880 --> 24:58.120]  See, not just the perpetrators, but the victims they could hack into their computers.
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.400]  These changes will take place in December unless Congress adopts competing legislation.
[25:02.400 --> 25:04.240]  This is a story from the Intercept.
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.120]  They say previously, under federal rules on criminal procedure, a magistrate judge could
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.200]  not approve a search warrant request for a computer remotely if the investigator didn't
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.200]  know where the computer was because it might be outside his or her jurisdiction.
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.920]  Well, it might also be outside of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.360]  you've got to be very specific about what you're looking for and who you're looking at
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.520]  and where you're going to look for this information when you get that search warrant.
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.640]  It says that you're going to go before a judge and the law enforcement officer is going to
[25:38.640 --> 25:45.840]  particularly describe the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized, etc.
[25:45.840 --> 25:46.840]  Okay?
[25:46.840 --> 25:54.680]  That's the problem with these dragnet surveillance warrants that are being done by the FISA court.
[25:54.680 --> 25:57.560]  And I put that term court in quotes.
[25:57.560 --> 25:59.120]  It's not really that.
[25:59.120 --> 26:00.120]  But isn't this amazing?
[26:00.120 --> 26:05.120]  You've got the Supreme Court writing laws just like the regulatory agencies do, don't
[26:05.120 --> 26:06.120]  they?
[26:06.120 --> 26:07.280]  They come up with a new ruling.
[26:07.280 --> 26:08.440]  They're writing their laws.
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.520]  They're not elected by us.
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.440]  But you've got all these regulatory agencies writing law, writing rules, and say, well,
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.880]  if somebody doesn't shut this down in a certain amount of time, we're going to go through
[26:19.880 --> 26:21.160]  with this.
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.880]  So the default is we're going to write the laws unless you come back and you're quite
[26:23.880 --> 26:24.880]  frankly.
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.760]  If Congress were to come back and remind the Supreme Court that we have a Fourth Amendment,
[26:29.760 --> 26:32.640]  I would imagine that the Supreme Court would say, man, we don't care.
[26:32.640 --> 26:33.640]  We don't care.
[26:33.640 --> 26:38.600]  We'll hear the arguments from the law enforcement people and we'll decide in their favor and
[26:38.600 --> 26:39.880]  against Congress.
[26:39.880 --> 26:45.840]  That's probably what they would do because they're there, they say, to tell us what the
[26:45.840 --> 26:47.320]  Constitution says.
[26:47.320 --> 26:49.960]  And they're there to shut down unconstitutional laws.
[26:49.960 --> 26:56.320]  And yet here they are, the Supreme Court writing a law in violation of the Constitution.
[26:56.320 --> 26:59.920]  A visiting professor at the University of California Law School described it as, quote,
[26:59.920 --> 27:07.120]  possibly the broadest expansion of extraterritorial surveillance power since the FBI's inception.
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.760]  Now today we've got a story up on the Dredge Report says, can you say rubber stamp?
[27:10.760 --> 27:11.760]  This is from Yahoo.
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.840]  The FBI and the NSA requests are never denied by the secret court by FISA.
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.440]  Remember why we have a FISA court.
[27:21.440 --> 27:25.560]  Remember that they created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the court that is part
[27:25.560 --> 27:26.560]  of that?
[27:26.560 --> 27:32.520]  They created that because of the church and pike hearings, the church senate hearings,
[27:32.520 --> 27:34.760]  the pike house hearings back in the 1970s.
[27:34.760 --> 27:41.360]  They said, wait a minute, we've got the NSA and the FBI and the CIA listening in on Americans'
[27:41.360 --> 27:42.360]  conversations.
[27:42.360 --> 27:43.560]  That's against the Constitution.
[27:43.560 --> 27:44.560]  You can't do that.
[27:44.560 --> 27:45.560]  That was back in the 70s.
[27:45.560 --> 27:50.120]  So they said, all right, we still need to be able to do this and we've got to have, we'll
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.600]  come up with a search warrant procedure, but it's got to be done secretly.
[27:53.600 --> 27:55.680]  So they create this secret court.
[27:55.680 --> 27:57.800]  Now there's no lawyer for the other side.
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.560]  It's only one lawyer and one judge in this FISA court, quote unquote.
[28:01.560 --> 28:03.640]  It is a star chamber, folks.
[28:03.640 --> 28:08.880]  And the worst thing about it is not the Mr. and Mrs. Verizon search warrant, as Rand Paul
[28:08.880 --> 28:16.560]  has called them, the fact that they get a dragnet, broadly based surveillance warrant, quote
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.560]  unquote.
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.960]  Now the worst thing is, is that the FISA court is saying that they are modifying our Constitution
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.120]  just like the Supreme Court.
[28:24.120 --> 28:29.480]  And yet, unlike the Supreme Court, we can't even see when they are writing new laws.
[28:29.480 --> 28:32.160]  That's how bad this is getting.
[28:32.160 --> 28:35.160]  It's absolutely over the top, absolutely uncontrolled.
[28:35.160 --> 28:38.280]  And you want to talk about a crazy religious cult?
[28:38.280 --> 28:42.360]  It's the omnipotent state we need to be worried about because that's the one that is coming
[28:42.360 --> 28:43.560]  after everybody.
[28:43.560 --> 28:44.560]  Stay with us.
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.520]  Be right back with Rob Do, Josh Owens, and the Dreamer riots that they saw firsthand
[28:48.520 --> 28:59.520]  looking at some new video footage.
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.840]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.720]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[29:07.720 --> 29:10.560]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[29:10.560 --> 29:16.800]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[29:16.800 --> 29:19.320]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.720]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[29:23.720 --> 29:29.360]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[29:29.360 --> 29:33.320]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[29:33.320 --> 29:36.920]  I personally counter this onslaught with antroplex.
[29:36.920 --> 29:44.760]  Antroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.040]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[29:48.040 --> 29:50.920]  Discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today.
[29:50.920 --> 29:55.800]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[29:55.800 --> 29:58.920]  with antroplex.

[30:07.920 --> 30:08.920]  at infowarslife.com.
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.560]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[30:13.560 --> 30:19.440]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information
[30:19.440 --> 30:22.480]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[30:22.480 --> 30:28.280]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple
[30:28.280 --> 30:31.400]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[30:31.400 --> 30:35.320]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[30:35.320 --> 30:38.240]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.440]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nasin iodine that
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.800]  major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[30:46.800 --> 30:51.120]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[30:51.120 --> 30:58.080]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the info warslife family of incredible products.
[30:58.080 --> 31:02.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[31:02.000 --> 31:07.200]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[31:07.200 --> 31:10.400]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[31:10.400 --> 31:15.680]  To one of the key compounds, BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[32:01.840 --> 32:05.040]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[32:05.040 --> 32:08.920]  You all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare
[32:08.920 --> 32:14.560]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart
[32:14.560 --> 32:17.400]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[32:17.400 --> 32:20.680]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[32:20.680 --> 32:23.800]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[32:23.800 --> 32:26.520]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[33:20.120 --> 33:30.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this May Day 2016.
[33:30.320 --> 33:34.960]  I'm David Knight and joining me now are Rob Do and Josh Owens, our reporters who've just
[33:34.960 --> 33:39.560]  returned from California and the Dreamer Riots, that's what I think that'll be called.
[33:39.560 --> 33:42.000]  I've never quite seen anything like this.
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.440]  I guess, you know, Ted Cruz says that Donald Trump encourages these riots.
[33:46.440 --> 33:48.080]  He's done this a second time now.
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.840]  He did it in Chicago except this time, you guys were there so it was happening so we
[33:52.840 --> 33:56.000]  can see that it wasn't the Trump people.
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.400]  We can see who started this.
[33:57.400 --> 33:59.800]  We can see what they did.
[33:59.800 --> 34:03.680]  But it's just absolutely amazing to me that he keeps doubling down on this.
[34:03.680 --> 34:05.960]  Yeah, he has obviously nowhere else to go.
[34:05.960 --> 34:11.720]  We were in the midst of the precious snowflake snowstorm in Southern California and in San
[34:11.720 --> 34:12.720]  Francisco.
[34:12.720 --> 34:14.680]  Let me tell you how whirlwind this was.
[34:14.680 --> 34:21.000]  We left the office here at 2.30 we flew out and at 1.30 we flew out.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.640]  We got to California at 2.30.
[34:22.640 --> 34:27.240]  We were on site an hour later and it was very reserved in the beginning.
[34:27.240 --> 34:30.360]  In fact, when we did our interview on the Infowars Nightly News, we couldn't hardly find
[34:30.360 --> 34:31.360]  any protesters.
[34:31.360 --> 34:34.480]  We found one guy talking in a crowd to some other people.
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.600]  And then after we got off about 20 minutes before the rally was scheduled to start, a
[34:40.600 --> 34:43.080]  whole group marched up.
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.680]  And then that's when the cops on the horses come in and start getting in between people.
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.400]  And you can see all this on the Alex Jones channel.
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.960]  We have tons of videos illustrating how this went down.
[34:53.960 --> 34:57.520]  And we actually started off with the night stuff first because that was the most sensational
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.200]  stuff that happened a couple hours after the stuff I'm talking about now.
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.960]  But they come in, they're keeping the groups apart, they're yelling at each other.
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.560]  And then when it was people that couldn't get in, we're trying to leave.
[35:08.560 --> 35:12.400]  There is at least, I'd say, 3,000 to 4,000 people that could not get into this rally.
[35:12.400 --> 35:15.480]  30,000 on the inside, a large number of people.
[35:15.480 --> 35:17.400]  We couldn't even see the end of the lines.
[35:17.400 --> 35:20.360]  And that's how it, every Trump rally I've been to, it's been like that.
[35:20.360 --> 35:21.360]  Thousands of people there.
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.400]  About how many protesters were there?
[35:23.400 --> 35:27.680]  I would say in the beginning, there was probably 200 to 250 maybe.
[35:27.680 --> 35:30.680]  Probably Donald Trump actually posted a photo, it's an aerial shot of it.
[35:30.680 --> 35:36.320]  And you can see, I think there were, he said, I think they sold, or they, there were 30,000
[35:36.320 --> 35:38.880]  tickets that people got.
[35:38.880 --> 35:40.880]  And I mean, thousands were turned away.
[35:40.880 --> 35:41.880]  Yeah.
[35:41.880 --> 35:48.560]  The whole stadium, which I think held 8,500, but they packed it in, was completely full.
[35:48.560 --> 35:53.200]  And you see, the whole stadium here, and then, I mean, it pales in comparison to the protesters.
[35:53.200 --> 35:54.200]  Very small number.
[35:54.200 --> 35:55.200]  Obviously the loud mine.
[35:55.200 --> 35:58.400]  Because I know when we were in New York, there were articles that came out, said, look, thousands
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.880]  of people protesting Donald Trump when he's speaking to the Jewish lobby there.
[36:03.880 --> 36:09.560]  But what they had was a small cordoned off area that was maybe 50 to 100 protesters.
[36:09.560 --> 36:12.160]  And you could see it after everybody went in, but they had this massive sea, and they
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.880]  just took a picture of everybody that was lined up to go into the area.
[36:15.880 --> 36:16.880]  All right.
[36:16.880 --> 36:17.880]  So those are protesters.
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.880]  Yeah.
[36:18.880 --> 36:22.360]  Well, what they did wrong was they gave the protesters the entire parking lot, essentially.
[36:22.360 --> 36:26.120]  So the protesters had the whole parking lot in which they can go to, and this is footage
[36:26.120 --> 36:28.080]  from San Francisco that we shot.
[36:28.080 --> 36:29.160]  But and we'll get to that in a second.
[36:29.160 --> 36:31.560]  We have a good video of a guy who really gets it all.
[36:31.560 --> 36:34.560]  He gets it while he was there, we're going to play that one in a second.
[36:34.560 --> 36:36.040]  But they gave him the whole parking lot.
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.800]  So when people were leaving that couldn't get in, they started, John, they were getting
[36:39.800 --> 36:42.120]  jaw that they were getting called racist.
[36:42.120 --> 36:46.160]  In addition to being yelled at for an hour and a half by these people, okay.
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.400]  And then they try to leave and the protesters start blocking the roads.
[36:50.400 --> 36:56.040]  They start doing these donuts, spinning out their tires and just making a lot of smoke.
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.560]  I saw the smoke from I was interviewing people and it started to get dark and I could see
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.560]  smoke coming.
[37:00.560 --> 37:01.560]  I thought it was a car fire.
[37:01.560 --> 37:02.560]  There was so much smoke.
[37:02.560 --> 37:03.560]  I think that's what drew everyone over.
[37:03.560 --> 37:04.560]  That's what drew everyone over.
[37:04.560 --> 37:07.760]  There was a car on fire and and then they just started blocking the streets.
[37:07.760 --> 37:11.160]  They blocked off this one corner and then it went to mayhem after that picture.
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.160]  Anybody's watching.
[37:12.160 --> 37:13.160]  There's a guy doing donuts.
[37:13.160 --> 37:18.520]  He's drifting in the Miata there and you know, look, he may be a good driver, but those
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.640]  aren't pylons.
[37:19.640 --> 37:23.680]  Those are people and it's a crazy crowd and they're moving and no matter how good a driver
[37:23.680 --> 37:25.720]  is, that is really irresponsible.
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.680]  I hate to see that happen because I don't want to see, well, I really thought somebody
[37:29.680 --> 37:31.520]  was going to get run over at any moment.
[37:31.520 --> 37:34.280]  I thought somebody was going to get hit and luckily nobody did get hit.
[37:34.280 --> 37:37.440]  I backed up a little bit because I got, I was like, well, he's going to do one donut and
[37:37.440 --> 37:38.440]  take off.
[37:38.440 --> 37:40.640]  No, he did like eight donuts and took off.
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.320]  But let's go to this video now of the of the bottom Donald.
[37:44.320 --> 37:46.960]  He said, he said, I don't know if I'm going to vote for him, but I'm supporting what he
[37:46.960 --> 37:49.520]  stands for in free speech.
[37:49.520 --> 37:50.520]  And this is a guy who came out.
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.960]  I talked to him at the end of this, of what was going on at this rally and it was, it was
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.320]  a weird rally the way they were, how organized they were.
[37:57.320 --> 37:59.480]  The one in Southern California, not very organized.
[37:59.480 --> 38:01.680]  People were just kind of mobbing around doing whatever.
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.200]  This one, they had attack patterns that they were developing and they were, people were
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.000]  following them and they seem to be led by a group in, and with green bandana's on there.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.080]  There were anarchists that were drawn with me in the beginning.
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.600]  They, they didn't like the fact that I was talking about biosphenol A in the juice boxes
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.240]  or vaccines or fluoride in the water.
[38:19.240 --> 38:22.680]  They thought that was all kooky, you know, but then they didn't want to talk about it.
[38:22.680 --> 38:23.880]  They go, we're not here to talk.
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.480]  We're here to cause and throw eggs.
[38:25.480 --> 38:26.480]  Yeah.
[38:26.480 --> 38:27.480]  Yeah.
[38:27.480 --> 38:28.480]  Yeah.
[38:28.480 --> 38:29.480]  There's one disrupt stuff.
[38:29.480 --> 38:30.480]  Yeah.
[38:30.480 --> 38:31.480]  Let's do that guy.
[38:31.480 --> 38:32.480]  Okay.
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.480]  So I'm walking here with a guy with your name, Johnny, right?
[38:35.480 --> 38:36.480]  Is that what you said?
[38:36.480 --> 38:37.480]  I'm Ronnie.
[38:37.480 --> 38:38.480]  Ronnie.
[38:38.480 --> 38:39.480]  Ronnie.
[38:39.480 --> 38:40.480]  Okay.
[38:40.480 --> 38:41.480]  And so why are you out here today?
[38:41.480 --> 38:43.000]  Um, you know, I am a Trump supporter.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.680]  I'm definitely, I don't know if I would vote for him, but I have to support what he's standing
[38:46.680 --> 38:47.680]  for.
[38:47.680 --> 38:48.680]  Yeah.
[38:48.680 --> 38:51.600]  Because I've been seeing all this opposition coming from Bernie and Hillary supporters
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.560]  and sitting there talking about we're liberate, we're liberal, we're loving, we just want
[38:55.560 --> 38:59.320]  peace yet they throw eggs at you and punch you in the mouth because they're peaceful
[38:59.320 --> 39:00.320]  and loving.
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.920]  And so what went down in Southern California, it got to me, I had to come out here and actually
[39:05.920 --> 39:07.720]  talk about what's going on.
[39:07.720 --> 39:09.200]  These people don't want to talk to you.
[39:09.200 --> 39:10.200]  That's the problem.
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.800]  They sit there and say they don't have double standards and that they're not hypocritical.
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.920]  They'll come up to you and just yell and scream like you're just your nobody.
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.920]  We hate you.
[39:18.920 --> 39:19.920]  You're racist.
[39:19.920 --> 39:20.920]  You're misogynist, homophobic.
[39:20.920 --> 39:22.240]  I have black friends.
[39:22.240 --> 39:23.240]  I have white friends.
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.520]  I had Mexican friends and supposedly I'm a racist.
[39:26.520 --> 39:27.520]  Wow.
[39:27.520 --> 39:28.520]  That's crazy.
[39:28.520 --> 39:29.520]  My family is black.
[39:29.520 --> 39:30.520]  I'm a racist.
[39:30.520 --> 39:31.520]  Okay?
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.520]  So it has nothing to do with race.
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.680]  I think Trump is really just trying to get the sovereignty back in America when he's
[39:36.680 --> 39:38.000]  talking about the borders.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.720]  Like he's not saying let's import all Muslims, let's import all Mexicans.
[39:41.720 --> 39:43.960]  He's talking about the drug pushers.
[39:43.960 --> 39:45.600]  He's talking about the criminals.
[39:45.600 --> 39:46.600]  He's talking about them.
[39:46.600 --> 39:50.960]  He's not talking about good people that are going to work every day and paying their bills.
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.120]  And there's just too many of these misconceptions generated by the hype of the mainstream media
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.040]  and people just kind of buy into it because of the herd mentality.
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.440]  I really urge people to, you know, read Edward Bernays' book on propaganda.
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.560]  When I wrote, when I read that book, blew my mind, blew my freaking mind, man.
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.520]  See, that's, yeah, that's, that is the Bernie supporter because they love you.
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.000]  That's love right there.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  You see that?
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  Look, you got-
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  I don't think he supports anyone.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.960]  Yeah, I think he just supports hate, but apparently he does support hate.
[40:21.960 --> 40:25.640]  But you read Edward Bernays' book on propaganda, it blows your mind.
[40:25.640 --> 40:27.640]  It's like almost everything that's going on right now.
[40:27.640 --> 40:30.360]  He talked about it a hundred years prior.
[40:30.360 --> 40:31.360]  It's crazy.
[40:31.360 --> 40:32.360]  You know, and he nailed it.
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.760]  Should they find that guy over there or what's going on?
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.960]  No, he's, they managed to escape the mob.
[40:37.960 --> 40:38.960]  Okay.
[40:38.960 --> 40:39.960]  All right.
[40:39.960 --> 40:40.960]  So what was going on?
[40:40.960 --> 40:43.200]  The guy was, they threw eggs at a guy that was burning a flag?
[40:43.200 --> 40:49.320]  The kid that, they stole this kid's American flag and then burned it and then hit the kid
[40:49.320 --> 40:51.080]  that had the flag with an egg.
[40:51.080 --> 40:54.200]  And so they were chasing the guy that threw the egg and stole the flag.
[40:54.200 --> 40:55.200]  It was the same person apparently.
[40:55.200 --> 40:56.200]  Okay.
[40:56.200 --> 40:57.200]  Yeah.
[40:57.200 --> 40:58.200]  Okay.
[40:58.200 --> 41:01.040]  Interesting dealings here at the Trump protest.
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.480]  I don't know if I'm going to go check into my hotel right now.
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.240]  It's like things are, I'm supposed to fly out at five, so I don't even know I'm going
[41:09.240 --> 41:10.240]  to check into the hotel.
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.640]  I might just grab the bags and go, but yeah, anyway, do you have anything else you want
[41:14.640 --> 41:15.640]  to add?
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.720]  Um, I just want to add that, uh, I mean, if you're, if you're a Trump supporter or if
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.880]  you simply are just supporting Trump because your title was going on, don't be afraid to
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.240]  come out here, you know, don't be afraid to, uh, to defend yourself against burning supporters.
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.560]  But I will say, don't get violent with these people because they are so manipulative.
[41:32.560 --> 41:33.560]  They are so crazy.
[41:33.560 --> 41:38.000]  I mean, one guy was literally just like, he was 10 feet away from me and he's like,
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.920]  why don't you come up here and tell me how much you want to hit me?
[41:40.920 --> 41:42.560]  I said, I never said I wanted to hit you.
[41:42.560 --> 41:43.560]  No, you said it.
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.560]  You said it.
[41:44.560 --> 41:46.360]  Oh, so you're saying that I said it without saying it.
[41:46.360 --> 41:48.360]  He goes, uh, you just whitewashed.
[41:48.360 --> 41:49.760]  You just whitewashed, bro.
[41:49.760 --> 41:50.960]  So that's all it is.
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.080]  That's just all a bunch of insults and I'm in fifth grade, but I think I'm adult level
[41:55.080 --> 41:56.080]  of thinking.
[41:56.080 --> 42:00.760]  You know, he just know that you're a man or know that you're a person and just moving
[42:00.760 --> 42:01.760]  in over here.
[42:01.760 --> 42:02.760]  Oh, yeah.
[42:02.760 --> 42:03.760]  Now we have to investigate.
[42:03.760 --> 42:05.280]  Boy, that guy is really wise.
[42:05.280 --> 42:06.280]  Yeah.
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.280]  He really, he really gets it.
[42:07.280 --> 42:08.280]  Yeah.
[42:08.280 --> 42:09.280]  And you can see the rest of it.
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.040]  There's a whole backstory, more stuff going on in this video because they find the guys
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.800]  that are fighting and then I interview the guy who's carrying around the Donald Trump
[42:15.800 --> 42:16.800]  head as well.
[42:16.800 --> 42:18.920]  There's a guy carrying around on his giant fishing pole.
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.920]  If you did that or if I did that with an Hispanic or a black man's head, oh, we feel racist
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.920]  or Hillary.
[42:24.920 --> 42:25.920]  Yeah.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.920]  Oh, yeah.
[42:26.920 --> 42:27.920]  But no, this guy's allowed to do that.
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.000]  And so I let him, they'll let him say his piece and basically, you know, stick his foot
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  in his mouth.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  All right.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  So that's a new video.
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  We just played a portion of it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  You can see the rest of it at the Alex Jones channel.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.520]  We're going to be right back with Josh Owens and Rob Do telling us about the Dreamer riots.
[42:40.520 --> 42:41.520]  Stay with us.
[42:41.520 --> 43:02.520]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights wrote, where an excess of power prevails, property
[43:02.520 --> 43:04.720]  of no sort is duly respected.
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.200]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties or in his possessions.
[43:10.200 --> 43:13.560]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[43:13.560 --> 43:15.920]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[43:15.920 --> 43:21.360]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[43:21.360 --> 43:23.080]  That is the ultimate concern.
[43:23.080 --> 43:27.840]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the
[43:27.840 --> 43:29.160]  founders of this country.
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.760]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.100]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[43:36.100 --> 43:41.040]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance, a people who
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.200]  mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.240]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints
[43:50.240 --> 43:51.640]  upon them are.
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.160]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.600]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[30:32.580 --> 47:43.960]  it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[47:43.960 --> 47:50.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host and joining us on this May
[47:50.400 --> 47:57.200]  Day 2016 are Rob Do and Josh Owens, who are just at the Dream of Riots in California.
[47:57.200 --> 48:03.720]  You know when I look at this May Day and these riots, my reaction Rob and Josh is the May
[48:03.720 --> 48:05.560]  Day distress call, you know?
[48:05.560 --> 48:08.640]  And when I look at this, it makes me want to keep my powder dry.
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.720]  We're talking about these riots here and we're talking about Ted Cruz shutting down the elections,
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.640]  putting his own delegates in, you know we've got the four boxes of liberty, right, that
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.640]  people talk about.
[48:19.640 --> 48:23.280]  You've got the soap box, your free speech, you've got the ballot box elections, those
[48:23.280 --> 48:24.400]  are both under attack.
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.840]  We see that with these Trump protesters, we also see it with the elections that are being
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.800]  stolen and of course we've got Cruz coming out and blaming Trump for encouraging the
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.920]  rioters, saying it's Trump's fault that all this stuff is happening.
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.680]  Do you really think this would be happening if we didn't have open borders?
[48:42.680 --> 48:46.760]  Because most of these people that were there appear to be dreamers coming across, dreamer
[48:46.760 --> 48:52.960]  age, flying Mexican flags and screaming that they wanted their free education and their
[48:52.960 --> 48:53.960]  goodies.
[48:53.960 --> 48:57.680]  Well, and not to separate things by race, but just from looking at the general crowd
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.120]  and you can look at the video and see this, I'd say 75% were Hispanic, I don't know how
[49:02.120 --> 49:05.840]  many of those were illegal or how many of their parents were illegal, but I did see a lot
[49:05.840 --> 49:06.840]  of Mexican flags.
[49:06.840 --> 49:09.400]  Certainly, and they were all screaming undocumented on a fray.
[49:09.400 --> 49:10.400]  Yeah, that's right.
[49:10.400 --> 49:11.400]  That's right.
[49:11.400 --> 49:12.400]  And the age group as well.
[49:12.400 --> 49:18.840]  Yeah, they're mostly very young, 20s and under, and a lot of high school kids couldn't
[49:18.840 --> 49:19.840]  even vote.
[49:19.840 --> 49:23.680]  And then there were some white kids sprinkled in with them and some blacks, but I'd say
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.480]  it was more Hispanic and then white and then black.
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.600]  Nevertheless, when we look at this, we look at people violently trying to shut down free
[49:31.600 --> 49:32.600]  speech.
[49:32.600 --> 49:33.600]  Yeah.
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.680]  There are elections being done openly and they're talking about it in a way that they've never
[49:37.680 --> 49:40.240]  talked about it before because they've never had to talk about it.
[49:40.240 --> 49:43.560]  We've known that this existed because we've followed this.
[49:43.560 --> 49:46.800]  So there's two of the boxes and of course, you've also got the jury box, you've got the
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.480]  ammo box, okay?
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.880]  But you also need the food box too.
[49:51.880 --> 49:52.880]  That's the fifth one.
[49:52.880 --> 49:53.880]  That's the fifth one.
[49:53.880 --> 49:56.880]  We need to put a fifth one in there for your liberty and that's the food box.
[49:56.880 --> 50:00.600]  And before we get back to talking about the dreamers here, folks, there is a way that
[50:00.600 --> 50:06.680]  you can stock up your fifth box, your storage box here.
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.480]  We've got info where select storeable food at a 30 to 40% discount.
[50:10.480 --> 50:11.480]  This is our mega sale.
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.480]  Time to load up.
[50:12.480 --> 50:13.480]  It was going to end on Friday night.
[50:13.480 --> 50:14.480]  That's right.
[50:14.480 --> 50:15.480]  It was going to end on Friday night.
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.280]  But Alex extended it through the weekend to help you prepare as a thank you.
[50:19.280 --> 50:22.040]  And again, it's the biggest discount we've ever had.
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.760]  This is the most you will see off of this select storeable food, 30 to 40% off.
[50:26.760 --> 50:28.600]  Now is the time to stock up.
[50:28.600 --> 50:32.120]  It has a shelf life of 25 years, all top quality food.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.120]  No GMO.
[50:33.120 --> 50:34.200]  It's made in the USA.
[50:34.200 --> 50:37.800]  So is the packaging total USA product.
[50:37.800 --> 50:43.320]  This is one way to prepare for yourself and to help people who are businessmen in the
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.320]  US as well.
[50:44.320 --> 50:45.680]  Again, it's for a limited time only.
[50:45.680 --> 50:46.840]  It's going to end tonight.
[50:46.840 --> 50:52.040]  This is the absolute end of the sale, 30 to 40% off info wars select storeable food.
[50:52.040 --> 50:55.560]  That's your fifth box, your cupboard box, okay?
[50:55.560 --> 50:56.640]  And I got something to say about this.
[50:56.640 --> 51:00.560]  We were, when we were in San Francisco, there was a debate towards the end.
[51:00.560 --> 51:03.520]  The protests and kind of the riot, the rioting had kind of died down.
[51:03.520 --> 51:06.520]  The people banging on windows and trying to get into this hotel, that had kind of died
[51:06.520 --> 51:07.520]  down.
[51:07.520 --> 51:08.720]  The cops had maintained control.
[51:08.720 --> 51:12.680]  But there was a debate going on about gun safety and how many bullets you should be
[51:12.680 --> 51:14.360]  allowed to have in your cartridge.
[51:14.360 --> 51:19.200]  And then this girl who has to be in, you know, she kind of reminded me of the girl that got
[51:19.200 --> 51:25.480]  maced in, in Jamesville when it gets maced for punching the guy.
[51:25.480 --> 51:26.880]  He was very loud, mouthy.
[51:26.880 --> 51:29.280]  And what do you want of those preppers?
[51:29.280 --> 51:33.320]  You know, they live in a freaking earthquake zone, okay?
[51:33.320 --> 51:38.040]  And these are the people that should be getting prepared for anything to happen.
[51:38.040 --> 51:39.040]  You should have firearms.
[51:39.040 --> 51:40.040]  You should have food.
[51:40.040 --> 51:41.040]  You should have water.
[51:41.040 --> 51:43.760]  I mean, these are things you need if, if you have an earthquake, because guess what?
[51:43.760 --> 51:45.840]  It's going to take a while for help to get there.
[51:45.840 --> 51:49.540]  And they might not be in your area or you might have to travel across some ravine or
[51:49.540 --> 51:51.200]  something that the bridge has gone.
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.200]  What if that happens?
[51:52.200 --> 51:53.880]  You're going to need food for your family.
[51:53.880 --> 51:59.400]  But here she is, the worst possible scenario, earthquake zone, a city, and absolutely contemptuous
[51:59.400 --> 52:00.400]  of any preparation.
[52:00.400 --> 52:01.400]  What are you, a prepper?
[52:01.400 --> 52:05.160]  And then I got, I got one more thing to add that we, we were in San Diego.
[52:05.160 --> 52:09.160]  We just flown into San Diego to fly back to Austin on Friday night and we get off the
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.160]  plane.
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.160]  We're just looking for our gate.
[52:11.160 --> 52:15.320]  And some guy goes, hey, Rob, do I'm like, what has turned because that doesn't happen
[52:15.320 --> 52:16.320]  to, you know, Alex Jones.
[52:16.320 --> 52:17.320]  I've been with him.
[52:17.320 --> 52:18.600]  It happens to him all the time.
[52:18.600 --> 52:19.600]  Never happened to me.
[52:19.600 --> 52:20.600]  This guy comes up.
[52:20.600 --> 52:24.600]  He starts shaking our hands, real happy, he's like, man, I love the work you guys are doing.
[52:24.600 --> 52:25.600]  Great job.
[52:25.600 --> 52:26.600]  Great job.
[52:26.600 --> 52:27.600]  He goes, let me tell you something.
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.680]  I was skeptical about that brain force, but I got some, man, that stuff works.
[52:31.680 --> 52:32.680]  And then he went off.
[52:32.680 --> 52:34.600]  It was proceeded to talk for 10 minutes straight.
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.320]  I mean, just like a stream of consciousness, like talking about all the issues out there.
[52:38.320 --> 52:39.320]  What do you think about this?
[52:39.320 --> 52:44.880]  I think that, you know, he, he was on brain force and it was making his synapses just
[52:44.880 --> 52:48.520]  go and he was, he was, had all the points coherent.
[52:48.520 --> 52:50.240]  It wasn't like he was on drugs.
[52:50.240 --> 52:53.160]  It was like he was, he was just a regular human.
[52:53.160 --> 52:56.560]  Just hit his, the spark had been turned on in his mind.
[52:56.560 --> 53:01.000]  So you know, as the news director here at m4s.com, I want to thank everybody for supporting us
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.920]  because it's when you go out and buy the products like this, that it enables, you know, Josh
[53:04.920 --> 53:09.200]  and myself and other reporters to go out on these trips and show people what it's like.
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.280]  You know, we became the mainstream media in Southern California because none of the other
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.320]  media was there.
[53:14.320 --> 53:15.880]  They had retreated.
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.120]  They had got their sound bites.
[53:17.120 --> 53:18.120]  They were happy.
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.920]  We showed the protesters and how great and peaceful they are.
[53:20.920 --> 53:24.960]  They didn't want to show the protesters kicking in police cars and slashing tires and beating
[53:24.960 --> 53:25.960]  up people.
[53:25.960 --> 53:27.480]  Oh, I went to all the headlines on Friday.
[53:27.480 --> 53:30.800]  I said, look at the way the mainstream press is talking about this.
[53:30.800 --> 53:35.880]  Unrest at Trump protests, violence at Trump rally, okay?
[53:35.880 --> 53:37.520]  And it's like, it's not unrest.
[53:37.520 --> 53:38.520]  Okay.
[53:38.520 --> 53:39.520]  That's what you get.
[53:39.520 --> 53:41.600]  These are programs, programs for you.
[53:41.600 --> 53:42.940]  They are all programmed.
[53:42.940 --> 53:46.400]  They have the talking points that have been embedded into their skulls from whatever media
[53:46.400 --> 53:47.600]  source they're getting from.
[53:47.600 --> 53:48.600]  Looks like the MSNBC.
[53:48.600 --> 53:51.640]  But they also made it sound as if it was coming from Trump.
[53:51.640 --> 53:52.640]  Right.
[53:52.640 --> 53:53.640]  Oh, yeah.
[53:53.640 --> 53:54.640]  As if it was coming from the Trump supporters.
[53:54.640 --> 53:55.640]  Right.
[53:55.640 --> 53:56.640]  They didn't show where the violence was coming from.
[53:56.640 --> 54:01.040]  And that was implied in their headlines that it was the fault of Trump, just as Cruz is
[54:01.040 --> 54:05.720]  saying that he is encouraging riots, okay, and going to encourage riots in Cleveland.
[54:05.720 --> 54:06.720]  Right.
[54:06.720 --> 54:11.400]  I interviewed a guy right before this happened, right before the spinning out stuff and the
[54:11.400 --> 54:13.520]  rioting started happening in the streets.
[54:13.520 --> 54:17.000]  And he goes, man, I was just trying to walk to get up here and people try to take my hat.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  I got punched.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  I got kicked.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  He's like, this is ridiculous.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  I wasn't even doing anything.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  I wasn't even talking to anybody.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.200]  I was just trying to get through the crowd.
[54:23.200 --> 54:24.200]  Yeah.
[54:24.200 --> 54:27.200]  And that's how loving and tolerant these people are.
[54:27.200 --> 54:28.200]  Yeah, intolerant.
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.280]  You know, destroying their car just for sitting in a car with a Trump t-shirt on.
[54:32.280 --> 54:33.280]  I know.
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.000]  I saw that video where they got around the car, looked like they were going to physically
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  attack them.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  They're hitting the car and everything.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.200]  Meanwhile, they're spraying this white car with graffiti, black graffiti, spitting on
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.200]  them and everything.
[54:44.200 --> 54:45.200]  Yeah.
[54:45.200 --> 54:46.200]  But I mean, spray painting the car.
[54:46.200 --> 54:47.200]  The car was destroyed.
[54:47.200 --> 54:50.560]  They didn't want to carry signs that say, love Trump's hate, love Trump's hate.
[54:50.560 --> 54:53.640]  What they are doing is not love in any way, shape or form.
[54:53.640 --> 54:56.240]  What they are showing is intolerance.
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.000]  And that's why we have to go out there and expose that.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.360]  So I really do want to thank everybody for supporting us because it lets us go out there
[55:01.360 --> 55:03.400]  and expose these people for what they really are.
[55:03.400 --> 55:04.840]  And we're going to continue to do it.
[55:04.840 --> 55:05.840]  Don't worry.
[55:05.840 --> 55:06.840]  We're going to continue.
[55:06.840 --> 55:07.840]  Yeah.
[55:07.840 --> 55:10.720]  And we just had that video from that black guy, the young black guy.
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.240]  He knew exactly what was going on.
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.520]  And he said, these protesters out here have been thoroughly propagandized, he was familiar
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.280]  with Edward Bernays, he knew what that was all about and he said, these people are victims
[55:20.280 --> 55:21.280]  of this.
[55:21.280 --> 55:22.280]  They don't know what they're talking about.
[55:22.280 --> 55:27.320]  All they can do is spout these slogans and spout these epithets that they put on people.
[55:27.320 --> 55:30.520]  You're a racist, you're homophobic, you're misogynist, and they don't want to debate.
[55:30.520 --> 55:32.520]  You start asking them a couple of questions, they run off.
[55:32.520 --> 55:33.520]  They're not about.
[55:33.520 --> 55:34.520]  If you, I'm out of here.
[55:34.520 --> 55:35.520]  They don't want to talk.
[55:35.520 --> 55:36.520]  That's right.
[55:36.520 --> 55:38.720]  Do we have time to play that one compilation from Thursday night?
[55:38.720 --> 55:39.720]  Yeah.
[55:39.720 --> 55:40.720]  Yeah.
[55:40.720 --> 55:41.720]  Let's play that.
[55:41.720 --> 55:42.720]  Let's play that.
[55:42.720 --> 55:43.720]  That's good about it's going viral.
[55:43.720 --> 55:44.720]  People.
[55:44.720 --> 55:45.720]  It's going viral.
[55:45.720 --> 55:46.720]  Megaviral.
[55:46.720 --> 55:48.720]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[55:48.720 --> 55:50.720]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.720]  Migration is a human right.
[55:52.720 --> 55:54.720]  Migration is beautiful.
[55:54.720 --> 55:56.720]  Migration is beautiful.
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.520]  Migration is a human right.
[55:58.520 --> 55:59.520]  Trump's a Nazi.
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.520]  Yeah.
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.520]  How many Jews has Trump killed?
[56:02.520 --> 56:03.520]  Huh?
[56:03.520 --> 56:04.520]  How many Jews has Trump killed?
[56:04.520 --> 56:05.520]  Oh please.
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.520]  How many Polish gypsies?
[56:06.520 --> 56:07.520]  Oh please.
[56:07.520 --> 56:09.520]  You're stupid.
[56:09.520 --> 56:11.520]  Shut up.
[56:11.520 --> 56:13.520]  Shut the fuck up.
[56:13.520 --> 56:15.520]  We don't want to go for your health, homie.
[56:15.520 --> 56:17.520]  Trump, free all the homies.
[56:17.520 --> 56:19.520]  Come on.
[56:19.520 --> 56:21.520]  Free on chop-o.
[56:21.520 --> 56:23.520]  Give me my Mexico.
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.520]  Give me my Daya.
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.520]  Fuck.
[56:27.520 --> 56:29.520]  Trump!
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.520]  Trump!
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.520]  Trump!
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.520]  Trump!
[56:35.520 --> 56:37.520]  If you break up this assembly,
[56:37.520 --> 56:39.520]  if you do not do so,
[56:39.520 --> 56:41.520]  you may be arrested,
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.520]  or something terrible will happen.
[56:43.520 --> 56:45.520]  Trump!
[56:45.520 --> 56:47.520]  Trump!
[56:47.520 --> 56:49.520]  What do you think is going to happen in like five minutes?
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.520]  In like five minutes,
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.520]  there's going to be pepper spray,
[56:53.520 --> 56:55.520]  and riot here running all through the years.
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.520]  I'm hereby declare this to be an unlevel assembly.
[56:57.520 --> 56:59.520]  I don't know if the people
[56:59.520 --> 57:01.520]  of the state of California
[57:01.520 --> 57:03.520]  demand all those assembles
[57:03.520 --> 57:05.520]  out there,
[57:05.520 --> 57:07.520]  and for you,
[57:07.520 --> 57:09.520]  immediately to burn.
[57:09.520 --> 57:11.520]  Word up, like, dude,
[57:11.520 --> 57:13.520]  you said that us Mexicans are bringing all types of bad people
[57:13.520 --> 57:15.520]  to this country?
[57:15.520 --> 57:17.520]  That's incorrect.
[57:23.520 --> 57:25.520]  They're destroying a police car right now,
[57:25.520 --> 57:27.520]  okay, they were jumping on top of it.
[57:27.520 --> 57:29.520]  He just said Trump says we're bringing all bad people here,
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.520]  but they're running all the Mexican flags on their heads,
[57:31.520 --> 57:33.520]  and they're pushing the windows of police cars,
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.520]  that's not bad.
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.520]  Now they're pushing people that they don't like,
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.520]  that's when they're beating up that guy.
[57:39.520 --> 57:41.520]  He's bloodied right now, that's the guy they got bloodied,
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.520]  and now we got the donors.
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.520]  Alright, that video's got over two million views
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.520]  on Facebook, it's gone viral,
[57:47.520 --> 58:02.520]  and we're going to be right back with Rob Do and Joshua.
[58:17.520 --> 58:19.520]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[58:19.520 --> 58:21.520]  Anthroplex is designed with
[58:21.520 --> 58:23.520]  known organic concentrated herbs
[58:23.520 --> 58:25.520]  to create the basic foundation
[58:25.520 --> 58:27.520]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.520]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[58:29.520 --> 58:31.520]  It's time for us to take our bodies back
[58:31.520 --> 58:33.520]  into our own hands,
[58:33.520 --> 58:35.520]  and it starts at infowarslife.com
[58:35.520 --> 58:51.520]  with Anthroplex.
[58:51.520 --> 58:53.520]  More than two years ago,
[58:53.520 --> 58:55.520]  Infowars first told you about our research
[58:55.520 --> 58:57.520]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[58:57.520 --> 58:59.520]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.520]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ,
[59:01.520 --> 59:03.520]  and how the government knowingly
[59:03.520 --> 59:05.520]  has identified out of the food and adding fluoride
[59:05.520 --> 59:07.520]  the bad member of the halogen family
[59:07.520 --> 59:09.520]  into the water.
[59:09.520 --> 59:11.520]  They took the good halogen-L,
[59:11.520 --> 59:13.520]  and put the deadly halogen in.
[59:13.520 --> 59:15.520]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[59:15.520 --> 59:17.520]  as it still is worsening today,
[59:17.520 --> 59:19.520]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[59:19.520 --> 59:21.520]  for your family.
[59:21.520 --> 59:23.520]  Now in 2016, even more information
[59:23.520 --> 59:25.520]  has been revealed concerning the connection
[59:25.520 --> 59:27.520]  between iodine and the gut,
[59:27.520 --> 59:29.520]  which many experts are now saying
[59:29.520 --> 59:31.520]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[59:31.520 --> 59:33.520]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[59:33.520 --> 59:35.520]  This is the real deal, folks,
[59:35.520 --> 59:37.520]  and the truth is that iodine is essential,
[59:37.520 --> 59:39.520]  in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[59:51.520 --> 01:00:01.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.520]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.520]  deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.520]  the information war continues.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.520]  I'm David Knight, and with me are Rob Dew
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.520]  and Joshua Owens, and they were,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.520]  of course, at the Dreamer Riots in California
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.520]  based around the Trump rallies.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.520]  Of course, you're not allowed to have a rally.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.520]  You'll have a lot of, I guess,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.520]  what were these guys about?
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.520]  High school to college age,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.520]  most of them coming out with Mexican flags,
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.520]  waving them, wearing them on their heads,
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.520]  and smashing police cars, you know,
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.520]  because you can't have a political rally.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.520]  It was an interesting thing,
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.520]  and we're going to come back to the videos
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.520]  and what you guys saw there,
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520]  but I want to get your reaction to this.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520]  Listen to what Heidi Cruz said yesterday.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.520]  Let's play this clip.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520]  Ted is an immigrant.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.520]  He is a Hispanic.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520]  Ted is an immigrant.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.520]  He is a Hispanic.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.520]  This is an interesting admission,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520]  because this is something that's,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.520]  yeah, let's play that one more time.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.520]  Ted is an immigrant.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.520]  He is a Hispanic, okay?
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.520]  Now, this is something that's picked up
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.520]  on the Washington Examiner.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.520]  It was interesting because the context of this
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.520]  was how he's going to unify the party.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.520]  That's the next thing she said, okay?
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.520]  He's been winning the women's vote
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.520]  in state after state.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520]  Well, he didn't win it in the last six years at all.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  He was like way behind
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.520]  in every demographic, okay,
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520]  in every state.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.520]  But of course, if he wins one state,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  he's got momentum again, according to his people.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520]  But here's the thing.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.520]  She's trying to make this case,
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520]  and they will be whoever they need to be
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]  so to these people, she's saying,
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520]  Ted is an immigrant. He is a Hispanic.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  And I look at this, and I think about
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.520]  what Donald Trump said.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.520]  He said, well, you know, Ted Cruz is a Canadian
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  until about 14 or 15 months ago, okay?
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.520]  And I have to ask myself.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  We will protect a banker class.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.520]  Yeah, you know, when questioned about
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520]  his natural born citizen status,
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520]  Ted Cruz always says, well, I'm a lawyer.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.520]  I've argued before the Supreme Court.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.520]  I know what a natural born citizen is,
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.520]  and yet he wants to tell us that he had no idea
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.520]  he was a Canadian citizen until just 14 or 15 months ago.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.520]  I mean, how is this guy
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.520]  even remotely competent or honest
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.520]  if either those things are true?
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.520]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.520]  There is a difference, and people need to understand this,
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520]  there is a difference between a naturalized
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520]  citizen and a natural born citizen.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.520]  That qualification was in there.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.520]  If you want to go back and look at the discussions
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520]  around the time the Constitution was ratified,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  if you want to be an originalist,
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.520]  which is what Ted Cruz says he's going to support,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520]  put into the Supreme Court,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.520]  if you want to know what the Constitution means,
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.520]  what these phrases mean, just like
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520]  you want to know what militia means,
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520]  you can go back and you look at the deliberations
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  at the time the Constitution was passed.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.520]  It's not rocket science.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.520]  It's not hidden. It's not some obscure thing.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520]  We know what it means.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.520]  He doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.520]  He just wants to say, hey, I'm a...
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.520]  I'm a...
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.520]  I'm qualified.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  David, I met two naturalized citizens.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.520]  I definitely met more, but I interviewed two.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.520]  One was from Ecuador and one was from Australia.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.520]  And they talked about the process
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.520]  they had to go through.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.520]  It took...
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.520]  One of the things I don't like about that process
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.520]  is they had to get her up...
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.520]  The lady had to get her up to date on her vaccine.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.520]  She mentioned that. She was not into vaccines at all.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.520]  And she didn't agree with that,
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.520]  but she wanted to become a citizen.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.520]  But they said one took six years,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520]  one took seven years.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.520]  It's not a cakewalk,
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.520]  but I said, was it worth the effort?
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.520]  I came to this country because I want to be part of it.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.520]  And one guy said, you know, when I came here,
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520]  I was a liberal Democrat.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.520]  And then when I got to see how things really work
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  in this country, I switched it.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.520]  He was a huge Trump supporter.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  People were screaming at him, calling him a racist
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.520]  and a race trader and everything else.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.520]  I interviewed him at the rally,
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520]  and then I interviewed him out in the street
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.520]  after he was leaving. He was walking away.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.520]  I said, hey, man, how's it going? He's like,
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.520]  I don't know what's going on. These people hate me now.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  They call me a race trader. They don't like me.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.520]  They're pushing me. And, you know,
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.520]  he was just trying to leave the event.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520]  Well, that's one aspect of it.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.520]  Shutting down people's free speech
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.520]  and the intolerance as part of that.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.520]  But then here's the other thing.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.520]  And this is the intolerance and the despising
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.520]  of the popular vote that I saw from George Will,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520]  for example. He writes an op-ed piece
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.520]  for the Washington Post. He says,
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.520]  if Trump is nominated, the GOP
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.520]  must keep him out of the White House.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520]  In other words, make sure that Hillary gets in there
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.520]  for the good of the GOP.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.520]  The reason they don't want Trump in there,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.520]  the reason people like George Will
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.520]  would like to see Hillary in is because
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.520]  of the globalist treaties.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.520]  It's a division between globalism and nationalism.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520]  It's not about anything else.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.520]  And the West doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.520]  That's right. We'll be right back.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:05:02.520]  Stay with us.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.520]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.520]  10% off on auto-ship.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.520]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.520]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:22.520]  when you shot an auto-ship.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.520]  This is David Knight with Rob Dew and Josh Owens.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.520]  They've been here showing some new videos
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.520]  that have just gone up on infowars.com
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.520]  as well as one that's gone viral, I think, on Facebook.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.520]  It's got about 2 million views already just on Facebook, I think.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.520]  We're going to be showing some other videos.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.520]  Also, we'll be taking some of your calls and questions for them
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520]  as to what they saw with the Dreamer riots.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520]  Before we get back to the suppression
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.520]  of free speech and the intolerance,
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.520]  I wanted to read a quote from George Will.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.520]  This course was on The Washington Post.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.520]  In the last segment, his total despising of the popular vote.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.520]  This is an elitist party apparatchic talking here.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.520]  Listen to what he has to say.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.520]  Indiana and California can, by supporting crews,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.520]  make the Republican Convention a deliberative body
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.520]  rather than one that merely ratifies decisions made elsewhere.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.520]  Where would those decisions have been made, guys?
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.520]  He's talking about the elections, okay?
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:23.520]  So he thinks that the convention needs to make this decision,
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.520]  of course, rather than ratifying decisions
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.520]  that were made by voters across the country.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.520]  And he goes, a convention's sovereign duty
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.520]  is to choose a plausible nominee
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:35.520]  who has a reasonable chance to win,
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.520]  not to passively affirm the will of a mere plurality of voters
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.520]  that was recorded episodically in a protracted process.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.520]  Well, okay, let's understand.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.520]  What he's saying is that their responsibility
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:53.520]  is to pick somebody and not go to the plurality of voters.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520]  Just ignore that, okay?
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.520]  That plurality of voters recording episodically
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.520]  in a protracted process, that's what we call a primary election.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520]  And that's the contempt these people have for this.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.520]  He says, if Trump were to be nominated,
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520]  conservatives would have two tasks.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.520]  The first one to be make sure that he loses 50 states.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.520]  These are the insiders. This is the insiders of the GOP.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520]  Listen to what Ted Cruz said along the same lines.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.520]  He said the last contested convention we had was in 1976.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.520]  Ronald Reagan had a million more votes than Gerald Ford,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.520]  but Gerald Ford got the votes of the majority of the delegates.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.520]  Now, what Ted Cruz doesn't say is, what happened to Gerald Ford?
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.520]  He lost miserably to Jimmy Carter, okay, why?
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.520]  Because they threw out the mere plurality of voters, okay?
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.520]  They have contempt for the voters.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.520]  That didn't work out too well for the GOP establishment, did it?
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.520]  And then he goes on to say, I'll use a football analogy.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]  This is Ted Cruz again.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.520]  He says, if you're on the 30-yard line and it's not a touchdown,
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.520]  Donald right now is on the 30-yard line and wants everybody to say,
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.520]  hey, the game is over, I'm past the 50, so what?
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]  He can't earn a majority.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.520]  Well, here's the real analogy, okay?
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.520]  The real analogy is that time has expired, okay?
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.520]  And let's say right now at this point,
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.520]  Trump is ahead 900 to 500, okay?
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.520]  So let's take it down to a football number.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.520]  36 to 20, okay?
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.520]  So at the end of regular play, team A is ahead by 36 to 20.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.520]  Team B demands that we have sudden death over time
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.520]  and that they get new rules, new players, and they own the refs, okay?
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.520]  That's the real reality here that Ted Cruz is talking about.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520]  It's a rigged process.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.520]  They want to overthrow the ballot box just like these rioters
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.520]  that you guys were recording want to overthrow the soapbox.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.520]  I got an analogy for you.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.520]  Ted Cruz is an anchor and he's just pulling people down.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.520]  Here it is from the Daily Caller, Glenn Beck.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.520]  My campaigning with Cruz didn't cause layoffs at the Blaze.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.520]  The Blaze has apparently laid off 40 employees
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.520]  and lost $500,000 campaigning with Ted Cruz.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]  That's Glenn Beck's outfit.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.520]  So now that Glenn Beck has jumped the shark literally
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  over to the Ted Cruz camp, he's literally just going up in flames.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.520]  He's an anchor around Glenn Beck's legs
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.520]  and then Carly Fiorina is an anchor around Ted Cruz's legs.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.520]  So they're just adding anchor after anchor on this.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  So yeah, poor Beck.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.520]  He's really eating his words at this point.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]  Yes, I've lost money.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]  I've lost half a million dollars.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]  That's my choice.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]  I believe in something.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]  I'm not sure what he's believing in.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.520]  I don't know what Ted Cruz believes in.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  You can't tell if you don't know what he believes in.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]  Absolutely.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.520]  He's got a piece of software that's basically
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.520]  the Hitchhiker's Guide to Winning Elections, okay?
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.520]  He pulls up this device as people are going door to door
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.520]  and it tells them exactly what to say to you.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.520]  It's kind of like a debabilizer, okay?
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.520]  This person speaks this language, so talk to them this way.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520]  Tell them precisely what they want to hear.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.520]  He doesn't stand for anything.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.520]  He's been on both sides of every issue.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.520]  He's really the John Kerry of the GOP.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.520]  But what you can see in this, the consistency,
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520]  is that he will say or do anything.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520]  And now what he's saying is that Donald Trump will do
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520]  everything he can to encourage riots.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.520]  Did you see Donald Trump out there smashing cars?
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.520]  Did you see Donald Trump supporters out there smashing cars?
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520]  Burning flags.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.520]  Did they grab Mexican flags from the protesters
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.520]  and burn them in their face?
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.520]  At every event that I've been to,
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.520]  and I've been to probably 15 now,
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.520]  I've never seen a Donald Trump person go out
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.520]  and try to find and pick a fight.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.520]  They're standing in line trying to get in.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.520]  They want to get in and see what Donald has to say,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.520]  even though people who are skeptical are like,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  I'm not sure if I like this guy or not,
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520]  but I want to see what he has to say.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.520]  I want to see what the crowd's like,
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.520]  because apparently they think it's some,
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.520]  the people on the outside,
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.520]  the people who hate Trump think it's some sort of
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520]  clan rally that's going on in there.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520]  When it's just a guy speaking,
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.520]  you can see all of his speeches on YouTube.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.520]  Okay, there's no clan rally going on.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.520]  There's no cross burning.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.520]  It's just talking about how do we take our country,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.520]  which has been dragged down by the globalists
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.520]  and how do we change that?
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.520]  And unfortunately, these young kids,
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.520]  these impressionable youths have been duped by,
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520]  Facebook who's pushing an anti-Trump movement,
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.520]  who's pushing open borders,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  yet the owner of Facebook lives around a wall.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520]  How ironic is that?
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  You've got this crowd of people who just
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.520]  are literally their brainwashed, wouldn't you say?
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.520]  Yeah, well, at the end of that video,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.520]  when you talk to that Mexican guy and you say,
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]  how is Trump racist?
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.520]  And he can't explain it.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.520]  So then he reverts to,
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.520]  well, a friend of a friend of a friend told me
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.520]  that Trump would make his employees leave the room
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.520]  because he hated them because they were black
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.520]  in Mexican.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520]  It's like a friend of a friend.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.520]  So they have this bubble think, bubble speak,
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.520]  where they're in their little groups.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.520]  They don't know what's going on in the world.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.520]  I mean, there are cars spinning around them.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  They're jumping out in front of it.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  They're jumping around in the streets like,
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  that's a block part.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520]  Right there.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]  They're delusional and it's obvious,
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.520]  especially when you're there and you look in their eyes
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.520]  and you see them spitting on someone's car,
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.520]  destroying someone's car just for wearing a Trump shirt.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]  Yeah, and they're saying,
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.520]  he says we're bad people as a smashed police car.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.520]  Right, bloody people's faces.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.520]  And he's in there, in the rally with people
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.520]  of all different races and cultures
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.520]  who are holding up pictures of loved ones
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.520]  who've been killed by illegal aliens who've come in here,
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.520]  unvetted, and they're criminals
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520]  and we're not allowed to vet them.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.520]  That would be bad for us to do that.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.520]  But you know, that's a, and now we've got some,
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]  there's a car.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]  Yeah, that's the car getting destroyed.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.520]  And then you had the guy who was just trying
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.520]  to get out of the parking lot.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520]  They block him up.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  He gets out of his car saying,
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520]  hey, can you guys move?
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.520]  Someone grabs his hat and then he lunges for his hat
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  because those hats were pretty expensive.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.520]  You know, the $30 Make America, the MAGA hat.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.520]  And they use that as an excuse to pounce on this guy
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.520]  and literally beat the tar out of him.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520]  I mean, and I can tell you standing there,
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.520]  I heard that guy, the meat in his face split open
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520]  as how hard they hit him in the face.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.520]  And his face was covered in blood
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.520]  just for wearing a Trump hat and standing there.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.520]  I'm trying to leave.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.520]  They're so tolerant.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520]  They're so, so nice.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.520]  And it's so great to see that coming here.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.520]  And we can't vet that.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520]  We can't punish them because that would be racist.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.520]  Right, right.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.520]  And no matter what they do, if you deport them,
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.520]  if you send them to jail, then that's racism.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520]  And I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.520]  You know, I think when we look at these events here,
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.520]  if people look at this and look at what was going on the inside
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.520]  and they look at what these people are doing,
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.520]  to me, that is the end of the election right there.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.520]  How do you justify that right there?
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.520]  How in any way, shape, or form can you go,
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.520]  oh, that's cool because he was what Trump?
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520]  Like the mindset there.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.520]  Just the total idiotic brainwashing.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520]  It's a game mindset.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520]  Yeah, it's a mob mentality.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.520]  And I call those people thugs.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.520]  Why do you call them thugs?
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.520]  Thugs would go out and do that to somebody.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.520]  The only person that thinks that is okay is a thug.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520]  And it's that kind of tribalism thinking,
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.520]  okay, that feeds the cartels as much as the war on drugs.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.520]  I want to, do we have time to play another video?
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.520]  Let's go to another video.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.520]  But I also want to give out this number
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.520]  because I know a lot of people want to ask you guys some questions.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520]  On Sunday, we've got a different number.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.520]  It's 877-789-2539.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:02.520]  That's 877-789-2539 if you want to call in with questions or with comments.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520]  I'd love to hear from people who were there.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.520]  If you were there at that event, at either event,
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.520]  the San Francisco event or the one in Orange County, which was Costa Mesa.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520]  If you're at either one of those events, definitely call in
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.520]  and give us your perspective on what you saw.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.520]  Were you one of the rioters showing love
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.520]  or were you one of the people standing in line
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.520]  just waiting to go in and see Trump
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.520]  and one of the disappointed people that didn't get in?
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520]  Let me tell you.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520]  Or maybe you got in.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.520]  And again, that number is 877-789-Alex.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.520]  Towards the end, when they closed off the gates
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.520]  and there was only one gate open,
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.520]  it was like a Black Friday people trying to get in.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]  So many people wanted to see Trump.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.520]  It's amazing.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.520]  These people were really, really supporting him.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.520]  But nobody was violent then either.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.520]  They were just like, hey, we want to get in.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520]  But Ted Cruz says those people were the problem.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.520]  Yeah.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.520]  Not the rioters, not the open border immigrants.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.520]  Go to the crooked Ted Cruz Valley.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.520]  See what happens.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.520]  And that number is 877-789-Alex if you want to call in.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.520]  Yeah.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.520]  First of all, I want to say,
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.520]  secret 12-act two,
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520]  Superman,
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.520]  brain force,
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]  prostagart,
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]  silver bullet.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]  I use them all.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.520]  They're phenomenal.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.520]  They work.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.520]  I am involved.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]  Thank you, brother.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.520]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.520]  I am a relatively short-time listener
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.520]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.520]  Welcome to the Info War.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.520]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520]  that support your health
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.520]  and the Info War at the same time.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.520]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520]  I buy all the nutraceuticals,
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520]  FUFX,
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520]  Nissan,
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520]  I got many guys a question.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.520]  Have they worked for you?
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.520]  They're one of the most unbelievable products
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.520]  I've ever had in my life.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.520]  What products are you taking?
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520]  Everything from SuperMail
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520]  to BrainForce,
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.520]  to Winter Sun,
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.520]  X2,
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.520]  even got a little DNA force.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.520]  So when I just re-upped everything
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.520]  and I just went to auto-fill.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520]  Visit infowarslife.com
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.520]  to read the information and research
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.520]  and to see the reviews for yourself.

[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.520]  Instead of buying five, six,
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.520]  or even seven different cleansing products,
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.520]  we use decades-old scientific research
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.520]  that puts together the Rolls Royce

[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.520]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.520]  is the only product on the market
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520]  that uses our proprietary
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.520]  SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520]  We use only the highest-quality organic herbs
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.520]  backed by serious research,
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520]  and we still bring it to you
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520]  at the best price out there.

[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520]  That's infowarslife.com
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:07.520]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]  I've been working all day.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.520]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.520]  I get in here at 8.30.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.520]  I was kind of run down.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520]  I just didn't feel like I was going to make it
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520]  I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520]  it's like bing.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.520]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.520]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]  People really love it.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520]  Read about it.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]  Find out why third-party
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.520]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.520]  because it really does have
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.520]  the best organic-based systems
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.520]  that will blow your socks off.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.520]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.520]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.520]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.520]  I took three hours of sleep, got up,
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.520]  took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.520]  You will find Brain Force
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.520]  and other game-changing products
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.520]  at infowarslife.com
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.520]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.520]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520]  Good, brother.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.520]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.520]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.520]  Me and my wife both used a lot of them
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.520]  and it made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520]  Well, thank you, brother,
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]  because it also funds our operation,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520]  but doing that,
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.520]  I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.520]  Supermail vitality was developed
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.520]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.520]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.520]  We did the Supermail and the Super Female Vitality.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.520]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.520]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks,
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520]  energy shots,
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  they've got a ton of money there.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.520]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520]  harvested around the planet
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.520]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.520]  They want to stun and dumb down
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520]  and energy drinks and stuff
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520]  just cover that up for a while,
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520]  but then burn you out.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]  In my experience,
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520]  where the stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.520]  goes right to the source.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.520]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.520]  Visit infowarslife.com today

[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.520]  I'm David Knight here with Rob Dew and Josh Owens,
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.520]  who are just out at the Dreamer Riots in California.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.520]  Riots that occurred around the Trump rally.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.520]  We're also going to go to your calls.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.520]  Terry, David, Chris, others.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.520]  Hang on, we're going to go to you in just a moment.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.520]  We've got one more video that we want to show
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.520]  and talk about.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520]  Before we do that,
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:48.520]  I also want to let you know about the end of the mega sale
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.520]  on InfoWars Select Storeable Food.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.520]  That's 30 to 40% off at infowarsstore.com
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.520]  and this is a huge discount, folks.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520]  Huge, huge.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520]  Huge.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.520]  This is, and of course, 30 to 40% off.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  This is going to end on Friday.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.520]  Alex extended it through tonight,
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.520]  but this will definitely be the end of it.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.520]  He did that as a thank you to people
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.520]  and to help you prepare.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520]  We're looking at these riots.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.520]  We're looking at how our society is on the verge
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.520]  of breaking down
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.520]  and as Rob Dew was just talking about,
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.520]  one of these riots,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.520]  somebody who's living in San Francisco
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.520]  in a city on an earthquake zone,
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]  comes over and says,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520]  what are you, one of these preppers?
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520]  And he's like, yeah, yeah,
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.520]  we need to take some preparation
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.520]  for our family, for ourselves.
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.520]  And this is one way that you can take advantage
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520]  of this mega sale.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.520]  30 to 40% off InfoWars Select Storeable Food

[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.520]  It's a good time to secure your supply right now.

[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520]  So you help us by letting us know
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520]  how to manage our inventory better.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520]  And we try to extend that savings to you
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.520]  with a 10% discount.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:11.520]  Again, Supermail Vitality is about to sell out
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.520]  and tonight ends the sale of 30 to 40% off
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.520]  InfoWars Select Storeable Food at infowarsstore.com.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.520]  Tell us about this next video, Rob.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.520]  Well, first of all,
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.520]  as I walk around with an InfoWars mic,
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]  I get a lot of people,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520]  hey, InfoWars, hey, InfoWars, great, I love it.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.520]  Glad InfoWars here.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.520]  Then you get some people that hate free speech
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.520]  and hate freedom and hate liberty
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.520]  and want to have a totalitarian fascist state,
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520]  a dictatorship.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]  Get out of here.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520]  I need some muscle to remove these reports.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520]  Exactly.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520]  Any of that stuff.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520]  And so I look at these guys
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.520]  and they're like, how could you support Trump?
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]  How could you support him?
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520]  In the beginning, I wasn't for Trump.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  You weren't for Trump.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.520]  But when you see both sides of the snake,
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.520]  of the eagle of death,
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520]  which is the Democrats and the Republicans
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520]  attacking this guy,
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520]  it makes you think, why are they so mad at this guy?
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520]  What has he done?
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.520]  Do they really care about Americans and Americans?
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.520]  No, we know that's true.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.520]  We know the Democrats don't give a fly in F
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]  about what's going on in our country.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.520]  Neither do the Republicans, those die-hard groups.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520]  They could care less.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.520]  They are for themselves.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.520]  They are for special interests.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.520]  That's what pisses me off so much,
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:18.520]  that these people, how could you be for Trump?
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520]  How dare you?
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520]  Because I have long hair.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.520]  Look, we know he's not a libertarian.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520]  Yeah, we know he's not a libertarian.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520]  When it comes to libertarian,
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520]  or when it comes to individual liberty,
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.520]  it's a Hobson's choice.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.520]  We don't have a choice, okay?
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.520]  They got one thing that they put out there.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.520]  And when we're looking at Donald Trump, however,
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.520]  there is a choice between globalism and nationalism.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.520]  And if we don't make that choice now,
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]  and that's something that the president
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]  can legitimately do,
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.520]  some of these issues that they get people
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520]  so fired up about,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520]  aren't things that the president can do anything,
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.520]  or should do anything, according to the Constitution, okay?
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.520]  But this is something, in terms of the globalism
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.520]  versus nationalism, if we can keep the nation,
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.520]  if we can keep from turning over our government
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:02.520]  to offshore committees who are going to manage our economy
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  to the people who are going to set up carbon taxes
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520]  to shut us down,
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.520]  if we can maintain our borders,
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.520]  maintain our country,
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520]  maintain our Constitution, at least in theory,
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520]  then we can restore it in practice.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.520]  We have an opportunity to do that,
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.520]  and we can do that at places other than the president.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520]  But when it comes to the president,
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.520]  there's nobody out there that's talking about the bill rights.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.520]  Exactly.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.520]  Or the 28 pages.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520]  No one wants to talk about that.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520]  Trump is, and they really do hate him,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]  and they really made it clear.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.520]  I mean, we look at people unmasking,
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]  like George Will, and saying,
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.520]  well, he got to make sure if he gets a nomination
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520]  that he loses in all 50 states.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520]  Yeah.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520]  Okay.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.520]  This is an uncoordinated attack on all sides,
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.520]  and people need to figure out, like,
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520]  why are they doing this?
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.520]  And not necessarily go, hey, I'm behind Trump.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520]  One thing Trump said, he's only going to run,
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.520]  he's only going to be president for four years if he wins.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.520]  He said, I'm just going to do it for four years,
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  and I'm out.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]  Okay, that should tell you something.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.520]  That should tell you this guy is not thirsting for power.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.520]  He's going to get in, do what he's going to do,
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.520]  and then move on and let somebody else take over.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520]  But maybe that's enough time.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520]  Maybe that four years is enough time for our country
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  to wake up and really see what's going on in the world.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]  And I just blindly follow these demagogues out there,
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.520]  these media talking heads that tell you,
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.520]  you know, the sky is green when it's really blue.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  Well, it's very important for people to understand
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.520]  how this whole system has been rigged.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.520]  They need to understand that we've had a single party
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.520]  at the top when it comes to issues of globalism,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.520]  of things like NAFTA, and these new treaties
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520]  that they're presenting us with,
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520]  the Trans-Pacific Transatlantic Partnership.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520]  That's what they need to understand.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520]  Let's go to that report right now,
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.520]  and let's play that,
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520]  and we'll talk about that when we come back,
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.520]  and we'll take your calls.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.520]  Seeing all this opposition coming from Bernie
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.520]  and Hillary supporters,
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.520]  and sitting there talking about,
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  we're liberal, we're loving,
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.520]  we just want peace, yet they throw eggs at you
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520]  and punch you in the mouth,
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.520]  because they're peaceful and loving.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.520]  I saw what went down in Southern California.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520]  It got to me, I had to come out here
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.520]  and actually talk about what's going on.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.520]  These people don't want to talk to you.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520]  That's the problem.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.520]  They sit there and say they don't have double standards,
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.520]  and that they're not hypocritical.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.520]  They'll come up to you and just yell and scream.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:13.520]  Maltese racist can't get cut.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.520]  All right, they just said they were going to be arrested.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.520]  Got people being triggered.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:32.520]  This one presents slavery, colonialism, genocide, oppression,
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.520]  and it's all right.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.520]  Yeah, no other countries do this.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.520]  There's no Muslim countries killing gays right now.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.520]  It's just the United States, it's better.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.520]  That's right.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.520]  Disillusion used.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520]  Burning the flag right now.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.520]  They're burning the American flag at this point.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.520]  No hate in our state.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520]  Here's a useful duke.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520]  No hate in our state.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.520]  They're not practicing hate at all right now.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520]  That's right.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520]  No hate in our state.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.520]  No hate in our state.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.520]  No hate in our state.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.520]  We can't let a guy, we're so afraid of one man
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.520]  that we can't let him speak.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.520]  We're going to try to correct.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.520]  Now, if people were burning,
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.520]  they're burning an effigy.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.520]  If you did that with any other person,
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.520]  you would be a heretic.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.520]  You would have to be crucified.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.520]  We're wearing stickers that said decapitate Trump.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.520]  Yeah, decapitate Trump.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.520]  Would anybody else have been hating crime?
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520]  God, it's cool.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.520]  It's okay.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520]  It's okay if you're brown
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520]  and want to burn something in efforts.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520]  That's when it's okay.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520]  There they are pushing us off a skybridge
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.520]  right now in the cops.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.520]  And that was just press up there.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.520]  They didn't even want press up there.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.520]  This was an anti-Trump guy who really wanted to get into a fight.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.520]  This was a lady who got arrested.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.520]  I'm a mother f***ing American.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.520]  You're a despressive person.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520]  You're a despозяpe.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520]  You don't stand up to hot the peasants.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.020]  You're a desp FARI.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.520]  You're f***king despasket you're f***ing despaction.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520]  You're a desp羅.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520]  You don't stand up to hot the peasants.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520]  You don't stick the konsecfice blow-up.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520]  You're f***ing despבת.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520]  Both of us are pelvis mewing.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520]  Both of those people were Hispanic, by the way.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]  They were telling her she was a disgrace.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520]  Because she is really.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]  She later said she'd rather be young and dumb
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]  than old and Poli呢.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.020]  Well, here they are, they come to this country
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.020]  They burn the American flag,
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.020]  they fly the Mexican flag,
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:06.520]  and they get in people's faces.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520]  And of course Ted Cruz says,
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520]  Donald Trump is lying.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.000]  That's loving, that's the new love now, okay?
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.480]  That's what we've been conditioned to accept,
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.560]  that love is getting in people's faces
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.120]  at political rallies and pushing them,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.200]  spitting on them and cussing at them and punching them out.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.040]  That's love.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:19.880]  That's amazing.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.760]  Let's go to Terry in Virginia, Terry.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.040]  We've got just a little bit of time,
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:24.880]  and if we don't have time,
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.160]  we'll hold you over through the break.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.680]  Go ahead, Terry.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.760]  Hi, I just wanted to report two things.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.400]  I was a delegate at the Virginia State
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.360]  Republican Convention over the weekend.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.560]  One thing that was a troubling thing
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.840]  is that we came away with voting on a slate
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.680]  that had 10 crews, delegates, and crew members.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.520]  Okay, hang on.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.200]  We're gonna go to a break or out of time.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.920]  You can tell us what the results were when we come back.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.760]  Stay with us.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.680]  David Knight, Rob Dew, and Josh Owens and our caller
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.880]  are there, Terry in Virginia.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.720]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.400]  Hey, Joe Biggs here with some brand new information
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.040]  about the social justice warrior fight for freedom
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.480]  and allowing men to go into women's restrooms.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.320]  Target stores open women's bathrooms
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.760]  and changing rooms to men.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.680]  Yay, now our women and daughters are safe.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.040]  It's so accepting and progressive, it's cool.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.720]  The Target department store chain has jumped
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.200]  into the transgender bathroom debate
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.160]  by declaring that men who claim to be women
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.200]  may use whatever bathroom or changing room they choose.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.040]  Yay, we're making such progressive waves.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.400]  Inclusivity is a core belief
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]  that Target and new company statement reads
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.720]  is something we celebrate.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.720]  We stand for equality and strive
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.320]  to make our guests and team members feel accepted,
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.600]  respected, and welcomed in our stores
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.920]  and workplaces every day.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:39.760]  We're not even worried
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.440]  about the actual transgendered people.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.440]  It's the pedophiles.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.520]  It's the ones you're gonna go in there, put on a dress,
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.360]  and go after young girls.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.040]  That is what we're worried about.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.200]  This has got to end.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.640]  The social justice warrior bulls*** is f***ing ridiculous.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.360]  I'm Joe Biggs, and I do not approve this message.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:01.360]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.600]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.840]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.600]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.640]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.120]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.240]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.080]  But in the 21st century,
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.600]  there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.120]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.240]  and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.720]  turn off our hormones,
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.400]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.840]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.520]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic,
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:45.840]  concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.040]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.880]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.040]  into our own hands
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.480]  as it starts at inforwarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.440]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here,
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.600]  host of The Bright Side,
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.520]  and as many of you know,
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.440]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.480]  You've all heard the shocking statistics,
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.480]  despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare,
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.200]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.440]  obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.640]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.000]  One out of three or four people
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.560]  is dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.480]  and everyone knows at least one person
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.200]  with a degenerative disease.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.760]  If you're dealing with a health challenge,
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.040]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.280]  your vigor and longevity,
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.240]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.280]  to incorporate nutritional raw materials

[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.720]  the fundamental nutrients,

[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.520]  and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,

[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early,
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.760]  and aging sets in.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.840]  No one has put together a formula
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.880]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.040]  nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.040]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.040]  Just one of the key compounds,

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  You're listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.560]  I'm David Knight with Rob Do and Josh Owens.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.760]  We've been talking about what happened in California
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.640]  with the Dreamer riots.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.600]  And now we're going to take your calls.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.200]  We were just talking to Terry in Virginia.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.480]  She was a delegate to the Virginia GOP convention.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.840]  Terry ran out of time just as you were telling us
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:47.680]  what happened there.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.320]  Recap how many people were there
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.640]  and what the decision was that was made.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.080]  Go ahead.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:57.480]  Well, there were supposed to be over 5,000 delegates
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.960]  that were supposed to attend.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.040]  But we ended up with less than 3,000 that showed up.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:07.920]  We were given a list of 78 delegates
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.280]  to go to the national convention.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.280]  27 of those delegates had committed to Cruz,
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.600]  16 committed to Trump.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.400]  We had 32 that were undeclared and three for K-6.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.280]  And at the end of the day when we were ready to vote,
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.760]  they handed us what they call a slate.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.720]  And this is, I'm not exactly sure how they choose
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.360]  these 13 delegates to go to the national convention
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.200]  out of the 78 that we were given.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.760]  But we ended up with 10 Cruz delegates
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.040]  going to the national convention and three Trumps.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.040]  In a state where Donald Trump won 35% of the popular vote
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.040]  and Ted Cruz won 17%.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.040]  Now, I was a voter in favor of Ted Cruz,
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.040]  so I'm not like he wanted to stay on Kennedy.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.640]  I'm not a Trump liner that's complaining
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.440]  about this delegate process.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.040]  But it was obvious to me at the end of the day
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  that this was rigged.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.040]  It was stacked.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.040]  It was, you know...
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.640]  Well, it's what I mentioned earlier
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.040]  when we see this editorial from George Will
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.040]  saying that we shouldn't allow
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.040]  voters who have been recorded episodically
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.040]  in a protracted process determine
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:23.040]  who the nominee is going to be.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.040]  In other words, he's just flat out rejecting
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  the whole idea of having primary elections.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]  And then we have Ted Cruz say this.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.040]  He says, it's going to be a battle to see
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.040]  who can earn a majority of the delegates
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.040]  elected by the people at the convention.
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.040]  And it's like, wait a minute, which one is it?
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040]  Is it going to be the delegates that were elected by the people?
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040]  Or is it going to be the delegates
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.040]  that the GOP and Ted Cruz selected to go to the convention?
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040]  That's the thing that I'm concerned about.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.040]  And you say you're a Cruz supporter.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.040]  Wouldn't you think that the people that are quote, unquote,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.040]  Cruz delegates, that they would be supporting Cruz
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.040]  and the people who are Trump delegates
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  would be people who are loyal to Trump
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:00.040]  to go to the convention?
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.040]  Wouldn't you think that would be the way
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.040]  that it would be arranged, Terry?
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040]  Well, that's the way it should be.
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.040]  Yeah.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.040]  And there were plenty of this area today.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.040]  I tell you, there were a lot of arguing.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.040]  There was a lot of arguing going on.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.040]  It was my first experience as a delegate.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.040]  I was told that there was a lot more arguing
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.040]  and, you know, about this delegate thing going on
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.040]  than had ever happened.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.040]  So people are really set up.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.040]  Well, you know, it's not just you.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.040]  It was the former, and I think she's two-term governor,
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.040]  Jan Brewer of Arizona, went to the Arizona convention,
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.040]  GOP convention yesterday, where they actually
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.040]  chose the individual delegates after they'd had the election.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.040]  After Donald Trump had gotten over,
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.040]  he'd gotten 40-some odd percent of the vote.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.040]  He had all 58 delegates according to the election.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.040]  But then Ted Cruz got every single one of them.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040]  And Jan Brewer, the former governor,
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.040]  I think two-time governor, said,
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  I've been a delegate to the last five GOP conventions,
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  and I was excluded because I was loyal to Trump.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.040]  I mean, that's amazing to me.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.040]  I just see them taking over the entire electoral process
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.040]  and doing it in such a blatant fashion.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.040]  I mean, it's not even a split.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.040]  It's unanimous for Trump, and then they switch it around
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.040]  at the convention to where it's unanimous for Cruz.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.040]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.040]  Well, if you look at the percentages,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.040]  I mean, it's just crazy if Trump had 35 percent
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.040]  of the popular vote and Cruz only had 17.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:29.040]  Well, if you're giving Ted Cruz 10 delegates to go,
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.040]  and that's 77 percent of the delegates,
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.040]  and Trump has three, which is only 23 percent.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.040]  And there was a lot more people in the race
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040]  when Virginia was happening. It wasn't just three like it is now.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.040]  That's right. I think that was back at Super Tuesday.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.040]  Yeah.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040]  Well, thank you so much, Terry.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040]  We got a lot of callers that are backed up here.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040]  Let's go to Chris in Indiana.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.040]  Hello, Chris.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.040]  Hey, go ahead.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.040]  Hi, I'm from South Bend, Indiana,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  and I'm going to a Trump rally tomorrow.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.040]  Mm-hmm.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.040]  Look, all this racism stuff, I am proud to be white,
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.040]  and this has turned into anti-racist is codeterm for anti-white.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:13.040]  And like race, like this whole war on language,
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.040]  racist really means,
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.040]  it's not like you're against another race.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.040]  Racist, the definition basically is you're proud to be a race,
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.040]  and it's like only white people cannot be proud of their race.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.040]  That's because the system hates white people
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.040]  because we love guns.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.040]  We know we were pissed off.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.040]  I mean, we love the family.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.040]  Well, I think it's amazing that La Raza,
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.040]  I think it's amazing that La Raza, which is Spanish for the race,
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:43.040]  can do this, and yet nobody calls them racists.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.040]  They can say people La Raza.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.040]  Blakely racist.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  Exactly.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.040]  That's what you heard at the events.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:51.040]  I heard it too many times to count.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.040]  So are you going to the Trump rally tomorrow?
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040]  Is there one there in Indiana?
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040]  Yeah, I work downtown.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:02.040]  I'm a medical technologist downtown here in South Bend,
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.040]  and I'm just going to walk there because I,
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.040]  I mean, I'm not going to bring my car anywhere on there.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.040]  I'm just seeing my police cars getting shaken up
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.040]  and stomped on and all this.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.040]  I'll just take the six block block.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.040]  Yeah, there's no concern for private property.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.040]  I would have a camera ready and a backup camera
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040]  in case that one goes down.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040]  And be sure all your batteries are charged
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.040]  because you never know when stuff is going to break out.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:27.040]  It seems to break out after people get turned away
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.040]  and they're going back to their cars.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.040]  And stuff starts to happen when the rally fills up
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.040]  and there's, you know, 1,500, 1,000 people
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.040]  just standing around going, well, I guess we're going to leave.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.040]  And then they have to go back through the protesters.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040]  So that's an important point, Chris.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.040]  Make sure you got a camera.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.040]  Make sure you record it because the mainstream media
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.040]  is going to twist this.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  And so is Ted Cruz to say that it's the Trump supporter's fault
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.040]  and that it's Donald Trump's fault on this.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.040]  So make sure you record that.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.040]  And Chris, get your video out and then send us an email.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.040]  So you can send me an email.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:01.040]  RobD at infowars.com or whistleblower at infowars.com.
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.040]  Absolutely.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.040]  You know, put it out there.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.040]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.040]  Let's go to Frank in North Carolina.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.040]  Frank, go ahead.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.040]  Thanks a lot, David.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.040]  I want to make a quick comment on Ted Cruz.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.040]  I hear a lot of people saying that, well, you know, it just,
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:19.040]  the reason that he's not getting traction is it just shows
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.040]  that America is not as conservative as it used to be.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.040]  Well, that may be partly true, but I think the real reason
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.040]  that Ted Cruz is not getting traction is because they don't,
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.040]  people don't believe that Cruz, they see through him.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.040]  That's right.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.040]  They don't, they don't believe that he is a conservative.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.040]  They don't believe that he is a Christian.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.040]  I mean, you look at his behavior, his actions,
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.040]  cheating on his wife and all of the sympathy and everything.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.040]  So obviously he didn't honor his oath to his wife.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.040]  He said, I think, I mean, I was telling Alex years ago,
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.040]  a year and a half or two ago that this guy is not what you think.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:56.040]  The fact that his wife is CFR and was drawing up the North
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  American Union and the fact that she worked for one of the
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.040]  number one enemy banks of the people of humanity,
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.040]  that does mean something.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.040]  This guy came out of the bushes.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.040]  This guy comes out of the bushes.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.040]  He honors the bushes.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.040]  He loves his association with the Bush family,
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.040]  the Bush crime family.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.040]  And I don't know if people remember this or not,
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.040]  but I think it was back in around 1987 or 88.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.040]  George Herbert Walker Bush had stated,
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.040]  you know, as far as Christians go,
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040]  they have an extra chromosome.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.040]  They're mentally retarded.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.040]  I mean, these people, they play the Christian.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:36.040]  They play the Christian as suckers.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.040]  That's what Ted Cruz is doing.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.040]  And he hasn't carried the evangelicals in the South,
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.040]  which is what he said he was going to do,
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.040]  because I think a lot of people have seen through it.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.040]  You see through it. I see through it.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.040]  And I saw through what he was doing at the open carry rally
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  that we covered in San Antonio.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  We got 1,000 people out there marching for their legal rights,
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.040]  respected here in Texas to open carry firearms,
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040]  long arms that were slung over their shoulders at the time.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040]  Ted Cruz was in the hotel,
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.040]  but hired across the street doing a fundraiser with Republican women,
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.040]  you know, having this little literal tea party with them,
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  because that's what he does.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.040]  You go to Indianapolis and you've got Donald Trump
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.040]  going to the people who are seeing their factory,
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.040]  their carrier factory, moved down to Mexico.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.040]  Ted Cruz goes to a GOP dinner.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.040]  I mean, this is what we see over and over.
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.040]  He's supposed to vote on Audit the Fed.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.040]  Go campaign somewhere.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.040]  That's right.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.040]  That's Ted Cruz's MO.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040]  So I don't buy any of that stuff.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040]  I haven't bought it for a long time.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.040]  And I don't...
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.040]  His wife's connections with Goldman Sachs,
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  with the Council on Foreign Relations,
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.040]  you know, it's just absolutely amazing if you really vet this guy.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.040]  And you don't have to look at any issues
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.040]  that are put out by the National Enquirer.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.040]  Look at what he did to Ben Carson.

[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.040]  All right.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.040]  Have they worked for you?
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:34.040]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.

[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:44.040]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to WinnerSun, X2, even got a little DNA force.

[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:31.040]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.040]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.040]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:51.040]  Frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield, nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:47:09.040]  This is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.

[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:31.040]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:40.040]  Well, I started off the broadcast today and now I'm going to be ending it here. We've got a roundtable discussion going. We've got David Knight, we've got Josh Yellen, so I do want to hear more from you.
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:44.040]  He's just such an amazing camera guy and journalist, and of course Rob Dew.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:59.040]  I want to just spend a few minutes here pointing out that this shows us really how high the stakes are under globalism, the vulcanization, the open borders, what the establishment is doing to make sure that we're sewed each other's throats so we can fall to their far-and-takeover.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:09.040]  We have an occupied country. We are being subdivided. We are being tested as a model for new order control worldwide.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:26.040]  And for folks that haven't gone to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or rather go to drudgerport.com where they have some of our videos linked, you haven't watched this yourself to just see big, fat people dropping around, waving Mexican flags.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:38.040]  And then like weirdos, social justice warrior, people that look like they're glow-in-the-dark space aliens with a bunch of hateful black lives matter people just attacking anyone they can and just saying, we're peaceful, we're peaceful.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:48.040]  Bam, punch you out in the face. It's like a sick cult. And they just think they've been given the green light by the establishment, and they have been given the green light, but they think to quote, take over.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  You know, each to create the clash of civilizations, and when it's all said and done, we'll have nothing but a total police state in this country. But I just want to say, you know, Rob do and people like Josh Owens who, and of course, David Knight and countless others that have gone into these conflict zones, like the Bundy standoffs,
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:17.040]  both in Nevada and up in Oregon and all the stuff in Ferguson with the guys getting shot with rubber bullets, you know, Joe Bay's, Jakari getting hit with tear gas. I really just want to say that I am so proud of the team we've got.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  And the modern 21st century polar veers that we've gotten our crew, but I also want to thank all of you, the listeners and the viewers, because I'm not being patronizing when I say you are the resistance.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  I mean, we couldn't do this without you. And I know you know that, but understand our victories against tyranny, exposing this evil are your victories.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:44.040]  And so I want everybody to savor the fact that we've got mega viral videos every week, exposing the globalist takeover that they don't want people to see.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:50.040]  You know, even the LA Times bemoaned all the Mexican flags and said, oh my gosh, this is really going to help Trump. Absolutely.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:50:02.040]  We're going to get out there. We're going to show the face of the new world order and what it has created. And he's dumbed down masses of desperate people of every race, color and creed who think fighting with each other.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:08.040]  While we're all collectively being enslaved is going to create some great future for us. So I just wanted to, I'm going to get off here and just listen.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:20.040]  I'm listening here on the free iPhone app, but I want to hear Josh in a few minutes about his experiences, what he saw. And then you guys take a few final calls. But just in closing, please folks support info or store.com.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:29.040]  Everybody needs storeable food in these bad times, 30 to 40% off info or select info or store.com bunch of specials on nutraceuticals running right now as well.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:37.040]  You're getting great products and you're funding independent free media. It is very expensive to do this. You know, look at Glenn Beck says he's on the verge of bankruptcy.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:46.040]  We've tried to do it, you know, lean, mean, you know, on the ground right here in Texas as inexpensively as we can. But if we had the funds, we could do even more.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:54.040]  So I want to thank you all for your support and now pass up on the show and she was there for the Communist Ford Foundation new order finance.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  LaRica keys to garbage, the attacks on free speech and these videos folks are the weapons of truth. They don't want your speech out there.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:11.040]  They don't want our videos out there. They don't want this information seen. That's why you've got to get it and send it out knowing you're literally in a military operation against the globalists.
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.040]  Alright, info or dot com or slash show spread that link folks and thank you for your support.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:25.040]  Absolutely. And just like Alex said, whether it's Bundy Ranch, whether it's Ferguson, all these places that we've been going to, no one else is really doing as to the scale that we're doing it.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:40.040]  Me and Rob do were out there with iPhones posting videos immediately as things were happening so that people can see that the media can't spin these Trump outside of these Trump rallies any longer because we're pretty much going to all of them.
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]  Yeah.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:47.040]  And when you see, see the crazy thing about being there is that you actually get up close and personal and get to look in these people's eyes.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:55.040]  And you see the difference, like Alex said, you see the difference from the people that are standing in line that are going into the Trump rally and the people that are protesting it.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:03.040]  And it's not about wealthy people and poor people. It's just about people that look like decent, honest, regular people.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:08.040]  And then people that they look like criminals and their actions are proving that they are criminals.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:15.040]  So when people get upset about Trump saying they're bringing in criminals, they're bringing, you know, if you're upset about that, then don't prove them right.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:20.040]  Don't go out there and destroy your city. See, that's what doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  And Costa Mesa, Donald Trump comes to their town and they're all like, well, this is our town. You know, you're not going to come to our town.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:29.040]  Well, then why aren't you destroying your own town when he comes to it?
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:36.040]  How does that make any sense that you're going to tag the light poles and you're going to spray paint the sign of the facility that he was at?
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.040]  You're going to torment the people that live in your town.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:46.040]  What is that doing to Donald Trump other than making you look like a criminal and look like a moron is actually what it's doing?
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040]  And it's very important. You pointed out the fact that people support us, that we can go to these different places.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.040]  You mentioned the Bundy Ranch and Alex mentioned the fact that Glenn Beck's operation is facing financial difficulty.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:04.040]  Well, he was lying about what was going on the Bundy Ranch, just like Ted Cruz is lying about what's going on in Chicago, what happened in California.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:09.040]  People see through the lies when he says Trump is causing these riots.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.040]  Trump is encouraging riots. He's going to do everything he can to encourage riots.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.040]  It's like, that's not what's happening. And you guys were there. You took the videos.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  People can see for themselves now what's going on, unedited, not the way that the mainstream press puts us out there with their tone down headlines.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.040]  Well, we don't really know what happened. There was a Trump rally and then all this violence because of Trump.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:36.040]  Right. It was all incited by the controlled opposition. And you can see the videos we've been putting them out. Just watch it for yourself.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  And we got more we're putting out to plenty of videos.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  You know, there's just not enough time in the day to upload these things with some of the upload speeds.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:48.040]  But we do appreciate everybody's support out there for, you know, allowing us to do this.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  Because when I first got here, it wasn't like the news wasn't as instant as what we have now.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:54:04.040]  I mean, it is instant news and we have to be on that front edge or else we will get left behind and people will the mainstream media will be able to push their narrative.
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:10.040]  You know, the one thing about the mainstream media, they got big vans and big cameras, but they can't move as fast as a couple guys with iPhones.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  That's right. That's right. We have that going for us.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:20.040]  And they're losing credibility just as Beck did because they people can see that they're they're spending this they're not telling the truth about what's going on.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.040]  Let's go to Scott and Washington. Scott, go ahead.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.040]  Scott, you're still there.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  Well, there's two things I want to mention real quick.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:39.040]  It's not surprising that good old Ted Cruz with a feel such compassion for these dreamers because if you would call with this good old friend, Glenn, be back.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:45.040]  Yes, he was down there on the border passing out Teddy bear and soccer ball.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  That's right. That was a narrative that they were selling everybody.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:58.040]  What we saw in reality is we saw these people wearing the Mexican flag, burning the American flag, smashing police cars, spray painting people's cars because they had somebody with a Trump shirt on the inside.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  And then on the inside of the rally, you got Donald Trump standing there with people Hispanic, black, other and and and they're showing their pictures of their relatives who were murdered by criminals who came across the border illegally unvetted.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.040]  And that's what has to be stopped. Absolutely.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  That's what I've been compassionate and Ted see.
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  I have to mention the number one reason that I would want to see Donald Trump get it.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:40.040]  I even above bringing back jobs to this country and Roger Stone alluded to it is that he would be the one that would have standing to go after in the prosecute to Clinton Foundation and all the garbage that's going on in there.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:54.040]  And I would solely believe that all the blackmail that she's got on people in Washington has to do with that foundation and has to probably do with the fact that people are probably heavily invested in it.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:56.040]  And I think you'll see a whole lot of stuff come out.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.040]  So I sincerely hope that he puts muscle into doing that.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.040]  Well, there's a lot that I think he'll expose.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  I mean, even when we look at what people are talking about with the upcoming debates between him and Hillary Clinton, he's going to go after Hillary Clinton's criminal past and no other Republican would do that.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.040]  They're all going to say, oh, that wouldn't fit into decorum.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:18.040]  We just can't come after her.
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.040]  You need to come after people if they're committing criminal actions.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.040]  Thank you, Scott.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.040]  Let's go real quickly to Rich in New York City.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  Go ahead, Rich.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:36.040]  Good evening, Dave. Thanks for taking my call with a couple comments. One is, you know, I'm kind of disgusted by this whole, all these protests that are going on at the Trump rally.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  And, you know, what's really troublesome is that, guys, if you're not behind Trump, you have a simple solution.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.040]  Don't vote for him.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.040]  And the fact that they're restricting everybody's free speech is disgusting.
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.040]  That's number one.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.040]  Go rally behind another candidate. You know, go walk the streets for that candidate. Go make some phone calls.
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:00.040]  Go do something positive with your time instead of destroying property and getting in people's faces, calling them racists.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.040]  Do a video. Tell people why you support the candidate you support or why you don't support this other guy.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.040]  But instead, they just stand out there and chant three words and get violent with people.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  It's become a fad. That's all it is.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.040]  Go ahead and continue, Rich.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  The point is about Ted Cruz and I share a couple commonalities of Cruz. Number one, I was born on the same day he was. Number two is I'm half Canadian.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:28.040]  And you know what? I can't run for president and neither can Ted Cruz. He's not eligible. He should have been out of this a long time.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:32.040]  He hasn't produced any documentation and he needs to just bow out.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  I think that's why he's there. So he can bow out.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:40.040]  I think they're going to use him to bow out and install somebody else because I don't think they really want Ted Cruz either.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.040]  He's just a pawn at this point.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:58:11.040]  Sorry to the callers that we couldn't get to. Join us tomorrow morning at 11 central and noon eastern.
